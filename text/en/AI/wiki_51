<text>In signal processing, phase noise is the frequency-domain representation of random fluctuations in the phase of a waveform, corresponding to time-domain deviations from perfect periodicity (jitter). Generally speaking, radio-frequency engineers speak of the phase noise of an oscillator, whereas digital-system engineers work with the jitter of a clock.

==Definitions==
An ideal oscillator would generate a pure sine wave. In the frequency domain, this would be represented as a single pair of Dirac delta functions (positive and negative conjugates) at the oscillator&#x27;s frequency; i.e., all the signal&#x27;s power is at a single frequency. All real oscillators have phase modulated noise components. The phase noise components spread the power of a signal to adjacent frequencies, resulting in noise sidebands. 

Consider the following noise-free signal:

:formula_1

Phase noise is added to this signal by adding a stochastic process represented by formula_2 to the signal as follows:

:formula_3

Different phase noise processes, formula_2, possess different power Spectral density (PSD). For example, a white noise PSD follows a formula_5 trend, a pink noise PSD follows a formula_6 trend, and a brown noise PSD follows a formula_7 trend. 

formula_8 is the single-sided (f&gt;0) phase noise PSD formula_9, given by the Fourier transform of the Autocorrelation of the phase noise. 

:formula_10

The noise can also be represented at the single-sided (f&gt;0) frequency noise PSD, formula_11, or the fractional frequency stability PSD, formula_12, which defines the frequency fluctuations in terms of the deviation from the carrier frequency, formula_13.

:formula_14

:formula_15

The phase noise can also be given as the spectral purity, formula_16, the single-sideband power in a 1Hz bandwidth at a frequency offset, f, from the carrier frequency, formula_13, referenced to the carrier power.

:formula_18

==Jitter conversions==
Phase noise is sometimes also measured and expressed as a power obtained by integrating over a certain range of offset frequencies. For example, the phase noise may be −40 dBc integrated over the range of 1 kHz to 100 kHz. This integrated phase noise (expressed in degrees) can be converted to jitter (expressed in seconds) using the following formula:
:formula_19

In the absence of 1/f noise in a region where the phase noise displays a –20dBc/decade slope (Leeson&#x27;s equation), the RMS cycle jitter can be related to the phase noise by:
: formula_20

Likewise:
: formula_21

==Measurement==
Phase noise can be measured using a spectrum analyzer if the phase noise of the device under test (DUT) is large with respect to the spectrum analyzer&#x27;s local oscillator. Care should be taken that observed values are due to the measured signal and not the shape factor of the spectrum analyzer&#x27;s filters. Spectrum analyzer based measurement can show the phase-noise power over many decades of frequency; e.g., 1 Hz to 10 MHz. The slope with offset frequency in various offset frequency regions can provide clues as to the source of the noise; e.g., low frequency flicker noise decreasing at 30 dB per decade (= 9 dB per octave).

Phase noise measurement systems are alternatives to spectrum analyzers. These systems may use internal and external references and allow measurement of both residual (additive) and absolute noise. Additionally, these systems can make low-noise, close-to-the-carrier, measurements.

==Linewidths==
The sinusoidal output of an ideal oscillator is a Dirac delta function in the power spectral density centered at the frequency of the sinusoid. Such perfect spectral purity is not achievable in a practical oscillator. Spreading of the spectrum line caused by phase noise is characterized by the fundamental linewidth and the integral linewidth. 

The fundamental linewidth, also known as the White noise-limited linewidth or the intrinsic linewidth, is the linewidth of an oscillator&#x27;s PSD in the presence of only white noise sources (noise with a PSD that follows a formula_5 trend, ie. equivalent across all frequencies). The fundamental linewidth takes Lorentzian spectral line shape. White noise provides a formula_23 Allan Deviation plot at small averaging times.

The integral linewidth, also known as the effective linewidth or the total linewidth, is the linewidth of an oscillator&#x27;s PSD in the presence of both white noise sources (noise with a PSD that follows a formula_5 trend) and pink noise sources (noise with a PSD that follows a formula_6 trend). Pink noise is sometimes called Flicker noise, or simply 1/f noise. The integral linewidth takes Voigt lineshape, a convolution of the white noise-induced Lorentzian lineshape and the pink noise-induced Gaussian lineshape. Pink noise provides a formula_26 Allan Deviation plot at moderate averaging times. This flat line on the Allan Deviation plot is also known as the flicker floor.

Additionally, the oscillator might experience Frequency drift over long periods of time, slowly moving the center frequency of the Voigt lineshape. This drift is a brown noise source (noise with a PSD that follows a formula_7 trend), and provides a formula_28 Allan Deviation plot at large averaging times. 

==Limiting System Performance==
A laser is a common oscillator that is characterized by its noise, and thus its Laser linewidth. The laser noise provides fundamental limitations of the systems that the laser is used in, such as loss of sensitivity in radar and communications systems, lack of definition in imaging systems, and a higher bit error rate in digital systems.

Lasers with a near-Infrared center wavelength are used in many atomic, molecular, and optical physics experiments to provide photons that interact with atoms. The requirements for the spectral purity at specific frequency offsets of the lasers used in qubit operation (such as clock transition lasers and state preparation lasers) are highly stringent because the coherence time of the qubit is directly related to the linewidth of the lasers.

<text>Phase perturbation is the shifting, from whatever cause, in the phase of an electronic signal. The shifting is often quite rapid, and may appear to be random or cyclic. The phase departure in phase perturbation usually is larger, but less rapid, than in phase jitter.

<text>Phase-shift keying (PSK) is a digital modulation process which conveys data by changing (modulating) the phase of a constant frequency carrier wave. The modulation is accomplished by varying the sine and cosine inputs at a precise time. It is widely used for wireless LANs, RFID and Bluetooth communication.

Any digital modulation scheme uses a finite number of distinct signals to represent digital data. PSK uses a finite number of phases, each assigned a unique pattern of binary digits. Usually, each phase encodes an equal number of bits. Each pattern of bits forms the symbol that is represented by the particular phase. The demodulator, which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the phase of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. This requires the receiver to be able to compare the phase of the received signal to a reference signal such a system is termed coherent (and referred to as CPSK).

CPSK requires a complicated demodulator, because it must extract the reference wave from the received signal and keep track of it, to compare each sample to. Alternatively, the phase shift of each symbol sent can be measured with respect to the phase of the previous symbol sent. Because the symbols are encoded in the difference in phase between successive samples, this is called differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). DPSK can be significantly simpler to implement than ordinary PSK, as it is a &#x27;non-coherent&#x27; scheme, i.e. there is no need for the demodulator to keep track of a reference wave. A trade-off is that it has more demodulation errors.

==Introduction==
There are three major classes of digital modulation techniques used for transmission of digitally represented data:

* Amplitude-shift keying (ASK)
* Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
* Phase-shift keying (PSK)

All convey data by changing some aspect of a base signal, the carrier wave (usually a sinusoid), in response to a data signal. In the case of PSK, the phase is changed to represent the data signal. There are two fundamental ways of utilizing the phase of a signal in this way:

* By viewing the phase itself as conveying the information, in which case the demodulator must have a reference signal to compare the received signal&#x27;s phase against; or
* By viewing the &quot;change&quot; in the phase as conveying information &quot;differential&quot; schemes, some of which do not need a reference carrier (to a certain extent).

A convenient method to represent PSK schemes is on a constellation diagram. This shows the points in the complex plane where, in this context, the real and imaginary axes are termed the in-phase and quadrature axes respectively due to their 90° separation. Such a representation on perpendicular axes lends itself to straightforward implementation. The amplitude of each point along the in-phase axis is used to modulate a cosine (or sine) wave and the amplitude along the quadrature axis to modulate a sine (or cosine) wave. By convention, in-phase modulates cosine and quadrature modulates sine.

In PSK, the constellation points chosen are usually positioned with uniform angular spacing around a circle. This gives maximum phase-separation between adjacent points and thus the best immunity to corruption. They are positioned on a circle so that they can all be transmitted with the same energy. In this way, the moduli of the complex numbers they represent will be the same and thus so will the amplitudes needed for the cosine and sine waves. Two common examples are &quot;binary phase-shift keying&quot; (BPSK) which uses two phases, and &quot;quadrature phase-shift keying&quot; (QPSK) which uses four phases, although any number of phases may be used. Since the data to be conveyed are usually binary, the PSK scheme is usually designed with the number of constellation points being a power of two.

==Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)==

BPSK (also sometimes called PRK, phase reversal keying, or 2PSK) is the simplest form of phase shift keying (PSK). It uses two phases which are separated by 180° and so can also be termed 2-PSK. It does not particularly matter exactly where the constellation points are positioned, and in this figure they are shown on the real axis, at 0° and 180°. Therefore, it handles the highest noise level or distortion before the demodulator reaches an incorrect decision. That makes it the most robust of all the PSKs. It is, however, only able to modulate at 1bit/symbol (as seen in the figure) and so is unsuitable for high data-rate applications.

In the presence of an arbitrary phase-shift introduced by the communications channel, the demodulator (see, e.g. Costas loop) is unable to tell which constellation point is which. As a result, the data is often differentially encoded prior to modulation.

BPSK is functionally equivalent to 2-QAM modulation.

===Implementation===
The general form for BPSK follows the equation:

:formula_1

This yields two phases, 0 and π.
In the specific form, binary data is often conveyed with the following signals:

:formula_2 for binary &quot;0&quot;
:formula_3 for binary &quot;1&quot;

where &quot;f&quot; is the frequency of the base band.

Hence, the signal space can be represented by the single basis function

:formula_4

where 1 is represented by formula_5 and 0 is represented by formula_6. This assignment is arbitrary.

This use of this basis function is shown at the end of the next section in a signal timing diagram. The topmost signal is a BPSK-modulated cosine wave that the BPSK modulator would produce. The bit-stream that causes this output is shown above the signal (the other parts of this figure are relevant only to QPSK). After modulation, the base band signal will be moved to the high frequency band by multiplying formula_7.

===Bit error rate===
The bit error rate (BER) of BPSK under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) can be calculated as:

:formula_8 or formula_9

Since there is only one bit per symbol, this is also the symbol error rate.

==Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)==
Sometimes this is known as &quot;quadriphase PSK&quot;, 4-PSK, or 4-QAM. (Although the root concepts of QPSK and 4-QAM are different, the resulting modulated radio waves are exactly the same.) QPSK uses four points on the constellation diagram, equispaced around a circle. With four phases, QPSK can encode two bits per symbol, shown in the diagram with Gray coding to minimize the bit error rate (BER) sometimes misperceived as twice the BER of BPSK.

The mathematical analysis shows that QPSK can be used either to double the data rate compared with a BPSK system while maintaining the &quot;same&quot; bandwidth of the signal, or to &quot;maintain the data-rate of BPSK&quot; but halving the bandwidth needed. In this latter case, the BER of QPSK is &quot;exactly the same&quot; as the BER of BPSK and believing differently is a common confusion when considering or describing QPSK. The transmitted carrier can undergo numbers of phase changes.

Given that radio communication channels are allocated by agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission giving a prescribed (maximum) bandwidth, the advantage of QPSK over BPSK becomes evident: QPSK transmits twice the data rate in a given bandwidth compared to BPSK - at the same BER. The engineering penalty that is paid is that QPSK transmitters and receivers are more complicated than the ones for BPSK. However, with modern electronics technology, the penalty in cost is very moderate.

As with BPSK, there are phase ambiguity problems at the receiving end, and differentially encoded QPSK is often used in practice.

===Implementation===
The implementation of QPSK is more general than that of BPSK and also indicates the implementation of higher-order PSK. Writing the symbols in the constellation diagram in terms of the sine and cosine waves used to transmit them:

:formula_10

This yields the four phases π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4 and 7π/4 as needed.

This results in a two-dimensional signal space with unit basis functions

:formula_11

The first basis function is used as the in-phase component of the signal and the second as the quadrature component of the signal.

Hence, the signal constellation consists of the signal-space 4 points

:formula_12

The factors of 1/2 indicate that the total power is split equally between the two carriers.

Comparing these basis functions with that for BPSK shows clearly how QPSK can be viewed as two independent BPSK signals. Note that the signal-space points for BPSK do not need to split the symbol (bit) energy over the two carriers in the scheme shown in the BPSK constellation diagram.

QPSK systems can be implemented in a number of ways. An illustration of the major components of the transmitter and receiver structure are shown below.

===Probability of error===
Although QPSK can be viewed as a quaternary modulation, it is easier to see it as two independently modulated quadrature carriers. With this interpretation, the even (or odd) bits are used to modulate the in-phase component of the carrier, while the odd (or even) bits are used to modulate the quadrature-phase component of the carrier. BPSK is used on both carriers and they can be independently demodulated.

As a result, the probability of bit-error for QPSK is the same as for BPSK:
:formula_13

However, in order to achieve the same bit-error probability as BPSK, QPSK uses twice the power (since two bits are transmitted simultaneously).

The symbol error rate is given by:

:formula_14

If the signal-to-noise ratio is high (as is necessary for practical QPSK systems) the probability of symbol error may be approximated:

:formula_15

The modulated signal is shown below for a short segment of a random binary data-stream. The two carrier waves are a cosine wave and a sine wave, as indicated by the signal-space analysis above. Here, the odd-numbered bits have been assigned to the in-phase component and the even-numbered bits to the quadrature component (taking the first bit as number 1). The total signal the sum of the two components is shown at the bottom. Jumps in phase can be seen as the PSK changes the phase on each component at the start of each bit-period. The topmost waveform alone matches the description given for BPSK above.
The binary data that is conveyed by this waveform is: 11000110.
* The odd bits, highlighted here, contribute to the in-phase component: 1010
* The even bits, highlighted here, contribute to the quadrature-phase component: 1001

===Variants===

====Offset QPSK (OQPSK)====
&quot;Offset quadrature phase-shift keying&quot; (&quot;OQPSK&quot;) is a variant of phase-shift keying modulation using four different values of the phase to transmit. It is sometimes called &quot;staggered quadrature phase-shift keying&quot; (&quot;SQPSK&quot;).

Taking four values of the phase (two bits) at a time to construct a QPSK symbol can allow the phase of the signal to jump by as much as 180° at a time. When the signal is low-pass filtered (as is typical in a transmitter), these phase-shifts result in large amplitude fluctuations, an undesirable quality in communication systems. By offsetting the timing of the odd and even bits by one bit-period, or half a symbol-period, the in-phase and quadrature components will never change at the same time. In the constellation diagram shown on the right, it can be seen that this will limit the phase-shift to no more than 90° at a time. This yields much lower amplitude fluctuations than non-offset QPSK and is sometimes preferred in practice.

The picture on the right shows the difference in the behavior of the phase between ordinary QPSK and OQPSK. It can be seen that in the first plot the phase can change by 180° at once, while in OQPSK the changes are never greater than 90°.

The modulated signal is shown below for a short segment of a random binary data-stream. Note the half symbol-period offset between the two component waves. The sudden phase-shifts occur about twice as often as for OQPSK (since the signals no longer change together), but they are less severe. In other words, the magnitude of jumps is smaller in OQPSK when compared to QPSK.

====SOQPSK====
The license-free shaped-offset QPSK (SOQPSK) is interoperable with Feher-patented QPSK (FQPSK), in the sense that an integrate-and-dump offset QPSK detector produces the same output no matter which kind of transmitter is used.

These modulations carefully shape the I and Q waveforms such that they change very smoothly, and the signal stays constant-amplitude even during signal transitions. (Rather than traveling instantly from one symbol to another, or even linearly, it travels smoothly around the constant-amplitude circle from one symbol to the next.) SOQPSK modulation can be represented as the hybrid of QPSK and MSK: SOQPSK has the same signal constellation as QPSK, however the phase of SOQPSK is always stationary.

The standard description of SOQPSK-TG involves ternary symbols. SOQPSK is one of the most spread modulation schemes in application to LEO satellite communications.

====&quot;π&quot;/4-QPSK====
This variant of QPSK uses two identical constellations which are rotated by 45° (formula_16 radians, hence the name) with respect to one another. Usually, either the even or odd symbols are used to select points from one of the constellations and the other symbols select points from the other constellation. This also reduces the phase-shifts from a maximum of 180°, but only to a maximum of 135° and so the amplitude fluctuations of formula_16-QPSK are between OQPSK and non-offset QPSK.

One property this modulation scheme possesses is that if the modulated signal is represented in the complex domain, transitions between symbols never pass through 0. In other words, the signal does not pass through the origin. This lowers the dynamical range of fluctuations in the signal which is desirable when engineering communications signals.

On the other hand, formula_16-QPSK lends itself to easy demodulation and has been adopted for use in, for example, TDMA cellular telephone systems.

The modulated signal is shown below for a short segment of a random binary data-stream. The construction is the same as above for ordinary QPSK. Successive symbols are taken from the two constellations shown in the diagram. Thus, the first symbol (1 1) is taken from the &quot;blue&quot; constellation and the second symbol (0 0) is taken from the &quot;green&quot; constellation. Note that magnitudes of the two component waves change as they switch between constellations, but the total signal&#x27;s magnitude remains constant (constant envelope). The phase-shifts are between those of the two previous timing-diagrams.

====DPQPSK====
Dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DPQPSK) or dual-polarization QPSK - involves the polarization multiplexing of two different QPSK signals, thus improving the spectral efficiency by a factor of 2. This is a cost-effective alternative to utilizing 16-PSK, instead of QPSK to double the spectral efficiency.

==Higher-order PSK==
Any number of phases may be used to construct a PSK constellation but 8-PSK is usually the highest order PSK constellation deployed. With more than 8 phases, the error-rate becomes too high and there are better, though more complex, modulations available such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Although any number of phases may be used, the fact that the constellation must usually deal with binary data means that the number of symbols is usually a power of 2 to allow an integer number of bits per symbol.

===Bit error rate===
For the general M-PSK there is no simple expression for the symbol-error probability if formula_19. Unfortunately, it can only be obtained from

:formula_20

where

:formula_21
and formula_22 and formula_23 are each Gaussian random variables.
This may be approximated for high formula_24 and high formula_25 by:

:formula_26

The bit-error probability for formula_24-PSK can only be determined exactly once the bit-mapping is known. However, when Gray coding is used, the most probable error from one symbol to the next produces only a single bit-error and

:formula_28

(Using Gray coding allows us to approximate the Lee distance of the errors as the Hamming distance of the errors in the decoded bitstream, which is easier to implement in hardware.)

The graph on the right compares the bit-error rates of BPSK, QPSK (which are the same, as noted above), 8-PSK and 16-PSK. It is seen that higher-order modulations exhibit higher error-rates; in exchange however they deliver a higher raw data-rate.

Bounds on the error rates of various digital modulation schemes can be computed with application of the union bound to the signal constellation.

===Spectral efficiency===

Bandwidth (or spectral) efficiency of M-PSK modulation schemes increases with increasing of modulation order &quot;M&quot; (unlike, for example, M-FSK):

:formula_29

The same relationship holds true for M-QAM.
==Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)==

===Differential encoding===
Differential phase shift keying (DPSK) is a common form of phase modulation that conveys data by changing the phase of the carrier wave. As mentioned for BPSK and QPSK there is an ambiguity of phase if the constellation is rotated by some effect in the communications channel through which the signal passes. This problem can be overcome by using the data to &quot;change&quot; rather than &quot;set&quot; the phase.

For example, in differentially-encoded BPSK a binary &quot;1&quot; may be transmitted by adding 180° to the current phase and a binary &quot;0&quot; by adding 0° to the current phase. 
Another variant of DPSK is symmetric differential phase shift keying, SDPSK, where encoding would be +90° for a &quot;1&quot; and −90° for a &quot;0&quot;.

In differentially-encoded QPSK (DQPSK), the phase-shifts are 0°, 90°, 180°, −90° corresponding to data &quot;00&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;10&quot;. This kind of encoding may be demodulated in the same way as for non-differential PSK but the phase ambiguities can be ignored. Thus, each received symbol is demodulated to one of the formula_24 points in the constellation and a comparator then computes the difference in phase between this received signal and the preceding one. The difference encodes the data as described above. &quot;Symmetric differential quadrature phase shift keying&quot; (SDQPSK) is like DQPSK, but encoding is symmetric, using phase shift values of −135°, −45°, +45° and +135°.

The modulated signal is shown below for both DBPSK and DQPSK as described above. In the figure, it is assumed that the &quot;signal starts with zero phase&quot;, and so there is a phase shift in both signals at formula_31.

Analysis shows that differential encoding approximately doubles the error rate compared to ordinary formula_24-PSK but this may be overcome by only a small increase in formula_25. Furthermore, this analysis (and the graphical results below) are based on a system in which the only corruption is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, there will also be a physical channel between the transmitter and receiver in the communication system. This channel will, in general, introduce an unknown phase-shift to the PSK signal; in these cases the differential schemes can yield a &quot;better&quot; error-rate than the ordinary schemes which rely on precise phase information.

One of the most popular applications of DPSK is the Bluetooth standard where formula_16-DQPSK and 8-DPSK were implemented.

===Demodulation===
For a signal that has been differentially encoded, there is an obvious alternative method of demodulation. Instead of demodulating as usual and ignoring carrier-phase ambiguity, the phase between two successive received symbols is compared and used to determine what the data must have been. When differential encoding is used in this manner, the scheme is known as differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). Note that this is subtly different from just differentially encoded PSK since, upon reception, the received symbols are &quot;not&quot; decoded one-by-one to constellation points but are instead compared directly to one another.

Call the received symbol in the formula_35th timeslot formula_36 and let it have phase formula_37. Assume without loss of generality that the phase of the carrier wave is zero. Denote the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) term as formula_38. Then

:formula_39

The decision variable for the formula_40th symbol and the formula_35th symbol is the phase difference between formula_36 and formula_43. That is, if formula_36 is projected onto formula_43, the decision is taken on the phase of the resultant complex number:

:formula_46

where superscript * denotes complex conjugation. In the absence of noise, the phase of this is formula_47, the phase-shift between the two received signals which can be used to determine the data transmitted.

The probability of error for DPSK is difficult to calculate in general, but, in the case of DBPSK it is:

:formula_48

which, when numerically evaluated, is only slightly worse than ordinary BPSK, particularly at higher formula_25 values.

Using DPSK avoids the need for possibly complex carrier-recovery schemes to provide an accurate phase estimate and can be an attractive alternative to ordinary PSK.

In optical communications, the data can be modulated onto the phase of a laser in a differential way. The modulation is a laser which emits a continuous wave, and a Mach–Zehnder modulator which receives electrical binary data. For the case of BPSK, the laser transmits the field unchanged for binary &#x27;1&#x27;, and with reverse polarity for &#x27;0&#x27;. The demodulator consists of a delay line interferometer which delays one bit, so two bits can be compared at one time. In further processing, a photodiode is used to transform the optical field into an electric current, so the information is changed back into its original state.

The bit-error rates of DBPSK and DQPSK are compared to their non-differential counterparts in the graph to the right. The loss for using DBPSK is small enough compared to the complexity reduction that it is often used in communications systems that would otherwise use BPSK. For DQPSK though, the loss in performance compared to ordinary QPSK is larger and the system designer must balance this against the reduction in complexity.

===Example: Differentially-encoded BPSK===
At the formula_50 time-slot call the bit to be modulated formula_51, the differentially encoded bit formula_52 and the resulting modulated signal formula_53. Assume that the constellation diagram positions the symbols at ±1 (which is BPSK). The differential encoder produces:

:formula_54

where formula_55 indicates binary or modulo-2 addition.

So formula_52 only changes state (from binary &quot;0&quot; to binary &quot;1&quot; or from binary &quot;1&quot; to binary &quot;0&quot;) if formula_51 is a binary &quot;1&quot;. Otherwise it remains in its previous state. This is the description of differentially encoded BPSK given above.

The received signal is demodulated to yield formula_58 and then the differential decoder reverses the encoding procedure and produces

:formula_59

since binary subtraction is the same as binary addition.

Therefore, formula_60 if formula_52 and formula_62 differ and formula_63 if they are the same. Hence, if both formula_52 and formula_62 are &quot;inverted&quot;, formula_51 will still be decoded correctly. Thus, the 180° phase ambiguity does not matter.

Differential schemes for other PSK modulations may be devised along similar lines. The waveforms for DPSK are the same as for differentially encoded PSK given above since the only change between the two schemes is at the receiver.

The BER curve for this example is compared to ordinary BPSK on the right. As mentioned above, whilst the error rate is approximately doubled, the increase needed in formula_25 to overcome this is small. The increase in formula_25 required to overcome differential modulation in coded systems, however, is larger typically about 3 dB. The performance degradation is a result of noncoherent transmission in this case it refers to the fact that tracking of the phase is completely ignored.

===Definitions===
For determining error-rates mathematically, some definitions will be needed:

* formula_69, energy per bit
* formula_70, energy per symbol with &quot;n&quot; bits
* formula_71, bit duration
* formula_72, symbol duration
* formula_73, noise power spectral density (W/Hz)
* formula_74, probability of &quot;bit-error&quot;
* formula_75, probability of symbol-error

formula_76 will give the probability that a single sample taken from a random process with zero-mean and unit-variance Gaussian probability density function will be greater or equal to formula_77. It is a scaled form of the complementary Gaussian error function:

: formula_78.

The error rates quoted here are those in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). These error rates are lower than those computed in fading channels, hence, are a good theoretical benchmark to compare with.

==Applications==
Owing to PSK&#x27;s simplicity, particularly when compared with its competitor quadrature amplitude modulation, it is widely used in existing technologies.

The wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11b-1999, uses a variety of different PSKs depending on the data rate required. At the basic rate of 1Mbit/s, it uses DBPSK (differential BPSK). To provide the extended rate of 2Mbit/s, DQPSK is used. In reaching 5.5Mbit/s and the full rate of 11Mbit/s, QPSK is employed, but has to be coupled with complementary code keying. The higher-speed wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11g-2003, has eight data rates: 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54Mbit/s. The 6 and 9Mbit/s modes use OFDM modulation where each sub-carrier is BPSK modulated. The 12 and 18Mbit/s modes use OFDM with QPSK. The fastest four modes use OFDM with forms of quadrature amplitude modulation.

Because of its simplicity, BPSK is appropriate for low-cost passive transmitters, and is used in RFID standards such as ISO/IEC 14443 which has been adopted for biometric passports, credit cards such as American Express&#x27;s ExpressPay, and many other applications.

Bluetooth 2 uses formula_16-DQPSK at its lower rate (2Mbit/s) and 8-DPSK at its higher rate (3Mbit/s) when the link between the two devices is sufficiently robust. Bluetooth 1 modulates with Gaussian minimum-shift keying, a binary scheme, so either modulation choice in version 2 will yield a higher data rate. A similar technology, IEEE 802.15.4 (the wireless standard used by Zigbee) also relies on PSK using two frequency bands: 868 MHz and 915MHz with BPSK and at 2.4GHz with OQPSK.

Both QPSK and 8PSK are widely used in satellite broadcasting. QPSK is still widely used in the streaming of SD satellite channels and some HD channels. High definition programming is delivered almost exclusively in 8PSK due to the higher bitrates of HD video and the high cost of satellite bandwidth. The DVB-S2 standard requires support for both QPSK and 8PSK. The chipsets used in new satellite set top boxes, such as Broadcom&#x27;s 7000 series support 8PSK and are backward compatible with the older standard.

Historically, voice-band synchronous modems such as the Bell 201, 208, and 209 and the CCITT V.26, V.27, V.29, V.32, and V.34 used PSK.

==Mutual information with additive white Gaussian noise==
The mutual information of PSK can be evaluated in additive Gaussian noise by numerical integration of its definition. The curves of mutual information saturate to the number of bits carried by each symbol in the limit of infinite signal to noise ratio formula_80. On the contrary, in the limit of small signal to noise ratios the mutual information approaches the AWGN channel capacity, which is the supremum among all possible choices of symbol statistical distributions.

At intermediate values of signal to noise ratios the mutual information (MI) is well approximated by:

:formula_81

The mutual information of PSK over the AWGN channel is generally lower than that of QAM modulation formats.

<doc id="41553" wikidata="Q3381567" url="?curid=41553" title="Photocurrent">
<text>Photocurrent is the electric current through a photosensitive device, such as a photodiode, as the result of exposure to radiant power. The photocurrent may occur as a result of the photoelectric, photoemissive, or photovoltaic effect. The photocurrent may be enhanced by internal gain caused by interaction among ions and photons under the influence of applied fields, such as occurs in an avalanche photodiode (APD).

When a suitable radiation is used, the photoelectric current is directly proportional to intensity of radiation and increases with the increase in accelerating potential till the stage is reached when photo-current becomes maximum and does not increase with further increase in accelerating potential. The highest (maximum) value of the photo-current is called saturation current. The value of retarding potential at which photo-current becomes zero is called cut-off voltage or stopping potential for the given frequency of the incident ray.

==Photovoltaics==

The generation of a photocurrent forms the basis of the photovoltaic cell.

==Photocurrent spectroscopy==
A characterization technique called photocurrent spectroscopy (PCS), also known as photoconductivity spectroscopy, is widely used for studying optoelectronic properties of semiconductors and other light absorbing materials. The setup of the technique involves having a semiconductor contacted with electrodes allowing for application of an electric bias, while at the same time a tunable light source incident with a given specific wavelength (energy) and power, usually pulsed by a mechanical chopper. 

The quantity measured is the electrical response of the circuit, coupled with the spectrograph obtained by varying the incident light energy by a monochromator. The circuit and optics are coupled by use of a lock-in amplifier. The measurements give information related to the band gap of the semiconductor, allowing for identification of various charge transitions like exciton and trion energies. This is highly relevant for studying semiconductor nanostructures like quantum wells, and other nanomaterials like transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.

Furthermore, by using a piezo stage to vary the lateral position of the semiconductor with micron precision, one can generate a micrograph false color image of the spectra for different positions. This is called scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM).

<text>A PIN diode is a diode with a wide, undoped intrinsic semiconductor region between a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor region. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily doped because they are used for ohmic contacts.

The wide intrinsic region is in contrast to an ordinary p–n diode. The wide intrinsic region makes the PIN diode an inferior rectifier (one typical function of a diode), but it makes it suitable for attenuators, fast switches, photodetectors, and high-voltage power electronics applications.

The PIN photodiode was invented by Jun-Ichi Nishizawa and his colleagues in 1950. It is a semiconductor device.

== Operation ==
A PIN diode operates under what is known as high-level injection. In other words, the intrinsic &quot;i&quot; region is flooded with charge carriers from the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; regions. Its function can be likened to filling up a water bucket with a hole on the side. Once the water reaches the hole&#x27;s level it will begin to pour out. Similarly, the diode will conduct current once the flooded electrons and holes reach an equilibrium point, where the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes in the intrinsic region.

When the diode is forward biased, the injected carrier concentration is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration. Due to this high level injection, which in turn is due to the depletion process, the electric field extends deeply (almost the entire length) into the region. This electric field helps in speeding up of the transport of charge carriers from the P to the N region, which results in faster operation of the diode, making it a suitable device for high-frequency operation.

== Characteristics ==
The PIN diode obeys the standard diode equation for low-frequency signals. At higher frequencies, the diode looks like an almost perfect (very linear, even for large signals) resistor. The P-I-N diode has a relatively large stored charge adrift in a thick intrinsic region. At a low-enough frequency, the stored charge can be fully swept and the diode turns off. At higher frequencies, there is not enough time to sweep the charge from the drift region, so the diode never turns off. The time required to sweep the stored charge from a diode junction is its reverse recovery time, and it is relatively long in a PIN diode. For a given semiconductor material, on-state impedance, and minimum usable RF frequency, the reverse recovery time is fixed. This property can be exploited; one variety of P-I-N diode, the step recovery diode, exploits the abrupt impedance change at the end of the reverse recovery to create a narrow impulse waveform useful for frequency multiplication with high multiples.

The high-frequency resistance is inversely proportional to the DC bias current through the diode. A PIN diode, suitably biased, therefore acts as a variable resistor. This high-frequency resistance may vary over a wide range (from to in some cases; the useful range is smaller, though).

The wide intrinsic region also means the diode will have a low capacitance when reverse-biased.

In a PIN diode the depletion region exists almost completely within the intrinsic region. This depletion region is much larger than in a PN diode and almost constant-size, independent of the reverse bias applied to the diode. This increases the volume where electron-hole pairs can be generated by an incident photon. Some photodetector devices, such as PIN photodiodes and phototransistors (in which the base-collector junction is a PIN diode), use a PIN junction in their construction.

The diode design has some design trade-offs. Increasing the cross-section area of the intrinsic region increases its stored charge reducing its RF on-state resistance while also increasing reverse bias capacitance and increasing the drive current required to remove the charge during a fixed switching time, with no effect on the minimum time required to sweep the charge from the I region. Increasing the thickness of the intrinsic region increases the total stored charge, decreases the minimum RF frequency, and decreases the reverse-bias capacitance, but doesn&#x27;t decrease the forward-bias RF resistance and increases the minimum time required to sweep the drift charge and transition from low to high RF resistance. Diodes are sold commercially in a variety of geometries for specific RF bands and uses.

== Applications ==
PIN diodes are useful as RF switches, attenuators, photodetectors, and phase shifters.

=== RF and microwave switches ===
Under zero- or reverse-bias (the &quot;off&quot; state), a PIN diode has a low capacitance. The low capacitance will not pass much of an RF signal. Under a forward bias of 1 mA (the &quot;on&quot; state), a typical PIN diode will have an RF resistance of about , making it a good conductor of RF. Consequently, the PIN diode makes a good RF switch.

Although RF relays can be used as switches, they switch relatively slowly (on the order of ). A PIN diode switch can switch much more quickly (e.g., ), although at lower RF frequencies it isn&#x27;t reasonable to expect switching times in the same order of magnitude as the RF period.

For example, the capacitance of an &quot;off&quot;-state discrete PIN diode might be . At , the capacitive reactance of is :

:formula_1

As a series element in a system, the off-state attenuation is:
:formula_2

This attenuation may not be adequate. In applications where higher isolation is needed, both shunt and series elements may be used, with the shunt diodes biased in complementary fashion to the series elements. Adding shunt elements effectively reduces the source and load impedances, reducing the impedance ratio and increasing the off-state attenuation. However, in addition to the added complexity, the on-state attenuation is increased due to the series resistance of the on-state blocking element and the capacitance of the off-state shunt elements.

PIN diode switches are used not only for signal selection, but also component selection. For example, some low-phase-noise oscillators use them to range-switch inductors.

=== RF and microwave variable attenuators ===
By changing the bias current through a PIN diode, it is possible to quickly change its RF resistance.

At high frequencies, the PIN diode appears as a resistor whose resistance is an inverse function of its forward current. Consequently, PIN diode can be used in some variable attenuator designs as amplitude modulators or output leveling circuits.

PIN diodes might be used, for example, as the bridge and shunt resistors in a bridged-T attenuator. Another common approach is to use PIN diodes as terminations connected to the 0 degree and -90 degree ports of a quadrature hybrid. The signal to be attenuated is applied to the input port, and the attenuated result is taken from the isolation port. The advantages of this approach over the bridged-T and pi approaches are (1) complementary PIN diode bias drives are not needed—the same bias is applied to both diodes—and (2) the loss in the attenuator equals the return loss of the terminations, which can be varied over a very wide range.

=== Limiters ===
PIN diodes are sometimes designed for use as input protection devices for high-frequency test probes and other circuits. If the input signal is small, the PIN diode has negligible impact, presenting only a small parasitic capacitance. Unlike a rectifier diode, it does not present a nonlinear resistance at RF frequencies, which would give rise to harmonics and intermodulation products. If the signal is large, then when the PIN diode starts to rectify the signal, the forward current charges the drift region and the device RF impedance is inversely proportional to the signal amplitude. That signal amplitude varying resistance can be used to terminate some predetermined portion of the signal in a resistive network dissipating the energy or to create an impedance mismatch that reflects the incident signal back toward the source. The latter may be combined with an isolator, a device containing a circulator which uses a permanent magnetic field to break reciprocity and a resistive load to separate and terminate the backward traveling wave. When used as a shunt limiter the PIN diode impedance is low over the entire RF cycle, unlike paired rectifier diodes that would swing from a high resistance to a low resistance during each RF cycle clamping the waveform and not reflecting it as completely. The ionization recovery time of gas molecules that permits the creation of the higher power spark gap input protection device ultimately relies on similar physics in a gas.

=== Photodetector and photovoltaic cell ===
The PIN photodiode was invented by Jun-ichi Nishizawa and his colleagues in 1950.

PIN photodiodes are used in fibre optic network cards and switches. As a photodetector, the PIN diode is reverse-biased. Under reverse bias, the diode ordinarily does not conduct (save a small dark current or Is leakage). When a photon of sufficient energy enters the depletion region of the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. The reverse-bias field sweeps the carriers out of the region, creating current. Some detectors can use avalanche multiplication.

The same mechanism applies to the PIN structure, or p-i-n junction, of a solar cell. In this case, the advantage of using a PIN structure over conventional semiconductor p–n junction is better long-wavelength response of the former. In case of long wavelength irradiation, photons penetrate deep into the cell. But only those electron-hole pairs generated in and near the depletion region contribute to current generation. The depletion region of a PIN structure extends across the intrinsic region, deep into the device. This wider depletion width enables electron-hole pair generation deep within the device, which increases the quantum efficiency of the cell.

Commercially available PIN photodiodes have quantum efficiencies above 80-90% in the telecom wavelength range (~1500 nm), and are typically made of germanium or InGaAs. They feature fast response times (higher than their p-n counterparts), running into several tens of gigahertz, making them ideal for high speed optical telecommunication applications. Similarly, silicon p-i-n photodiodes have even higher quantum efficiencies, but can only detect wavelengths below the bandgap of silicon, i.e. ~1100 nm.

Typically, amorphous silicon thin-film cells use PIN structures. On the other hand, CdTe cells use NIP structure, a variation of the PIN structure. In a NIP structure, an intrinsic CdTe layer is sandwiched by n-doped CdS and p-doped ZnTe; the photons are incident on the n-doped layer, unlike in a PIN diode.

A PIN photodiode can also detect ionizing radiation in case it is used as a semiconductor detector.

In modern fiber-optical communications, the speed of optical transmitters and receivers is one of the most important parameters. Due to the small surface of the photodiode, its parasitic (unwanted) capacitance is reduced. The bandwidth of modern pin photodiodes is reaching the microwave and millimeter waves range.

== Example PIN photodiodes ==
SFH203 and BPW34 are cheap general purpose PIN diodes in 5 mm clear plastic cases with bandwidths over 100 MHz.

<doc id="41559" wikidata="Q122518" url="?curid=41559" title="Plane wave">
<text>In physics, a plane wave is a special case of a wave or field: a physical quantity whose value, at any given moment, is constant through any plane that is perpendicular to a fixed direction in space.

For any position formula_1 in space and any time formula_2, the value of such a field can be written as
formula_3
where formula_4 is a unit-length vector, and formula_5 is a function that gives the field&#x27;s value as dependent on only two real parameters: the time formula_2, and the scalar-valued displacement formula_7 of the point formula_1 along the direction formula_4. The displacement is constant over each plane perpendicular to formula_4.

The values of the field formula_11 may be scalars, vectors, or any other physical or mathematical quantity. They can be complex numbers, as in a complex exponential plane wave. 

When the values of formula_11 are vectors, the wave is said to be a longitudinal wave if the vectors are always collinear with the vector formula_4, and a transverse wave if they are always orthogonal (perpendicular) to it.

==Special types==

===Traveling plane wave===
Often the term &quot;plane wave&quot; refers specifically to a &quot;traveling plane wave&quot;, whose evolution in time can be described as simple translation of the field at a constant &quot;wave speed&quot; formula_14 along the direction perpendicular to the wavefronts. Such a field can be written as 
formula_15
where formula_16 is now a function of a single real parameter formula_17, that describes the &quot;profile&quot; of the wave, namely the value of the field at time formula_18, for each displacement formula_7. In that case, formula_4 is called the &quot;direction of propagation&quot;. For each displacement formula_21, the moving plane perpendicular to formula_4 at distance formula_23 from the origin is called a &quot;wavefront&quot;. This plane travels along the direction of propagation formula_4 with velocity formula_14; and the value of the field is then the same, and constant in time, at every one of its points.

===Sinusoidal plane wave===
The term is also used, even more specifically, to mean a &quot;monochromatic&quot; or sinusoidal plane wave: a travelling plane wave whose profile formula_16 is a sinusoidal function. That is,
formula_27
The parameter formula_28, which may be a scalar or a vector, is called the amplitude of the wave; the scalar coefficient formula_29 is its &quot;spatial frequency&quot;; and the scalar formula_30 is its &quot;phase shift&quot;.

A true plane wave cannot physically exist, because it would have to fill all space. Nevertheless, the plane wave model is important and widely used in physics. The waves emitted by any source with finite extent into a large homogeneous region of space can be well approximated by plane waves when viewed over any part of that region that is sufficiently small compared to its distance from the source. That is the case, for example, of the light waves from a distant star that arrive at a telescope.

===Plane standing wave ===

A standing wave is a field whose value can be expressed as the product of two functions, one depending only on position, the other only on time. A plane standing wave, in particular, can be expressed as
formula_31
where formula_32 is a function of one scalar parameter (the displacement formula_7) with scalar or vector values, and formula_34 is a scalar function of time. 

This representation is not unique, since the same field values are obtained if formula_34 and formula_32 are scaled by reciprocal factors. If formula_37 is bounded in the time interval of interest (which is usually the case in physical contexts), formula_34 and formula_32 can be scaled so that the maximum value of formula_37 is 1. Then formula_41 will be the maximum field magnitude seen at the point formula_1.

==Properties==

A plane wave can be studied by ignoring the directions perpendicular to the direction vector formula_4; that is, by considering the function formula_44 as a wave in a one-dimensional medium. 

Any local operator, linear or not, applied to a plane wave yields a plane wave. Any linear combination of plane waves with the same normal vector formula_4 is also a plane wave.

For a scalar plane wave in two or three dimensions, the gradient of the field is always collinear with the direction formula_4; specifically, formula_47, where formula_48 is the partial derivative of formula_32 with respect to the first argument. 

The divergence of a vector-valued plane wave depends only on the projection of the vector formula_5 in the direction formula_4. Specifically,
formula_52
In particular, a transverse planar wave satisfies formula_53 for all formula_1 and formula_2.

<text>In telecommunications and fiber optics, a plastic-clad silica fiber or polymer-clad silica fiber (PCS) is an optical fiber that has a silica-based core and a plastic cladding. The cladding of a PCS fiber should not be confused with the polymer overcoat of a conventional all-silica fiber. 

==Usage==
The main applications of plastic-clad silica fiber are industrial, medical or sensing applications where cores that are larger than those used in standard data communications fibers are advantageous.

PCS fibers in general have significantly lower performance characteristics, particularly higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths, than all-glass fibers.

<doc id="41562" wikidata="Q43247" url="?curid=41562" title="Ingrid Bergman">
<text>Ingrid Bergman (29 August 191529 August 1982) was a Swedish actress. With a career spanning five decades, Bergman is often regarded as one of the most influential screen figures in cinematic history. She won numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Award, and a Volpi Cup. She is one of only four actresses to have received at least three acting Academy Awards (only Katharine Hepburn has four). In 1999, the American Film Institute recognised Bergman as the fourth-greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and German mother, Bergman began her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to the U.S. audience came in the English-language remake of &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939). Known for her naturally luminous beauty, she starred in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942) as Ilsa Lund. Bergman&#x27;s notable performances in the 1940s include the dramas &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945), and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she won for &quot;Gaslight&quot;. She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock: &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946), and &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949).

In 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Stromboli&quot;, released after the revelation that she was having an affair with Rossellini; that and her pregnancy before their marriage created a scandal in the U.S. that prompted her to remain in Europe for several years. During this time, she starred in Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot; and &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; (1954), the former of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She returned to Hollywood, earning two more Academy Awards for her roles in &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1956) and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974). During this period she also starred in &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1969), and &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (1978) receiving her sixth Best Actress nomination.

Bergman won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the Maxwell Anderson play &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot; (1947). She also won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1960), and &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982). In 1974, Bergman discovered she was suffering from breast cancer but continued to work until shortly before her death on her sixty-seventh birthday in 1982. Bergman spoke five languages—Swedish, English, German, Italian, and French—and acted in each.

==Early life==

Ingrid Bergman was born on 29 August 1915 in Stockholm, to a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman, and a German mother, Frieda &quot;Friedel&quot; Henriette Auguste Louise Bergman (née Adler), who was born in Kiel. Her parents married in Hamburg on 13 June 1907. She was named after Princess Ingrid of Sweden. Although she was raised in Sweden, she spent her summers in Germany and spoke fluent German.

Bergman was raised as an only child, as two older siblings had died in infancy before she was born. When she was two and a half years old, her mother died. She learned to create imaginary friends as a child. Justus Bergman had wanted his daughter to become an opera star and had her take voice lessons for three years. He sent her to the , a prestigious girls&#x27; school in Stockholm where Bergman was reportedly neither a good student nor popular.

Justus was a photographer and loved documenting his daughter&#x27;s birthdays with his camera. He made his daughter one of his favorite photographic subjects. She enjoyed dancing, dressing up, and acting in front of her father&#x27;s lenses. &quot;I was perhaps the most photographed child in Scandinavia,&quot; quipped Bergman in her later years. In 1929, when Bergman was around 14, her father died of stomach cancer. Losing her parents at such a young age was a trauma that Bergman later described as &quot;living with an ache&quot;, an experience of which she was not even aware.

After her father&#x27;s death, Bergman was sent to live with her paternal aunt, Ellen, who died of heart disease six months later. Bergman then lived with her paternal uncle Otto and his wife Hulda, who had five children of their own. She also visited her maternal aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called (Mom) according to family lore. She later said, &quot;I have wanted to be an actress almost as long as I can remember&quot;, sometimes wearing her deceased mother&#x27;s clothing, and staging plays in her father&#x27;s empty studio.

Bergman spoke Swedish and German as first languages, English and Italian (acquired later, while living in the U.S. and Italy), and French (learned in school). She acted in each of these languages at various times.

Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored Royal Dramatic Training Academy, where Greta Garbo had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, (&quot;A Crime&quot;), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. This was &quot;totally against procedure&quot; at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles. During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by Swedish film studio Svensk Filmindustri, which led her to leave the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year to work in films full-time.

== Career ==
=== 1935–1938: Swedish years ===
Bergman&#x27;s first film experience was as an extra in the 1932 film , an experience she described as &quot;walking on holy ground&quot;. Her first speaking role was a small part in (1935). Bergman played Elsa, a maid in a seedy hotel, being pursued by the leading man, Edvin Adolphson. Critics called her &quot;hefty and sure of herself&quot;, and &quot;somewhat overweight ... with an unusual way of speaking her lines&quot;. The unflatteringly striped costume that she wore may have contributed to the unfavorable comments regarding her appearance. Soon after , Bergman was offered a studio contract and placed under director Gustaf Molander.
Bergman starred in &quot;Ocean Breakers&quot;, in which she played a fisherman&#x27;s daughter, and then in , where she had the opportunity to work alongside her idol Gösta Ekman. Next, she starred in &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot; (1935). She played Lena, a secretary in love with her boss, Johan, who is unhappily married. Throughout, Lena and the wife vie for Johan&#x27;s affection, with the wife losing her husband to Lena at the end.

In 1936, in &quot;On the Sunny Side&quot; (), Bergman was cast as an orphan from a good family who marries a rich older gentleman.
Also in 1936, she appeared in &quot;Intermezzo&quot;, her first lead performance, where she was reunited with Gösta Ekman. This was a pivotal film for the young actress and allowed her to demonstrate her talent. Director Molander later said: &quot;I created &quot;Intermezzo&quot; for her, but I was not responsible for its success. Ingrid herself made it successful.&quot; In 1938, she starred in &quot;Only One Night&quot;, playing an upper-class woman living on a country estate. She didn&#x27;t like the part, calling it &quot;a piece of rubbish&quot;. She only agreed to appear if only she could star in the studio&#x27;s next film project, . She later acted in &quot;Dollar&quot; (1938), a Scandinavian screwball comedy. Bergman had just been voted Sweden&#x27;s most admired movie star in the previous year and received top billing. wrote in its review: &quot;Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s feline appearance as an industrial tycoon&#x27;s wife overshadows them all.&quot;

In her next film, a role created especially for her,  (&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot;), she played against her usual casting, as a bitter, unsympathetic character, whose face had been hideously burned. Anna Holm is the leader of a blackmail gang that targets the wealthy folk of Stockholm for their money and jewellery. The film required Bergman to wear heavy make-up, as well as glue, to simulate a burned face. A brace was put in place to distort the shape of one cheek. In her diary, she called the film &quot;my own picture, my very own. I have fought for it.&quot;. The critics loved her performance, citing her as an actor of great talent and confidence. The film was awarded a Special Recommendation at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, for its &quot;overall artistic contribution&quot;. It was remade in 1941 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with the same title, starring Joan Crawford.

Bergman signed a three-picture contract with UFA, the German major film company, although she only made one picture. At the time, she was pregnant, but, nonetheless, she arrived in Berlin to begin filming &quot;The Four Companions&quot; () (1938), directed by Carl Froelich. The film was intended as a star vehicle to launch Bergman&#x27;s career in Germany. In the film, she played one of four ambitious young women, attempting to set up a graphic design agency. The film was a light-hearted combination of comedy and romance. At first, she did not comprehend the political and social situation in Germany. Later, she said: &quot;I saw very quickly that if you were anybody at all in films, you had to be a member of the Nazi party.&quot; By September, she was back in Sweden, and gave birth to her daughter, Pia. She was never to work in Germany again.

Bergman appeared in eleven films in her native Sweden before the age of twenty-five. Her characters were always plagued with uncertainty, fear, and anxiety. The early Swedish films were not masterpieces, but she worked with some of the biggest talents in the Swedish film industry, such as Gösta Ekman, Karin Swanström, Victor Sjöström, and Lars Hanson. It showcased her immense acting talent, as a young woman with a bright future ahead of her.

===1939–1949: Hollywood and stage work breakthrough===

Bergman&#x27;s first acting role in the United States was in &quot;&quot; by Gregory Ratoff which premiered on 22 September 1939. She accepted the invitation of Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, who wished her to star in the English-language remake of her earlier Swedish film &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Petter Aron Lindström, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938). In &quot;Intermezzo&quot;, she played the role of a young piano accompanist, opposite Leslie Howard, who played a famous violin virtuoso. Bergman arrived in Los Angeles on 6 May 1939 and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence.

According to Selznick&#x27;s son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Bergman: &quot;She didn&#x27;t speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick&quot;. Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick. &quot;He let her have her way&quot;, notes a story in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn&#x27;t recognize, and &quot;instructed them to lay off&quot;. He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;synthetic razzle-dazzle&quot;.
During the following weeks, while &quot;Intermezzo&quot; was being filmed, Selznick was also filming &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman: 

&quot;Intermezzo&quot; became an enormous success and as a result, Bergman became a star. Ratoff, said, &quot;She is sensational.&quot; This was the &quot;sentiment of the entire set&quot;, wrote a retrospective, adding that workmen went out of their way to do things for her and that the cast and crew &quot;admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines&quot;. Film historian David Thomson notes that this became &quot;the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America&quot;, where her lack of make-up contributed to an &quot;air of nobility&quot;. According to &quot;Life&quot;, the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall girl &quot;with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile&quot;.

Selznick appreciated her uniqueness. Bergman was hailed as a fine new talent, and received many positive reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted her &quot;freshness and simplicity and natural dignity&quot; and the maturity of her acting which was nonetheless, free of &quot;stylistic traits—the mannerisms, postures, precise inflections—that become the stock in trade of the matured actress&quot;. Variety noted that she was warm and convincing, and provided an &quot;arresting performance&quot; and that her &quot;charm, sincerity&quot; ...and &quot;infectious vivaciousness&quot; would &quot;serve her well in both comedy and drama&quot;. There was also recognition of her natural appearance, in contrast to other film actresses. &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; critic wrote: &quot;Using scarcely any make-up, but playing with mobile intensity, she creates the character so vividly and credibility that it becomes the core of [the] narrative.&quot; Bergman made her stage debut in 1940 with &quot;Liliom&quot; opposite Burgess Meredith, at a time when she was still learning English. Selznick was worried that his new starlet&#x27;s value would diminish if she received bad reviews. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed that Bergman seemed at ease, and commanded the stage that evening. That same year she starred in &quot;June Night&quot; (), a Swedish language drama film directed by Per Lindberg. She plays Kerstin, a woman who has been shot by her lover. The news reaches the national papers. Kerstin moves to Stockholm under the new name of Sara, but lives under the scrutiny and watchful eye of her new community. wrote, &quot;Bergman establishes herself as an actress belonging to the world elite.&quot;

Bergman was loaned out of David O. Selznick&#x27;s company, to appear in three films which were released in 1941. On 18 February, Robert Sherwood Productions&#x27; released her second collaboration with Gregory Ratoff, &quot;Adam Had Four Sons.&quot; On 7 March, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released W. S. Van Dyke&#x27;s &quot;Rage in Heaven&quot;. On 12 August, Victor Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, another Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, had its New York opening. Bergman was supposed to play the &quot;good girl&quot; role of Dr Jekyll&#x27;s fiancée but pleaded with the studio that she should play the &quot;bad girl&quot; Ivy, the saucy barmaid. Reviews noted that &quot;she gave a finely-shaded performance&quot;. A New York Times review stated that &quot;the young Swedish actress proves again, that a shining talent can sometimes lift itself above an impossibly written role&quot;. Another review said: &quot;she displays a canny combination of charm, understanding, restraint and sheer acting ability.&quot;

On 30 July 1941 at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, Bergman made her second stage appearance in &quot;Anna Christie.&quot; She was praised for her performance as a whore in the play based on Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s work. A San Francisco paper said she was as unspoiled as a fresh Swedish snowball. Selznick called her &quot;The Palmolive Garbo&quot;, a reference to a popular soap, and a well-known Swedish actress of the time. Thornton Delaharty said, &quot;Lunching with Ingrid is like sitting down to an hour or so of conversation with an intelligent orchid.&quot;

&quot;Casablanca&quot;, by Michael Curtiz, opened on 26 November 1942. Bergman co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in the film; this remains her best-known role. She played the role of Ilsa, the former love of Rick Blaine and wife of Victor Laszlo, fleeing with Laszlo to the United States. The film premiered on 26 November 1942 at New York&#x27;s Hollywood Theater. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;The events are shot with sharp humor and delightful touches of political satire.&quot; It went into more general release, in January 1943.&quot;Casablanca&quot; was not one of Bergman&#x27;s favorite performances. &quot;I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.&quot; In later years, she stated, &quot;I feel about &quot;Casablanca&quot; that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled&quot;. Despite her personal views regarding her performance, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Bergman was surprisingly lovely, crisp and natural ... and lights the romantic passages with a warm and genuine glow&quot;. Other reviewers said that she &quot;[plays] the heroine with ... appealing authority and beauty&quot; and &quot;illuminates every scene in which she appears&quot; and compared her to &quot;a youthful Garbo.&quot;

&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; had its New York premiere on 14 July 1943. With &quot;Selznick&#x27;s steady boosting&quot;, she played the part of Maria, it was also her first color film. For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was adapted from Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel of the same title and co-starred Gary Cooper. When the book was sold to Paramount Pictures, Hemingway stated that &quot;Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part&quot;. His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, &quot;Intermezzo&quot;. They met a few weeks later, and after studying her, he declared, &quot;You &quot;are&quot; Maria!&quot;. James Agee, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, said Bergman &quot;bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism, which almost never appears in American pictures.&quot; He speaks movingly of her character&#x27;s confession of her rape, and her scene of farewell, &quot;which is shattering to watch&quot;. Agee believed that Bergman has truly studied what Maria might feel and look like in real life, and not in a Hollywood film. Her performance is both &quot;devastating and wonderful to see&quot;.

&quot;Gaslight&quot; opened on 4 May 1944. Bergman won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Under the direction of George Cukor, she portrayed a &quot;wife driven close to madness&quot; by her husband, played by Charles Boyer. The film, according to Thomson, &quot;was the peak of her Hollywood glory.&quot; Reviewers noted her sympathetic and emotional performance, and that she exercised restraint, by not allowing emotion to &quot;slip off into hysteria&quot;. &quot;The New York Journal-American&quot; called her &quot;one of the finest actresses in filmdom&quot; and said that &quot;she flames in passion and flickers in depression until the audience—becomes rigid in its seats&quot;.

&quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; premiered on 6 December 1945. Bergman played a nun opposite Bing Crosby, for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress. Crosby plays a priest who is assigned to a Roman Catholic school where he conflicts with its headmistress, played by Bergman. Reviewer Nathan Robin said: &#x27;Crosby&#x27;s laconic ease brings out the impishness behind Bergman&#x27;s fine-china delicacy, and Bergman proves a surprisingly spunky and spirited comic foil for Crosby&#x27;. The film was the biggest box office hit of 1945.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Spellbound&quot; premiered on 28 December 1945. In &quot;Spellbound&quot;, Bergman played Dr. Constance Petersen, a psychiatrist whose analysis could determine whether or not Dr. Anthony Edwardes, played by Gregory Peck, is guilty of murder. Artist Salvador Dalí was hired to create a dream sequence but much of what had been shot was cut by Selznick. During the film, she had the opportunity to appear with Michael Chekhov, who was her acting coach during the 1940s. This would be the first of three collaborations she had with Hitchcock.

Next, Bergman starred in &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot;, with Gary Cooper, a film originally shot in 1943, but released on 30 March 1946. It was first released to the armed forces overseas. In deference to more timely war-themed and patriotic films, Warner Bros held back the theatrical opening in the United States. On 6 September premiered Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious.&quot; In it, Bergman played a US spy, Alicia Huberman, who had been given an assignment to infiltrate the Nazi sympathizers in South America. Along the way, she fell in love with her fellow spy, played by Cary Grant. The film also starred Claude Rains in an Oscar-nominated performance by a supporting actor. According to Roger Ebert, &quot;Notorious&quot; is the most elegant expression of Hitchcock&#x27;s visual style. &quot;&quot;Notorious&quot; is my favorite Hitchcock&quot;, he asserted. Writing for the BFI, Samuel Wigley called it a &quot;perfect&quot; film. &quot;Notorious&quot; was selected by the National Film Registry in 2006 as culturally and significantly important.

On 5 October 1946, Bergman appeared in &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot; at the Alvin Theatre in New York. Tickets were fully booked for a twelve-week run. It was the greatest hit in New York. After each performance, crowds were in line to see Bergman in person. &quot;Newsweek&quot; called her &#x27;Queen of the Broadway Season.&#x27; She reportedly received roughly $129,000 plus 15 percent of the grosses. &quot;The Associated Press&quot; named her &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. &quot;Gallup&quot; certified her as the most popular actress in America.

On 17 February 1948, &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot;, by Lewis Milestone was released with Bergman and Charles Boyer as the leading roles Based on Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s book, it follows a story of Joan Madou, an Italian-Romanian refugee who works as a cabaret singer in a Paris nightclub. Distressed by her lover&#x27;s sudden death, she attempts suicide by plunging into the Seine, but rescued by Dr Ravic, a German surgeon (Charles Boyer). On 11 November 1948, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; had its world premiere. For her role, Bergman received another Best Actress nomination. The independent film was based on the Maxwell Anderson play &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot;, which had earned her a Tony Award earlier that year. Produced by Walter Wanger and initially released through RKO. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, then chose to appear on the Broadway stage in Anderson&#x27;s play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the Rossellini scandal, which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on DVD.

&quot;Under Capricorn&quot; premiered on 9 September 1949, as another Bergman and Hitchcock collaboration. The film is set in the Australia of 1831. The story opens as Charles Adare, played by Michael Wilding, arrives in New South Wales with his uncle. Desperate to find his fortune, Adare meets Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotten), who is married to Adare&#x27;s childhood friend Lady Henrietta (Bergman), an alcoholic kept locked in their mansion. Soon, Flusky becomes jealous of Adare&#x27;s affection for his wife. The film met with negative reactions from critics. Some of the negativity may have been based on disapproval of Bergman&#x27;s affair with the Italian director Roberto Rossellini. Their scandalous relationship became apparent, shortly after the film&#x27;s release.

=== 1950–1955: Italian films with Rossellini ===
&quot;Stromboli&quot; was released by Italian director Roberto Rossellini on 18 February 1950. Bergman had greatly admired two films by Rossellini. She wrote to him in 1949, expressing her admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. As a consequence, she was cast in &quot;Stromboli&quot;. During the production, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their first child.

This affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the United States Senate. On 14 March 1950, Senator Edwin C. Johnson insisted that his once-favorite actress &quot;had perpetrated an assault upon the institution of marriage&quot;, and went so far as to call her &quot;a powerful influence for evil&quot;. &quot;The purity that made people joke about Saint Bergman when she played Joan of Arc,&quot; one writer commented, &quot;made both audiences and United States senators feel betrayed when they learned of her affair with Roberto Rossellini.&quot; Art Buchwald, permitted to read her mail during the scandal, reflected in an interview, &quot;Oh, that mail was bad, ten, twelve, fourteen huge mail bags. &#x27;Dirty whore.&#x27; &#x27;Bitch.&#x27; &#x27;Son of a bitch.&#x27; And they were all Christians who wrote it.&quot;

Ed Sullivan chose not to have her on his show, despite a poll indicating that the public wanted her to appear. However, Steve Allen, whose show was equally popular, did have her as a guest, later explaining &quot;the danger of trying to judge artistic activity through the prism of one&#x27;s personal life&quot;. Spoto notes that Bergman had, by virtue of her roles and screen persona, placed herself &quot;above all that&quot;. She had played a nun in &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945), and a virgin saint in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948). Bergman later said, &quot;People saw me in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, and declared me a saint. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m just a woman, another human being.&quot; As a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, left her first husband, and went through a publicized divorce and custody battle for their daughter. Bergman and Rossellini were married on 24 May 1950.

In the United States, the film &quot;Stromboli&quot; was a box office bomb but did better overseas, where Bergman and Rossellini&#x27;s affair was considered less scandalous. In all, RKO lost $200,000 on the picture. In Italy, it was awarded the Rome Prize for Cinema as the best film of the year. The initial reception in America, however, was very negative. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opened his review by writing: &quot;After all the unprecedented interest that the picture &quot;Stromboli&quot; has aroused—it being, of course, the fateful drama which Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini have made—it comes as a startling anticlimax to discover that this widely heralded film is incredibly feeble, inarticulate, uninspiring and painfully banal.&quot; Crowther added that Bergman&#x27;s character &quot;is never drawn with clear and revealing definition, due partly to the vagueness of the script and partly to the dullness and monotony with which Rossellini has directed her.&quot;

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; agreed, writing,
&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;As entertainment, it does have a few moments of distinction, but on the whole it is a dull slow-paced piece, badly edited and mediocre in writing, direction and acting.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; found that there was &quot;nothing whatsoever in the footage that rises above the humdrum&quot;, and felt that Bergman &quot;doesn&#x27;t really seem to have her heart in any of the scenes.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; lamented, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity that many people who never go to foreign-made pictures will be drawn into this by the Rossellini-Bergman names and will think that this flat, drab, inept picture is what they&#x27;ve been missing.&quot;
Recent assessments have been more positive. Reviewing the film in 2013 in conjunction with its DVD release as part of The Criterion Collection, Dave Kehr called the film &quot;one of the pioneering works of modern European filmmaking.&quot; In an expansive analysis of the film, critic Fred Camper wrote of the drama, 

The Venice Film Festival ranked &quot;Stromboli&quot; among the 100 most important Italian films (&quot;100 film italiani da salvare&quot;) from 1942 to 1978. In 2012, the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll also listed it as one of the 250 greatest films of all time.

In 1952, Rossellini directed Bergman in &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot;, where she plays Irene Girard who is distraught by the sudden death of her son. Her husband played by Alexander Knox soon copes, but Irene seems to need a purpose in life to assuage her guilt of neglecting her son.

Rossellini directed her in a brief segment of his 1953 documentary film, &quot;Siamo donne&quot; (&quot;We, the Women&quot;), which was devoted to film actresses. His biographer, Peter Bondanella, notes that problems with communication during their marriage may have inspired his films&#x27; central themes of &quot;solitude, grace, and spirituality in a world without moral values&quot;. In December 1953, Rossellini directed her in the play &quot;Joan of Arc at the Stake&quot; in Naples, Italy. They took the play to Barcelona, London, Paris and Stockholm. Her performance received generally good reviews.

Their following effort was &quot;Viaggio in Italia (Journey to Italy)&quot; in 1954. It follows a couple&#x27;s journey to Naples, Italy to sell off an inherited house. Trapped in a lifeless marriage, they are further unnerved by the locals&#x27; way of living. According to John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the film started The French New Wave. Martin Scorsese picked this film to be among his favorites in his documentary short in 2001. On 17 February 1955, &quot;Joan at the Stake&quot; opened at the Stockholm Opera House. The play was attended by the prime minister and other theatrical figures in Sweden. &quot;Swedish Daily&quot; reported that Bergman seems vague, cool and lacking in charisma. Bergman was hurt by mostly negative reviews from the media of her native land. Stig Ahlgren was the most harsh when he labelled her a clever businesswoman, not an actress. &quot;Ingrid is a commodity, a desirable commodity which is offered in the free market.&quot; Another effort they released that year was &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco al rogo (Joan of Arc at the Stake)&quot;.

Their final effort in 1954 was &quot;La Paura&quot; (&quot;Fear&quot;), based on a play by Austro-Jewish writer Stefan Zweig&#x27;s 1920 novella &quot;Angst&quot; about adultery and blackmail. In &quot;Fear&quot;, Bergman plays a businesswoman who runs a pharmaceutical company founded by her husband (Mathias Wieman). She is having an affair with a man whose ex-lover turns up and blackmails her. The woman demands money, threatening to tell her husband about the affair if Bergman doesn&#x27;t pay her off. Under constant threats, Bergman is pressed to the point of committing suicide.

Rossellini&#x27;s use of a Hollywood star in his typically &quot;neorealist&quot; films, in which he normally used non-professional actors, provoked some negative reactions in certain circles. Rossellini, &quot;defying audience expectations[,]...employed Bergman &quot;as if&quot; she were a nonprofessional,&quot; depriving her of a script and the typical luxuries accorded to a star (indoor plumbing, for instance, or hairdressers) and forcing Bergman to act &quot;inspired by reality while she worked&quot;, creating what one critic calls &quot;a new cinema of psychological introspection&quot;. Bergman was aware of Rossellini&#x27;s directing style before filming, as the director had earlier written to her explaining that he worked from &quot;a few basic ideas, developing them little by little&quot; as a film progressed. Rossellini then was accused of ruining her successful career by taking her away from Hollywood, while Bergman was seen as the impetus for Rossellini abandoning the aesthetic style and socio-political concerns of Neo-Realism.

While the movies Bergman made with Rossellini were commercial failures, the films have garnered great appreciation and attention in recent times. According to Jordan Cronk in his article reviewing the movies, their work has inspired a beginning of a modern cinematic era. Rossellini&#x27;s films during the Bergman era ponder issues of complex psychology as depicted by Bergman in films like &quot;Stromboli&quot;, &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot; and &quot;Journey to Italy&quot;. The influence of Bergman and Rossellini&#x27;s partnership can be felt in the movies by Godard, Fellini and Antonioni to, more recently, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. David Kehr from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that their works now stand as one of the pioneering works whose influence can be felt in European modern filmmaking.

===1956–1972: Hollywood return===

After separating from Rossellini, Bergman starred in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Elena and Her Men&quot; (&quot;Elena et les Hommes&quot;, 1956), a romantic comedy in which she played a Polish princess caught up in political intrigue. Bergman and Renoir had wanted to work together. In &quot;Elena and Her Men&quot;, which Renoir had written for her, she plays down-on-her-luck Polish princess Elena Sorokowska. The film was a hit in Paris when it premiered in September 1956. Candice Russell, commented that Bergman is the best thing in the film. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The movie is about something else—about Bergman&#x27;s rare eroticism, and the way her face seems to have an inner light on film. Was there ever a more sensuous actress in the movies?&quot;

In 1956, Bergman also starred in a French adaptation of the stage production &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;. It was presented at the Théâtre de Paris, Paris. It tells a story of a &quot;boarding school boy&quot; who is thought to be homosexual. Bergman played the wife of the headmaster. She is supportive of the young man, grows closer to him and later has sex with him, as a way to &quot;prove&quot; and support his masculinity. It was a smash hit.

Twentieth Century Fox had bought the rights to &quot;Anastasia&quot; with Anatole Litvak slated to direct. Executive producer Buddy Adler wanted Bergman, then still a controversial figure in the States, to return to the American screen after a seven-year absence. Litvak also felt she would be an excellent actress for the part and insisted on her starring in the film. Fox agreed to take a chance, making her a box-office risk to play the leading role. Filming would take place in England, Paris, and Copenhagen.

&quot;Anastasia&quot; (1956) tells the story of a woman who may be the sole surviving member of the Romanov family. Yul Brynner is the scheming general, who tries to pass her off as the single surviving daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II. He hopes to use her to collect a hefty inheritance. &quot;Anastasia&quot; was an immediate success. Bosley Crowther wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;It is a beautifully molded performance, worthy of an Academy Award and particularly gratifying in the light of Miss Bergman&#x27;s long absence from commendable films.&quot;

With her role in &quot;Anastasia&quot;, Bergman made a triumphant return to working for a Hollywood studio (albeit in a film produced in Europe) and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for a second time. Cary Grant accepted the award on her behalf. Its director, Anatole Litvak, described her as &quot;one of the greatest actresses in the world&quot;:

After Anastasia, Bergman starred in &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), a romantic comedy directed by Stanley Donen. She plays a successful London stage actress, Anna Kalman, who falls in love with Philip Adams, a diplomat played by Cary Grant. The film is based on the play &quot;&#x27;Kind Sir&quot;&#x27; written by Norman Krasna. Although unmarried, he tells her that he is married but cannot get a divorce. He does so in order to remain single. Cecil Parker and Phyllis Calvert also co-starred.

Bergman later starred in the 1958 picture &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, based on a true story about Gladys Aylward, a Christian missionary in China who, despite many obstacles, was able to win the hearts of the natives through patience and sincerity. In the film&#x27;s climactic scene, she leads a group of orphaned children to safety, to escape from the Japanese invasion. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the justification of her achievements is revealed by no other displays than those of Miss Bergman&#x27;s mellow beauty, friendly manner and melting charm.&quot; The film also co-starred Robert Donat and Curd Jurgens.

Bergman made her first post-scandal public appearance in Hollywood at the 31st Academy Awards in 1959, as presenter of the award for Best Picture, and received a standing ovation when introduced. She presented the award for Best Motion Picture together with Cary Grant, with whom she had recently starred in &quot;Indiscreet&quot;. Bergman made her television debut in an episode of &quot;Startime&quot;, an anthology show, which presented dramas, musical comedies, and variety shows. The episode presented &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, an adaptation of the horror novella by Henry James and directed by John Frankenheimer. She played a governess to two little children, who are haunted by the ghost of their previous caretaker. For this performance, she was awarded the 1960 Emmy for best dramatic performance by an actress. Also in 1960, Bergman was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star at 6759 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1961, Bergman&#x27;s second American television production, &quot;Twenty-four Hours in a Woman&#x27;s Life&quot;, was produced by her third husband, Lars Schmidt. Bergman played a bereaved wife, in love with a younger man she has known for only 24 hours. She later starred in &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; as Paula Tessier, a middle-aged interior decorator who falls in love with Anthony Perkins&#x27; character, who is fifteen years her junior. Paula is in relationship with Roger Demarest, a womanizer, played by Yves Montand. Roger loves Paula but reluctant to give up his womanizing ways. When Perkins starts pursuing her, the lonely Paula is suddenly forced to choose between the two men. In his review of the film, Bosley Crowther wrote that Bergman was neither convincing nor interesting in her part as Perkins&#x27;s lover.

In 1962, Schmidt also co-produced his wife&#x27;s third venture into American television, &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, made for BBC and CBS. She played the titular character opposite Michael Redgrave and Ralph Richardson. David Duprey wrote in his review, &quot;Bergman and Sir Ralph Richardson on screen at the same time is like peanut butter and chocolate spread on warm toast.&quot; Later in the year, she took the titular role of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the in Paris.

On 23 September 1964, &quot;The Visit&quot; premiered. Based on Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s 1956 play, &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame; eine tragische Komödie,&quot; it starred Bergman and Anthony Quinn. With a production budget of $1.5 million, principal photography took place in Capranica, outside of Rome. She plays Karla Zachanassian, the world&#x27;s richest woman, who returns to her birthplace, seeking revenge.

On 13 May 1965, Anthony Asquith&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot; premiered. Bergman plays Gerda Millett, a wealthy American widow who meets up with a Yugoslavian partisan, Omar Sharif. For her role, she was reportedly paid $250,000. That same year, although known chiefly as a film star, Bergman appeared in London&#x27;s West End, working with stage star Michael Redgrave in &quot;A Month in the Country.&quot; She took on the role of Natalia Petrovna, a lovely headstrong woman, bored with her marriage and her life. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The production would hardly have exerted this special appeal without the presence of Ingrid Bergman.&quot;

In 1966, Bergman acted in only one project, an hour-long television version of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s one-character play, &quot;The Human Voice&quot;. It tells a story of a lonely woman in her apartment talking on the phone to her lover who is about to leave her for another woman. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her performance, calling it a tour-de-force. &quot;The Times of London&quot; echoed the same sentiment, describing it as a great dramatic performance through this harrowing monologue.
In 1967, Bergman was cast in a short episode of Swedish anthology film, &quot;Stimulantia&quot;. Her segment which is based on the Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s &quot;The Jewellery&quot; reunited her with Gustaf Molander. Next, Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;More Stately Mansions&quot; directed by José Quintero, opened on 26 October 1967. Bergman, Colleen Dewhurst, and Arthur Hill appeared in the leading roles. The show closed on 2 March 1968 after 142 performances. It was reported that thousand of spectators bought tickets, and travelled across the country, to see Bergman perform. Bergman returned as both a presenter and a performer during the 41st Annual Academy Awards in 1969.

Bergman wished to work in American films again, following a long hiatus. She starred in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; released in 1969, with Walter Matthau and Goldie Hawn. Here, she played a prim spinster, a dental nurse-receptionist who is secretly in love with her boss, the dentist, played by Matthau. Howard Thompson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
The teaming of Matthau, whose dour, craggy virility now supplants the easy charm of Barry Nelson, and the ultra-feminine Miss Bergman, in a rare comedy venture, was inspirational on somebody&#x27;s part. The lady is delightful as a (now) &quot;Swedish iceberg&quot;, no longer young, who flowers radiantly while running interference for the boss&#x27;s romantic bumbling. The two stars mesh perfectly.On 9 April 1970, Guy Green&#x27;s &quot;A Walk in the Spring Rain&quot; had its world premiere. Bergman played Libby, the middle-aged wife of a New York professor (Fritz Weaver). She accompanies him on his sabbatical in the Tennessee mountains, where he intends to write a book. She meets a local handyman, Will Cade (Anthony Quinn), and they form a mutual attraction. The screenplay, by writer-producer Stirling Silliphant, was based on the romantic novel written by Rachel Maddux. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in its review wrote, &quot;Striving mightily and looking lovely, Miss Bergman seems merely a petulant woman who falls into the arms of Quinn for novelty, from boredom with her equally bored husband, [Weaver], pecking away on a book in their temporary mountain retreat.&quot;

On 18 February 1971, &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, a play based on George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s work, made a debut at London theatre. She took on the role of a woman whose husband has taken up with a woman half her age. Although the play was a commercial success, critics were not very receptive of Bergman&#x27;s British accent.

She made an appearance in one episode of &quot;The Bob Hope Show&quot; in 1972. Also that year, U.S. Senator Charles H. Percy entered an apology into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; for the verbal attack made on Bergman on 14 March 1950 by Edwin C. Johnson. Percy noted that she had been &quot;the victim of bitter attack in this chamber 22 years ago.&quot; He expressed regret that the persecution caused Bergman to &quot;leave this country at the height of her career&quot;. Bergman said that the remarks had been difficult to forget, and had caused her to avoid the country for nine years. Although she had paid a high price, Bergman had made peace with America, according to her daughter, Isabella Rossellini.

=== 1973–1982: Later years and continued success ===
On 27 September 1972, Fielder Cook&#x27;s &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot; premiered. She plays the titular character, a wealthy recluse who befriends two children who are seeking &quot;treasure&quot; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Also that year, Bergman was the president of the jury at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. In an interview with &quot;The Daytona Beach Sunday News&quot; in 1978, she recalled this event because she met with Ingmar Bergman once again. This gave her the opportunity to remind him about the letter she had written, some ten years ago, asking him to cast her in one of his pictures. Knowing that Ingmar would be attending, she made a copy of his long-ago reply, and put it in his pocket. He didn&#x27;t reply again, for two years.

Next, Bergman returned to London&#x27;s West End and appeared with John Gielgud in &quot;The Constant Wife,&quot; which was a critical success. The theatre was consistently packed. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found the play &quot;unusually entertaining&quot;, while Harold Hobson of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was still peeved at Bergman for playing yet another English woman with a &quot;strange accent&quot;.

Bergman became one of the few actresses ever to receive three Oscars when she won her third (and first in the category of Best Supporting Actress) for her performance in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974). Director Sidney Lumet had offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman&#x27;s role:
At the 1975 Academy Awards, film director Jean Renoir was to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to the motion picture industry. As he was ill at the time, he asked that Ingrid Bergman accept this award on his behalf. Bergman made a speech of acceptance that praised his films and the &quot;compassion that marked all his works&quot; as well as his teaching of both young filmmakers and audiences. Although she had been nominated for the new Best Supporting Actress Award, she considered her role in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; to be quite minor and did not expect to win. When the award was announced, in her surprised and unrehearsed remarks, she remarked to the audience that Valentina Cortese should have won the award for her role in &quot;Day for Night&quot;, by Truffaut. Bergman and Cortese spent the rest of the evening in each other&#x27;s company, and were the subject of many photographs. Also in 1975, Bergman attended the AFI tribute to Orson Welles. The audience gave her a standing ovation when she appeared on stage. She joked that she hardly knew Welles and they only invited her because she was working across the street.

In 1976, Bergman was the first person to receive France&#x27;s newly created Honorary César, a national film award. She also appeared in &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, by Vincente Minnelli, which premiered on 7 October 1976. Roger Ebert in his review wrote,

From 1977 to 1978, Bergman returned to the London&#x27;s West with Wendy Hiller in &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot;. She played Helen Lancaster, a rich, self-centred woman whose car becomes stuck in a snowdrift. The play became the great new hit of the season.

In 1978, Bergman appeared in &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (), by accomplished Swedish filmmaker, Ingmar Bergman (no relation), for which she received her seventh—and final—Academy Award nomination. She did not attend the awards, due to her illness. This was her final cinema performance. The film gave her the opportunity to work with Liv Ullmann, another well-known and respected Scandinavian artist. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist, Charlotte, who travels to Norway intending to visit her neglected eldest daughter, Eva, played by Ullmann. Eva is married to a clergyman and they care for her sister, Helena, who is severely disabled, paralyzed, and unable to speak clearly. Charlotte has not visited either of her two daughters for seven years. Upon arrival at Eva&#x27;s home, she is shocked and dismayed to learn that her younger daughter is also in residence, and not still in the institution &quot;home&quot;. Very late that night, Eva and Charlotte have an impassioned and painful conversation about their past relationship. Charlotte leaves the next day. The film was shot in Norway.

Bergman was battling cancer at the time of the filming. The final two weeks of the shooting schedule required adjustment because she required additional surgery. Believing that her career was nearing its end, Bergman wanted her swan song to be honourable. She was pleased with the overwhelming critical acclaim for &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;. Stanley Kaufmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;The astonishment is Bergman&#x27;s performance. We&#x27;ve all adored her for decades but not many of us have thought her a superb actress. Here, she exalted in the hands of a master.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;An expressive force we can&#x27;t even remember seeing since Hollywood grabbed her.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; (London) concurred that it was &quot;a tour-de-force, such as the cinema rarely sees&quot;. Both Bergman and Ullmann won the &quot;New York Film Critic&#x27;s Award&quot; and Italy&#x27;s &quot;Donatello&quot; award, for their roles. Bergman later recalled that Ingmar had possibly given her the best role of her career, that she would never make another movie again. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go down and play little parts. This should be the end.&quot;

In 1979, Bergman hosted the AFI&#x27;s Life Achievement Award Ceremony for Alfred Hitchcock. At the program&#x27;s finale, she presented him with the wine cellar key that was crucial to the plot of &quot;Notorious&quot;. &quot;Cary Grant kept this for 10 years, then he gave it to me, and I kept it for 20 years for good luck and now I give it to you with my prayers,&quot; before adding &quot;God bless you, Hitch.&quot; Bergman was the guest of honour in the Variety&#x27;s Club All Star Salute program in December 1979. The show was hosted by Jimmy Stewart and was attended by Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Goldie Hawn, Helen Hayes, Paul Henreid and many of her former co-stars. She was honored with the &quot;Illis Quorum&quot;, the medal given to artists of significance by the King of Sweden.

In the late &#x27;70s, Bergman appeared on several talk shows and was interviewed by Merv Griffin, David Frost, Michael Parkinson, Mike Douglas, John Russell and Dick Cavett, discussing her life and career.

In 1980, Bergman&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Ingrid Bergman: My Story&quot;, was written with the help of Alan Burgess. In it, she discusses her childhood, her early career, her life during her time in Hollywood, the Rossellini scandal, and subsequent events. The book was written after her son warned her that she would only be known through rumors and interviews if she did not tell her own story. In 1982, she was awarded the David di Donatello&#x27;s Golden Medal of the Minister of Tourism, given by The Academy of Italian Cinema.

Finally that year, Bergman played the starring role in a television mini-series, &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982), about the late Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. Bergman was surprised to be offered the role, but the producer explained, &quot;People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people.&quot; Her daughter Isabella added, &quot;Now, &quot;that&quot; was interesting to Mother.&quot; She was also persuaded that Golda was a &quot;grand-scale person&quot;, one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role &quot;also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany&quot;.

According to Chandler, &quot;Ingrid&#x27;s rapidly deteriorating health was a more serious problem. Insurance for Bergman was impossible. Not only did she have cancer, but it was spreading, and if anyone had known how bad it was, no one would have gone on with the project.&quot; After viewing the series on TV, Isabella commented:

Her daughter said that Bergman identified with Golda Meir, because she, too had felt guilty. Bergman tried to strike a balance between home and work responsibilities and deal with &quot;the inability to be in two places at one time&quot;. Bergman&#x27;s arm was terribly swollen from her cancer surgery. She was often ill during the filming, recovering from the mastectomy and the removal of lymph nodes. It was important to her, as an actress, to make a certain gesture of Meir&#x27;s, which required her to raise both arms, but she was unable to properly raise one arm. During the night, her arm was propped up, in an uncomfortable position, so that the fluid would drain, and enable her to perform her character&#x27;s important gesture.

Despite her health problems, she rarely complained or let others see the difficulties she endured. Four months after the filming was completed, Bergman died on her 67th birthday. After her death, her daughter Pia accepted her Emmy.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and children ===
On 10 July 1937, at the age of 21, in Stöde, Bergman married a dentist, Petter Aron Lindström, who later became a neurosurgeon. The couple had one child, a daughter, Friedel Pia Lindström. After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindström stayed in Rochester, New York, where he studied medicine and surgery at the University of Rochester.

In between films, Bergman travelled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in &quot;Life&quot;, the &quot;doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully&quot;. He insisted she draw the line between her professional life and her personal life, as he had a &quot;professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood&quot;. Lindström later moved to San Francisco, California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming. Lindström did not view Bergman as the rest of the world did. He thought she was too absorbed with her professional popularity and image, and was full of vanity. According to Bergman&#x27;s biographer, Donald Spoto, Lindström managed her career and financial matters. He was very frugal with money. On 27 August 1945, two days before her 30th birthday, she (as Ingrid Lindstrom) and her husband both filed US citizenship applications.
Lindström had been aware of his wife&#x27;s affairs. When asked by the biographer why he didn&#x27;t ask for a divorce, he replied bluntly, &quot;I lived with that because of her income.&quot; Bergman returned to Europe after the scandalous publicity surrounding her affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini during the filming of &quot;Stromboli&quot; in 1950. She begged Lindström for a divorce and contact with their daughter Pia, but he refused.

In the same month &quot;Stromboli&quot; was released, she gave birth to a boy, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (&quot;Robin&quot;) Rossellini (born 2 February 1950). A week after her son was born, she divorced Lindström under Mexican jurisdiction, and married Rossellini by proxy on 24 May 1950. On 18 June 1952, she gave birth to twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and Isabella Rossellini. Isabella became an actress and model, and Isotta a professor of Italian literature. It was not until 1957 that Bergman was reunited with Pia, in Rome. Her ex-husband, however, remained bitter towards Bergman.
During the scandal, Bergman received letters of support from Cary Grant, Helen Hayes, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and other celebrities. The adultery and remarriage is remembered as a major sex scandal of 20th century Hollywood. It received an extraordinary amount of media attention in the U.S. and abroad, including Bergman&#x27;s native Sweden. Bergman was treated harshly by the conservative Swedish press, with some journalists claiming she had destroyed the international reputation of Sweden. The scandal also took ethnic overtones, with Rossellini described as the over-sexed Latin lover. On the other hand, Bergman was defended by Swedish feminists, especially in 1955 when Bergman first returned to Sweden after the scandal, causing friction between conservative journalists and the emerging feminist movement. In the U.S., the scandal also took xenophobic turns. Sen. Edwin C. Johnson stated that &quot;under the law, no alien guilty of turpitude can set foot on American soil again&quot; and that Bergman had &quot;deliberately exiled herself from this country that was so good to her&quot;. Isabella Rossellini said that &quot;[..] she was chased out of America because they felt that foreigners and stars, we come to America, and then behave immorally and are bad examples to the younger generations.&quot; Although post-war social conservate morals stoked the public outrage, another factor was the Bergman&#x27;s on-screen image as a pure, saint-like character; she later commented: &quot;People saw me in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, and declared me a saint. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m just a woman, another human being&quot; and &quot;It was because so many people, who knew me only on the screen, thought I was perfect and infallible and then were angry and disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t ... A nun does not fall in love with an Italian.&quot;

Her marriage with Rossellini declined and eventually ended in divorce in 1957. Rossellini&#x27;s cousin, Renzo Avanzo, was worried that Bergman would discourage Rossellini from making pictures he should be making. Rossellini didn&#x27;t like her friends, fearing they would lure her back to Hollywood. He was possessive and would not allow Bergman to work for anyone else. In 1957, Rossellini had an affair with Sonali Das Gupta while filming in India. Bergman met with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in London, to get permission for Rossellini to leave India.

On 21 December 1958, Bergman married Lars Schmidt, a theatrical entrepreneur from a wealthy Swedish shipping family. She met Schmidt through her publicist, Kay Brown. The couple and their children spent summers together in Danholmen, Lars&#x27;s private island off the coast of Sweden. They also stayed at Choisel near Paris. Bergman traveled frequently for filming, while Lars produced plays and television shows all over Europe, and their work schedules put a strain on their marriage. While vacationing with Schmidt in Monte Gordo beach in Algarve, Portugal in 1963, right after making the TV movie &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, she received a ticket for wearing a too-revealing bikini, by the modesty standards of conservative Portugal. After almost two decades of marriage, the couple divorced in 1975. Nonetheless, Lars was by her side when she died on 29 August 1982, her 67th birthday.

One of Bergman&#x27;s grandchildren is Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann.

In October 1978, Bergman gave an interview on her last film role, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;, which explored the relationship between a mother and daughter. She played a classical concert pianist, who valued her career more than motherhood and caring for her two daughters. Bergman said: &quot;A lot of it is what I have lived through, leaving my children, having a career.&quot; She recalled instances in her own life, &quot;when she had to pry her children&#x27;s arms from around her neck, &#x27;and then go away&#x27; to advance her career.&quot; In her will, the bulk of her estate was divided among her four children, with some provision for Rossellini&#x27;s niece Fiorella, Bergman&#x27;s maid in Rome, and her agent&#x27;s daughter Kate Brown.

===Relationships===
Bergman had affairs with her directors and co-stars in the 1940s. Spencer Tracy and Bergman briefly dated during the filming of &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. She later had an affair with Gary Cooper while shooting &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Cooper said, &quot;No one loved me more than Ingrid Bergman, but the day after filming concluded, I couldn&#x27;t even get her on the phone.&quot; Jeanine Basinger writes, [Victor] &quot;Fleming fell deeply in love with the irresistible Swede and never really got over it&quot;. While directing his final film &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, he was completely enthralled with Bergman. She had a brief affair with musician Larry Adler when she was travelling across Europe entertaining the troops in 1945. In Anthony Quinn&#x27;s autobiography, he mentions his sexual relationship with Bergman, among his many other affairs. Howard Hughes was also quite taken by Bergman. They met through Cary Grant and Irene Selznick. He phoned one day to inform her that he had just bought RKO as a present for her.

During her marriage to Lindström, Bergman also had affairs with the photographer Robert Capa and the actor Gregory Peck. It was through Bergman&#x27;s autobiography that her affair with Capa became known.p. 176 In June 1945, Bergman was passing through Paris, on her way to Berlin to entertain American soldiers. In response to a dinner invitation she met Capa and novelist Irwin Shaw. By her account, they had a wonderful evening. The next day, she departed for Berlin. Two months later, Capa was in Berlin, photographing ruins, and they met again. Distressed over her marriage to Lindström, she fell in love with Capa, and wished to leave her husband. During their months together in Berlin, Capa made enough money to follow Bergman back to Hollywood. Although &quot;Life&quot; magazine assigned him to cover Bergman, he was unhappy with the &quot;frivolity&quot; of Hollywood.

Bergman&#x27;s brief affair with &quot;Spellbound&quot; co-star Gregory Peck was kept private until Peck confessed it to Brad Darrach of &quot;People&quot; in an interview five years after Bergman&#x27;s death. Peck said, &quot;All I can say is that I had a real love for her (Bergman), and I think that&#x27;s where I ought to stop ... I was young. She was young. We were involved for weeks in close and intense work.&quot;

Bergman was a Lutheran, once saying of herself, &quot;I&#x27;m tall, Swedish, and Lutheran&quot;.

Later, her daughter Isabella Rossellini said: &quot;She showed that women are independent, that women want to tell their own story, want to take initiative, but sometimes, they can&#x27;t because sometimes, our social culture doesn&#x27;t allow women to break away from certain rules.&quot;

After the making of &quot;&quot; (1939), producer David O. Selznick and his wife Irene became friends with Bergman and remained so throughout her career. Bergman also formed a lifelong friendship with her &quot;Notorious&quot; co-star, Cary Grant. They met briefly in 1938 at a party thrown by Selznick. Scot Eyman in his book, &quot;Cary Grant: A Brilliant Disguise&quot; wrote, &quot;Grant found that he liked Ingrid Bergman a great deal... She was beautiful, but lots of actresses are beautiful. What made Bergman special was her indifference to her looks, her clothes, to everything except her art.&quot; Bergman and Hitchcock also formed a sustained friendship out of mutual admiration.

At , she was taller than some of her male costars, causing occasional problems. She was two inches (5 cm) taller than Humphrey Bogart, and Bogart was reported as standing on blocks or sitting on cushions in their scenes together in &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Bergman was also taller than Claude Rains, and for the scenes in &quot;Notorious&quot; where Rains and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains&#x27;s height below camera level, and Rains also wore elevator shoes in some scenes.

==Illness and death==

During the run of &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; in London, Bergman discovered a hard lump under her left breast. The lump was removed on 15 June 1974 in a London clinic. While working on &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;, Bergman discovered another lump, and flew back to London for another surgery. Afterward, she began rehearsals for &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; (1978).

Despite her illness, she agreed to play Golda Meir in 1981, then retired to her apartment in Cheyne Gardens, London, where she underwent chemotherapy. As photographers camped outside on the pavement, she refrained from approaching the front window. The cancer had spread to her spine, collapsing her twelfth vertebra; her right lung no longer functioned, and only a small part of her left lung had not collapsed.

Bergman died in London on 29 August 1982, at midnight on her 67th birthday. Her ex-husband Lars Schmidt and three other people were present, having drunk their last toast to her hours earlier. A copy of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was at her bedside, opened to a page near the end. The memorial service was held in St Martin-in-the-Fields church in October with 1,200 mourners. In attendance were her children, the Rossellinis, and relatives from Sweden, as well as numerous fellow actors and costars, including Liv Ullmann, Sir John Gielgud, Dame Wendy Hiller, Birgit Nilsson and Joss Ackland. As part of the service, quotations from Shakespeare were read. Musical selections included &quot;This Old Man&quot; from &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, a piece by Beethoven, and strains of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. Bergman&#x27;s grandson, Justin Daly, recalled the event as hundreds of photographers were waiting and taking pictures, and a camera hit him on the head: &quot;In the middle of all this chaos, I could sense that she wasn&#x27;t just my grandmother. She belonged to everyone else. She belonged to the world.&quot;

Ingrid Bergman was cremated at a private ceremony attended only by close relatives and five friends at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, and her ashes were taken to Sweden. Most were scattered in the sea around the islet of Dannholmen, near the fishing village of Fjällbacka in Bohuslän. The location is on the west coast of Sweden, a place where she had spent most of the summers from 1958 until her death. The remainder of her ashes were placed next to her parents&#x27; ashes in Norra Begravningsplatsen (Northern Cemetery or Burial Place), Stockholm, Sweden.

==Acting style, public image and screen persona==

According to the &quot;St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture&quot;, upon her arrival in the U.S. Bergman quickly became &quot;the ideal of American womanhood&quot; and a contender for Hollywood&#x27;s greatest leading actress. David O. Selznick once called her &quot;the most completely conscientious actress&quot; with whom he had ever worked.

Bergman was often associated with vulnerable yet strong characters who were in love but were also troubled by anxiety and fear. As preparation for &quot;Gaslight&quot; she went to a mental hospital and observed a particular patient. For &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot;, she reviewed tapes, to master Meir&#x27;s mannerisms. In &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;, she moves across the screen like a caged animal but always keeps a ladylike composure that makes her words even more &quot;silent but deathly&quot;. Bergman could be rigid and stubborn in her acting approach. Ingmar Bergman stated that they argued frequently, on set. &quot;She went to a limit and objected to go beyond the limit.&quot; Jan Göransson of the Swedish Film Institute described Bergman as stubborn and loved to question her directors, whose innovative ideas about acting eventually won her over.

Bergman&#x27;s ability to instantly change emotions was one of her greatest talents. Funing Tang from the University of Miami asserted, &quot;even a moment of reticence, a little glance, or even an eye movement can alter the film&#x27;s direction and provide her film and character with suspense, ambiguity and mysteriousness, which are rooted in her singular characteristics.&quot;

Roger Ebert echoed the same observation when he cited that Bergman has her way of looking into a man&#x27;s face. He added, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t simply gaze at his eyes, as so many actresses do, their thoughts on the next line of dialogue. She peers into the eyes, searching for meaning and clues, and when she is in a close two-shot with an actor, watch the way her own eyes reflect the most minute changes in his expression.&quot;

For writer Susan Kerr, Bergman might have the greatest downcast eyes in history. &quot;She got her greatest effects in &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Gaslight&quot; and &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot; by swooping her eyes down to the floor and darting them back and forth, as if watching a mouse scurry across the room&quot;, Kerr wrote.
According to &quot;Stardom and the Aesthetics of Neorealism: Ingrid Bergman in Rossellini&#x27;s Italy&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock was responsible for transforming the Bergman&#x27;s screen persona towards a &quot;less is more&quot;. He coaxed her to be more understated and neutral, while his camera concentrated the expression in the micro-movement of her face. Much of his work with her involved efforts to quell her expressiveness, gestures and body movements. Susan White, one of the contributing authors in &quot;A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock&quot;, argued that while Bergman was one of his favorite collaborators, she is not the quintessential Hitchcock blonde. She is more like &quot;a resistant and defiant blonde&quot;, in contrast to Grace Kelly type ... more malleable and conformative. For Bergman, the face became a central aspect to her persona. In many of her films, her body is covered up in what are often elaborate costumes; nun&#x27;s habits, doctor&#x27;s coats, soldier&#x27;s armors, and Victorian dresses. The technique of &quot;chiaroscuro&quot;, had been used in many of Bergman&#x27;s films to capture the ambience and the emotional turmoils of her characters through her face. In the case of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, shadows and lighting were used to make her face look thinner. Peter Byrnes of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;Casablanca&quot; is perhaps the world&#x27;s best close-up movie, in which he added, &quot;after the initial set-up, they just keep coming, a series of stunningly emotional close-ups to die for&quot;. Byrnes asserted that these close-ups is the start of the seduction process between Bergman and the audience. He added, &quot;She is so beautiful, and so beautifully lit, that the audience feels they&#x27;ve had their money&#x27;s worth already.&quot; Bergman&#x27;s daughter, Pia Lindstrom felt that her mother gave some of her best acting in her later films once her mother had finally been freed of her youthful, radiant physical beauty.

Dan Callahan, a prominent film writer commented that there is an element of suspense when watching how Bergman, who was a polyglot, emotes, enhanced by her voice and the way she read her lines. He wrote that Bergman was less effective while speaking in French and German, as if she were void of creative energy. Angelica Jade Bastién of Vulture echoed the same sentiment, that Bergman&#x27;s secret weapon is her voice and her accent.

Bergman portrayed women in extra-marital affairs in &quot;Intermezzo&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;, prostitutes in &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; and &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, and a villainess in &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot;. Nonetheless, the public seemed to believe that Bergman&#x27;s off-screen persona was similar to the saintly characters she played in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;. Although the preponderance of &quot;fallen woman&quot; roles did not besmirch Bergman&#x27;s saintly status, the publicized affair with Rossellini resulted in a public sense of betrayal. David O. Selznick testified later, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m responsible for the public&#x27;s image of her as Saint Ingrid. We deliberately built her up as the normal, healthy, unneurotic career woman, devoid of scandal and with an idyllic home life. I guess that backfired later.&quot;

==Legacy==
The news of Bergman&#x27;s death was widely reported across the United States and Europe. Both the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot; printed front page notices. The &quot;New York Post&quot; announcement was in bold red. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Ingrid Bergman, Winner of Three Oscars Is Dead.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; paid its tribute in an article that called her &quot;an actress whose innocent yet provocative beauty made her one of the great stars of stage and screen&quot;.
Bergman was mourned by many, especially her fellow co-stars. They praised her tenacity, spirit, and warmth. Joseph Cotten considered her a great friend and a great actress. Paul Henreid commented, &quot;She was so terribly beautiful in her youth. She was a very strong lady with great desires and emotions and she led a colorful life.&quot; Liv Ullmann said that she would mourn her because &quot;She made me very proud to be a woman,&quot; she added. Leonard Nimoy praised her tenacity and courage. &quot;I developed enormous respect for her as a person and talent. She was a marvelous lady and actress&quot;.

On 30 August 1983, stars, friends and family came to Venice Film Festival to honour the late Bergman on the first anniversary of her death. Among the many guests were Gregory Peck, Walter Matthau, Audrey Hepburn, Roger Moore, Charlton Heston, Prince Albert of Monaco, Claudette Colbert and Olivia de Havilland. They dined, and wined for five days while remembering Bergman and the legacy she left behind.

Despite suffering from cancer for eight years, Bergman continued her career and won international honours for her final roles. &quot;Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage&quot;, added biographer Donald Spoto. Director George Cukor once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, &quot;Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear? I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It makes you a great star.&quot;

Writing about her first years in Hollywood, &quot;Life&quot; stated that &quot;All Bergman vehicles are blessed&quot;, and &quot;they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady&quot;. She was &quot;completely pleased&quot; with her early career&#x27;s management by David O. Selznick, who always found excellent dramatic roles for her to play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, &quot;I am an actress, and I am interested in acting, not in making money.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; adds that &quot;she has greater versatility than any actress on the American screen ... Her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise&quot;.

Biographer Donald Spoto said she was &quot;arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment&quot;. After her American film debut in the film &quot;&quot; (1939), Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style, and without need for make-up. Film critic James Agee wrote that she &quot;not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism&quot;.

Film historian David Thomson, said she &quot;always strove to be a &#x27;true&#x27; woman&quot;, and many filmgoers identified with her:

According to her daughter Isabella Rossellini, her mother had a deep sense of freedom and independence. She then added, &quot;She was able to integrate so many cultures... she is not even American but she is totally part of American culture like she is totally part of the Swedish, Italian, French, European film making.&quot;

Wesleyan University hosts the &quot;Ingrid Bergman Collection&quot; of Bergman&#x27;s personal papers, scripts, awards, portraits, photos, scrapbooks, costumes, legal papers, financial records, stills, clippings and memorabilia.

=== Activism ===

During a 1946 press conference in Washington, D.C. for the promotion of the play &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot;, she protested to the newspapers regarding racial segregation after seeing it first hand at Lisner Auditorium, the theater where she was working. This led to significant publicity and some hate mail. A bust of Bergman has been placed outside the Lisner Auditorium, in recognition of her protest, and as a reminder of the venue&#x27;s segregated past.

Bergman went to Alaska during World War II to entertain US Army troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to Europe for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. She arrived in Paris on 6 June 1945 with Jack Benny, Larry Adler and Martha Tilton where they stayed at The Ritz Hotel. Bergman&#x27;s performance was rather limited; she couldn&#x27;t sing, she couldn&#x27;t play an instrument and she didn&#x27;t have Jack Benny&#x27;s humour. In Kassel, she ran offstage in tears. When they went to see a concentration camp, she stayed behind. After the onset of World War II, Bergman felt guilt for her initial dismissal of the Nazi state in Germany. According to her biographer Charlotte Chandler, she had at first considered the Nazis only a &quot;temporary aberration, &#x27;too foolish to be taken seriously&#x27;. She believed Germany would not start a war.&quot; Bergman felt that &quot;the good people there would not permit it&quot;. Chandler adds that she &quot;felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps&quot;.

===Centennial celebration===

In 2015, to celebrate the Bergman centennial, exhibitions, film screenings, books, documentaries and seminars were presented by various institutions. The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) held a screening of her films, chosen and introduced by her children. AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center presented an extensive retrospective of her Hollywood and Italian films. University of California, Berkeley hosted a lecture, where journalist and film critic, Ulrika Knutson called Bergman &quot;a pioneering feminist&quot;. Toronto International Film Festival continued with &quot;Notorious: Celebrating the Ingrid Bergman Centenary&quot; which featured a series of her best-known films. &quot;Ingrid Bergman at BAM&quot; was screened at Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Rose Cinemas. BAMcinématek presented &quot;Ingrid Bergman Tribute&quot; on 12 September 2015, an event co-hosted by Isabella Rossellini and Jeremy Irons, which featured a live reading by Rossellini and Irons taken from Bergman&#x27;s personal letters. The Plaza Cinema &amp; Media Arts Center in Patchogue, New York held a special screening of Bergman&#x27;s films. Screenings and tributes occurred in other cities; London, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Tokyo and Melbourne. The Bohuslän Museum in Uddevalla, north of Gothenburg opened an exhibition titled &quot;Ingrid Bergman in Fjällbacka&quot;. A pictorial book titled &quot;Ingrid Bergman: A Life in Pictures&quot; was published by the Bergman estate.

&quot;Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words&quot;, is a 2015 Swedish documentary film, directed by Stig Björkman, which was made to celebrate her centennial. It was screened in the Cannes Classics section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a special mention for L&#x27;Œil d&#x27;or. A photograph of Bergman, by David Seymour featured as the main poster at Cannes. The festival described Bergman as a &quot;modern icon, an emancipated woman, an intrepid actress, and a figurehead for the new realism&quot;. The New York Film Festival and The Tokyo International Film Festival also presented the documentary.

At the 2015 Vancouver International Film Festival, the film was chosen as &quot;Most Popular International Documentary&quot;, based on audience balloting. The film &quot;loses no chance to illuminate the independence and courage she showed in her private life&quot;. Although the viewer may pronounce judgement on &quot; Bergman&#x27;s free-wheeling, non-conformist maternal lifestyle, there can be no doubt about her determination and professional commitment.&quot; Ending with her last screen appearance in &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; in 1978, &quot;Bjorkman leaves behind the image of a uniquely strong, independent woman whose relaxed modernity was way ahead of its time.&quot;

To celebrate the same occasion, the U.S. Postal Service and Posten AB of Sweden, jointly issued commemorative stamps in Bergman&#x27;s honor. The stamp art features a circa 1940 image of Bergman taken by László Willinger, with a colorized still of Bergman from &quot;Casablanca&quot; as the selvage photograph. Her daughter, Pia Lindstrom commented, &quot;I think she would be very surprised that she is on a U.S. stamp and I know she would think it is great fun.&quot;

=== Biographical stage plays ===
Bergman was portrayed by her daughter, Isabella Rossellini in &quot;My Dad is 100 years Old&quot; (2005). In 2015, &quot;&#x27;Notorious&quot;&#x27;, a play based on Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; was staged at The Gothenburg Opera. Bergman&#x27;s Italian period has been dramatised on stage in the musical play which is titled, &quot;Camera; The Musical About Ingrid Bergman&quot;. It was written by Jan-Erik Sääf and Staffan Aspegren and performed in Stockholm, Sweden.

=== In popular culture ===

Woody Guthrie composed &quot;Ingrid Bergman&quot;, a song about Bergman in 1950. The lyrics have been described as &quot;erotic&quot;, and make reference to Bergman&#x27;s relationship with Roberto Rossellini, which began during work on the film &quot;Stromboli&quot;. Billy Bragg and Wilco covered the song on their album &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; (1998).

Alfred Hitchcock based his film &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954) (starring James Stewart as a &quot;Life&quot; wartime photographer) on Bergman and Capa&#x27;s romance.

In 1984, a hybrid tea rose breed was named &quot;Ingrid Bergman&quot;, in honor of the star.

Her portrayal of Ilsa Lund from &quot;Casablanca&quot; was parodied by Kate McKinnon in one episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In the opening montage of the 72nd Academy Awards, Billy Crystal, as Victor Laszlo, made a parody out of &quot;Casablanca&#x27;s&quot; final scene. In the &#x27;80s, Warner Bros made &quot;&#x27;Carrotblanca&quot;&#x27; as a homage to Bogart and Bergman&#x27;s character in &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; (1989), &quot;Casablanca&quot; is a recurring theme, with the lead characters arguing over the meaning of its ending throughout the film. Bogart and Bergman also appeared in Tesco&#x27;s Clubcard advertisement (2019).

To help educate and inform about the importance of mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic, WarnerMedia, the Ad Council, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), released a video featuring Bogart and Bergman in a scene from &quot;Casablanca&quot; wearing masks.

In one scene from &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1981)&quot;,&quot; with some creative editing, Steve Martin&#x27;s character is having a conversation with Alicia Huberman from &quot;Notorious&quot;. In one scene from the movie &quot;Lake House&quot; (2006), Sandra Bullock&#x27;s character is seen to be watching the kiss scene from &quot;Notorious&quot;. The kiss scene between Bergman and Spencer Tracy from &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; is featured in the &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; (1989) closing montage. Bergman&#x27;s Sister Benedict is referenced in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). There is one episode in the second season of &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;, which is titled &quot;Here&#x27;s a Little Known Ingrid Bergman Incident&quot;.

Bergman&#x27;s Ilsa also inspired the character Ilsa Faust, played by Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson, in the film series. Ferguson was told by costar Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie to review &quot;Notorious&quot; and other of Bergman&#x27;s films as preparation for her role.
In the movie &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016), the lead female character has a poster of Bergman on her bedroom wall. Near the end of the movie, another poster of Bergman can be seen by the side of a road. One of the original soundtracks for the film is named &#x27;Bogart and Bergman.&#x27;

Bergman&#x27;s publicity photo from &quot;Notorious&quot; was used as the front cover of the book by Dan Callahan, &quot;The Camera Lies: Acting for Hitchcock&quot; (2020). Bergman&#x27;s love affair with Robert Capa has been dramatised in a 2012 novel by Chris Greenhalgh, &quot;Seducing Ingrid Bergman&quot;. Bergman is also referenced in Donald Trump&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;&quot;, and in &quot;Small Fry&quot;, a memoir by Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter of Steve Jobs.

As part of its dedication to the female icons of Italian cinema, Bergman was immortalised in a mural on a public staircase off Via Fiamignano near Rome. A mural of her image from &quot;Casablanca&quot; was painted on the outdoor cinema wall in Fremont, Seattle. The Dutch National Airline named one of their planes &quot;Ingrid Bergman&quot; in the 2010s. She has a wax figure of her displayed at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s, Hollywood, California. In Fjällbacka, off the coast of Sweden, a square was named as Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s Square to honor her memory. A wooden mould of Bergman&#x27;s feet is on display at Salvatore Ferragamo Museum in Florence, Italy.

<text>A polarential telegraph system is a direct-current telegraph system employing polar transmission in one direction and a form of differential duplex transmission in the other. 

Two types of polarential systems, known as types A and B, are in use. In half-duplex operation of a type A polarential system, the direct-current balance is independent of line resistance. In half-duplex operation of a type B polarential system, the direct current is substantially independent of the line leakage. Type A is better for cable loops where leakage is negligible but resistance varies with temperature. Type B is considered better for open wire where variable line leakage is frequent.

<doc id="41564" wikidata="Q193760" url="?curid=41564" title="Polarization (waves)">
<text>&#x27; (also &#x27;) is a property of transverse waves which specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations. In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave. One example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string &quot;(see image)&quot;, for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids.

An electromagnetic wave such as light consists of a coupled oscillating electric field and magnetic field which are always perpendicular to each other. Different states of polarization correspond to different relationships between polarization and the direction of propagation. In linear polarization, the fields oscillate in a single direction. In circular or elliptical polarization, the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels, either in the right-hand or in the left-hand direction.

Light or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and incandescent lamps, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called &quot;unpolarized light&quot;. Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a polarizer, which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. The most common optical materials do not affect the polarization of light, but some materials—those that exhibit birefringence, dichroism, or optical activity—affect light differently depending on its polarization. Some of these are used to make polarizing filters. Light also becomes partially polarized when it reflects at an angle from a surface.

According to quantum mechanics, electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called photons. When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their spin. A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized electromagnetic waves are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand. Linearly polarized waves consist of photons that are in a superposition of right and left circularly polarized states, with equal amplitude and phases synchronized to give oscillation in a plane.

Polarization is an important parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as optics, seismology, radio, and microwaves. Especially impacted are technologies such as lasers, wireless and optical fiber telecommunications, and radar.

== Introduction ==


=== Wave propagation and polarization ===

Most sources of light are classified as incoherent and unpolarized (or only &quot;partially polarized&quot;) because they consist of a random mixture of waves having different spatial characteristics, frequencies (wavelengths), phases, and polarization states. However, for understanding electromagnetic waves and polarization in particular, it is easier to just consider coherent plane waves; these are sinusoidal waves of one particular direction (or wavevector), frequency, phase, and polarization state. Characterizing an optical system in relation to a plane wave with those given parameters can then be used to predict its response to a more general case, since a wave with any specified spatial structure can be decomposed into a combination of plane waves (its so-called angular spectrum). Incoherent states can be modeled stochastically as a weighted combination of such uncorrelated waves with some distribution of frequencies (its &quot;spectrum&quot;), phases, and polarizations.

==== Transverse electromagnetic waves ====
Electromagnetic waves (such as light), traveling in free space or another homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, are properly described as transverse waves, meaning that a plane wave&#x27;s electric field vector and magnetic field are each in some direction perpendicular to (or &quot;transverse&quot; to) the direction of wave propagation; and are also perpendicular to each other. By convention, the &quot;polarization&quot; direction of an electromagnetic wave is given by its electric field vector. Considering a monochromatic plane wave of optical frequency (light of vacuum wavelength has a frequency of where is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the axis. Being a transverse wave the and fields must then contain components only in the and directions whereas . Using complex (or phasor) notation, the instantaneous physical electric and magnetic fields are given by the real parts of the complex quantities occurring in the following equations. As a function of time and spatial position (since for a plane wave in the direction the fields have no dependence on or ) these complex fields can be written as:
formula_1
and
formula_2
where is the wavelength (whose refractive index is ) and is the period of the wave. Here , , , and are complex numbers. In the second more compact form, as these equations are customarily expressed, these factors are described using the wavenumber and angular frequency (or &quot;radian frequency&quot;) . In a more general formulation with propagation restricted to the direction, then the spatial dependence is replaced by where is called the wave vector, the magnitude of which is the wavenumber.

Thus the leading vectors and each contain up to two nonzero (complex) components describing the amplitude and phase of the wave&#x27;s and polarization components (again, there can be no polarization component for a transverse wave in the direction). For a given medium with a characteristic impedance , is related to by:
formula_3

In a dielectric, is real and has the value , where is the refractive index and is the impedance of free space. The impedance will be complex in a conducting medium. Note that given that relationship, the dot product of and must be zero:
formula_4
indicating that these vectors are orthogonal (at right angles to each other), as expected.

Knowing the propagation direction ( in this case) and , one can just as well specify the wave in terms of just and describing the electric field. The vector containing and (but without the component which is necessarily zero for a transverse wave) is known as a Jones vector. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the intensity of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components:
formula_5

However, the wave&#x27;s &quot;state of polarization&quot; is only dependent on the (complex) ratio of to . So let us just consider waves whose ; this happens to correspond to an intensity of about in free space (where ). And because the absolute phase of a wave is unimportant in discussing its polarization state, let us stipulate that the phase of is zero; in other words is a real number while may be complex. Under these restrictions, and can be represented as follows:
formula_6
where the polarization state is now fully parameterized by the value of (such that ) and the relative phase .

==== Non-transverse waves ====
In addition to transverse waves, there are many wave motions where the oscillation is not limited to directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), but one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.

Just considering electromagnetic waves, we note that the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an anisotropic medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the electric displacement and magnetic flux density still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the electric susceptibility (or in the magnetic permeability), now given by a tensor, the direction of (or ) may differ from that of (or ). Even in isotropic media, so-called inhomogeneous waves can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or &quot;extinction coefficient&quot;) such as metals; these fields are also not strictly transverse. Surface waves or waves propagating in a waveguide (such as an optical fiber) are generally transverse waves, but might be described as an electric or magnetic transverse mode, or a hybrid mode.

Even in free space, longitudinal field components can be generated in focal regions, where the plane wave approximation breaks down. An extreme example is radially or tangentially polarized light, at the focus of which the electric or magnetic field respectively is longitudinal (along the direction of propagation).

For longitudinal waves such as sound waves in fluids, the direction of oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is normally not even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk solid can be transverse as well as longitudinal, for a total of three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the shear stress and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in seismology.

== Polarization state ==
Polarization can be defined in terms of pure polarization states with only a coherent sinusoidal wave at one optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically times faster). The field oscillates in the -plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the direction, perpendicular to the page.
The first two diagrams below trace the electric field vector over a complete cycle for linear polarization at two different orientations; these are each considered a distinct &quot;state of polarization&quot; (SOP). The linear polarization at 45° can also be viewed as the addition of a horizontally linearly polarized wave (as in the leftmost figure) and a vertically polarized wave of the same amplitude .







Now if one were to introduce a phase shift in between those horizontal and vertical polarization components, one would generally obtain elliptical polarization as is shown in the third figure. When the phase shift is exactly ±90°, and the amplitudes are the same, then circular polarization is produced (fourth and fifth figures). Circular polarization can be created by sending linearly polarized light through a quarter-wave plate oriented at 45° to the linear polarization to create two components of the same amplitude with the required phase shift. The superposition of the original and phase-shifted components causes a rotating electric field vector, which is depicted in the animation on the right. Note that circular or elliptical polarization can involve either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the field, depending on the relative phases of the components. These correspond to distinct polarization states, such as the two circular polarizations shown above.

The orientation of the and axes used in this description is arbitrary. The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the polarization ellipse in terms of the and polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those basis polarizations. Axes are selected to suit a particular problem, such as being in the plane of incidence. Since there are separate reflection coefficients for the linear polarizations in and orthogonal to the plane of incidence (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; polarizations, see below), that choice greatly simplifies the calculation of a wave&#x27;s reflection from a surface.

Any pair of orthogonal polarization states may be used as basis functions, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.

=== Polarization ellipse ===
For a purely polarized monochromatic wave the electric field vector over one cycle of oscillation traces out an ellipse.
A polarization state can then be described in relation to the geometrical parameters of the ellipse, and its &quot;handedness&quot;, that is, whether the rotation around the ellipse is clockwise or counter clockwise. One parameterization of the elliptical figure specifies the orientation angle , defined as the angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the -axis along with the ellipticity , the ratio of the ellipse&#x27;s major to minor axis. (also known as the axial ratio). The ellipticity parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse&#x27;s eccentricity formula_7 or the ellipticity angle, formula_8 formula_9 as is shown in the figure. The angle is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to . The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity of infinity and unity (or of zero and 45°) respectively.

=== Jones vector ===

Full information on a completely polarized state is also provided by the amplitude and phase of oscillations in two components of the electric field vector in the plane of polarization. This representation was used above to show how different states of polarization are possible. The amplitude and phase information can be conveniently represented as a two-dimensional complex vector (the Jones vector):

formula_10

Here and denote the amplitude of the wave in the two components of the electric field vector, while and represent the phases. The product of a Jones vector with a complex number of unit modulus gives a different Jones vector representing the same ellipse, and thus the same state of polarization. The physical electric field, as the real part of the Jones vector, would be altered but the polarization state itself is independent of absolute phase. The basis vectors used to represent the Jones vector need not represent linear polarization states (i.e. be real). In general any two orthogonal states can be used, where an orthogonal vector pair is formally defined as one having a zero inner product. A common choice is left and right circular polarizations, for example to model the different propagation of waves in two such components in circularly birefringent media (see below) or signal paths of coherent detectors sensitive to circular polarization.

=== Coordinate frame ===
Regardless of whether polarization state is represented using geometric parameters or Jones vectors, implicit in the parameterization is the orientation of the coordinate frame. This permits a degree of freedom, namely rotation about the propagation direction. When considering light that is propagating parallel to the surface of the Earth, the terms &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; polarization are often used, with the former being associated with the first component of the Jones vector, or zero azimuth angle. On the other hand, in astronomy the equatorial coordinate system is generally used instead, with the zero azimuth (or position angle, as it is more commonly called in astronomy to avoid confusion with the horizontal coordinate system) corresponding to due north.

==== &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; designations ====


Another coordinate system frequently used relates to the &quot;plane of incidence&quot;. This is the plane made by the incoming propagation direction and the vector perpendicular to the plane of an interface, in other words, the plane in which the ray travels before and after reflection or refraction. The component of the electric field parallel to this plane is termed &quot;p-like&quot; (parallel) and the component perpendicular to this plane is termed &quot;s-like&quot; (from , German for &#x27;perpendicular&#x27;). Polarized light with its electric field along the plane of incidence is thus denoted &#x27;, while light whose electric field is normal to the plane of incidence is called &#x27;. &quot;P&quot;-polarization is commonly referred to as &quot;transverse-magnetic&quot; (TM), and has also been termed &quot;pi-polarized&quot; or &quot;-polarized&quot;, or &quot;tangential plane polarized&quot;. &quot;S&quot;-polarization is also called &quot;transverse-electric&quot; (TE), as well as &quot;sigma-polarized&quot; or &quot;σ-polarized&quot;, or &quot;sagittal plane polarized&quot;.

=== Degree of polarization ===
Degree of polarization (DOP) is a quantity used to describe the portion of an electromagnetic wave which is polarized. can be calculated from the Stokes parameters. A perfectly polarized wave has a of 100%, whereas an unpolarized wave has a of 0%. A wave which is partially polarized, and therefore can be represented by a superposition of a polarized and unpolarized component, will have a somewhere in between 0 and 100%. is calculated as the fraction of the total power that is carried by the polarized component of the wave.

 can be used to map the strain field in materials when considering the of the photoluminescence. The polarization of the photoluminescence is related to the strain in a material by way of the given material&#x27;s photoelasticity tensor.

 is also visualized using the Poincaré sphere representation of a polarized beam. In this representation, is equal to the length of the vector measured from the center of the sphere.

=== Unpolarized and partially polarized light ===
== Implications for reflection and propagation ==

=== Polarization in wave propagation ===

In a vacuum, the components of the electric field propagate at the speed of light, so that the phase of the wave varies in space and time while the polarization state does not. That is, the electric field vector of a plane wave in the direction follows:
formula_11

where is the wavenumber. As noted above, the instantaneous electric field is the real part of the product of the Jones vector times the phase factor When an electromagnetic wave interacts with matter, its propagation is altered according to the material&#x27;s (complex) index of refraction. When the real or imaginary part of that refractive index is dependent on the polarization state of a wave, properties known as birefringence and polarization dichroism (or diattenuation) respectively, then the polarization state of a wave will generally be altered.

In such media, an electromagnetic wave with any given state of polarization may be decomposed into two orthogonally polarized components that encounter different propagation constants. The effect of propagation over a given path on those two components is most easily characterized in the form of a complex transformation matrix known as a Jones matrix:
formula_12

The Jones matrix due to passage through a transparent material is dependent on the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be dispersive, that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar phase factor and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.

For propagation effects in two orthogonal modes, the Jones matrix can be written as
formula_13

where and are complex numbers describing the phase delay and possibly the amplitude attenuation due to propagation in each of the two polarization eigenmodes. is a unitary matrix representing a change of basis from these propagation modes to the linear system used for the Jones vectors; in the case of linear birefringence or diattenuation the modes are themselves linear polarization states so and can be omitted if the coordinate axes have been chosen appropriately.

==== Birefringence ====
In a birefringent substance, electromagnetic waves of different polarizations travel at different speeds (phase velocities). As a result, when unpolarized waves travel through a plate of birefringent material, one polarization component has a shorter wavelength than the other, resulting in a phase difference between the components which increases the further the waves travel through the material. The Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: . Media termed diattenuating (or &quot;dichroic&quot; in the sense of polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a Hermitian matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.
In birefringent media there is no attenuation, but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical wave plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change, its polarization direction is identical to one of those basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength-dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.

Circular birefringence is also termed optical activity, especially in chiral fluids, or Faraday rotation, when due to the presence of a magnetic field along the direction of propagation. When linearly polarized light is passed through such an object, it will exit still linearly polarized, but with the axis of polarization rotated. A combination of linear and circular birefringence will have as basis polarizations two orthogonal elliptical polarizations; however, the term &quot;elliptical birefringence&quot; is rarely used.

One can visualize the case of linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally back to the original linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.

==== Dichroism ====
Media in which transmission of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called &quot;dichroic&quot; or &quot;diattenuating&quot;. Like birefringence, diattenuation can be with respect to linear polarization modes (in a crystal) or circular polarization modes (usually in a liquid).

Devices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode are known as &quot;&quot; or simply &quot;polarizers&quot;. This corresponds to in the above representation of the Jones matrix. The output of an ideal polarizer is a specific polarization state (usually linear polarization) with an amplitude equal to the input wave&#x27;s original amplitude in that polarization mode. Power in the other polarization mode is eliminated. Thus if unpolarized light is passed through an ideal polarizer (where and ) exactly half of its initial power is retained. Practical polarizers, especially inexpensive sheet polarizers, have additional loss so that . However, in many instances the more relevant figure of merit is the polarizer&#x27;s degree of polarization or extinction ratio, which involve a comparison of to . Since Jones vectors refer to waves&#x27; amplitudes (rather than intensity), when illuminated by unpolarized light the remaining power in the unwanted polarization will be of the power in the intended polarization.

=== Specular reflection ===
In addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects describable using Jones matrices can also occur at (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected; for a given material those proportions (and also the phase of reflection) are dependent on the angle of incidence and are different for the &quot;s&quot;- and &quot;p&quot;-polarizations. Therefore, the polarization state of reflected light (even if initially unpolarized) is generally changed.
Any light striking a surface at a special angle of incidence known as Brewster&#x27;s angle, where the reflection coefficient for &quot;p&quot;-polarization is zero, will be reflected with only the &quot;s&quot;-polarization remaining. This principle is employed in the so-called &quot;pile of plates polarizer&quot; (see figure) in which part of the &quot;s&quot;-polarization is removed by reflection at each Brewster angle surface, leaving only the &quot;p&quot;-polarization after transmission through many such surfaces. The generally smaller reflection coefficient of the &quot;p&quot;-polarization is also the basis of polarized sunglasses; by blocking the &quot;s&quot;- (horizontal) polarization, most of the glare due to reflection from a wet street, for instance, is removed.

In the important special case of reflection at normal incidence (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular &quot;s&quot;- or &quot;p&quot;-polarization. Both the and polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical to that of the incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by convention this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the axes called &quot;right-handed&quot; for a wave in the direction is &quot;left-handed&quot; for a wave in the direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the &quot;s&quot;- and &quot;p&quot;-polarization components.

== Measurement techniques involving polarization ==
Some optical measurement techniques are based on polarization. In many other optical techniques polarization is crucial or at least must be taken into account and controlled; such examples are too numerous to mention.

=== Measurement of stress ===

In engineering, the phenomenon of stress induced birefringence allows for stresses in transparent materials to be readily observed. As noted above and seen in the accompanying photograph, the chromaticity of birefringence typically creates colored patterns when viewed in between two polarizers. As external forces are applied, internal stress induced in the material is thereby observed. Additionally, birefringence is frequently observed due to stresses &quot;frozen in&quot; at the time of manufacture. This is famously observed in cellophane tape whose birefringence is due to the stretching of the material during the manufacturing process.

=== Ellipsometry ===

Ellipsometry is a powerful technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following specular reflection from such a surface. This is typically done as a function of incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since ellipsometry relies on reflection, it is not required for the sample to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.

Ellipsometry can be used to model the (complex) refractive index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.

=== Geology ===

The property of (linear) birefringence is widespread in crystalline minerals, and indeed was pivotal in the initial discovery of polarization. In mineralogy, this property is frequently exploited using polarization microscopes, for the purpose of identifying minerals. See optical mineralogy for more details.

Sound waves in solid materials exhibit polarization. Differential propagation of the three polarizations through the earth is a crucial in the field of seismology. Horizontally and vertically polarized seismic waves (shear waves) are termed SH and SV, while waves with longitudinal polarization (compressional waves) are termed P-waves.

=== Autopsy ===
Similarly, polarization microscopes can be used to aid in the detection of foreign matter in biological tissue slices if it is birefringent; autopsies often mention (a lack of or presence of) &quot;polarizable foreign debris.&quot;

=== Chemistry ===
We have seen (above) that the birefringence of a type of crystal is useful in identifying it, and thus detection of linear birefringence is especially useful in geology and mineralogy. Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, as seen in the photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, but there may be circular birefringence when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed enantiomers of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called racemic mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for organic molecules, a net circular birefringence (or &quot;optical activity&quot;) is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a polarimeter in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, at the end of which is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.

=== Astronomy ===

In many areas of astronomy, the study of polarized electromagnetic radiation from outer space is of great importance. Although not usually a factor in the thermal radiation of stars, polarization is also present in radiation from coherent astronomical sources (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol masers), and incoherent sources such as the large radio lobes in active galaxies, and pulsar radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent), and is also imposed upon starlight by scattering from interstellar dust. Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar magnetic field via Faraday rotation. The polarization of the cosmic microwave background is being used to study the physics of the very early universe. Synchrotron radiation is inherently polarized. It has been suggested that astronomical sources caused the chirality of biological molecules on Earth, but chirality selection on inorganic crystals has been proposed as an alternative theory.

== Applications and examples ==

=== Polarized sunglasses ===
Unpolarized light, after being reflected by a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains a degree of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in the early 1800s by the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus, after whom Malus&#x27;s law is named. Polarizing sunglasses exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the road ahead viewed at a grazing angle.

Wearers of polarized sunglasses will occasionally observe inadvertent polarization effects such as color-dependent birefringent effects, for example in toughened glass (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent plastics, in conjunction with natural polarization by reflection or scattering. The polarized light from LCD monitors (see below) is extremely conspicuous when these are worn.

=== Sky polarization and photography ===

Polarization is observed in the light of the sky, as this is due to sunlight scattered by aerosols as it passes through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is most strongly observed at points on the sky making a 90° angle to the Sun. Polarizing filters use these effects to optimize the results of photographing scenes in which reflection or scattering by the sky is involved.
Sky polarization has been used for orientation in navigation. The Pfund sky compass was used in the 1950s when navigating near the poles of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field when neither the sun nor stars were visible (e.g., under daytime cloud or twilight). It has been suggested, controversially, that the Vikings exploited a similar device (the &quot;sunstone&quot;) in their extensive expeditions across the North Atlantic in the 9th–11th centuries, before the arrival of the magnetic compass from Asia to Europe in the 12th century. Related to the sky compass is the &quot;polar clock&quot;, invented by Charles Wheatstone in the late 19th century.

=== Display technologies ===
The principle of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology relies on the rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used in the vast majority of televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.

In a totally different sense, polarization encoding has become the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images to the left and right eye in stereoscopic displays used for 3D movies. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). Polarized 3D glasses with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However, circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from RealD. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as silver screens); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.

Although now obsolete, CRT computer displays suffered from reflection by the glass envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter in front of the screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave &quot;left&quot; circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is &quot;blocked&quot; by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However, the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.

=== Radio transmission and reception ===
All radio (and microwave) antennas used for transmitting or receiving are intrinsically polarized. They transmit in (or receive signals from) a particular polarization, being totally insensitive to the opposite polarization; in certain cases that polarization is a function of direction. Most antennas are nominally linearly polarized, but elliptical and circular polarization is a possibility. In the case of linear polarization, the same kind of filtering as described above, is possible. In the case of elliptical polarization (circular polarization is in reality just a kind of elliptical polarization where the length of both elasticity factors is the same), filtering out a single angle (e.g. 90°) will have virtually no impact as the wave at any time can be in any of the 360 degrees.

The vast majority of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can &quot;only&quot; have its polarization in the direction of that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna&#x27;s polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical &quot;whip antenna&quot; or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the &quot;axial mode&quot; (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.

Polarization is important in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in satellite television in order to double the channel capacity over a fixed frequency band. The same frequency channel can be used for two signals broadcast in opposite polarizations. By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.

Especially due to the presence of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.

The effect of free electrons in the ionosphere, in conjunction with the earth&#x27;s magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However, medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave&#x27;s path through the ionosphere and the earth&#x27;s magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.
=== Polarization and vision ===
Many animals are capable of perceiving some of the components of the polarization of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear polarization of sky light is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun. This ability is very common among the insects, including bees, which use this information to orient their communicative dances. Polarization sensitivity has also been observed in species of octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and mantis shrimp. In the latter case, one species measures all six orthogonal components of polarization, and is believed to have optimal polarization vision. The rapidly changing, vividly colored skin patterns of cuttlefish, used for communication, also incorporate polarization patterns, and mantis shrimp are known to have polarization selective reflective tissue. Sky polarization was thought to be perceived by pigeons, which was assumed to be one of their aids in homing, but research indicates this is a popular myth.

The naked human eye is weakly sensitive to polarization, without the need for intervening filters. Polarized light creates a very faint pattern near the center of the visual field, called Haidinger&#x27;s brush. This pattern is very difficult to see, but with practice one can learn to detect polarized light with the naked eye.

=== Angular momentum using circular polarization ===
It is well known that electromagnetic radiation carries a certain linear momentum in the direction of propagation. In addition, however, light carries a certain angular momentum if it is circularly polarized (or partially so). In comparison with lower frequencies such as microwaves, the amount of angular momentum in light, even of pure circular polarization, compared to the same wave&#x27;s linear momentum (or radiation pressure) is very small and difficult to even measure. However, it was utilized in an experiment to achieve speeds of up to 600 million revolutions per minute.

<doc id="41565" wikidata="Q7209154" url="?curid=41565" title="Polarization-maintaining optical fiber">
<text>In fiber optics, polarization-maintaining optical fiber (PMF or PM fiber) is a single-mode optical fiber in which linearly polarized light, if properly launched into the fiber, maintains a linear polarization during propagation, exiting the fiber in a specific linear polarization state; there is little or no cross-coupling of optical power between the two polarization modes. Such fiber is used in special applications where preserving polarization is essential.

==Polarization crosstalk==
In an ordinary (non-polarization-maintaining) fiber, two polarization modes (say vertical and horizontal polarization) have the same nominal phase velocity due to the fiber&#x27;s circular symmetry. However tiny amounts of random birefringence in such a fiber, or bending in the fiber, will cause a tiny amount of crosstalk from the vertical to the horizontal polarization mode. And since even a short portion of fiber, over which a tiny coupling coefficient may apply, is many thousands of wavelengths long, even that small coupling between the two polarization modes, applied coherently, can lead to a large power transfer to the horizontal mode, completely changing the wave&#x27;s net state of polarization. Since that coupling coefficient was unintended and a result of arbitrary stress or bending applied to fiber, the output state of polarization will itself be random, and will vary as those stresses or bends vary; it will also vary with wavelength. 

==Principle of operation==
Polarization-maintaining fibers work by &quot;intentionally&quot; introducing a systematic linear birefringence in the fiber, so that there are two well defined polarization modes which propagate along the fiber with very distinct phase velocities. The beat length Lb of such a fiber (for a particular wavelength) is the distance (typically a few millimeters) over which the wave in one mode will experience an additional delay of one wavelength compared to the other polarization mode. Thus a length Lb /2 of such fiber is equivalent to a half-wave plate. Now consider that there might be a random coupling between the two polarization states over a significant length of such fiber. At point 0 along the fiber, the wave in polarization mode 1 induces an amplitude into mode 2 at some phase. However at point 1/2 Lb along the fiber, the same coupling coefficient between the polarization modes induces an amplitude into mode 2 which is now 180 degrees &quot;out of phase&quot; with the wave coupled at point zero, leading to cancellation. At point Lb along the fiber the coupling is again in the original phase, but at 3/2 Lb it is again out of phase and so on. The possibility of coherent addition of wave amplitudes through crosstalk over distances much larger than Lb is thus eliminated. Most of the wave&#x27;s power remains in the original polarization mode, and exits the fiber in that mode&#x27;s polarization as it is oriented at the fiber end. Optical fiber connectors used for PM fibers are specially keyed so that the two polarization modes are aligned and exit in a specific orientation.

Note that a polarization-maintaining fiber does not polarize light as a polarizer does. Rather, PM fiber maintains the linear polarization of linearly polarized light provided that it is launched into the fiber aligned with one of the fiber&#x27;s polarization modes. Launching linearly polarized light into the fiber at a different angle will excite both polarization modes, conducting the same wave at slightly different phase velocities. At most points along the fiber the net polarization will be an elliptically polarized state, with a return to the original polarization state after an integer number of beat lengths. Consequently, if visible laser light is launched into the fiber exciting both polarization modes, scattering of propagating light viewed from the side, is observed with a light and dark pattern periodic over each beat length, since scattering is preferentially perpendicular to the polarization direction.

==Designs==

Several different designs are used to create birefringence in a fiber. The fiber may be geometrically asymmetric or have a refractive index profile which is asymmetric such as the design using an elliptical cladding as shown in the diagram. Alternatively, stress permanently induced in the fiber will produce stress birefringence; this may be accomplished using rods of another material included within the cladding. Several different shapes of rod are used, and the resulting fiber is sold under brand names such as &quot;PANDA&quot; and &quot;Bow-tie&quot;. (&quot;PANDA&quot; refers to the resemblance of the fiber&#x27;s cross-section to the face of a panda, and is also an acronym for &quot;Polarization-maintaining AND Absorption-reducing&quot;.) 

It is possible to create a circularly birefringent optical fiber just using an ordinary (circularly symmetric) single-mode fiber and twisting it, thus creating internal torsional stress. That causes the phase velocity of right and left hand circular polarizations to significantly differ. Thus the two circular polarizations propagate with little crosstalk in between them

==Applications==
Polarization-maintaining optical fibers are used in special applications, such as in fiber optic sensing, interferometry and quantum key distribution. They are also commonly used in telecommunications for the connection between a source laser and a modulator, since the modulator requires polarized light as input. They are rarely used for long-distance transmission, because PM fiber is expensive and has higher attenuation than single-mode fiber. Another important application is fiber-optic gyroscopes, which are widely used in the aerospace industry. 

The output of a PM fiber is typically characterized by its polarization extinction ratio (PER)—the ratio of correctly to incorrectly polarized light, expressed in decibels. The quality of PM patchcords and pigtails can be characterized with a PER meter. Good PM fibers have extinction ratios in excess of 20 dB.

<text>In electrical engineering, the power factor of an AC power system is defined as the ratio of the &quot;real power&quot; absorbed by the load to the &quot;apparent power&quot; flowing in the circuit. Real power is the average of the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the electricity for performing work. Apparent power is the product of root mean square (RMS) current and voltage. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power may be greater than the real power, so more current flows in the circuit than would be required to transfer real power alone. A power factor magnitude of less than one indicates the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the average product of the two. A negative power factor occurs when the device (normally the load) generates real power, which then flows back towards the source.

In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The larger currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers with a low power factor.

Power-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loads, such as rectifiers, distort the current drawn from the system. In such cases, active or passive power factor correction may be used to counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central substation, spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.

==General case==

The general expression for power factor is given by

:formula_1
:formula_2

where formula_3 is the real power measured by an ideal wattmeter, formula_4 is the rms current measured by an ideal ammeter, and formula_5 is the rms voltage measured by an ideal voltmeter. Apparent power, formula_6, is the product of the rms current and the rms voltage.

If the load is sourcing power back toward the generator, then formula_3 and formula_8 will be negative.

===Periodic waveforms===
If the waveforms are periodic with the same fundamental period, then the power factor can be computed by the following

:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14 
:formula_15

where formula_16 is the instantaneous current, formula_17 is the instantaneous voltage, formula_18 is an arbitrary starting time, and formula_19 is the period of the waveforms.

===Nonperiodic waveforms===

If the waveforms are not periodic and the physical meters have the same averaging time, then the equations for the periodic case can be used with the exception that formula_19 is the averaging time of the meters instead of the waveform period.

== Linear circuits ==

In a linear circuit, consisting of combinations of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, current flow has a sinusoidal response to the sinusoidal line voltage. A linear load does not change the shape of the input waveform but may change the relative timing (phase) between voltage and current, due to its inductance or capacitance.

In a purely resistive AC circuit, voltage and current waveforms are in step (or in phase), changing polarity at the same instant in each cycle. All the power entering the load is consumed (or dissipated).

Where reactive loads are present, such as with capacitors or inductors, energy storage in the loads results in a phase difference between the current and voltage waveforms. During each cycle of the AC voltage, extra energy, in addition to any energy consumed in the load, is temporarily stored in the load in electric or magnetic fields then returned to the power grid a fraction of the period later.

Electrical circuits containing predominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, devices using heating elements like electric toasters and ovens) have a power factor of almost 1, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, solenoid valves, transformers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and others) can have a power factor well below 1.

A circuit with a low power factor will use a greater amount of current to transfer a given quantity of real power than a circuit with a high power factor thus causing increased losses due to resistive heating in power lines, and requiring the use of higher-rated conductors and transformers.

=== Definition and calculation ===
AC power has two components:
* Real power or active power (formula_3) (sometimes called average power), expressed in watts (W)
* Reactive power (formula_22), usually expressed in reactive volt-amperes (var)

Together, they form the complex power (formula_23) expressed as volt-amperes (VA). The magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power (formula_24), also expressed in volt-amperes (VA).

The VA and var are non-SI units dimensionally similar to the watt but are used in engineering practice instead of the watt to state what quantity is being expressed. The SI explicitly disallows using units for this purpose or as the only source of information about a physical quantity as used.

The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. As power is transferred along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called apparent power. The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total apparent power flowing in the line.

The power factor can also be computed as the cosine of the angle θ by which the current waveform lags or leads the voltage waveform.

==== Power triangle ====
One can relate the various components of AC power by using the power triangle in vector space. Real power extends horizontally in the real axis and reactive power extends in the direction of the imaginary axis. Complex power (and its magnitude, apparent power) represents a combination of both real and reactive power, and therefore can be calculated by using the vector sum of these two components. We can conclude that the mathematical relationship between these components is:

:formula_25

As the angle θ increases with fixed total apparent power, current and voltage are further out of phase with each other. Real power decreases, and reactive power increases.

==== Lagging, leading and unity power factors ====
Power factor is described as &quot;leading&quot; if the current waveform is advanced in phase concerning voltage, or &quot;lagging&quot; when the current waveform is behind the voltage waveform. A lagging power factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will &quot;consume&quot; reactive power. The reactive component formula_22 is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is &quot;consumed&quot; by the inductive load. A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load &quot;supplies&quot; reactive power, and therefore the reactive component formula_22 is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.

If θ is the phase angle between the current and voltage, then the power factor is equal to the cosine of the angle, formula_28:
:formula_29

Since the units are consistent, the power factor is by definition a dimensionless number between -1 and 1. When the power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive, and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, referred to as the &quot;unity&quot; power factor, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the load. Power factors are usually stated as &quot;leading&quot; or &quot;lagging&quot; to show the sign of the phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and inductive loads are lagging (current lags voltage).

If a purely resistive load is connected to a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cables generate reactive power with the current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device&#x27;s magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source during the rest of the cycle.

For example, to get 1 kW of real power, if the power factor is unity, 1 kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1 kW ÷ 1 = 1 kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs to be transferred to get the same real power. To get 1 kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5 kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1 kW ÷ 0.2 = 5 kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load and is subject to losses in the production and transmission processes.

Electrical loads consuming alternating current power consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive power is the complex power, and its magnitude is the apparent power. The presence of reactive power causes the real power to be less than the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.

A negative power factor (0 to −1) can result from returning active power to the source, such as in the case of a building fitted with solar panels when surplus power is fed back into the supply.

=== Power factor correction of linear loads ===

A high power factor is generally desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an electric power transmission utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor to reduce costs.

Power factor correction brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act to cancel the inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power to meet the demand of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow from the utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power, and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.

The reactive elements in power factor correction devices can create voltage fluctuations and harmonic noise when switched on or off. They will supply or sink reactive power regardless of whether there is a corresponding load operating nearby, increasing the system&#x27;s no-load losses. In the worst case, reactive elements can interact with the system and with each other to create resonant conditions, resulting in system instability and severe overvoltage fluctuations. As such, reactive elements cannot simply be applied without engineering analysis.

An automatic power factor correction unit consists of some capacitors that are switched by means of contactors. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures power factor in an electrical network. Depending on the load and power factor of the network, the power factor controller will switch the necessary blocks of capacitors in steps to make sure the power factor stays above a selected value.

In place of a set of switched capacitors, an unloaded synchronous motor can supply reactive power. The reactive power drawn by the synchronous motor is a function of its field excitation. It is referred to as a synchronous condenser. It is started and connected to the electrical network. It operates at a leading power factor and puts vars onto the network as required to support a system&#x27;s voltage or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.

The synchronous condenser&#x27;s installation and operation are identical to those of large electric motors. Its principal advantage is the ease with which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a variable capacitor. Unlike with capacitors, the amount of reactive power furnished is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks. Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with high-voltage direct-current transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as steel mills.

For power factor correction of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic devices such as the static VAR compensator or STATCOM are increasingly used. These systems are able to compensate sudden changes of power factor much more rapidly than contactor-switched capacitor banks and, being solid-state, require less maintenance than synchronous condensers.

== Non-linear loads ==
Examples of non-linear loads on a power system are rectifiers (such as used in a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as fluorescent lamps, electric welding machines, or arc furnaces. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. &quot;Distortion power factor&quot; is a measure of how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.
=== Non-sinusoidal components ===
In linear circuits having only sinusoidal currents and voltages of one frequency, the power factor arises only from the difference in phase between the current and voltage. This is &quot;displacement power factor&quot;.

Non-linear loads change the shape of the current waveform from a sine wave to some other form. Non-linear loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain non-linear loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, switched-mode power supplies, variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.

To measure the real power or reactive power, a wattmeter designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.

=== Distortion power factor ===
The distortion power factor is the distortion component associated with the harmonic voltages and currents present in the system.
:formula_30

formula_31 is the total harmonic distortion of the load current. 
:formula_32

formula_33 is the fundamental component of the current, formula_4 is the total current, and formula_35 is the current on the hth harmonic; all are root mean square values (distortion power factor can also be used to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.

The result when multiplied with the displacement power factor is the overall, true power factor or just power factor (PF):
:formula_36

=== Distortion in three-phase networks ===
In practice, the local effects of distortion current on devices in a three-phase distribution network rely on the magnitude of certain order harmonics rather than the total harmonic distortion.

For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) have the property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a delta-wye transformer, these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater resistive heating. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they will result in a non-zero current in the neutral wire. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases
and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue. The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger eddy currents in the magnetic core of the transformer. Eddy current losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer&#x27;s efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life.

Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17th, etc.) combine 120 degrees out of phase, similarly to the fundamental harmonic but in a reversed sequence. In generators and motors, these currents produce magnetic fields which oppose the rotation of the shaft and sometimes result in damaging mechanical vibrations.

=== Power factor correction (PFC) in non-linear loads ===

==== Passive PFC ====
The simplest way to control the harmonic current is to use a filter that passes current only at line frequency (50 or 60 Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors and makes a non-linear device look more like a linear load. An example of passive PFC is a valley-fill circuit.

A disadvantage of passive PFC is that it requires larger inductors or capacitors than an equivalent power active PFC circuit. Also, in practice, passive PFC is often less effective at improving the power factor.

==== Active PFC ====
Active PFC is the use of power electronics to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor. Some types of the active PFC are buck, boost, buck-boost and synchronous condenser. Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.

In the case of a switched-mode power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant voltage at its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.

For a three-phase SMPS, the Vienna rectifier configuration may be used to substantially improve the power factor.

SMPSs with passive PFC can achieve power factor of about 0.7–0.75, SMPSs with active PFC, up to 0.99 power factor, while a SMPS without any power factor correction have a power factor of only about 0.55–0.65.

Due to their very wide input voltage range, many power supplies with active PFC can automatically adjust to operate on AC power from about 100 V (Japan) to 240 V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.

==== Dynamic PFC ====
Dynamic power factor correction (DPFC), sometimes referred to as real-time power factor correction, is used for electrical stabilization in cases of rapid load changes (e.g. at large manufacturing sites). DPFC is useful when standard power factor correction would cause over or under correction. DPFC uses semiconductor switches, typically thyristors, to quickly connect and disconnect capacitors or inductors to improve power factor.

== Importance in distribution systems ==
Power factors below 1.0 require a utility to generate more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to the square of the current). Alternatively, all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current. When the power factor is close to unity, for the same kVA rating of the transformer more load current can be supplied.

Utilities typically charge additional costs to commercial customers who have a power factor below some limit, which is typically 0.9 to 0.95. Engineers are often interested in the power factor of a load as one of the factors that affect the efficiency of power transmission.

With the rising cost of energy and concerns over the efficient delivery of power, active PFC has become more common in consumer electronics. Current Energy Star guidelines for computers call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the PC&#x27;s power supply. According to a white paper authored by Intel and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, PCs with internal power supplies will require the use of active power factor correction to meet the ENERGY STAR 5.0 Program Requirements for Computers.

In Europe, EN 61000-3-2 requires power factor correction be incorporated into consumer products.

Small customers, such as households, are not usually charged for reactive power and so power factor metering equipment for such customers will not be installed.

== Measurement techniques ==
The power factor in a single-phase circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced polyphase circuit is not uniquely defined.

A direct reading power factor meter can be made with a moving coil meter of the electrodynamic type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the moving part of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load. One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.

Another electromechanical instrument is the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, just like a polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation, the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument can be made to register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.

Digital instruments exist that directly measure the time lag between voltage and current waveforms. Low-cost instruments of this type measure the peak of the waveforms. More sophisticated versions measure the peak of the fundamental harmonic only, thus giving a more accurate reading for phase angle on distorted waveforms. Calculating power factor from voltage and current phases is only accurate if both waveforms are sinusoidal.

Power Quality Analyzers, often referred to as Power Analyzers, make a digital recording of the voltage and current waveform (typically either one phase or three phase) and accurately calculate true power (watts), apparent power (VA) power factor, AC voltage, AC current, DC voltage, DC current, frequency, IEC61000-3-2/3-12 Harmonic measurement, IEC61000-3-3/3-11 flicker measurement, individual phase voltages in delta applications where there is no neutral line, total harmonic distortion, phase and amplitude of individual voltage or current harmonics, etc.

== Mnemonics ==
Anglophone power engineering students are advised to remember:
&quot;ELI the ICE man&quot; or &quot;ELI on ICE&quot; – the voltage E, leads the current I, in an inductor L. The current I leads the voltage E in a capacitor C.

Another common mnemonic is CIVIL – in a capacitor (C) the current (I) leads voltage (V), voltage (V) leads current (I) in an inductor (L).

<text>For optical fibers, a power-law index profile is an index of refraction profile characterized by 

:formula_1
where
formula_2

and formula_3 is the nominal refractive index as a function of distance from the fiber axis, formula_4 is the nominal refractive index on axis, formula_5 is the refractive index of the cladding, which is taken to be homogeneous (formula_6), formula_7 is the core radius, and formula_8 is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile. formula_7 is often used in place of formula_8. Hence, this is sometimes called an alpha profile. 

For this class of profiles, multimode distortion is smallest when formula_8 takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite formula_8, the profile becomes a step-index profile.

<doc id="41574" wikidata="Q7239737" url="?curid=41574" title="Preemphasis improvement">
<text>In FM broadcasting, preemphasis improvement is the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the high-frequency portion of the baseband, &quot;i.e.,&quot; modulating signal, which improvement results from passing the modulating signal through a preemphasis network before transmission.

The reason that preemphasis is needed is that the process of detecting a frequency-modulated signal in a receiver produces a noise spectrum that rises in frequency (a so-called &quot;triangular&quot; spectrum). Without preemphasis, the received audio would sound unacceptably noisy at high frequencies, especially under conditions of low carrier-to-noise ratio, i.e., during fringe reception conditions. Preemphasis increases the magnitude of the higher signal frequencies, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. At the output of the discriminator in the FM receiver, a deemphasis network restores the original signal power distribution.

&quot;FM improvement factor&quot; is the quotient obtained by dividing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of an FM receiver by the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the input of the receiver. When the FM improvement factor is greater than unity, the improvement in the SNR is always obtained at the expense of an increased bandwidth in the receiver and the transmission path.

&quot;FM improvement threshold&quot; is the point in an FM (frequency modulation) receiver at which the peaks in the RF signal equal the peaks of the thermal noise generated in the receiver. A baseband signal-to-noise ratio of about 30 dB is typical at the improvement threshold, and this ratio improves 1 dB for each decibel of increase in the signal above the threshold.

<doc id="41578" wikidata="Q519361" url="?curid=41578" title="Primary Rate Interface">
<text>The Primary Rate Interface (PRI) is a telecommunications interface standard used on an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) for carrying multiple DS0 voice and data transmissions between the network and a user.

PRI is the standard for providing telecommunication services to enterprises and offices. It is based on T-carrier (T1) transmission in the US, Canada, and Japan, while the E-carrier (E1) is common in Europe and Australia. The T1 line consists of 23 bearer (B) channels and one data (D) channel for control purposes, for a total bandwidth of 24x64-kbit/s or 1.544 Mbit/s. The E1 carrier provides 30 B- and one D-channel for a bandwidth of 2.048 Mbit/s. The first timeslot on the E1 is used for synchronization purposes and is not considered to be a B- or D-channel. The D-channel typically uses timeslot 16 on an E1, while it is timeslot 24 for a T1. Fewer active bearer channels, sometimes called user channels, may be used in fractional T1 or E1 services.

==ISDN service types==
The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) prescribes two levels of service:
* Basic Rate Interface (BRI): one 16-kbit/s D channel with two 64-kbit/s B channels, intended for small enterprises and residential service.
* Primary Rate Interface (PRI): one 64-kbit/s D channel with 23 (1.544 Mbit/s T1, a.k.a. &quot;23B + D&quot;) or 30 (2.048 Mbit/s E1, a.k.a. &quot;30B + D&quot;) 64-kbit/s B channels, intended for large organizations.

Each B-channel carries data, voice, and other services. The D-channel carries control and signaling information. Larger connections are possible using PRI pairing. A dual T1-PRI could have 24 + 23 = 47 B-channels and 1 D-channel (often called &quot;47B + D&quot;), but more commonly has 46 B-channels and 2 D-channels thus providing a backup signaling channel. The concept applies to E1s as well and both can include more than 2 PRIs. When configuring multiple T1&#x27;s as ISDN-PRI&#x27;s, it&#x27;s possible to use NFAS (non-facility associated signaling) to enable one or two D-channels to support additional B-channels on separate T1 circuits.

==Application==
The Primary Rate Interface channels are typically used by medium to large enterprises with digital private branch exchange (PBX) telephone systems to provide digital access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The B-channels may be used flexibly and reassigned when necessary to meet special needs such as video conferences.

PRI channels and direct inward dialing are also common as a means of delivering inbound calls to voice over IP gateways from the PSTN.

<text>In telecommunications, a primary time standard is a time standard that does not require calibration against another time standard.

Examples of primary time, (&quot;i.e.&quot;, frequency standards) are caesium standards and hydrogen masers.

The international second is based on the microwave frequency (9,192,631,770 Hz) associated with the atomic resonance of the hyperfine ground state levels of the caesium-133 atom in a magnetically neutral environment. Realizable caesium frequency standards use a strong electromagnet to deliberately introduce a magnetic field which overwhelms that of the Earth. The presence of this strong magnetic field introduces a slight, but known, increase in the atomic resonance frequency. However, very small variations in the calibration of the electric current in the electromagnet introduce minuscule frequency variations among different caesium oscillators.

<doc id="41584" wikidata="Q7246218" url="?curid=41584" title="Private line">
<text>In telecommunications, a private line is typically a telephone company service that uses a dedicated, usually unswitched point-to-point circuit, but it may involve private switching arrangements, or predefined transmission physical or virtual paths. Most private lines connect only two locations, but some have multiple drop points. If the circuit is used for interconnecting switching systems, including manual switchboards, it is often called a tie line.

Among subscribers to the public switched telephone network, the term &quot;private line&quot; is often erroneously used to describe an &quot;individual&quot; telephone line for service for only one subscriber, as opposed to a party line with multiple stations connected.

In radio or wireless telephony, &quot;Private Line&quot; is a term trademarked by Motorola to describe an implementation of a Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS), a method of using low-frequency subaudible tones to share a single radio channel among multiple users. Each user group would use a different low frequency tone. Motorola&#x27;s trade name, especially the abbreviation &quot;PL&quot;, has become a genericized trademark for the method. General Electric used the term &quot;Channel Guard&quot; to describe the same system and other manufacturers used other terms.

A later digital version of a private line is called &quot;digital private line&quot; (DPL).

Advantages of private lines are:
* High security as one dedicated link is provided
* Always available
* Instant data transmission

== Types ==

* PLNA - Private Line No Apparatus
* PLNE - Private Line No Equipment
* PLAR - Private Line Automatic Ringdown (think the &quot;Red Phone&quot;)

<doc id="41586" wikidata="Q1434913" url="?curid=41586" title="Propagation constant">
<text>The propagation constant of a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave is a measure of the change undergone by the amplitude and phase of the wave as it propagates in a given direction. The quantity being measured can be the voltage, the current in a circuit, or a field vector such as electric field strength or flux density. The propagation constant itself measures the dimensionless change in magnitude or phase per unit length. In the context of two-port networks and their cascades, propagation constantmeasures the change undergone by the source quantity as it propagates from one port to the next.

The propagation constant&#x27;s value is expressed logarithmically, almost universally to the base &quot;e&quot;, rather than base 10 that is used in telecommunications in other situations. The quantity measured, such as voltage, is expressed as a sinusoidal phasor. The phase of the sinusoid varies with distance which results in the propagation constant being a complex number, the imaginary part being caused by the phase change.

==Alternative names==

The term &quot;propagation constant&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with &quot;ω&quot;. It is probably the most widely used term but there are a large variety of alternative names used by various authors for this quantity. These include transmission parameter, transmission function, propagation parameter, propagation coefficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In transmission line theory, &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are counted among the &quot;secondary coefficients&quot;, the term &quot;secondary&quot; being used to contrast to the &quot;primary line coefficients&quot;. The primary coefficients are the physical properties of the line, namely R,C,L and G, from which the secondary coefficients may be derived using the telegrapher&#x27;s equation. In the field of transmission lines, the term transmission coefficient has a different meaning despite the similarity of name: it is the companion of the reflection coefficient.

==Definition==

The propagation constant, symbol , for a given system is defined by the ratio of the complex amplitude at the source of the wave to the complex amplitude at some distance , such that,

:formula_1

Inverting the above equation and isolating results in the quotient of the complex amplitude ratio&#x27;s natural logarithm and the distance traveled:

:formula_2

Since the propagation constant is a complex quantity we can write:

:formula_3
where
* , the real part, is called the &quot;attenuation constant&quot;
* , the imaginary part, is called the &quot;phase constant&quot;
* formula_4 more often is used for electrical circuits. 

That does indeed represent phase can be seen from Euler&#x27;s formula:

:formula_5

which is a sinusoid which varies in phase as varies but does not vary in amplitude because

:formula_6

The reason for the use of base is also now made clear. The imaginary phase constant, , can be added directly to the attenuation constant, , to form a single complex number that can be handled in one mathematical operation provided they are to the same base. Angles measured in radians require base , so the attenuation is likewise in base .

The propagation constant for conducting lines can be calculated from the primary line coefficients by means of the relationship

:formula_7

where

:formula_8 the series impedance of the line per unit length and,

:formula_9 the shunt admittance of the line per unit length.

===Plane wave===
The propagation factor of a plane wave traveling in a linear media in the direction is given by
formula_10
where
* formula_11
* formula_12 distance traveled in the direction
* formula_13 attenuation constant in the units of nepers/meter
* formula_14 phase constant in the units of radians/meter
* formula_15 frequency in radians/second
* formula_16 conductivity of the media
* formula_17 = complex permitivity of the media
* formula_18 = complex permeability of the media
* formula_19
The sign convention is chosen for consistency with propagation in lossy media. If the attenuation constant is positive, then the wave amplitude decreases as the wave propagates in the direction.

Wavelength, phase velocity, and skin depth have simple relationships to the components of the propagation constant:
formula_20

==Attenuation constant==

In telecommunications, the term attenuation constant, also called attenuation parameter or attenuation coefficient, is the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave propagating through a medium per unit distance from the source. It is the real part of the propagation constant and is measured in nepers per metre. A neper is approximately 8.7 dB. Attenuation constant can be defined by the amplitude ratio

:formula_21

The propagation constant per unit length is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the sending end current or voltage to the receiving end current or voltage, divided by the distance &quot;x&quot; involved:

:formula_22

===Conductive lines===

The attenuation constant for conductive lines can be calculated from the primary line coefficients as shown above. For a line meeting the distortionless condition, with a conductance &quot;G&quot; in the insulator, the attenuation constant is given by

:formula_23

however, a real line is unlikely to meet this condition without the addition of loading coils and, furthermore, there are some frequency dependent effects operating on the primary &quot;constants&quot; which cause a frequency dependence of the loss. There are two main components to these losses, the metal loss and the dielectric loss.

The loss of most transmission lines are dominated by the metal loss, which causes a frequency dependency due to finite conductivity of metals, and the skin effect inside a conductor. The skin effect causes R along the conductor to be approximately dependent on frequency according to

:formula_24

Losses in the dielectric depend on the loss tangent (tan &quot;δ&quot;) of the material divided by the wavelength of the signal. Thus they are directly proportional to the frequency.

:formula_25

===Optical fiber===

The attenuation constant for a particular propagation mode in an optical fiber is the real part of the axial propagation constant.

==Phase constant==
In electromagnetic theory, the phase constant, also called phase change constant, parameter or coefficient is the imaginary component of the propagation constant for a plane wave. It represents the change in phase per unit length along the path traveled by the wave at any instant and is equal to the real part of the angular wavenumber of the wave. It is represented by the symbol &quot;β&quot; and is measured in units of radians per unit length.

From the definition of (angular) wavenumber for transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves in lossless media,
:formula_26

For a transmission line, the telegrapher&#x27;s equations tells us that the wavenumber must be proportional to frequency for the transmission of the wave to be undistorted in the time domain. This includes, but is not limited to, the ideal case of a lossless line. The reason for this condition can be seen by considering that a useful signal is composed of many different wavelengths in the frequency domain. For there to be no distortion of the waveform, all these waves must travel at the same velocity so that they arrive at the far end of the line at the same time as a group. Since wave phase velocity is given by

:formula_27

it is proved that &quot;β&quot; is required to be proportional to &quot;ω&quot;. In terms of primary coefficients of the line, this yields from the telegrapher&#x27;s equation for a distortionless line the condition

:formula_28

where &quot;L&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are, respectively, the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the line. However, practical lines can only be expected to approximately meet this condition over a limited frequency band.

In particular, the phase constant formula_29 is not always equivalent to the wavenumber formula_30. The relation
:formula_31
applies to the TEM wave, which travels in free space or TEM-devices such as the coaxial cable and two parallel wires transmission lines. Nevertheless, it does not apply to the TE wave (transverse electric wave) and TM wave (transverse magnetic wave). For example, in a hollow waveguide where the TEM wave cannot exist but TE and TM waves can propagate,

:formula_32

:formula_33

Here formula_34 is the cutoff frequency. In a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency is

:formula_35

where formula_36 are the mode numbers for the rectangle&#x27;s sides of length formula_37 and formula_38 respectively. For TE modes, formula_39 (but formula_40 is not allowed), while for TM modes formula_41.

The phase velocity equals

:formula_42

==Filters and two-port networks==
The term propagation constant or propagation function is applied to filters and other two-port networks used for signal processing. In these cases, however, the attenuation and phase coefficients are expressed in terms of nepers and radians per network section rather than per unit length. Some authors make a distinction between per unit length measures (for which &quot;constant&quot; is used) and per section measures (for which &quot;function&quot; is used).

The propagation constant is a useful concept in filter design which invariably uses a cascaded section topology. In a cascaded topology, the propagation constant, attenuation constant and phase constant of individual sections may be simply added to find the total propagation constant etc.

===Cascaded networks===
The ratio of output to input voltage for each network is given by

:formula_43
:formula_44
:formula_45

The terms formula_46 are impedance scaling terms and their use is explained in the image impedance article.

The overall voltage ratio is given by

:formula_47

Thus for &quot;n&quot; cascaded sections all having matching impedances facing each other, the overall propagation constant is given by

:formula_48

<text>In telecommunications, a propagation path obstruction is a man-made or natural physical feature that lies near enough to a radio path to cause a measurable effect on path loss, exclusive of reflection effects. An obstruction may lie to the side, above, or below the path. Ridges, bridges, cliffs, buildings, and trees are examples of obstructions. If the clearance from the nearest anticipated path position, over the expected range of Earth radius &quot;k&quot;-factor, exceeds 0.6 of the first Fresnel zone radius, the feature is not normally considered an obstruction.

<doc id="41589" wikidata="Q7251372" url="?curid=41589" title="Protective distribution system">
<text>A protective distribution system (PDS), also called &quot;protected distribution system&quot;, is a US government term for wireline or fiber-optic telecommunication system that includes terminals and adequate acoustical, electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of classified information. At one time these systems were called &quot;approved circuits&quot;.

A complete protected distribution system includes the subscriber and terminal equipment and the interconnecting lines.

==Description==
The purpose of a PDS is to deter, detect and/or make difficult physical access to the communication lines carrying national security information.
A specification called the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 7003 was issued in December 1996 by the Committee on National Security Systems.
Approval authority, standards, and guidance for the design, installation, and maintenance for PDS are provided by NSTISSI 7003 to U.S. government departments and agencies and their contractors and vendors. This instruction describes the requirements for all PDS installations within the U.S. and for low and medium threat locations outside the U.S.
PDS is commonly used to protect SIPRNet and JWICS networks.
The document superseded one numbered NASCI 4009 on Protected Distribution Systems, dated December 30, 1981, and part of a document called NACSEM 5203, that covered guidelines for facility design, using the designations &quot;red&quot; and &quot;black&quot;.

There are two types of PDS: hardened distribution systems and simple distribution systems.

==Hardened distribution ==
Hardened distribution PDSs provide significant physical protection and can be implemented in three forms: hardened carrier PDSs, alarmed carrier PDSs and continuously viewed carrier PDSs.

===Hardened carrier===
In a hardened carrier PDS, the data cables are installed in a carrier constructed of electrical metallic tubing (EMT), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid sheet steel ducting. All of the connections in a Hardened Carrier System are permanently sealed completely around all surfaces with welds, epoxy or other such sealants. If the hardened carrier is buried under ground, to secure cables running between buildings for example, the carrier containing the cables is encased in concrete.

With a hardened carrier system, detection is accomplished via human inspections that are required to be performed periodically. Therefore, hardened carriers are installed below ceilings or above flooring so they can be visually inspected to ensure that no intrusions have occurred. These periodic visual inspections (PVIs) occur at a frequency dependent upon the level of threat to the environment, the security classification of the data, and the access control to the area.

=== Alarmed carrier ===
As an alternative to conducting human visual inspections, an alarmed carrier PDS may be constructed to automate the inspection process through electronic monitoring with an alarm system. In an Alarmed Carrier PDS, the carrier system is “alarmed” with specialized optical fibers deployed within the conduit for the purpose of sensing acoustic vibrations that usually occur when an intrusion is being attempted on the conduit in order to gain access to the cables.

Alarmed carrier PDS offers several advantages over hardened carrier PDS:

#Provides continuous monitoring 24/7/365
#Eliminates the requirement for periodic visual inspections
#Allows the carrier to be hidden above the ceiling or below the floor, since periodic visual inspections are not required
#Eliminates the need for the welding and epoxying of the connections
#Eliminates the requirement for concrete encasement outdoors 
#Eliminates the need to lock down manhole covers
#Enables rapid redeployment for evolving network arrangements

Legacy alarmed carrier systems monitor the carrier containing the cables being protected. More advanced systems monitor the fibers within, or intrinsic to, the cables being protected to turn those cables into sensors, which detect intrusion attempts.

Depending on the government organization, utilizing an alarmed carrier PDS in conjunction with interlocking armored cable may, in some cases, allow for the elimination of the carrier systems altogether. In these instances, the cables being protected can be installed in existing conveyance (wire basket, ladder rack) or suspended cabling (on D-rings, J-Hooks, etc.).

=== Continuously viewed carrier ===
A Continuously Viewed Carrier PDS is one that is under continuous observation, 24 hours per day (including when operational). Such circuits may be grouped together, but should be separated from all non-continuously viewed circuits ensuring an open field of view. Standing orders should include the requirement to investigate any attempt to disturb the PDS. Appropriate security personnel should investigate the area of attempted penetration within 15 minutes of discovery. This type of hardened carrier is not used for Top Secret or special category information for non-U.S. UAA.
UAA is an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA). Like definitions include Controlled Access Area (CAA) and Restricted Access Area (RAA). A Secure Room (SR) offers the highest degree of protection.

Therefore, from the least protected (least secure) to the most protected is as follows:

UAA
RAA
CAA
SR

== Simple distribution ==

Simple distribution PDSs are afforded a reduced level of physical security protection as compared to a hardened distribution PDS. They use a simple carrier system and the following means are acceptable under NSTISSI 7003: 
#The data cables should be installed in a carrier
#The carrier can be constructed of any material (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit)
#The joints and access points should be secured and be controlled by personnel cleared to the highest level of data handled by the PDS
#The carrier is to be inspected in accordance with the requirements of NSTISSI 7003

<doc id="41591" wikidata="Q2634565" url="?curid=41591" title="Protocol data unit">
<text>In telecommunications, a protocol data unit (PDU) is a single unit of information transmitted among peer entities of a computer network. It is composed of protocol-specific control information and user data. In the layered architectures of communication protocol stacks, each layer implements protocols tailored to the specific type or mode of data exchange.

For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implements a connection-oriented transfer mode, and the PDU of this protocol is called a &quot;segment&quot;, while the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) uses datagrams as protocol data units for connectionless communication. A layer lower in the Internet protocol suite, at the Internet layer, the PDU is called a packet, irrespective of its payload type.

==Packet-switched data networks==

In the context of packet switching data networks, a protocol data unit (PDU) is best understood in relation to a service data unit (SDU).

The features or services of the network are implemented in distinct &quot;layers&quot;. The physical layer sends ones and zeros across a wire or fiber. The data link layer then organizes these ones and zeros into chunks of data and gets them safely to the right place on the wire. The network layer transmits the organized data over multiple connected networks, and the transport layer delivers the data to the right software application at the destination.

Between the layers (and between the application and the top-most layer), the layers pass service data units (SDUs) across interfaces. The higher layer understands the structure of the data in the SDU, but the lower layer at the interface does not; moreover, the lower layer treats the SDU as the payload, undertaking to get it to the same interface at the destination. In order to do this, the &quot;protocol&quot; (lower) layer will add to the SDU certain data it needs to perform its function; which is called encapsulation. For example, it might add a port number to identify the application, a network address to help with routing, a code to identify the type of data in the packet and error-checking information. All this additional information, plus the original service data unit from the higher layer, constitutes the &quot;protocol data unit&quot; at this layer.

The SDU and metadata added by the lower layer can be larger than the maximum size of that layer&#x27;s PDU (known as the maximum transmission unit; MTU). When this is the case, the PDU must be split into multiple payloads of a size suitable for transmission or processing by the lower layer; a process known as IP fragmentation.

The significance of this is that the PDU is the structured information that is passed to a matching protocol layer further along on the data&#x27;s journey that allows the layer to deliver its intended function or service. The matching layer, or &quot;peer&quot;, decodes the data to extract the original service data unit, decide if it is error-free and where to send it next, etc. Unless we have already arrived at the lowest (physical) layer, the PDU is passed to the peer using services of the next lower layer in the protocol &quot;stack&quot;. When the PDU passes over the interface from the layer that constructed it to the layer that merely delivers it (and therefore does not understand its internal structure), it becomes a service data unit to that layer. The addition of addressing and control information (encapsulation) to an SDU to form a PDU and the passing of that PDU to the next lower layer as an SDU repeats until the lowest layer is reached and the data passes over some medium as a physical signal.

The above process can be likened to the mail system in which a letter (SDU) is placed in an envelope on which is written an address (addressing and control information) making it a PDU. The sending post office might look only at the postcode and place the letter in a mailbag so that the address on the envelope can no longer be seen, making it now an SDU. The mailbag is labeled with the destination postcode and so becomes a PDU until it is combined with other bags in a crate when it is now an SDU, and the crate is labeled with the region to which all the bags are to be sent, making the crate a PDU. When the crate reaches the destination matching its label, it is opened and the bags (SDUs) removed only to become PDUs when someone reads the code of the destination post office. The letters themselves are SDUs when the bags are opened but become PDUs when the address is read for final delivery. When the addressee finally opens the envelope, the top-level SDU, the letter itself, emerges.

==Examples==
===OSI model===
Protocol data units of the OSI model are:

*The Layer 4: transport layer PDU is the segment.
*The Layer 3: network layer PDU is the packet or the datagram.
*The Layer 2: data link layer PDU is the frame.
*The Layer 1: physical layer PDU is the bit or, more generally, symbol.

Given a context pertaining to a specific OSI layer, &quot;PDU&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for its representation at that layer.

===Internet protocol suite===
Protocol data units for the Internet protocol suite are:

*The transport layer PDU is the TCP segment for TCP, and the datagram for UDP
*The Internet layer PDU is the packet.
*The link layer PDU is the frame.

On TCP/IP over Ethernet, the data on the physical layer is carried in Ethernet frames.

===Internetwork packet exchange (IPX)===
* For IPX, the IPX packet is the network layer PDU for IPX, and can simultaneously be used in the transport layer as well.
* The SPX packet on top of IPX, is a transport layer PDU.
* The link-layer PDU is the frame.

===ATM===
The data link layer PDU in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks is called a &quot;cell&quot;.

===Media access control protocol data unit===
A media access control protocol data unit (MAC PDU or MPDU) is a message that is exchanged between media access control (MAC) entities in a communication system based on the layered OSI model.

In systems where the MPDU may be larger than the MAC service data unit (MSDU), the MPDU may &quot;include&quot; multiple MSDUs as a result of packet aggregation. In systems where the MPDU is smaller than the MSDU, then one MSDU may &quot;generate&quot; multiple MPDUs as a result of packet segmentation.

<text>In telecommunications, provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide new services to its users. In National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications services, &quot;provisioning&quot; equates to &quot;initiation&quot; and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability.

The concept of network provisioning or service mediation, mostly used in the telecommunication industry, refers to the provisioning of the customer&#x27;s services to the network elements, which are various equipment connected in that network communication system. Generally in telephony provisioning this is accomplished with network management database table mappings. It requires the existence of networking equipment and depends on network planning and design.

In a modern signal infrastructure employing information technology (IT) at all levels, there is no possible distinction between telecommunications services and &quot;higher level&quot; infrastructure. Accordingly, provisioning configures any required systems, provides users with access to data and technology resources, and refers to all enterprise-level information-resource management involved.

Organizationally, a CIO typically manages provisioning, necessarily involving human resources and IT departments cooperating to:

* Give users access to data repositories or grant authorization to systems, network applications and databases based on a unique user identity.
* Appropriate for their use hardware resources, such as computers, mobile phones and pagers.

As its core, the provisioning process monitors access rights and privileges to ensure the security of an enterprise&#x27;s resources and user privacy. As a secondary responsibility, it ensures compliance and minimizes the vulnerability of systems to penetration and abuse. As a tertiary responsibility, it tries to reduce the amount of custom configuration using boot image control and other methods that radically reduce the number of different configurations involved.

Discussion of provisioning often appears in the context of virtualization, orchestration, utility computing, cloud computing, and open-configuration concepts and projects. For instance, the OASIS Provisioning Services Technical Committee (PSTC) defines an XML-based framework for exchanging user, resource, and service-provisioning information - SPML (Service Provisioning Markup Language) for &quot;managing the provisioning and allocation of identity information and system resources within and between organizations&quot;.

Once provisioning has taken place, the process of SysOpping ensures the maintenance of services to the expected standards. Provisioning thus refers only to the setup or startup part of the service operation, and SysOpping to the ongoing support.

==Network provisioning==
One type of provisioning.
The services which are assigned to the customer in the customer relationship management (CRM) have to be provisioned on the network element which is enabling the service and allows the customer to actually use the service. The relation between a service configured in the CRM and a service on the network elements is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship; for example, services like Microsoft Media Server (mms://) can be enabled by more than one network element.

During the provisioning, the service mediation device translates the service and the corresponding parameters of the service to one or more services/parameters on the network elements involved. The algorithm used to translate a system service into network services is called provisioning logic.

Electronic invoice feeds from your carriers can be automatically downloaded directly into the core of the telecom expense management (TEM) software and it will immediately conduct an audit of each single line item charge all the way down to the User Support and Operations Center (USOC) level. The provisioning software will capture each circuit number provided by all of your carriers and if billing occurs outside of the contracted rate an exception rule will trigger a red flag and notify the pre-established staff member to review the billing error.

==Server provisioning==
Server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems, data and software, and make it ready for network operation. Typical tasks when provisioning a server are: select a server from a pool of available servers, load the appropriate software (operating system, device drivers, middleware, and applications), appropriately customize and configure the system and the software to create or change a boot image for this server, and then change its parameters, such as IP address, IP Gateway to find associated network and storage resources (sometimes separated as &quot;resource provisioning&quot;) to audit the system. By auditing the system, you ensure OVAL compliance with limit vulnerability, ensure compliance, or install patches. After these actions, you restart the system and load the new software. This makes the system ready for operation. Typically an internet service provider (ISP) or network operations center will perform these tasks to a well-defined set of parameters, for example, a boot image that the organization has approved and which uses software it has license to. Many instances of such a boot image create a virtual dedicated host.

There are many software products available to automate the provisioning of servers, services and end-user devices. Examples: BMC Bladelogic Server Automation, HP Server Automation, IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager, Redhat Kickstart, xCAT, HP Insight CMU, etc. Middleware and applications can be installed either when the operating system is installed or afterwards by using an Application Service Automation tool. Further questions are addressed in academia such as when provisioning should be issued and how many servers are needed in multi-tier, or multi-service applications.

In cloud computing, servers may be provisioned via a web user interface or an application programming interface (API). One of the unique things about cloud computing is how rapidly and easily this can be done. Monitoring software can be used to trigger automatic provisioning when existing resources become too heavily stressed.

In short, server provisioning configures servers based on resource requirements. The use of a hardware or software component (e.g. single/dual processor, RAM, HDD, RAID Controller, a number of LAN cards, applications, OS, etc.) depends on the functionality of the server, such as ISP, virtualization, NOS, or voice processing. Server redundancy depends on the availability of servers in the organization. Critical applications have less downtime when using cluster servers, RAID, or a mirroring system.

Service used by most larger-scale centers in part to avoid this. Additional resource provisioning may be done per service.

There are several software on the market for server provisioning such as Cobbler or HP Intelligent Provisioning.

==User provisioning==

User provisioning refers to the creation, maintenance and deactivation of user objects and user attributes, as they exist in one or more systems, directories or applications, in response to automated or interactive business processes. User provisioning software may include one or more of the following processes: change propagation, self-service workflow, consolidated user administration, delegated user administration, and federated change control. User objects may represent employees, contractors, vendors, partners, customers or other recipients of a service. Services may include electronic mail, inclusion in a published user directory, access to a database, access to a network or mainframe, etc. User provisioning is a type of identity management software, particularly useful within organizations, where users may be represented by multiple objects on multiple systems and multiple instances.

==Self-service provisioning for cloud computing services==
On-demand self-service is described by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as an essential characteristic of cloud computing. The self-service nature of cloud computing lets end users obtain and remove cloud services―including applications, the infrastructure supporting the applications, and configuration― themselves without requiring the assistance of an IT staff member. The automatic self-servicing may target different application goals and constraints (e.g. deadlines and cost), as well as handling different application architectures (e.g., bags-of-tasks and workflows). Cloud users can obtain cloud services through a cloud service catalog or a self-service portal. Because business users can obtain and configure cloud services themselves, this means IT staff can be more productive and gives them more time to manage cloud infrastructures.

One downside of cloud service provisioning is that it is not instantaneous. A cloud virtual machine (VM) can be acquired at any time by the user, but it may take up to several minutes for the acquired VM to be ready to use. The VM startup time is dependent on factors, such as image size, VM type, data center location, and number of VMs. Cloud providers have different VM startup performance.

==Mobile subscriber provisioning==
Mobile subscriber provisioning refers to the setting up of new services, such as GPRS, MMS and Instant Messaging for an existing subscriber of a mobile phone network, and any gateways to standard Internet chat or mail services. The network operator typically sends these settings to the subscriber&#x27;s handset using SMS text services or HTML, and less commonly WAP, depending on what the mobile operating systems can accept.

A general example of provisioning is with data services. A mobile user who is using his or her device for voice calling may wish to switch to data services in order to read emails or browse the Internet. The mobile device&#x27;s services are &quot;provisioned&quot; and thus the user is able to stay connected through push emails and other features of smartphone services.

Device management systems can benefit end-users by incorporating plug-and-play data services, supporting whatever device the end-user is using.. Such a platform can automatically detect devices in the network, sending them settings for immediate and continued usability. The process is fully automated, keeping the history of used devices and sending settings only to subscriber devices which were not previously set. One method of managing mobile updates is to filter IMEI/IMSI pairs. Some operators report activity of 50 over-the-air settings update files per second.

==Mobile content provisioning==
This refers to delivering mobile content, such as mobile internet to a mobile phone, agnostic of the features of said device. These may include operating system type and versions, Java version, browser version, screen form factors, audio capabilities, language settings and many other characteristics. As of April 2006, an estimated 5,000 permutations were relevant. Mobile content provisioning facilitates a common user experience, though delivered on widely different handsets.

==Mobile device provisioning==
Provisioning devices involves delivering configuration data and policy settings to the mobile devices from a central point – Mobile device management system tools.

==Internet access provisioning==
When getting a customer online, the client system must be configured. Depending on the connection technology (e.g., DSL, Cable, Fibre), the client system configuration may include:
* Modem configuration
* Network authentication
* Installing drivers
* Setting up Wireless LAN
* Securing operating system (primarily for Windows)
* Configuring browser provider-specifics
* E-mail provisioning (create mailboxes and aliases)
* E-mail configuration in client systems
* Installing additional support software or add-on packages

There are four approaches to provisioning internet access:

* Hand out manuals: Manuals are a great help for experienced users, but inexperienced users will need to call the support hotline several times until all internet services are accessible. Every unintended change in the configuration, by user mistake or due to a software error, results in additional calls.
* On-site setup by a technician: Sending a technician on-site is the most reliable approach from the provider&#x27;s point of view, as the person ensures that the internet access is working, before leaving the customer&#x27;s premises. This advantage comes at high costs – either for the provider or the customer, depending on the business model. Furthermore, it is inconvenient for customers, as they have to wait until they get an installation appointment and because they need to take a day off from work. For repairing an internet connection on-site or phone support will be needed again.
* Server-side remote setup: Server-side modem configuration uses a protocol called TR-069. It is widely established and reliable. At the current stage it can only be used for modem configuration. Protocol extensions are discussed, but not yet practically implemented, particularly because most client devices and applications do not support them yet. All other steps of the provisioning process are left to the user, typically causing many rather long calls to the support hotline.
* Installation CD: Also called a &quot;client-side self-service installation&quot; CD, it can cover the entire process from modem configuration to setting up client applications, including home networking devices. The software typically acts autonomously, i.e., it doesn&#x27;t need an online connection and an expensive backend infrastructure. During such an installation process the software usually also install diagnosis and self-repair applications that support customers in case of problems, avoiding costly hotline calls. Such client-side applications also open completely new possibilities for marketing, cross- and upselling. Such solutions come from highly specialised companies or directly from the provider&#x27;s development department.

<doc id="41593" wikidata="Q910571" url="?curid=41593" title="Pseudorandom noise">
<text>In cryptography, pseudorandom noise (PRN) is a signal similar to noise which satisfies one or more of the standard tests for statistical randomness. Although it seems to lack any definite pattern, pseudorandom noise consists of a deterministic sequence of pulses that will repeat itself after its period.

In cryptographic devices, the pseudorandom noise pattern is determined by a key and the repetition period can be very long, even millions of digits.

Pseudorandom noise is used in some electronic musical instruments, either by itself or as an input to subtractive synthesis, and in many white noise machines.

In spread-spectrum systems, the receiver correlates a locally generated signal with the received signal. Such spread-spectrum systems require a set of one or more &quot;codes&quot; or &quot;sequences&quot; such that
* Like random noise, the local sequence has a very low correlation with any other sequence in the set, or with the same sequence at a significantly different time offset, or with narrow band interference, or with thermal noise.
* Unlike random noise, it must be easy to generate exactly the same sequence at both the transmitter and the receiver, so the receiver&#x27;s locally generated sequence has a very high correlation with the transmitted sequence.

In a direct-sequence spread spectrum system, each bit in the pseudorandom binary sequence is known as a &quot;chip&quot; and the &quot;inverse&quot; of its period as &quot;chip rate&quot;; &quot;compare bit rate and symbol rate.&quot;

In a frequency-hopping spread spectrum sequence, each value in the pseudorandom sequence is known as a &quot;channel number&quot; and the &quot;inverse&quot; of its period as the &quot;hop rate&quot;. FCC Part 15 mandates at least 50 different channels and at least a 2.5 Hz hop rate for narrow band frequency-hopping systems.

GPS satellites broadcast data at a rate of 50 data bits per second – each satellite modulates its data with one PN bit stream at 1.023 million chips per second and the same data with another PN bit stream at 10.23 million chips per second.
GPS receivers correlate the received PN bit stream with a local reference to measure distance. GPS is a receive-only system that uses relative timing measurements from several satellites (and the known positions of the satellites) to determine receiver position.

Other range-finding applications involve two-way transmissions. A local station generates a pseudorandom bit sequence and transmits it to the remote location (using any modulation technique). Some object at the remote location echoes this PN signal back to the location station – either passively, as in some kinds of radar and sonar systems, or using an active transponder at the remote location, as in the Apollo Unified S-band system. By correlating a (delayed version of) the transmitted signal with the received signal, a precise round trip time to the remote location can be determined and thus the distance.

==PN code==

A pseudo-noise code (PN code) or pseudo-random-noise code (PRN code) is one that has a spectrum similar to a random sequence of bits but is deterministically generated. The most commonly used sequences in direct-sequence spread spectrum systems are maximal length sequences, Gold codes, Kasami codes, and Barker codes.

<text>In telecommunications, a psophometer is an instrument that measures the perceptible noise of a telephone circuit.

The core of the meter is based on a true RMS voltmeter, which measures the level of the noise signal. This was used for the first psophometers, in the 1930s. As the human-perceived level of noise is more important for telephony than their raw voltage, a modern psophometer incorporates a weighting network to represent this perception. The characteristics of the weighting network depend on the type of circuit under investigation, such as whether the circuit is used to normal speech standards (300 Hz – 3.3 kHz), or for high-fidelity broadcast-quality sound (50 Hz – 15 kHz).

== Etymology ==
The name was coined in the 1930s, on a basis from , itself derived from . It is unrelated to .

The &#x27;-meter&#x27; suffix was already widely used in English, but also derives originally from Greek.

<text>In telecommunication, a public land mobile network (PLMN) is a combination of wireless communication services offered by a specific operator in a specific country. A PLMN typically consists of several cellular technologies like GSM/2G, UMTS/3G, LTE/4G, NR/5G, offered by a single operator within a given country, often referred to as a cellular network.

==PLMN code==

A PLMN is identified by a globally unique PLMN code, which consists of a MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code). Hence, it is a five- to six-digit number identifying a country, and a mobile network operator in that country, usually represented in the form 001-01 or 001–001.

A PLMN is part of a:
* Location Area Identity (LAI) (PLMN and Location Area Code)
* Cell Global Identity (CGI) (LAI and Cell Identifier)
* IMSI (see PLMN code and IMSI)

==Leading zeros in PLMN codes==
Note that an MNC can be of two-digit form and three-digit form with leading zeros. It is administered by the respective national numbering plan administrator. From PLMN assignments, it is apparent that such dualities of two-digit and three-digit MNCs with the same number value are avoided (see the list of mobile country codes and mobile network codes). An example for an actual three-digit/two-digit MNC with leading zeros is in Bermuda MCC, 350-007 and 350-00, 350-01.

==PLMN code and IMSI==
The IMSI, which identifies a SIM or USIM for one subscriber, typically starts with the PLMN code. For example, an IMSI belonging to the PLMN 262-33 would look like 262330000000001. Mobile phones use this to detect roaming, so that a mobile phone subscribed on a network with a PLMN code that mismatches the start of the USIM&#x27;s IMSI will typically display an &quot;R&quot; on the icon that indicates connection strength.

==PLMN services==

A PLMN typically offers the following services to a mobile subscriber:

* Emergency calls to local Fire/Ambulance/Police stations.
* Voice calls to/from any PLMN (&quot;cellular network&quot;) or PSTN (&quot;landline&quot;/VoIP).
* Short message service (SMS) services to/from any PLMN or SIP service (the original form of texting on a mobile phone, now often replaced by Messaging apps).
* Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) services to/from any PLMN or SIP service.
* Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) for operator specific interactions (e.g. dialing &quot;*#100#&quot; to indicate the current balance).
* Internet data connectivity for arbitrary services, e.g. via GPRS in GSM, IuPS in UMTS, or LTE.

The availability, quality and bandwidth of these services strongly depends on the particular technology used to implement a PLMN.

<doc id="41600" wikidata="Q191733" url="?curid=41600" title="Pulse">
<text>In medicine, the pulse is the rhythmic throbbing of each artery in response to the cardiac cycle (heartbeat). The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery or ulnar artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery). The pulse is most commonly measured at the wrist or neck. A sphygmograph is an instrument for measuring the pulse.

== Physiology ==
Claudius Galen was perhaps the first physiologist to describe the pulse. The pulse is an expedient tactile method of determination of systolic blood pressure to a trained observer. Diastolic blood pressure is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods, occurring between heartbeats.

Pressure waves generated by the heart in systole move the arterial walls. Forward movement of blood occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant. These properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave.

Pulse velocity, pulse deficits and much more physiologic data are readily and simplistically visualized by the use of one or more arterial catheters connected to a transducer and oscilloscope. This invasive technique has been commonly used in intensive care since the 1970s.

The pulse may be further indirectly observed under light absorbances of varying wavelengths with assigned and inexpensively reproduced mathematical ratios. Applied capture of variances of light signal from the blood component hemoglobin under oxygenated vs. deoxygenated conditions allows the technology of pulse oximetry.

==Characteristics==

===Rate===

The rate of the pulse can be observed and measured on the outside of an artery by tactile or visual means. It is recorded as arterial beats per minute or BPM. Although the pulse and heart beat are related, they are not the same. For example, there is a delay between the onset of the heart beat and the onset of the pulse, known as the pulse transit time, which varies by site. Similarly measurements of heart rate variability and pulse rate variability differ. 

In healthy people, the pulse rate is close to the heart rate, as measured by ECG. Measuring the pulse rate is therefore a convenient way to estimate the heart rate. Pulse deficit is a condition in which a person has a difference between their pulse rate and heart rate. It can be observed by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation using a stethoscope at the PMI, near the heart apex, for example. Typically, in people with pulse deficit, heart beats do not result in pulsations at the periphery, meaning the pulse rate is lower than the heart rate. Pulse deficit has been found to be significant in the context of premature ventricular contraction and atrial fibrillation.

===Rhythm===

A normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force. An irregular pulse may be due to sinus arrhythmia, ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, partial heart block etc. Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called &quot;intermittent pulse&quot;. Examples of &quot;regular&quot; intermittent (regularly irregular) pulse include pulsus bigeminus, second-degree atrioventricular block. An example of &quot;irregular&quot; intermittent (irregularly irregular) pulse is atrial fibrillation.

===Volume===
The degree of expansion displayed by artery during diastolic and systolic state is called volume. It is also known as amplitude, expansion or size of pulse.

====Hypokinetic pulse====
A weak pulse signifies narrow pulse pressure. It may be due to low cardiac output (as seen in shock, congestive cardiac failure), hypovolemia, valvular heart disease (such as aortic outflow tract obstruction, mitral stenosis, aortic arch syndrome) etc.

====Hyperkinetic pulse====
A bounding pulse signifies high pulse pressure. It may be due to low peripheral resistance (as seen in fever, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, , A-V fistula, Paget&#x27;s disease, beriberi, liver cirrhosis), increased cardiac output, increased stroke volume (as seen in anxiety, exercise, complete heart block, aortic regurgitation), decreased distensibility of arterial system (as seen in atherosclerosis, hypertension and coarctation of aorta).

The strength of the pulse can also be reported:
* 0 = Absent
* 1 = Barely palpable
* 2 = Easily palpable
* 3 = Full
* 4 = Aneurysmal or bounding pulse

===Force===
Also known as compressibility of pulse. It is a rough indication of systolic blood pressure.

===Tension===
Determined mainly by mean arterial blood pressure [edited by Elmoghazy] &amp; It corresponds to diastolic blood pressure. A low tension pulse (pulsus mollis), the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats. In high tension pulse (pulsus durus), vessels feel rigid even between pulse beats.

===Form===
A form or contour of a pulse is palpatory estimation of arteriogram. A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse (pulsus celer) is seen in aortic regurgitation. A slow rising and slowly falling pulse (pulsus tardus) is seen in aortic stenosis.

===Equality===
Comparing pulses and different places gives valuable clinical information.

A discrepant or unequal pulse between left and right radial artery is observed in anomalous or aberrant course of artery, coarctation of aorta, aortitis, dissecting aneurysm, peripheral embolism etc. An unequal pulse between upper and lower extremities is seen in coarctation to aorta, aortitis, block at bifurcation of aorta, dissection of aorta, iatrogenic trauma and arteriosclerotic obstruction.

===Condition of arterial wall===
A normal artery is not palpable after flattening by digital pressure. A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5–10 cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis.

===Radio-femoral delay===
In coarctation of aorta, femoral pulse may be significantly delayed as compared to radial pulse (unless there is coexisting aortic regurgitation). The delay can also be observed in supravalvar aortic stenosis.

==Patterns==
Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include:
* Anacrotic pulse: notch on the upstroke of the carotid pulse. Two distinct waves (slow initial upstroke and delayed peak, which is close to S2). Present in AS.
* Dicrotic pulse: is characterized by two beats per cardiac cycle, one systolic and the other diastolic. Physiologically, the dicrotic wave is the result of reflected waves from the lower extremities and aorta. Conditions associated with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance can produce a dicrotic pulse.
* Pulse deficit: difference in the heart rate by direct cardiac ausculation and by palpation of the peripheral arterial pulse rate when in atrial fibrillation (AF).
* Pulsus alternans: an ominous medical sign that indicates progressive systolic heart failure. To trained fingertips, the examiner notes a pattern of a strong pulse followed by a weak pulse over and over again. This pulse signals a flagging effort of the heart to sustain itself in systole. It also can be detected in HCM with obstruction.
* Pulsus bigeminus: indicates a pair of hoofbeats within each heartbeat. Concurrent auscultation of the heart may reveal a gallop rhythm of the native heartbeat.
* Pulsus bisferiens: is characterized by two beats per cardiac cycle, both systolic, unlike the dicrotic pulse. It is an unusual physical finding typically seen in patients with aortic valve diseases if the aortic valve does not normally open and close. Trained fingertips will observe two pulses to each heartbeat instead of one.
* &quot;Pulsus tardus et parvus&quot;, also &quot;pulsus parvus et tardus&quot;, slow-rising pulse and anacrotic pulse, is weak (parvus), and late (tardus) relative to its expected characteristics. It is caused by a stiffened aortic valve that makes it progressively harder to open, thus requiring increased generation of blood pressure in the left ventricle. It is seen in aortic valve stenosis.
* Pulsus paradoxus: a condition in which some heartbeats cannot be detected at the radial artery during the inspiration phase of respiration. It is caused by an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure during this phase, and is diagnostic of a variety of cardiac and respiratory conditions of varying urgency, such as cardiac tamponade.
* Tachycardia: an elevated resting heart rate. In general an electrocardiogram (ECG) is required to identify the type of tachycardia.
* Pulsatile This description of the pulse implies the intrinsic physiology of systole and diastole. Scientifically, systole and diastole are forces that expand and contract the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
*A collapsing pulse is a sign of hyperdynamic circulation, which can be seen in AR or PDA.

== Common palpable sites ==
Sites can be divided into peripheral pulses and central pulses. Central pulses include the carotid and femoral pulses.

===Upper limb===

*Axillary pulse: located inferiorly of the lateral wall of the axilla
*Brachial pulse: located on the inside of the upper arm near the elbow, frequently used in place of carotid pulse in infants (brachial artery)
*Radial pulse: located on the lateral of the wrist (radial artery). It can also be found in the anatomical snuff box. Commonly, the radial pulse is measured with three fingers. The finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep). 
*Ulnar pulse: located on the medial of the wrist (ulnar artery).

===Lower limb===
*Femoral pulse: located in the inner thigh, at the mid-inguinal point, halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine (femoral artery).
*Popliteal pulse: Above the knee in the popliteal fossa, found by holding the bent knee. The patient bends the knee at approximately 124°, and the health care provider holds it in both hands to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind the knee (popliteal artery).
*Dorsalis pedis pulse: located on top of the foot, immediately lateral to the extensor of hallucis longus (dorsalis pedis artery).
*Tibialis posterior pulse: located on the medial side of the ankle, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm posterior to the medial malleolus (posterior tibial artery). It is easily palpable over Pimenta&#x27;s Point.

===Head and neck===

*Carotid pulse: located in the neck (carotid artery). The carotid artery should be palpated gently and while the patient is sitting or lying down. Stimulating its baroreceptors with low palpitation can provoke severe bradycardia or even stop the heart in some sensitive persons. Also, a person&#x27;s two carotid arteries should not be palpated at the same time. Doing so may limit the flow of blood to the head, possibly leading to fainting or brain ischemia. It can be felt between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the hyoid bone and lateral to the thyroid cartilage.
*Facial pulse: located on the mandible (lower jawbone) on a line with the corners of the mouth (facial artery).
*Temporal pulse: located on the temple directly in front of the ear (superficial temporal artery).

Although the pulse can be felt in multiple places in the head, people should not normally hear their heartbeats within the head. This is called pulsatile tinnitus, and it can indicate several medical disorders.

===Torso===
*Apical pulse: located in the 5th left intercostal space, 1.25 cm lateral to the mid-clavicular line. In contrast with other pulse sites, the apical pulse site is unilateral, and measured not under an artery, but below the heart itself (more specifically, the apex of the heart). See also apex beat.

==History==
Pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. The first person to measure the heart beat was Herophilus of Alexandria, Egypt (c. 335–280 BC) who designed a water clock to time the pulse. Rumi has mentioned in a poem that &quot;The wise physician measured the patient&#x27;s pulse and became aware of his condition.&quot; It shows the practice was common during Rumi&#x27;s era and geography. 
The first person to accurately measure the pulse rate was Santorio Santorii who invented the &quot;pulsilogium&quot;, a form of pendulum which was later studied by Galileo Galilei. A century later another physician, de Lacroix, used the pulsilogium to test cardiac function.

<text>In telecommunications, pulse-address multiple access (PAMA) is a channel access method that enables the ability of a communication satellite to receive signals from several Earth terminals simultaneously and to amplify, translate, and relay the signals back to Earth, based on the addressing of each station by an assignment of a unique combination of time and frequency slots.

This ability may be restricted by allowing only some of the terminals access to the satellite at any given time.

<text>In signal processing and telecommunications, pulse duration is the interval between the time, during the first transition, that the amplitude of the pulse reaches a specified fraction (level) of its final amplitude, and the time the pulse amplitude drops, on the last transition, to the same level.

The interval between the 50% points of the final amplitude is usually used to determine or define pulse duration, and this is understood to be the case unless otherwise specified. Other fractions of the final amplitude, e.g., 90% or 1/e, may also be used, as may the root mean square (rms) value of the pulse amplitude.

In radar, the pulse duration is the time the radar&#x27;s transmitter is energized during each cycle.

<text>In telecommunications, a pulse link repeater (PLR) is a device that interfaces concatenated E and M signaling paths. 

A PLR converts a ground, received from the E lead of one signal path, to −48 VDC, which is applied to the M lead of the concatenated signal path. 

In many commercial carrier systems, the channel bank cards or modules have a &quot;PLR&quot; option that permits the direct concatenation of E&amp;M signaling paths, without the need for separate PLR equipment.

<text>Push-to-type operation: In telegraph or data transmission systems, that method of communication in which the operator at a station must keep a switch operated in order to send messages. 

Push-to-type operation is used in radio systems where the same frequency is employed for transmission and reception. 

Push-to-type operation is a derivative form of transmission and may be used in simplex, half-duplex, or duplex operation. &quot;Synonym&quot; press-to-type operation.

This is similar to Push-to-talk operation for radio phone communications.

<text>Quality control (QC) is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as &quot;a part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements&quot;.

This approach places emphasis on three aspects (enshrined in standards such as ISO 9001):

# Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes, performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records
# Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications
# Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.

Inspection is a major component of quality control, where physical product is examined visually (or the end results of a service are analyzed). Product inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface es for example.

== History and introduction ==

Early stone tools such as anvils had no holes and were not designed as interchangeable parts. Mass production established processes for the creation of parts and system with identical dimensions and design, but these processes are not uniform and hence some customers were unsatisfied with the result. Quality control separates the act of testing products to uncover defects from the decision to allow or deny product release, which may be determined by fiscal constraints. For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract.

The simplest form of quality control was a sketch of the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as plug gauges and ring gauges. However, this did not address the problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.

==Notable approaches==
There is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:

==In project management==
In project management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the project scope. In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality control team which focuses on this area.

<text>In telecommunications, a quasi-analog signal is a digital signal that has been converted to a form suitable for transmission over a specified analog channel. 

The specification of the analog channel should include frequency range, bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and envelope delay distortion. When quasi-analog form of signaling is used to convey message traffic over dial-up telephone systems, it is often referred to as voice-data. A modem may be used for the conversion process.

<doc id="41616" wikidata="Q576842" url="?curid=41616" title="Queuing delay">
<text>In telecommunications and computer engineering, the queuing delay is the time a job waits in a queue until it can be executed. It is a key component of network delay. In a switched network, queuing delay is the time between the completion of signaling by the call originator and the arrival of a ringing signal at the call receiver. Queuing delay may be caused by delays at the originating switch, intermediate switches, or the call receiver servicing switch. In a data network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays between the request for service and the establishment of a circuit to the called data terminal equipment (DTE). In a packet-switched network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays encountered by a packet between the time of insertion into the network and the time of delivery to the address. 
==Router processing==
This term is most often used in reference to routers. When packets arrive at a router, they have to be processed and transmitted. A router can only process one packet at a time. If packets arrive faster than the router can process them (such as in a burst transmission) the router puts them into the queue (also called the buffer) until it can get around to transmitting them. Delay can also vary from packet to packet so averages and statistics are usually generated when measuring and evaluating queuing delay. 

As a queue begins to fill up due to traffic arriving faster than it can be processed, the amount of delay a packet experiences going through the queue increases. The speed at which the contents of a queue can be processed is a function of the transmission rate of the facility. This leads to the classic delay curve. The average delay any given packet is likely to experience is given by the formula 1/(μ-λ) where μ is the number of packets per second the facility can sustain and λ is the average rate at which packets are arriving to be serviced. This formula can be used when no packets are dropped from the queue. 

The maximum queuing delay is proportional to buffer size. The longer the line of packets waiting to be transmitted, the longer the average waiting time is. The router queue of packets waiting to be sent also introduces a potential cause of packet loss. Since the router has a finite amount of buffer memory to hold the queue, a router that receives packets at too high a rate may experience a full queue. In this case, the router has no other option than to simply discard excess packets.

When the transmission protocol uses the dropped-packets symptom of filled buffers to regulate its transmit rate, as the Internet&#x27;s TCP does, bandwidth is fairly shared at near theoretical capacity with minimal network congestion delays. Absent this feedback mechanism the delays become both unpredictable and rise sharply, a symptom also seen as freeways approach capacity; metered onramps are the most effective solution there, just as TCP&#x27;s self-regulation is the most effective solution when the traffic is packets instead of cars). This result is both hard to model mathematically and quite counterintuitive to people who lack experience with mathematics or real networks. Failing to drop packets, choosing instead to buffer an ever-increasing number of them, produces bufferbloat.
==Notation==
In Kendall&#x27;s notation, the M/M/1/K queuing model, where K is the size of the buffer, may be used to analyze the queuing delay in a specific system. Kendall&#x27;s notation should be used to calculate the queuing delay when packets are dropped from the queue. The M/M/1/K queuing model is the most basic and important queuing model for network analysis.

<doc id="41620" wikidata="Q571921" url="?curid=41620" title="Radiation pattern">
<text>In the field of antenna design the term radiation pattern (or antenna pattern or far-field pattern) refers to the &quot;directional&quot; (angular) dependence of the strength of the radio waves from the antenna or other source.

Particularly in the fields of fiber optics, lasers, and integrated optics, the term radiation pattern may also be used as a synonym for the [[Near and far field|near-field]] pattern or Fresnel pattern. This refers to the &quot;positional&quot; dependence of the electromagnetic field in the near field, or Fresnel region of the source. The near-field pattern is most commonly defined over a plane placed in front of the source, or over a cylindrical or spherical surface enclosing it.

The far-field pattern of an antenna may be determined experimentally at an antenna range, or alternatively, the near-field pattern may be found using a [[Electromagnetic near-field scanner|near-field scanner]], and the radiation pattern deduced from it by computation. The far-field radiation pattern can also be calculated from the antenna shape by computer programs such as NEC. Other software, like HFSS can also compute the near field.

The far field radiation pattern may be represented graphically as a plot of one of a number of related variables, like the field strength at a constant (large) radius (an amplitude pattern or field pattern), the power per unit solid angle (power pattern) and the directive gain. Very often, only the relative amplitude is plotted, normalized either to the amplitude on the antenna boresight, or to the total radiated power. The plotted quantity may be shown on a linear scale, or in dB. The plot is typically represented as a three-dimensional graph (as at right), or as separate graphs in the vertical plane and horizontal plane. This is often known as a polar diagram.

==Reciprocity==

It is a fundamental property of antennas that the receiving pattern (sensitivity as a function of direction) of an antenna when used for receiving is identical to the far-field radiation pattern of the antenna when used for transmitting. This is a consequence of the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetics and is proved below. Therefore, in discussions of radiation patterns the antenna can be viewed as either transmitting or receiving, whichever is more convenient.

There are limits to reciprocity: It applies only to &quot;passive&quot; antenna elements – &quot;active&quot; antennas that incorporate amplifiers or other individually powered components are &quot;not&quot; reciprocal. And even when the antenna is made of exclusively of passive elements, reciprocity only applies to the waves emitted and intercepted by the antenna. Reciprocity does &quot;not&quot; apply to the distribution of current in the various parts of the antenna generated by the intercepted waves nor currents that create emitted waves: Antenna current profiles typically differ for receiving and transmitting, despite the waves in the far field radiating inward and outward along the same path, with the same overall pattern, just with reversed direction.

==Typical patterns==
Since electromagnetic radiation is dipole radiation, it is not possible to build an antenna that radiates coherently equally in all directions, although such a hypothetical isotropic antenna is used as a reference to calculate antenna gain.

The simplest antennas, monopole and dipole antennas, consist of one or two straight metal rods along a common axis. These axially symmetric antennas have radiation patterns with a similar symmetry, called omnidirectional patterns; they radiate equal power in all directions perpendicular to the antenna, with the power varying only with the angle to the axis, dropping off to zero on the antenna&#x27;s axis. This illustrates the general principle that if the shape of an antenna is symmetrical, its radiation pattern will have the same symmetry.

In most antennas, the radiation from the different parts of the antenna interferes at some angles; the radiation pattern of the antenna can be considered an interference pattern. This results in minimum or zero radiation at certain angles where the radio waves from the different parts arrive out of phase, and local maxima of radiation at other angles where the radio waves arrive in phase. Therefore, the radiation plot of most antennas shows a pattern of maxima called &quot;&quot;lobes&quot; at various angles, separated by &quot;nulls&quot; at which the radiation goes to zero. The larger the antenna is compared to a wavelength, the more lobes there will be.
In a directional antenna in which the objective is to emit the radio waves in one particular direction, the antenna is designed to radiate most of its power in the lobe directed in the desired direction. Therefore, in the radiation plot this lobe appears larger than the others; it is called the &quot;main lobe&quot;. The axis of maximum radiation, passing through the center of the main lobe, is called the &quot;beam axis&quot;&quot; or &quot;boresight axis&quot;. In some antennas, such as split-beam antennas, there may exist more than one major lobe. The other lobes beside the main lobe, representing unwanted radiation in other directions, are called minor lobes. The minor lobes oriented at an angle to the main lobe are called &quot;side lobes&quot;. The minor lobe in the opposite direction (180°) from the main lobe is called the &quot;back lobe&quot;&quot;.

Minor lobes usually represent radiation in undesired directions, so in directional antennas a design goal is usually to reduce the minor lobes. Side lobes are normally the largest of the minor lobes. The level of minor lobes is usually expressed as a ratio of the power density in the lobe in question to that of the major lobe. This ratio is often termed the side lobe ratio or side lobe level. Side lobe levels of −20 dB or greater are usually not desirable in many applications. Attainment of a side lobe level smaller than −30 dB usually requires very careful design and construction. In most radar systems, for example, low side lobe ratios are very important to minimize false target indications through the side lobes.

==Proof of reciprocity==
For a complete proof, see the reciprocity (electromagnetism) article. Here, we present a common simple proof limited to the approximation of two antennas separated by a large distance compared to the size of the antenna, in a homogeneous medium. The first antenna is the test antenna whose patterns are to be investigated; this antenna is free to point in any direction. The second antenna is a reference antenna, which points rigidly at the first antenna.

Each antenna is alternately connected to a transmitter having a particular source impedance, and a receiver having the same input impedance (the impedance may differ between the two antennas).

It is assumed that the two antennas are sufficiently far apart that the properties of the transmitting antenna are not affected by the load placed upon it by the receiving antenna. Consequently, the amount of power transferred from the transmitter to the receiver can be expressed as the product of two independent factors; one depending on the directional properties of the transmitting antenna, and the other depending on the directional properties of the receiving antenna.

For the transmitting antenna, by the definition of gain, formula_1, the radiation power density at a distance formula_2 from the antenna (i.e. the power passing through unit area) is

:formula_3.

Here, the angles formula_4 and formula_5 indicate a dependence on direction from the antenna, and formula_6 stands for the power the transmitter would deliver into a matched load. The gain formula_1 may be broken down into three factors; the antenna gain (the directional redistribution of the power), the radiation efficiency (accounting for ohmic losses in the antenna), and lastly the loss due to mismatch between the antenna and transmitter. Strictly, to include the mismatch, it should be called the realized gain, but this is not common usage.

For the receiving antenna, the power delivered to the receiver is

:formula_8.

Here formula_9 is the power density of the incident radiation, and formula_10 is the antenna aperture or effective area of the antenna (the area the antenna would need to occupy in order to intercept the observed captured power). The directional arguments are now relative to the receiving antenna, and again formula_10 is taken to include ohmic and mismatch losses.

Putting these expressions together, the power transferred from transmitter to receiver is

:formula_12,

where formula_1 and formula_10 are directionally dependent properties of the transmitting and receiving antennas respectively. For transmission from the reference
antenna (2), to the test antenna (1), that is

:formula_15,

and for transmission in the opposite direction

:formula_16.

Here, the gain formula_17 and effective area formula_18 of antenna 2 are fixed, because the orientation of this antenna is fixed with respect to the first.

Now for a given disposition of the antennas, the reciprocity theorem requires that the power transfer is equally effective in each direction, i.e.

:formula_19,

whence

:formula_20.

But the right hand side of this equation is fixed (because the orientation of antenna 2 is fixed), and so

:formula_21,

i.e. the directional dependence of the (receiving) effective aperture and the (transmitting) gain are identical (QED). Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is the same irrespective of the nature of the antenna, and so must be the same for all antennas. Analysis of a particular antenna (such as a Hertzian dipole), shows that this constant is formula_22, where formula_23 is the free-space wavelength. Hence, for any antenna the gain and the effective aperture are related by

:formula_24.

Even for a receiving antenna, it is more usual to state the gain than to specify the effective aperture. The power delivered to the receiver is therefore more usually written as

:formula_25

(see link budget). The effective aperture is however of interest for comparison with the actual physical size of the antenna.

===Practical consequences===

* When determining the pattern of a receiving antenna by computer simulation, it is not necessary to perform a calculation for every possible angle of incidence. Instead, the radiation pattern of the antenna is determined by a single simulation, and the receiving pattern inferred by reciprocity.
* When determining the pattern of an antenna by measurement, the antenna may be either receiving or transmitting, whichever is more convenient.
* For a practical antenna, the side lobe level should be minimum, it is necessary to have the maximum directivity.

<text>In telecommunications and position fixing, the term radio fix has the following meanings:

*The locating of a radio transmitter by bearings taken from two or more direction finding stations, the site of the transmitter being at the point of intersection.
*The location of a ship or aircraft by determining the direction of radio signals coming to the ship or aircraft from two or more sending stations, the locations of which are known.

Compare triangulation.

==Obtaining a radio fix==


A single transmitter can be used to give a line of position (LOP) of the craft. The (true) bearing to the station from the craft, TB or QUJ, is composed of the true heading, TH, plus the relative bearing, RB, of the station. The bearing from the station (QTE) is found by adding 180° to the QUJ figure.

The line of position is then the line of bearing QUJ (i.e. from the station to the receiver) passing through the station.

:formula_1

For the diagram on the right, we have:

:formula_2
:formula_3

A radio fix on two stations can be found in exactly the same way. The intersection of the two position lines gives the position of the receiver. For the diagram on the right, the LOPs are found as before:

:formula_4
:formula_5

:formula_6
:formula_7

Remembering that the LOPs pass through their respective stations, it is now simple to find the location of the craft.

Remember too, that bearings and direction are given/recorded with respect to True North and to Magnetic North. Values used by mobile stations usually need to be converted from Magnetic to True. (Fixed stations are expected to use True).

<text>Radiometry is a set of techniques for measuring electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. Radiometric techniques in optics characterize the distribution of the radiation&#x27;s power in space, as opposed to photometric techniques, which characterize the light&#x27;s interaction with the human eye. The fundamental difference between radiometry and photometry is that radiometry gives the entire optical radiation spectrum, while photometry is limited to the visible spectrum. Radiometry is distinct from quantum techniques such as photon counting.

The use of radiometers to determine the temperature of objects and gasses by measuring radiation flux is called pyrometry. Handheld pyrometer devices are often marketed as infrared thermometers.

Radiometry is important in astronomy, especially radio astronomy, and plays a significant role in Earth remote sensing. The measurement techniques categorized as &quot;radiometry&quot; in optics are called &quot;photometry&quot; in some astronomical applications, contrary to the optics usage of the term.

Spectroradiometry is the measurement of absolute radiometric quantities in narrow bands of wavelength.

== Radiometric quantities ==

== Integral and spectral radiometric quantities ==
Integral quantities (like radiant flux) describe the total effect of radiation of all wavelengths or frequencies, while spectral quantities (like spectral power) describe the effect of radiation of a single wavelength or frequency . To each integral quantity there are corresponding spectral quantities, defined as the quotient of the integrated quantity by the range of frequency or wavelength considered. For example, the radiant flux Φe corresponds to the spectral power Φe, and Φe.

Getting an integral quantity&#x27;s spectral counterpart requires a limit transition. This comes from the idea that the precisely requested wavelength photon existence probability is zero. Let us show the relation between them using the radiant flux as an example:

Integral flux, whose unit is W:
formula_1
Spectral flux by wavelength, whose unit is :
formula_2
where formula_3 is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small wavelength interval formula_4.
The area under a plot with wavelength horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

Spectral flux by frequency, whose unit is :
formula_5
where formula_3 is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small frequency interval formula_7.
The area under a plot with frequency horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

The spectral quantities by wavelength and frequency are related to each other, since the product of the two variables is the speed of light (formula_8):
:formula_9 or formula_10 or formula_11

The integral quantity can be obtained by the spectral quantity&#x27;s integration:

formula_12

<text>A random number is generated by a random (stochastic) process such as throwing Dice. Individual numbers can&#x27;t be predicted, but the likely result of generating a large quantity of numbers can be predicted by specific mathematical series and statistics.

==Algorithms and implementations==
Random numbers are frequently used in algorithms such as Knuth&#x27;s 1964-developed algorithm for shuffling lists. (popularly known as &quot;the Knuth shuffle&quot; or &quot;the Fisher–Yates shuffle&quot;, based on work they did in 1938).

In 1999, a new feature was added to the Pentium III: a hardware-based random number generator. It has been described as &quot;several oscillators combine their outputs and that odd waveform is sampled asynchronously.&quot; These numbers, however, were only 32 bit, at a time when export controls were on 56 bits and higher, so they were not state of the art.

==Common understanding==
In common understanding, &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; is not as random as &quot;3 5 2 1 4&quot; and certainly not as random as &quot;47 88 1 32 41&quot; but &quot;we can&#x27;t say authoritavely that the first sequence is not random ... it could have been generated by chance.&quot;

When a police officer claims to have done a &quot;random .. door-to-door&quot; search, there is a certain expectation that members of a jury will have.

==Real world consequences==
Flaws in &quot;randomness&quot; have real-world consequences.

A 99.8% randomness was shown by researchers to negatively affect an estimated 27,000 customers of a large service and that the problem was not limited to just that situation.

<text>In telecommunications, receive-after-transmit time delay is the time interval between (a) the instant of keying off the local transmitter to stop transmitting and (b) the instant the local receiver output has increased to 90% of its steady-state value in response to an RF signal from another transmitter. 

The RF signal from the distant transmitter must exist at the local receiver input prior to, or at the time of, keying off the local transmitter. 

Receive-after-transmit time delay applies only to half-duplex operation.

<text>In telecommunications, attack-time delay is the time needed for a receiver or transmitter to respond to an incoming signal.

For a receiver, the attack-time delay is defined as the time interval from the instant a step radio-frequency signal, at a level equal to the receiver&#x27;s threshold of sensitivity, is applied to the receiver input, to the instant when the receiver&#x27;s output amplitude reaches 90% of its steady-state value. If a squelch circuit is operating, the receiver attack-time delay includes the time for the receiver to break squelch. 

For a transmitter, the attack-time delay is defined as the interval from the instant the transmitter is keyed-on to the instant the transmitted radio-frequency signal amplitude has increased to a specified level, usually 90% of its key-on steady-state value. The transmitter attack-time delay excludes the time required for automatic antenna tuning.

<text>In geometry, a cycloid is the curve traced by a point on a circle as it rolls along a straight line without slipping. A cycloid is a specific form of trochoid and is an example of a roulette, a curve generated by a curve rolling on another curve.

The cycloid, with the cusps pointing upward, is the curve of fastest descent under uniform gravity (the brachistochrone curve). It is also the form of a curve for which the period of an object in simple harmonic motion (rolling up and down repetitively) along the curve does not depend on the object&#x27;s starting position (the tautochrone curve). In physics, when a charged particle at rest is put under a uniform electric and magnetic field perpendicular to one another, the particle’s trajectory draws out a cycloid.

== History ==
The cycloid has been called &quot;The Helen of Geometers&quot; as, like Helen of Troy, it caused frequent quarrels among 17th-century mathematicians, while Sarah Hart sees it named as such &quot;because the properties of this curve are so beautiful&quot;.

Historians of mathematics have proposed several candidates for the discoverer of the cycloid. Mathematical historian Paul Tannery speculated that such a simple curve must have been known to the ancients, citing similar work by Carpus of Antioch described by Iamblichus. English mathematician John Wallis writing in 1679 attributed the discovery to Nicholas of Cusa, but subsequent scholarship indicates that either Wallis was mistaken or the evidence he used is now lost. Galileo Galilei&#x27;s name was put forward at the end of the 19th century and at least one author reports credit being given to Marin Mersenne. Beginning with the work of Moritz Cantor and Siegmund Günther, scholars now assign priority to French mathematician Charles de Bovelles based on his description of the cycloid in his &quot;Introductio in geometriam&quot;, published in 1503. In this work, Bovelles mistakes the arch traced by a rolling wheel as part of a larger circle with a radius 120% larger than the smaller wheel.

Galileo originated the term &quot;cycloid&quot; and was the first to make a serious study of the curve. According to his student Evangelista Torricelli, in 1599 Galileo attempted the quadrature of the cycloid (determining the area under the cycloid) with an unusually empirical approach that involved tracing both the generating circle and the resulting cycloid on sheet metal, cutting them out and weighing them. He discovered the ratio was roughly 3:1, which is the true value, but he incorrectly concluded the ratio was an irrational fraction, which would have made quadrature impossible. Around 1628, Gilles Persone de Roberval likely learned of the quadrature problem from Père Marin Mersenne and effected the quadrature in 1634 by using Cavalieri&#x27;s Theorem. However, this work was not published until 1693 (in his &quot;Traité des Indivisibles&quot;).

Constructing the tangent of the cycloid dates to August 1638 when Mersenne received unique methods from Roberval, Pierre de Fermat and René Descartes. Mersenne passed these results along to Galileo, who gave them to his students Torricelli and Viviani, who were able to produce a quadrature. This result and others were published by Torricelli in 1644, which is also the first printed work on the cycloid. This led to Roberval charging Torricelli with plagiarism, with the controversy cut short by Torricelli&#x27;s early death in 1647.

In 1658, Blaise Pascal had given up mathematics for theology but, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest. Pascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Roberval and Senator Carcavy were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by John Wallis and Antoine de Lalouvère) was judged to be adequate. While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren&#x27;s proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Duo&quot;, giving Wren priority for the first published proof.

Fifteen years later, Christiaan Huygens had deployed the cycloidal pendulum to improve chronometers and had discovered that a particle would traverse a segment of an inverted cycloidal arch in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point. In 1686, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz used analytic geometry to describe the curve with a single equation. In 1696, Johann Bernoulli posed the brachistochrone problem, the solution of which is a cycloid.

== Equations ==
The cycloid through the origin, generated by a circle of radius rolling over the &quot;-&quot;axis on the positive side (), consists of the points , with
formula_1
where is a real parameter corresponding to the angle through which the rolling circle has rotated. For given , the circle&#x27;s centre lies at .

The Cartesian equation is obtained by solving the &quot;&quot;-equation for and substituting into the &quot;-&quot;equation:formula_2or, eliminating the multiple-valued inverse cosine:formula_3When is viewed as a function of , the cycloid is differentiable everywhere except at the cusps on the -axis, with the derivative tending toward formula_4 or formula_5 near a cusp (where ). The map from to is differentiable, in fact of class ∞, with derivative 0 at the cusps.

The slope of the tangent to the cycloid at the point formula_6 is given by formula_7.

A cycloid segment from one cusp to the next is called an arch of the cycloid, for example the points with formula_8 and formula_9.

Considering the cycloid as the graph of a function formula_10, it satisfies the differential equation:

:formula_11
If we define formula_12 as the height difference from the cycloid&#x27;s vertex (the point with a horizontal tangent and formula_13), then we have:
:formula_14

==Involute==

The involute of the cycloid has exactly the same shape as the cycloid it originates from. This can be visualized as the path traced by the tip of a wire initially lying on a half arch of the cycloid: as it unrolls while remaining tangent to the original cycloid, it describes a new cycloid (see also cycloidal pendulum and arc length).

===Demonstration===

This demonstration uses the rolling-wheel definition of cycloid, as well as the instantaneous velocity vector of a moving point, tangent to its trajectory. In the adjacent picture, formula_15 and formula_16 are two points belonging to two rolling circles, with the base of the first just above the top of the second. Initially, formula_15 and formula_16 coincide at the intersection point of the two circles. When the circles roll horizontally with the same speed, formula_15 and formula_16 traverse two cycloid curves. Considering the red line connecting formula_15 and formula_16 at a given time, one proves &quot;the line is always&quot; &quot;tangent to the lower arc at formula_16 and orthogonal to the upper arc at formula_15&quot;. Let formula_25 be the point in common between the upper and lower circles at the given time. Then:
*formula_26 are colinear: indeed the equal rolling speed gives equal angles formula_27, and thus formula_28 . The point formula_25 lies on the line formula_30 therefore formula_31 and analogously formula_32. From the equality of formula_33 and formula_34 one has that also formula_35. It follows formula_36 .
*If formula_37 is the meeting point between the perpendicular from formula_15 to the line segment formula_30 and the tangent to the circle at formula_16 , then the triangle formula_41 is isosceles, as is easily seen from the construction: formula_42 and formula_43formula_44 . For the previous noted equality between formula_45 and formula_46 then formula_47 and formula_41 is isosceles.
*Drawing from formula_16 the orthogonal segment to formula_30, from formula_15 the straight line tangent to the upper circle, and calling formula_52 the meeting point, one sees that formula_53 is a rhombus using the theorems on angles between parallel lines
*Now consider the velocity formula_54 of formula_16 . It can be seen as the sum of two components, the rolling velocity formula_56 and the drifting velocity formula_57, which are equal in modulus because the circles roll without skidding. formula_57 is parallel to formula_59, while formula_56 is tangent to the lower circle at formula_16 and therefore is parallel to formula_62. The rhombus constituted from the components formula_57 and formula_56 is therefore similar (same angles) to the rhombus formula_65 because they have parallel sides. Then formula_54, the total velocity of formula_16, is parallel to formula_68 because both are diagonals of two rhombuses with parallel sides and has in common with formula_69 the contact point formula_16. Thus the velocity vector formula_54 lies on the prolongation of formula_69 . Because formula_54 is tangent to the cycloid at formula_16, it follows that also formula_69 coincides with the tangent to the lower cycloid at formula_16.
*Analogously, it can be easily demonstrated that formula_69 is orthogonal to formula_78 (the other diagonal of the rhombus).
*This proves that the tip of a wire initially stretched on a half arch of the lower cycloid and fixed to the upper circle at formula_15 will follow the point along its path &quot;without changing its length&quot; because the speed of the tip is at each moment orthogonal to the wire (no stretching or compression). The wire will be at the same time tangent at formula_16 to the lower arc because of the tension and the facts demonstrated above. (If it were not tangent there would be a discontinuity at formula_16 and consequently unbalanced tension forces.)

== Area ==
Using the above parameterization formula_82, the area under one arch, formula_83 is given by:
formula_84

This is three times the area of the rolling circle.

== Arc length ==

The arc length of one arch is given by
formula_85

Another geometric way to calculate the length of the cycloid is to notice that when a wire describing an involute has been completely unwrapped from half an arch, it extends itself along two diameters, a length of . This is thus equal to half the length of arch, and that of a complete arch is .

From the cycloid&#x27;s vertex (the point with a horizontal tangent and formula_13) to any point within the same arch, the arc length squared is formula_87, which is proportional to the height difference formula_88; this property is the basis for the cycloid&#x27;s isochronism. In fact, the arc length squared is equal to the height difference multiplied by the full arch length .

== Cycloidal pendulum ==

If a simple pendulum is suspended from the cusp of an inverted cycloid, such that the string is constrained to be tangent to one of its arches, and the pendulum&#x27;s length &quot;L&quot; is equal to that of half the arc length of the cycloid (i.e., twice the diameter of the generating circle, &quot;L = 4r&quot;), the bob of the pendulum also traces a cycloid path. Such a pendulum is isochronous, with equal-time swings regardless of amplitude. Introducing a coordinate system centred in the position of the cusp, the equation of motion is given by:
formula_89
where formula_90 is the angle that the straight part of the string makes with the vertical axis, and is given by
formula_91
where is the &quot;amplitude&quot;, formula_92 is the radian frequency of the pendulum and &quot;g&quot; the gravitational acceleration.
The 17th-century Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens discovered and proved these properties of the cycloid while searching for more accurate pendulum clock designs to be used in navigation.

== Related curves ==
Several curves are related to the cycloid.
* Trochoid: generalization of a cycloid in which the point tracing the curve may be inside the rolling circle (curtate) or outside (prolate).
* Hypocycloid: variant of a cycloid in which a circle rolls on the inside of another circle instead of a line.
* Epicycloid: variant of a cycloid in which a circle rolls on the outside of another circle instead of a line.
* Hypotrochoid: generalization of a hypocycloid where the generating point may not be on the edge of the rolling circle.
* Epitrochoid: generalization of an epicycloid where the generating point may not be on the edge of the rolling circle.

All these curves are roulettes with a circle rolled along another curve of uniform curvature. The cycloid, epicycloids, and hypocycloids have the property that each is similar to its evolute. If &quot;q&quot; is the product of that curvature with the circle&#x27;s radius, signed positive for epi- and negative for hypo-, then the similitude ratio of curve to evolute is 1 + 2&quot;q&quot;.

The classic Spirograph toy traces out hypotrochoid and epitrochoid curves.

== Other uses ==
The cycloidal arch was used by architect Louis Kahn in his design for the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. It was also used by Wallace K. Harrison in the design of the Hopkins Center at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

Early research indicated that some transverse arching curves of the plates of golden age violins are closely modeled by curtate cycloid curves. Later work indicates that curtate cycloids do not serve as general models for these curves, which vary considerably.

<doc id="41641" wikidata="Q1852282" url="?curid=41641" title="Reflection coefficient">
<text>In physics and electrical engineering the reflection coefficient is a parameter that describes how much of a wave is reflected by an impedance discontinuity in the transmission medium. It is equal to the ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave to the incident wave, with each expressed as phasors. For example, it is used in optics to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface with a different index of refraction, such as a glass surface, or in an electrical transmission line to calculate how much of the electromagnetic wave is reflected by an impedance discontinuity. The reflection coefficient is closely related to the &quot;transmission coefficient&quot;. The reflectance of a system is also sometimes called a reflection coefficient.

Different specialties have different applications for the term.

== Transmission lines ==
In telecommunications and transmission line theory, the reflection coefficient is the ratio of the complex amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave. The voltage and current at any point along a transmission line can always be resolved into forward and reflected traveling waves given a specified reference impedance &quot;Z0&quot;. The reference impedance used is typically the characteristic impedance of a transmission line that&#x27;s involved, but one can speak of reflection coefficient without any actual transmission line being present. In terms of the forward and reflected waves determined by the voltage and current, the reflection coefficient is defined as the complex ratio of the voltage of the reflected wave (formula_1) to that of the incident wave (formula_2). This is typically represented with a formula_3 (capital gamma) and can be written as:

:formula_4

It can as well be defined using the &quot;currents&quot; associated with the reflected and forward waves, but introducing a minus sign to account for the opposite orientations of the two currents:

:formula_5

The reflection coefficient may also be established using other field or circuit pairs of quantities whose product defines power resolvable into a forward and reverse wave. For instance, with electromagnetic plane waves, one uses the ratio of the electric fields of the reflected to that of the forward wave (or magnetic fields, again with a minus sign); the ratio of each wave&#x27;s electric field &quot;E&quot; to its magnetic field &quot;H&quot; is again an impedance &quot;Z&quot;0 (equal to the impedance of free space in a vacuum). Similarly in acoustics one uses the acoustic pressure and velocity respectively.
In the accompanying figure, a signal source with internal impedance formula_6 possibly followed by a transmission line of characteristic impedance formula_6 is represented by its Thévenin equivalent, driving the load formula_8. For a real (resistive) source impedance formula_6, if we define formula_3 using the reference impedance formula_11 then the source&#x27;s maximum power is delivered to a load formula_12, in which case formula_13 implying no reflected power. More generally, the squared-magnitude of the reflection coefficient formula_14 denotes the proportion of that power that is reflected back to the source, with the power actually delivered toward the load being formula_15.

Anywhere along an intervening (lossless) transmission line of characteristic impedance formula_16, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient formula_17 will remain the same (the powers of the forward and reflected waves stay the same) but with a different phase. In the case of a short circuited load (formula_18), one finds formula_19 at the load. This implies the reflected wave having a 180° phase shift (phase reversal) with the voltages of the two waves being opposite at that point and adding to zero (as a short circuit demands).

=== Relation to load impedance ===
The reflection coefficient is determined by the load impedance at the end of the transmission line, as well as the characteristic impedance of the line. A load impedance of formula_8 terminating a line with a characteristic impedance of formula_21 will have a reflection coefficient of

:formula_22

This is the coefficient at the load. The reflection coefficient can also be measured at other points on the line. The &quot;magnitude&quot; of the reflection coefficient in a lossless transmission line is constant along the line (as are the powers in the forward and reflected waves). However its &quot;phase&quot; will be shifted by an amount dependent on the electrical distance formula_23 from the load. If the coefficient is measured at a point formula_24 meters from the load, so the electrical distance from the load is formula_25 radians, the coefficient formula_26 at that point will be 

: formula_27

Note that the phase of the reflection coefficient is changed by &quot;twice&quot; the phase length of the attached transmission line. That is to take into account not only the phase delay of the reflected wave, but the phase shift that had first been applied to the forward wave, with the reflection coefficient being the quotient of these. The reflection coefficient so measured, formula_26, corresponds to an impedance which is generally dissimilar to formula_8 present at the far side of the transmission line.

The complex reflection coefficient (in the region formula_30, corresponding to passive loads) may be displayed graphically using a Smith chart. The Smith chart is a polar plot of formula_3, therefore the magnitude of formula_3 is given directly by the distance of a point to the center (with the edge of the Smith chart corresponding to formula_33). Its evolution along a transmission line is likewise described by a rotation of formula_34 around the chart&#x27;s center. Using the scales on a Smith chart, the resulting impedance (normalized to formula_16) can directly be read. Before the advent of modern electronic computers, the Smith chart was of particular use as a sort of analog computer for this purpose.

=== Standing wave ratio ===

The standing wave ratio (SWR) is determined solely by the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the reflection coefficient:

:formula_36

Along a lossless transmission line of characteristic impedance &quot;Z&quot;0, the SWR signifies the ratio of the voltage (or current) maxima to minima (or what it would be if the transmission line were long enough to produce them). The above calculation assumes that formula_3 has been calculated using &quot;Z&quot;0 as the reference impedance. Since it uses only the &quot;magnitude&quot; of formula_3, the SWR intentionally ignores the specific value of the load impedance &quot;ZL&quot; responsible for it, but only the magnitude of the resulting impedance mismatch. That SWR remains the same wherever measured along a transmission line (looking towards the load) since the addition of a transmission line length to a load formula_8 only changes the phase, not magnitude of formula_3. While having a one-to-one correspondence with reflection coefficient, SWR is the most commonly used figure of merit in describing the mismatch affecting a radio antenna or antenna system. It is most often measured at the transmitter side of a transmission line, but having, as explained, the same value as would be measured at the antenna (load) itself.

== Seismology ==
Reflection coefficient is used in feeder testing for reliability of medium.

== Optics and microwaves ==

In optics and electromagnetics in general, &quot;reflection coefficient&quot; can refer to either the amplitude reflection coefficient described here, or the reflectance, depending on context. Typically, the reflectance is represented by a capital &quot;R&quot;, while the amplitude reflection coefficient is represented by a lower-case &quot;r&quot;. These related concepts are covered by Fresnel equations in classical optics.

== Acoustics ==

Acousticians use reflection coefficients to understand the effect of different materials on their acoustic environments.

<text>In telecommunications and radar, a reflective array antenna is a class of directive antennas in which multiple driven elements are mounted in front of a flat surface designed to reflect the radio waves in a desired direction. They are a type of array antenna. They are often used in the VHF and UHF frequency bands. VHF examples are generally large and resemble a highway billboard, so they are sometimes called billboard antennas. Other names are bedspring array and bowtie array depending on the type of elements making up the antenna. The curtain array is a larger version used by shortwave radio broadcasting stations.

Reflective array antennas usually have a number of identical driven elements, fed in phase, in front of a flat, electrically large reflecting surface to produce a unidirectional beam of radio waves, increasing antenna gain and reducing radiation in unwanted directions. The larger the number of elements used, the higher the gain; the narrower the beam is and the smaller the sidelobes are. The individual elements are most commonly half wave dipoles, although they sometimes contain parasitic elements as well as driven elements. The reflector may be a metal sheet or more commonly a wire screen. A metal screen reflects radio waves as well as a solid metal sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about one-tenth of a wavelength, so screens are often used to reduce weight and wind loads on the antenna. They usually consist of a grill of parallel wires or rods, oriented parallel to the axis of the dipole elements.

The driven elements are fed by a network of transmission lines, which divide the power from the RF source equally between the elements. This often has the circuit geometry of a tree structure.

==Basic concepts==
===Radio signals===
When a radio signal passes a conductor, it induces an electrical current in it. Since the radio signal fills space, and the conductor has a finite size, the induced currents add up or cancel out as they move along the conductor. A basic goal of antenna design is to make the currents add up to a maximum at the point where the energy is tapped off. To do this, the antenna elements are sized in relation to the wavelength of the radio signal, with the aim of setting up standing waves of current that are maximized at the feed point.

This means that an antenna designed to receive a particular wavelength has a natural size. To improve reception, one cannot simply make the antenna larger; this will improve the amount of signal intercepted by the antenna, which is largely a function of area, but will lower the efficiency of the reception (at a given wavelength). Thus, in order to improve reception, antenna designers often use multiple elements, combining them together so their signals add up. These are known as &quot;antenna arrays&quot;.

===Array phasing===
In order for the signals to add together, they need to arrive in-phase. Consider two dipole antennas placed in a line end-to-end, or &quot;collinear&quot;. If the resulting array is pointed directly at the source signal, both dipoles will see the same instantaneous signal, and thus their reception will be in-phase. However, if one were to rotate the antenna so it was at an angle to the signal, the extra path from the signal to the more distant dipole means it receives the signal slightly out of phase. When the two signals are then added up, they no longer strictly reinforce each other, and the output drops. This makes the array more sensitive horizontally, while stacking the dipoles in parallel narrows the pattern vertically. This allows the designer to tailor the reception pattern, and thus the gain, by moving the elements about.

If the antenna is properly aligned with the signal, at any given instant in time, all of the elements in an array will receive the same signal and be in-phase. However, the output from each element has to be gathered up at a single feed point, and as the signals travel across the antenna to that point, their phase is changing. In a two-element array this is not a problem because the feed point can be placed between them; any phase shift taking place in the transmission lines is equal for both elements. However, if one extends this to a four-element array, this approach no longer works, as the signal from the outer pair has to travel further and will thus be at a different phase than the inner pair when it reaches the center. To ensure that they all arrive with the same phase, it is common to see additional transmission wire inserted in the signal path, or for the transmission line to be crossed over to reverse the phase if the difference is greater than a wavelength.

===Reflectors===
The gain can be further improved through the addition of a &quot;reflector&quot;. Generally any conductor in a flat sheet will act in a mirror-like fashion for radio signals, but this also holds true for non-continuous surfaces as long as the gaps between the conductors are less than about of the target wavelength. This means that wire mesh or even parallel wires or metal bars can be used, which is especially useful both for reducing the total amount of material as well as reducing wind loads.

Due to the change in signal propagation direction on reflection, the signal undergoes a reversal of phase. In order for the reflector to add to the output signal, it has to reach the elements in-phase. Generally this would require the reflector to be placed at of a wavelength behind the elements, and this can be seen in many common reflector arrays like television antennas. However, there are a number of factors that can change this distance, and actual reflector positioning varies.

Reflectors also have the advantage of reducing the signal received from the back of the antenna. Signals received from the rear and re-broadcast from the reflector have not undergone a change of phase, and do not add to the signal from the front. This greatly improves the front-to-back ratio of the antenna, making it more directional. This can be useful when a more directional signal is desired, or unwanted signals are present. There are cases when this is not desirable, and although reflectors are commonly seen in array antennas, they are not universal. For instance, while UHF television antennas often use an array of bowtie antennas with a reflector, a bowtie array without a reflector is a relatively common design in the microwave region.

===Gain limits===
As more elements are added to an array, the beamwidth of the antenna&#x27;s main lobe decreases, leading to an increase in gain. In theory there is no limit to this process. However, as the number of elements increases, the complexity of the required feed network that keeps the signals in-phase increases. Ultimately, the rising inherent losses in the feed network become greater than the additional gain achieved with more elements, limiting the maximum gain that can be achieved.

 The gain of practical array antennas is limited to about 25–30 dB. Two half wave elements spaced a half wave apart and a quarter wave from a reflecting screen have been used as a standard gain antenna with about 9.8 dBi at its design frequency. Common 4-bay television antennas have gains around 10 to 12 dB, and 8-bay designs might increase this to 12 to 16 dB. The 32-element SCR-270 had a gain around 19.8 dB. Some very large reflective arrays have been constructed, notably the Soviet Duga radars which are hundreds of meters across and contain hundreds of elements. &quot;Active&quot; array antennas, in which groups of elements are driven by separate RF amplifiers, can have much higher gain, but are prohibitively expensive.

Since the 1980s, versions for use at microwave frequencies have been made with patch antenna elements mounted in front of a metal surface.

== Radiation pattern and beam steering ==
When driven in phase, the radiation pattern of the reflective array is a single main lobe perpendicular to the plane of the antenna, plus several sidelobes at equal angles to either side. The more elements used, the narrower the main lobe and the less power is radiated in the sidelobes.

The main lobe of the antenna can be steered electronically within a limited angle by phase shifting the drive signals applied to the individual elements. Each antenna element is fed through a phase shifter which can be controlled digitally, delaying each signal by a successive amount. This causes the wavefronts created by the superposition of the individual elements to be at an angle to the plane of the antenna. Antennas that use this technique are called phased arrays and often used in modern radar systems. 

Another option for steering the beam is mounting the entire antenna structure on a pivoting platform and rotating it mechanically.

<doc id="41644" wikidata="Q663650" url="?curid=41644" title="Reflectance">
<text>The reflectance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in reflecting radiant energy. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is reflected at the boundary. Reflectance is a component of the response of the electronic structure of the material to the electromagnetic field of light, and is in general a function of the frequency, or wavelength, of the light, its polarization, and the angle of incidence. The dependence of reflectance on the wavelength is called a &quot;reflectance spectrum&quot; or &quot;spectral reflectance curve&quot;.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Hemispherical reflectance===
The &quot;hemispherical reflectance&quot; of a surface, denoted , is defined as
formula_1
where is the radiant flux &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface and is the radiant flux &quot;received&quot; by that surface.

===Spectral hemispherical reflectance===
The &quot;spectral hemispherical reflectance in frequency&quot; and &quot;spectral hemispherical reflectance in wavelength&quot; of a surface, denoted and respectively, are defined as
formula_2
formula_3
where
* is the spectral radiant flux in frequency &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface;
* is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that surface;
* is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface;
* is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that surface.

===Directional reflectance===
The &quot;directional reflectance&quot; of a surface, denoted &quot;R&quot;Ω, is defined as
formula_4
where
* is the radiance &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface;
* is the radiance received by that surface.

This depends on both the reflected direction and the incoming direction. In other words, it has a value for every combination of incoming and outgoing directions. It is related to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function and its upper limit is 1. Another measure of reflectance, depending only on the outgoing direction, is &quot;I&quot;/&quot;F&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; is the radiance reflected in a given direction and &quot;F&quot; is the incoming radiance averaged over all directions, in other words, the total flux of radiation hitting the surface per unit area, divided by π. This can be greater than 1 for a glossy surface illuminated by a source such as the sun, with the reflectance measured in the direction of maximum radiance (see also Seeliger effect).

===Spectral directional reflectance===
The &quot;spectral directional reflectance in frequency&quot; and &quot;spectral directional reflectance in wavelength&quot; of a surface, denoted and respectively, are defined as
formula_5
formula_6
where
* is the spectral radiance in frequency &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface;
* is the spectral radiance received by that surface;
* is the spectral radiance in wavelength &quot;reflected&quot; by that surface;
* is the spectral radiance in wavelength received by that surface.

Again, one can also define a value of (see above) for a given wavelength.

==Reflectivity==
For homogeneous and semi-infinite (see halfspace) materials, reflectivity is the same as reflectance. 
Reflectivity is the square of the magnitude of the Fresnel reflection coefficient,
which is the ratio of the reflected to incident electric field; 
as such the reflection coefficient can be expressed as a complex number as determined by the Fresnel equations for a single layer, whereas the reflectance is always a positive real number.

For layered and finite media, according to the CIE, reflectivity is distinguished from &quot;reflectance&quot; by the fact that reflectivity is a value that applies to &quot;thick&quot; reflecting objects. When reflection occurs from thin layers of material, internal reflection effects can cause the reflectance to vary with surface thickness. Reflectivity is the limit value of reflectance as the sample becomes thick; it is the intrinsic reflectance of the surface, hence irrespective of other parameters such as the reflectance of the rear surface. Another way to interpret this is that the reflectance is the fraction of electromagnetic power reflected from a specific sample, while reflectivity is a property of the material itself, which would be measured on a perfect machine if the material filled half of all space.

==Surface type==
Given that reflectance is a directional property, most surfaces can be divided into those that give specular reflection and those that give diffuse reflection.

For specular surfaces, such as glass or polished metal, reflectance is nearly zero at all angles except at the appropriate reflected angle; that is the same angle with respect to the surface normal in the plane of incidence, but on the opposing side. When the radiation is incident normal to the surface, it is reflected back into the same direction.

For diffuse surfaces, such as matte white paint, reflectance is uniform; radiation is reflected in all angles equally or near-equally. Such surfaces are said to be Lambertian.

Most practical objects exhibit a combination of diffuse and specular reflective properties.

==Water reflectance==
Reflection occurs when light moves from a medium with one index of refraction into a second medium with a different index of refraction.

Specular reflection from a body of water is calculated by the Fresnel equations. Fresnel reflection is directional and therefore does not contribute significantly to albedo which primarily diffuses reflection.

A real water surface may be wavy. Reflectance, which assumes a flat surface as given by the Fresnel equations, can be adjusted to account for waviness.

==Grating efficiency==
The generalization of reflectance to a diffraction grating, which disperses light by wavelength, is called &quot;diffraction efficiency&quot;.

<text>Refractive index contrast, in an optical waveguide, such as an optical fiber, is a measure of the relative difference in refractive index of the core and cladding. The refractive index contrast, Δ, is often given by formula_1, where &quot;n&quot;1 is the maximum refractive index in the core (or simply the core index for a step-index profile) and &quot;n&quot;2 is the refractive index of the cladding. The criterion &quot;n&quot;2 &lt; &quot;n&quot;1 must be satisfied in order to sustain a guided mode by total internal reflection. Alternative formulations include formula_2 and formula_3. Normal optical fibers, constructed of different glasses, have very low refractive index contrast (Δ«1) and hence are weakly-guiding. The weak guiding will cause a greater portion of the cross-sectional Electric field profile to reside within the cladding (as evanescent tails of the guided mode) as compared to strongly-guided waveguides. Integrated optics can make use of higher core index to obtain Δ&gt;1 allowing light to be efficiently guided around corners on the micro-scale, where popular high-Δ material platform is silicon-on-insulator. High-Δ allows sub-wavelength core dimensions and so greater control over the size of the evanescent tails. The most efficient low-loss optical fibers require low Δ to minimise losses to light scattered outwards.

<text>In telecommunications, relative transmission level is the ratio of the signal power, at a given point in a transmission system, to a reference signal power. 

The ratio is usually determined by applying a standard test tone at zero transmission level point (or applying adjusted test tone power at any other point) and measuring the gain or loss to the location of interest. A distinction should be made between the standard test tone power and the expected median power of the actual signal required as the basis for the design of transmission systems.</text><links>

<doc id="41653" wikidata="Q7312134" url="?curid=41653" title="Remote call forwarding">
<text>In telecommunications, remote call forwarding is a service feature that allows incoming calls to be forwarded to a remote call forwarding number, such as a cell phone or another office location, and is designated by the call receiver.

Customers may have a remote-forwarding telephone number in a central switching office without having any other local telephone service in that office.

One common purpose for this service is to enable customers to retain their telephone number when they move to a location serviced by a different telephone exchange. The service is useful for business customers with widely advertised numbers which appear on headed paper, vehicles and various marketing literature. When customers ring, their calls are forwarded to the new location.

Remote call forwarding is also a means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign exchange line, this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local calls are flat-rated but trunk calls are expensive.

One alternative to RCF is Caller Redirect whereby callers simply hear an intercept message notifying them that the number has changed. Another alternative is to port the existing number to a voice over IP carrier, which is not tied to a single physical location as the subscriber may be anywhere on broadband Internet. However, not all phone numbers can be ported.

==Remote Access to Call Forwarding==
Remote Call Forwarding (RCF) requires neither a physical telephone set nor physical input by customer to get calls forwarded.

In this respect, it differs from the (similarly named) Remote Access to Call Forwarding in that the number is attached to a physical line where it rings normally until a call is made to a remote number to enable redirection.

To activate Remote Access to Call Forwarding, a subscriber calls a provider-supplied Remote Access Directory Number, enters the telephone number of the line to be redirected along with a personal identification number (PIN), a vertical service code (such as 72# or *73) and the number to which the calls are to be forwarded.

Remote Access to Call Forwarding allows incoming calls to be diverted and answered elsewhere if a subscriber cannot use their telephone normally (for instance, the number is assigned to a lost or stolen wireless handset or to a landline in need of repair service). In some cases, a business which subscribes to standard call forwarding (*72) may be able to request temporary redirection of inbound calls when calling a telco repair service number (such as 6-1-1) to report a line outage.

<doc id="41655" wikidata="Q273693" url="?curid=41655" title="Repeater">
<text>In telecommunications, a repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction. Some types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal, but alter its method of transmission, for example, on another frequency or baud rate.

There are several different types of repeaters; a telephone repeater is an amplifier in a telephone line, an optical repeater is an optoelectronic circuit that amplifies the light beam in an optical fiber cable; and a radio repeater is a radio receiver and transmitter that retransmits a radio signal. 

A broadcast relay station is a repeater used in broadcast radio and television.

==Overview==
When an information-bearing signal passes through a communication channel, it is progressively degraded due to loss of power. For example, when a telephone call passes through a wire telephone line, some of the power in the electric current which represents the audio signal is dissipated as heat in the resistance of the copper wire. The longer the wire, the more power is lost, and the smaller the amplitude of the signal at the far end. So with a long enough wire the call will not be audible at the other end. Similarly, the greater the distance between a radio station and a receiver, the weaker the radio signal, and the poorer the reception. A repeater is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of a signal and retransmits it, allowing it to travel further. Since it amplifies the signal, it requires a source of electric power.

The term &quot;repeater&quot; originated with telegraphy in the 19th century, and referred to an electromechanical device (a relay) used to regenerate telegraph signals. 

Use of the term has continued in telephony and data communications.

In computer networking, because repeaters work with the actual physical signal, and do not attempt to interpret the data being transmitted, they operate on the physical layer, the first layer of the OSI model; a multiport Ethernet repeater is usually called a hub.

== Types ==
=== Telephone repeater ===
This is used to increase the range of telephone signals in a telephone line.

:* Land line repeater
They are most frequently used in trunklines that carry long distance calls. In an analog telephone line consisting of a pair of wires, it consists of an amplifier circuit made of transistors which use power from a DC current source to increase the power of the alternating current audio signal on the line. Since the telephone is a duplex (bidirectional) communication system, the wire pair carries two audio signals, one going in each direction. So telephone repeaters have to be bilateral, amplifying the signal in both directions without causing feedback, which complicates their design considerably. Telephone repeaters were the first type of repeater and were some of the first applications of amplification. The development of telephone repeaters between 1900 and 1915 made long-distance phone service possible. Now, most telecommunications cables are fiber-optic cables which use optical repeaters (below).

Before the invention of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled carbon microphones were used as amplifiers in telephone repeaters. After the turn of the 20th century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and they were used. The invention of audion tube repeaters around 1916 made transcontinental telephony practical. In the 1930s vacuum tube repeaters using hybrid coils became commonplace, allowing the use of thinner wires. In the 1950s negative impedance gain devices were more popular, and a transistorized version called the E6 repeater was the final major type used in the Bell System before the low cost of digital transmission made all voiceband repeaters obsolete. Frequency frogging repeaters were commonplace in frequency-division multiplexing systems from the middle to late 20th century.

:* Submarine cable repeater
This is a type of telephone repeater used in underwater submarine telecommunications cables.
===Optical communications repeater===

This is used to increase the range of signals in a fiber-optic cable. Digital information travels through a fiber-optic cable in the form of short pulses of light. The light is made up of particles called photons, which can be absorbed or scattered in the fiber. An optical communications repeater usually consists of a phototransistor which converts the light pulses to an electrical signal, an amplifier to increase the power of the signal, an electronic filter which reshapes the pulses, and a laser which converts the electrical signal to light again and sends it out the other fiber. However, optical amplifiers are being developed for repeaters to amplify the light itself without the need of converting it to an electric signal first.

===Radio repeater===

This is used to extend the range of coverage of a radio signal. The history of radio relay repeaters began in 1898 from the publication by Johann Mattausch in Austrian Journal Zeitschrift für Electrotechnik (v. 16,
35 - 36). But his proposal &quot;Translator&quot; was primitive and not suitable for use. The first relay system with radio repeaters, which really functioned, was that invented in 1899 by Emile Guarini-Foresio.

A radio repeater usually consists of a radio receiver connected to a radio transmitter. The received signal is amplified and retransmitted, often on another frequency, to provide coverage beyond the obstruction. Usage of a duplexer can allow the repeater to use one antenna for both receive and transmit at the same time.

:* Broadcast relay station, rebroadcastor or translator: This is a repeater used to extend the coverage of a radio or television broadcasting station. It consists of a secondary radio or television transmitter. The signal from the main transmitter often comes over leased telephone lines or by microwave relay.

:* Microwave relay: This is a specialized point-to-point telecommunications link, consisting of a microwave receiver that receives information over a beam of microwaves from another relay station in line-of-sight distance, and a microwave transmitter which passes the information on to the next station over another beam of microwaves. Networks of microwave relay stations transmit telephone calls, television programs, and computer data from one city to another over continent-wide areas.

::* Passive repeater: This is a microwave relay that simply consists of a flat metal surface to reflect the microwave beam in another direction. It is used to get microwave relay signals over hills and mountains when it is not necessary to amplify the signal.

:* Cellular repeater: This is a radio repeater for boosting cell phone reception in a limited area. The device functions like a small cellular base station, with a directional antenna to receive the signal from the nearest cell tower, an amplifier, and a local antenna to rebroadcast the signal to nearby cell phones. It is often used in downtown office buildings.

:* Digipeater: A repeater node in a packet radio network. It performs a store and forward function, passing on packets of information from one node to another.

:* Amateur radio repeater: Used by amateur radio operators to enable two-way communication across an area which would otherwise be difficult by point-to-point on VHF and UHF. These repeaters are set up and maintained by individual operators or clubs, and are generally available for any licensed amateur to use. A hill or mountaintop location is a preferable location to construct a repeater, as it will maximize the usability across a large area.

Radio repeaters improve communication coverage in systems using frequencies that typically have line-of-sight propagation. Without a repeater, these systems are limited in range by the curvature of the Earth and the blocking effect of terrain or high buildings. A repeater on a hilltop or tall building can allow stations that are out of each other&#x27;s line-of-sight range to communicate reliably.

Radio repeaters may also allow translation from one set of radio frequencies to another, for example to allow two different public service agencies to interoperate (say, police and fire services of a city, or neighboring police departments). They may provide links to the public switched telephone network as well, or satellite network (BGAN, INMARSAT, MSAT) as an alternative path from source to the destination.

Typically a repeater station listens on one frequency, A, and transmits on a second, B. All mobile stations listen for signals on channel B and transmit on channel A. The difference between the two frequencies may be relatively small compared to the frequency of operation, say 1%. Often the repeater station will use the same antenna for transmission and reception; highly selective filters called &quot;duplexers&quot; separate the faint incoming received signal from the billions of times more powerful outbound transmitted signal. Sometimes separate transmitting and receiving locations are used, connected by a wire line or a radio link. While the repeater station is designed for simultaneous reception and transmission, mobile units need not be equipped with the bulky and costly duplexers, as they only transmit or receive at any time.

Mobile units in a repeater system may be provided with a &quot;talkaround&quot; channel that allows direct mobile-to-mobile operation on a single channel. This may be used if out of reach of the repeater system, or for communications not requiring the attention of all mobiles. The &quot;talkaround&quot; channel may be the repeater output frequency; the repeater will not retransmit any signals on its output frequency.

An engineered radio communication system designer will analyze the coverage area desired and select repeater locations, elevations, antennas, operating frequencies and power levels to permit a predictable level of reliable communication over the designed coverage area.

==Data handling==
Repeaters can be divided into two types depending on the type of data they handle:

===Analog repeater===
This type is used in channels that transmit data in the form of an analog signal in which the voltage or current is proportional to the amplitude of the signal, as in an audio signal. They are also used in trunklines that transmit multiple signals using frequency division multiplexing (FDM). Analog repeaters are composed of a linear amplifier, and may include electronic filters to compensate for frequency and phase distortion in the line.

===Digital repeater===
The digital repeater is used in channels that transmit data by binary digital signals, in which the data is in the form of pulses with only two possible values, representing the binary digits 1 and 0. A digital repeater amplifies the signal, and it also may retime, resynchronize, and reshape the pulses. A repeater that performs the retiming or resynchronizing functions may be called a regenerator.

<text>In telecommunications, a repeating coil is a voice-frequency transformer characterized by a closed magnetic core, a pair of identical balanced primary (line) windings, a pair of identical but not necessarily balanced secondary (drop) windings, and low transmission loss at voice frequencies. It permits transfer of voice currents from one winding to another by magnetic induction, matches line and drop impedances, and prevents direct conduction between the line and the drop.

It is a special application of an isolation transformer, and is often used to prevent ground loops or earth loops, which cause humming or buzzing in audio circuits. It also prevents low direct current voltages from passing.

<text>In telecommunications, the term reradiation has the following meanings:

#Electromagnetic radiation, at the same or different wavelengths, i.e., frequencies, of energy received from an incident wave.
#Undesirable radiation of signals locally generated in a radio receiver. This type of radiation might cause interference or reveal the location of the device.

Near-field effects of an AM antenna may extend out or more. Cellular and microwave towers within this radius can reflect the Medium Wave AM signal out at a phase which cancels the main Medium Wave AM signal. This process results in an interfering signal called reradiation.</text><links>

<text>Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when an object or system is subjected to an external force or vibration that matches its resonant frequency, defined as the frequency that generates the maximum amplitude response in the system. When this happens, the object or system absorbs energy from the external force and starts vibrating with a larger amplitude. Resonance can occur in various systems, such as mechanical, electrical, or acoustic systems, and it is often desirable in certain applications, such as musical instruments or radio receivers. However, resonance can also be detrimental, leading to excessive vibrations or even structural failure in some cases. 

All systems, including molecular systems and particles, tend to vibrate at a natural frequency depending upon their structure; when there is very little damping this frequency is approximately equal to, but slightly above, the resonant frequency or resonance frequency. When an oscillating force, an external vibration, is applied at a resonant frequency of a dynamic system, object, or particle, the outside vibration will cause the system to oscillate at a higher amplitude (with more force) than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies.

The resonant frequencies of a system can be identified when the response to an external vibration creates an amplitude that is a relative maximum within the system. Small periodic forces that are near a resonant frequency of the system have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations in the system due to the storage of vibrational energy.

Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or waves: there is mechanical resonance, orbital resonance, acoustic resonance, electromagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) and resonance of quantum wave functions. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., musical instruments), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).

The term &quot;resonance&quot; (from Latin &quot;resonantia&quot;, &#x27;echo&#x27;, from &quot;resonare&quot;, &#x27;resound&#x27;) originated from the field of acoustics, particularly the sympathetic resonance observed in musical instruments, e.g., when one string starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different one is struck.

==Overview==

Resonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different storage modes (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called damping. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the natural frequency of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple and distinct resonant frequencies.

==Examples==

A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing&#x27;s natural oscillations.

Resonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all sinusoidal waves and vibrations are generated. For example, when hard objects like metal, glass, or wood are struck, there are brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength electromagnetic radiation is produced by resonance on an atomic scale, such as electrons in atoms. Other examples of resonance include:

* Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the balance wheel in a mechanical watch and the quartz crystal in a quartz watch
* Tidal resonance of the Bay of Fundy
* Acoustic resonances of musical instruments and the human vocal tract
* Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)
* Friction idiophones, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) vibrate by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip
* Electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios and TVs that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received
* Creation of coherent light by optical resonance in a laser cavity
* Orbital resonance as exemplified by some moons of the Solar System&#x27;s giant planets and resonant groups such as the plutinos
* Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several spectroscopic techniques that are used in condensed matter physics
**Electron spin resonance
**Mössbauer effect
**Nuclear magnetic resonance

==Linear systems==
Resonance manifests itself in many linear and nonlinear systems as oscillations around an equilibrium point. When the system is driven by a sinusoidal external input, a measured output of the system may oscillate in response. The ratio of the amplitude of the output&#x27;s steady-state oscillations to the input&#x27;s oscillations is called the gain, and the gain can be a function of the frequency of the sinusoidal external input. Peaks in the gain at certain frequencies correspond to resonances, where the amplitude of the measured output&#x27;s oscillations are disproportionately large.

Since many linear and nonlinear systems that oscillate are modeled as harmonic oscillators near their equilibria, a derivation of the resonant frequency for a driven, damped harmonic oscillator is shown. An RLC circuit is used to illustrate connections between resonance and a system&#x27;s transfer function, frequency response, poles, and zeroes. Building off the RLC circuit example, these connections for higher-order linear systems with multiple inputs and outputs are generalized.

===The driven, damped harmonic oscillator===
Consider a damped mass on a spring driven by a sinusoidal, externally applied force. Newton&#x27;s second law takes the form

where &quot;m&quot; is the mass, &quot;x&quot; is the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium point, &quot;F&quot;0 is the driving amplitude, &quot;ω&quot; is the driving angular frequency, &quot;k&quot; is the spring constant, and &quot;c&quot; is the viscous damping coefficient. This can be rewritten in the form

where
* formula_1 is called the &quot;undamped angular frequency of the oscillator&quot; or the &quot;natural frequency&quot;,
* formula_2 is called the &quot;damping ratio&quot;.

Many sources also refer to &quot;ω&quot;0 as the &quot;resonant frequency&quot;. However, as shown below, when analyzing oscillations of the displacement &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), the resonant frequency is close to but not the same as &quot;ω&quot;0. In general the resonant frequency is close to but not necessarily the same as the natural frequency. The RLC circuit example in the next section gives examples of different resonant frequencies for the same system.

The general solution of Equation () is the sum of a transient solution that depends on initial conditions and a steady state solution that is independent of initial conditions and depends only on the driving amplitude &quot;F&quot;0, driving frequency &quot;ω&quot;, undamped angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;0, and the damping ratio &quot;ζ&quot;. The transient solution decays in a relatively short amount of time, so to study resonance it is sufficient to consider the steady state solution.

It is possible to write the steady-state solution for &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as a function proportional to the driving force with an induced phase change &quot;φ&quot;,
 \sin(\omega t + \varphi),&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_3

The phase value is usually taken to be between −180° and 0 so it represents a phase lag for both positive and negative values of the arctan argument.


Resonance occurs when, at certain driving frequencies, the steady-state amplitude of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is large compared to its amplitude at other driving frequencies. For the mass on a spring, resonance corresponds physically to the mass&#x27;s oscillations having large displacements from the spring&#x27;s equilibrium position at certain driving frequencies. Looking at the amplitude of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as a function of the driving frequency &quot;ω&quot;, the amplitude is maximal at the driving frequency
formula_4

&quot;ω&quot;&quot;r&quot; is the resonant frequency for this system. Again, the resonant frequency does not equal the undamped angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;0 of the oscillator. They are proportional, and if the damping ratio goes to zero they are the same, but for non-zero damping they are not the same frequency. As shown in the figure, resonance may also occur at other frequencies near the resonant frequency, including &quot;ω&quot;0, but the maximum response is at the resonant frequency.

Also, &quot;ω&quot;&quot;r&quot; is only real and non-zero if formula_5, so this system can only resonate when the harmonic oscillator is significantly underdamped. For systems with a very small damping ratio and a driving frequency near the resonant frequency, the steady state oscillations can become very large.

==== The pendulum ====
For other driven, damped harmonic oscillators whose equations of motion do not look exactly like the mass on a spring example, the resonant frequency remains
formula_6
but the definitions of &quot;ω&quot;0 and &quot;ζ&quot; change based on the physics of the system. For a pendulum of length &quot;ℓ&quot; and small displacement angle &quot;θ&quot;, Equation () becomes
formula_7

and therefore
* formula_8
* formula_9

=== RLC series circuits ===

Consider a circuit consisting of a resistor with resistance &quot;R&quot;, an inductor with inductance &quot;L&quot;, and a capacitor with capacitance &quot;C&quot; connected in series with current &quot;i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and driven by a voltage source with voltage &quot;v&quot;&quot;in&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). The voltage drop around the circuit is
Rather than analyzing a candidate solution to this equation like in the mass on a spring example above, this section will analyze the frequency response of this circuit. Taking the Laplace transform of Equation (),
formula_10
where &quot;I&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and &quot;V&quot;&quot;in&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) are the Laplace transform of the current and input voltage, respectively, and &quot;s&quot; is a complex frequency parameter in the Laplace domain. Rearranging terms,
formula_11

====Voltage across the capacitor====
An RLC circuit in series presents several options for where to measure an output voltage. Suppose the output voltage of interest is the voltage drop across the capacitor. As shown above, in the Laplace domain this voltage is
formula_12
or
formula_13

Define for this circuit a natural frequency and a damping ratio,
formula_14
formula_15

The ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage becomes
formula_16

&quot;H&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is the transfer function between the input voltage and the output voltage. This transfer function has two poles–roots of the polynomial in the transfer function&#x27;s denominator–at
and no zeros–roots of the polynomial in the transfer function&#x27;s numerator. Moreover, for , the magnitude of these poles is the natural frequency &quot;ω&quot;0 and that for , our condition for resonance in the harmonic oscillator example, the poles are closer to the imaginary axis than to the real axis.

Evaluating &quot;H&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) along the imaginary axis , the transfer function describes the frequency response of this circuit. Equivalently, the frequency response can be analyzed by taking the Fourier transform of Equation () instead of the Laplace transform. The transfer function, which is also complex, can be written as a gain and phase,
formula_17

A sinusoidal input voltage at frequency &quot;ω&quot; results in an output voltage at the same frequency that has been scaled by &quot;G&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) and has a phase shift &quot;Φ&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;). The gain and phase can be plotted versus frequency on a Bode plot. For the RLC circuit&#x27;s capacitor voltage, the gain of the transfer function &quot;H&quot;(&quot;iω&quot;) is
.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Note the similarity between the gain here and the amplitude in Equation (). Once again, the gain is maximized at the resonant frequency
formula_4

Here, the resonance corresponds physically to having a relatively large amplitude for the steady state oscillations of the voltage across the capacitor compared to its amplitude at other driving frequencies.

==== Voltage across the inductor ====
The resonant frequency need not always take the form given in the examples above. For the RLC circuit, suppose instead that the output voltage of interest is the voltage across the inductor. As shown above, in the Laplace domain the voltage across the inductor is
formula_19
formula_20
formula_21

using the same definitions for &quot;ω&quot;0 and &quot;ζ&quot; as in the previous example. The transfer function between &quot;V&quot;in(&quot;s&quot;) and this new &quot;V&quot;out(&quot;s&quot;) across the inductor is
formula_22

This transfer function has the same poles as the transfer function in the previous example, but it also has two zeroes in the numerator at . Evaluating &quot;H&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) along the imaginary axis, its gain becomes
formula_23

Compared to the gain in Equation () using the capacitor voltage as the output, this gain has a factor of &quot;ω&quot;2 in the numerator and will therefore have a different resonant frequency that maximizes the gain. That frequency is
formula_24

So for the same RLC circuit but with the voltage across the inductor as the output, the resonant frequency is now &quot;larger&quot; than the natural frequency, though it still tends towards the natural frequency as the damping ratio goes to zero. That the same circuit can have different resonant frequencies for different choices of output is not contradictory. As shown in Equation (), the voltage drop across the circuit is divided among the three circuit elements, and each element has different dynamics. The capacitor&#x27;s voltage grows slowly by integrating the current over time and is therefore more sensitive to lower frequencies, whereas the inductor&#x27;s voltage grows when the current changes rapidly and is therefore more sensitive to higher frequencies. While the circuit as a whole has a natural frequency where it tends to oscillate, the different dynamics of each circuit element make each element resonate at a slightly different frequency.

==== Voltage across the resistor ====
Suppose that the output voltage of interest is the voltage across the resistor. In the Laplace domain the voltage across the resistor is
formula_25
formula_26

and using the same natural frequency and damping ratio as in the capacitor example the transfer function is
formula_27

This transfer function also has the same poles as the previous RLC circuit examples, but it only has one zero in the numerator at &quot;s&quot; = 0. For this transfer function, its gain is
formula_28

The resonant frequency that maximizes this gain is
formula_29
and the gain is one at this frequency, so the voltage across the resistor resonates &quot;at&quot; the circuit&#x27;s natural frequency and at this frequency the amplitude of the voltage across the resistor equals the input voltage&#x27;s amplitude.

==== Antiresonance ====
Some systems exhibit antiresonance that can be analyzed in the same way as resonance. For antiresonance, the amplitude of the response of the system at certain frequencies is disproportionately &quot;small&quot; rather than being disproportionately large. In the RLC circuit example, this phenomenon can be observed by analyzing both the inductor and the capacitor combined.

Suppose that the output voltage of interest in the RLC circuit is the voltage across the inductor &quot;and&quot; the capacitor combined in series. Equation () showed that the sum of the voltages across the three circuit elements sums to the input voltage, so measuring the output voltage as the sum of the inductor and capacitor voltages combined is the same as &quot;v&quot;&quot;in&quot; minus the voltage drop across the resistor. The previous example showed that at the natural frequency of the system, the amplitude of the voltage drop across the resistor &quot;equals&quot; the amplitude of &quot;v&quot;&quot;in&quot;, and therefore the voltage across the inductor and capacitor combined has zero amplitude. We can show this with the transfer function.

The sum of the inductor and capacitor voltages is
formula_30
formula_31

Using the same natural frequency and damping ratios as the previous examples, the transfer function is
formula_32

This transfer has the same poles as the previous examples but has zeroes at
Evaluating the transfer function along the imaginary axis, its gain is
formula_33

Rather than look for resonance, i.e., peaks of the gain, notice that the gain goes to zero at &quot;ω&quot; = &quot;ω&quot;0, which complements our analysis of the resistor&#x27;s voltage. This is called antiresonance, which has the opposite effect of resonance. Rather than result in outputs that are disproportionately large at this frequency, this circuit with this choice of output has no response at all at this frequency. The frequency that is filtered out corresponds exactly to the zeroes of the transfer function, which were shown in Equation () and were on the imaginary axis.

==== Relationships between resonance and frequency response in the RLC series circuit example ====
These RLC circuit examples illustrate how resonance is related to the frequency response of the system. Specifically, these examples illustrate:
* How resonant frequencies can be found by looking for peaks in the gain of the transfer function between the input and output of the system, for example in a Bode magnitude plot
* How the resonant frequency for a single system can be different for different choices of system output
* The connection between the system&#x27;s natural frequency, the system&#x27;s damping ratio, and the system&#x27;s resonant frequency
* The connection between the system&#x27;s natural frequency and the magnitude of the transfer function&#x27;s poles, pointed out in Equation (), and therefore a connection between the poles and the resonant frequency
* A connection between the transfer function&#x27;s zeroes and the shape of the gain as a function of frequency, and therefore a connection between the zeroes and the resonant frequency that maximizes gain
* A connection between the transfer function&#x27;s zeroes and antiresonance

The next section extends these concepts to resonance in a general linear system.

=== Generalizing resonance and antiresonance for linear systems ===

Next consider an arbitrary linear system with multiple inputs and outputs. For example, in state-space representation a third order linear time-invariant system with three inputs and two outputs might be written as
formula_34
formula_35
where &quot;u&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) are the inputs, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;(t) are the state variables, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) are the outputs, and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are matrices describing the dynamics between the variables.

This system has a transfer function matrix whose elements are the transfer functions between the various inputs and outputs. For example,
formula_36

Each &quot;H&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is a scalar transfer function linking one of the inputs to one of the outputs. The RLC circuit examples above had one input voltage and showed four possible output voltages–across the capacitor, across the inductor, across the resistor, and across the capacitor and inductor combined in series–each with its own transfer function. If the RLC circuit were set up to measure all four of these output voltages, that system would have a 4×1 transfer function matrix linking the single input to each of the four outputs.

Evaluated along the imaginary axis, each &quot;H&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;iω&quot;) can be written as a gain and phase shift,
formula_37

Peaks in the gain at certain frequencies correspond to resonances between that transfer function&#x27;s input and output, assuming the system is stable.

Each transfer function &quot;H&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) can also be written as a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials of &quot;s&quot;.
formula_38

The complex roots of the numerator are called zeroes, and the complex roots of the denominator are called poles. For a stable system, the positions of these poles and zeroes on the complex plane give some indication of whether the system can resonate or antiresonate and at which frequencies. In particular, any stable or marginally stable, complex conjugate pair of poles with imaginary components can be written in terms of a natural frequency and a damping ratio as
formula_39
as in Equation (). The natural frequency &quot;ω&quot;0 of that pole is the magnitude of the position of the pole on the complex plane and the damping ratio of that pole determines how quickly that oscillation decays. In general,
* Complex conjugate pairs of &quot;poles&quot; near the imaginary axis correspond to a peak or resonance in the frequency response in the vicinity of the pole&#x27;s natural frequency. If the pair of poles is &quot;on&quot; the imaginary axis, the gain is infinite at that frequency.
* Complex conjugate pairs of &quot;zeroes&quot; near the imaginary axis correspond to a notch or antiresonance in the frequency response in the vicinity of the zero&#x27;s frequency, i.e., the frequency equal to the magnitude of the zero. If the pair of zeroes is &quot;on&quot; the imaginary axis, the gain is zero at that frequency.

In the RLC circuit example, the first generalization relating poles to resonance is observed in Equation (). The second generalization relating zeroes to antiresonance is observed in Equation (). In the examples of the harmonic oscillator, the RLC circuit capacitor voltage, and the RLC circuit inductor voltage, &quot;poles near the imaginary axis&quot; corresponds to the significantly underdamped condition ζ &lt; 1/formula_40.

== Standing waves ==
A physical system can have as many natural frequencies as it has degrees of freedom and can resonate near each of those natural frequencies. A mass on a spring, which has one degree of freedom, has one natural frequency. A double pendulum, which has two degrees of freedom, can have two natural frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators increases, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. Systems with very large numbers of degrees of freedom can be thought of as continuous rather than as having discrete oscillators.

Energy transfers from one oscillator to the next in the form of waves. For example, the string of a guitar or the surface of water in a bowl can be modeled as a continuum of small coupled oscillators and waves can travel along them. In many cases these systems have the potential to resonate at certain frequencies, forming standing waves with large-amplitude oscillations at fixed positions. Resonance in the form of standing waves underlies many familiar phenomena, such as the sound produced by musical instruments, electromagnetic cavities used in lasers and microwave ovens, and energy levels of atoms.

===Standing waves on a string===

When a string of fixed length is driven at a particular frequency, a wave propagates along the string at the same frequency. The waves reflect off the ends of the string, and eventually a steady state is reached with waves traveling in both directions. The waveform is the superposition of the waves.

At certain frequencies, the steady state waveform does not appear to travel along the string. At fixed positions called nodes, the string is never displaced. Between the nodes the string oscillates and exactly halfway between the nodes–at positions called anti-nodes–the oscillations have their largest amplitude.

For a string of length formula_41 with fixed ends, the displacement formula_42 of the string perpendicular to the formula_43-axis at time formula_44 is
formula_45

where
*formula_46 is the amplitude of the left- and right-traveling waves interfering to form the standing wave,
*formula_47 is the wave number,
*formula_48 is the frequency.

The frequencies that resonate and form standing waves relate to the length of the string as
formula_49
formula_50

where formula_51 is the speed of the wave and the integer formula_52 denotes different modes or harmonics. The standing wave with oscillates at the fundamental frequency and has a wavelength that is twice the length of the string. The possible modes of oscillation form a harmonic series.

==Resonance in complex networks==

A generalization to complex networks of coupled harmonic oscillators shows that such systems have a finite number of natural resonant frequencies, related to the topological structure of the network itself. In particular, such frequencies result related to the eigenvalues of the network&#x27;s Laplacian matrix. Let formula_53 be the adjacency matrix describing the topological structure of the network and formula_54 the corresponding Laplacian matrix, where formula_55 is the diagonal matrix of the degrees of the network&#x27;s nodes. Then, for a network of classical and identical harmonic oscillators, when a sinusoidal driving force formula_56 is applied to a specific node, the global resonant frequencies of the network are given by formula_57 where formula_58 are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian formula_59.

==Types==

===Mechanical===

Mechanical resonance is the tendency of a mechanical system to absorb more energy when the frequency of its oscillations matches the system&#x27;s natural frequency of vibration than it does at other frequencies. It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including bridges, buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing objects, engineers must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as resonance disaster.

Avoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and bridge construction project. As a countermeasure, shock mounts can be installed to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The Taipei 101 building relies on a —a tuned mass damper—to cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur. Buildings in seismic zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition, engineers designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts.

Clocks keep time by mechanical resonance in a balance wheel, pendulum, or quartz crystal.

The cadence of runners has been hypothesized to be energetically favorable due to resonance between the elastic energy stored in the lower limb and the mass of the runner.

====International Space Station====

The rocket engines for the International Space Station (ISS) are controlled by an autopilot. Ordinarily, uploaded parameters for controlling the engine control system for the Zvezda module make the rocket engines boost the International Space Station to a higher orbit. The rocket engines are hinge-mounted, and ordinarily the crew does not notice the operation. On January 14, 2009, however, the uploaded parameters made the autopilot swing the rocket engines in larger and larger oscillations, at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. These oscillations were captured on video, and lasted for 142 seconds.

===Acoustic===

Acoustic resonance is a branch of mechanical resonance that is concerned with the mechanical vibrations across the frequency range of human hearing, in other words sound. For humans, hearing is normally limited to frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), Many objects and materials act as resonators with resonant frequencies within this range, and when struck vibrate mechanically, pushing on the surrounding air to create sound waves. This is the source of many percussive sounds we hear.

Acoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as most acoustic instruments use resonators, such as the strings and body of a violin, the length of tube in a flute, and the shape of, and tension on, a drum membrane.

Like mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic failure of the object at resonance. The classic example of this is breaking a wine glass with sound at the precise resonant frequency of the glass, although this is difficult in practice.

===Electrical ===

Electrical resonance occurs in an electric circuit at a particular &quot;resonant frequency&quot; when the impedance of the circuit is at a minimum in a series circuit or at maximum in a parallel circuit (usually when the transfer function peaks in absolute value). Resonance in circuits are used for both transmitting and receiving wireless communications such as television, cell phones and radio.

===Optical ===
An optical cavity, also called an &quot;optical resonator&quot;, is an arrangement of mirrors that forms a standing wave cavity resonator for light waves. Optical cavities are a major component of lasers, surrounding the gain medium and providing feedback of the laser light. They are also used in optical parametric oscillators and some interferometers. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called &quot;modes&quot;. Longitudinal modes differ only in frequency while transverse modes differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. Ring resonators and whispering galleries are examples of optical resonators that do not form standing waves.

Different resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.

Optical cavities are designed to have a very large &quot;Q&quot; factor. A beam reflects a large number of times with little attenuation—therefore the frequency line width of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the laser.

Additional optical resonances are guided-mode resonances and surface plasmon resonance, which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.

===Orbital ===
In celestial mechanics, an orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to their orbital periods being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In most cases, this results in an &quot;unstable&quot; interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter&#x27;s moons Ganymede, Europa, and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn&#x27;s inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to clear the neighborhood around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around them; this effect is used in the current definition of a planet.

=== Atomic, particle, and molecular ===

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the name given to a physical resonance phenomenon involving the observation of specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of an atomic nucleus in the presence of an applied, external magnetic field. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials through NMR spectroscopy. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

All nuclei containing odd numbers of nucleons have an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment. A key feature of NMR is that the resonant frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant frequencies of the sample&#x27;s nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant frequency.

Electron paramagnetic resonance, otherwise known as &quot;electron spin resonance&quot; (ESR), is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be paramagnetic.

The Mössbauer effect is the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma ray photons by atoms bound in a solid form.

Resonance in particle physics appears in similar circumstances to classical physics at the level of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Resonances can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula in the Universal resonance curve section of this article applying if &quot;Γ&quot; is the particle&#x27;s decay rate and formula_60 is the particle&#x27;s mass &quot;M&quot;. In that case, the formula comes from the particle&#x27;s propagator, with its mass replaced by the complex number &quot;M&quot; + &quot;iΓ&quot;. The formula is further related to the particle&#x27;s decay rate by the optical theorem.

== Disadvantages ==

A column of soldiers marching in regular step on a narrow and structurally flexible bridge can set it into dangerously large amplitude oscillations. On April 12, 1831, the Broughton Suspension Bridge near Salford, England collapsed while a group of British soldiers were marching across. Since then, the British Army has had a standing order for soldiers to break stride when marching across bridges, to avoid resonance from their regular marching pattern affecting the bridge.

Vibrations of a motor or engine can induce resonant vibration in its supporting structures if their natural frequency is close to that of the vibrations of the engine. A common example is the rattling sound of a bus body when the engine is left idling.

Structural resonance of a suspension bridge induced by winds can lead to its catastrophic collapse. Several early suspension bridges in Europe and United States were destroyed by structural resonance induced by modest winds. The collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge on 7 November 1940 is characterized in physics as a classic example of resonance. It has been argued by Robert H. Scanlan and others that the destruction was instead caused by aeroelastic flutter, a complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it—an example of a self oscillation, or a kind of &quot;self-sustaining vibration&quot; as referred to in the nonlinear theory of vibrations.

== Q factor==
The &quot;Q&quot; factor or &quot;quality factor&quot; is a dimensionless parameter that describes how under-damped an oscillator or resonator is, and characterizes the bandwidth of a resonator relative to its center frequency.
A high value for &quot;Q&quot; indicates a lower rate of energy loss relative to the stored energy, i.e., the system is lightly damped. The parameter is defined by the equation:
formula_61.

The higher the Q factor, the greater the amplitude at the resonant frequency, and the smaller the &quot;bandwidth&quot;, or range of frequencies around resonance occurs. In electrical resonance, a high-&quot;Q&quot; circuit in a radio receiver is more difficult to tune, but has greater selectivity, and so would be better at filtering out signals from other stations. High Q oscillators are more stable.

Examples that normally have a low Q factor include door closers (Q=0.5). Systems with high Q factors include tuning forks (Q=1000), atomic clocks and lasers (Q≈1011).

==Universal resonance curve==
The exact response of a resonance, especially for frequencies far from the resonant frequency, depends on the details of the physical system, and is usually not exactly symmetric about the resonant frequency, as illustrated for the simple harmonic oscillator above.

For a lightly damped linear oscillator with a resonance frequency formula_60, the &quot;intensity&quot; of oscillations formula_63 when the system is driven with a driving frequency &quot;formula_64&quot; is typically approximated by the following formula that is symmetric about the resonance frequency:formula_65

Where the susceptibility formula_66 links the amplitude of the oscillator to the driving force in frequency space:formula_67

The intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations. This is a Lorentzian function, or Cauchy distribution, and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. is a parameter dependent on the damping of the oscillator, and is known as the &quot;linewidth&quot; of the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency. The linewidth is inversely proportional to the &quot;Q&quot; factor, which is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance.

In radio engineering and electronics engineering, this approximate symmetric response is known as the &quot;universal resonance curve&quot;, a concept introduced by Frederick E. Terman in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio circuits with a range of center frequencies and &quot;Q&quot; values.

<text>In technology, response time is the time a system or functional unit takes to react to a given input.

== Computing ==
In computing, the responsiveness of a service, how long a system takes to respond to a request for service, is measured through the response time. That service can be anything from a memory fetch, to a disk IO, to a complex database query, or loading a full web page. Ignoring transmission time for a moment, the response time is the sum of the service time and wait time. The service time is the time it takes to do the work you requested. For a given request the service time varies little as the workload increases – to do X amount of work it always takes X amount of time. The wait time is how long the request had to wait in a queue before being serviced and it varies from zero, when no waiting is required, to a large multiple of the service time, as many requests are already in the queue and have to be serviced first.

With basic queueing theory math you can calculate how the average wait time increases as the device providing the service goes from 0-100% busy. As the device becomes busier, the average wait time increases in a non-linear fashion. The busier the device is, the more dramatic the response time increases will seem as you approach 100% busy; all of that increase is caused by increases in wait time, which is the result of all the requests waiting in queue that have to run first.

Transmission time gets added to response time when your request and the resulting response has to travel over a network and it can be very significant. Transmission time can include propagation delays due to distance (the speed of light is finite), delays due to transmission errors, and data communication bandwidth limits (especially at the last mile) slowing the transmission speed of the request or the reply.

Developers can reduce the response time of a system (for end users or not) using program optimization techniques.

==Real-time systems==

In real-time systems the response time of a task or thread is defined as the time elapsed between the dispatch (time when task is ready to execute) to the time when it finishes its job (one dispatch). Response time is different from WCET which is the maximum time the task would take if it were to execute without interference. It is also different from deadline which is the length of time during which the task&#x27;s output would be valid in the context of the specific system. And it has a relation to the TTFB, which is the time between the dispatch and the time when the response starts.

==Display technologies==

Response time is the amount of time a pixel in a display takes to change. It is measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower numbers mean faster transitions and therefore fewer visible image artifacts. Display monitors with long response times would create display motion blur around moving objects, making them unacceptable for rapidly moving images. Response times are usually measured from grey-to-grey transitions, based on a VESA industry standard from the 10% to the 90% points in the pixel response curve.

In fast paced competitive games such as Counter-Strike, the response time of a display is crucial for optimal performance. Displays that have a lower response time are more responsive to player input and produce less visual errors when displaying a rapidly changing image, making low response time important for competitive gaming. Most modern monitors that are marketed for gaming have a response time of 1ms, although it is not uncommon to see &lt;1ms response time in high end monitors, and &gt;1ms response time on less expensive monitors or monitors that have a higher resolution.

<text>Responsivity is a measure of the input–output gain of a detector system. In the specific case of a photodetector, it measures the electrical output per optical input. 

A photodetector&#x27;s responsivity is usually expressed in units of amperes or volts per watt of incident radiant power. For a system that responds linearly to its input, there is a unique responsivity. For nonlinear systems, the responsivity is the local slope. Many common photodetectors respond linearly as a function of the incident power. 

Responsivity is a function of the wavelength of the incident radiation and of the sensor&#x27;s properties, such as the bandgap of the material of which the photodetector is made. One simple expression for the responsivity &quot;R&quot; of a photodetector in which an optical signal is converted into an electric current (known as a photocurrent) is 
: formula_1
where formula_2 is the quantum efficiency (the conversion efficiency of photons to electrons) of the detector for a given wavelength, formula_3 is the electron charge, formula_4 is the frequency of the optical signal, and formula_5 is the Planck constant. This expression is also given in terms of formula_6, the wavelength of the optical signal, and has the unit of amperes per watt (A/W).

The term responsivity is also used to summarize input–output relationship in non-electrical systems. For example, a neuroscientist may measure how neurons in the visual pathway respond to light. In this case, responsivity summarizes the change in the neural response per unit signal strength. The responsivity in these applications can have a variety of units. The signal strength typically is controlled by varying either intensity (intensity-response function) or contrast (contrast-response function). The neural response measure depends on the part of the nervous system under study. For example, at the level of the retinal cones, the response might be in photocurrent. In the central nervous system the response is usually spikes per second. In functional neuroimaging, the response measure is usually BOLD contrast. The responsivity units reflect the relevant stimulus and physiological units. 

When describing an amplifier, the more common term is gain. 

&quot;Deprecated synonym&quot; [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]. A system&#x27;s sensitivity is the inverse of the stimulus level required to produce a threshold response, with the threshold typically chosen just above the noise level.

Return loss is related to both standing wave ratio (SWR) and reflection coefficient (Γ). Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR. Return loss is a measure of how well devices or lines are matched. A match is good if the return loss is high. A high return loss is desirable and results in a lower insertion loss.

From a certain perspective &#x27;Return Loss&#x27; is a misnomer. The usual function of a transmission line is to convey power from a source to a load with minimal loss. If a transmission line is correctly matched to a load, the reflected power will be zero, no power will be lost due to reflection, and &#x27;Return Loss&#x27; will be infinite. Conversely if the line is terminated in an open circuit, the reflected power will be equal to the incident power; all of the incident power will be lost in the sense that none of it will be transferred to a load, and RL will be zero. Thus the numerical values of RL tend in the opposite sense to that expected of a &#x27;loss&#x27;.

== Sign ==
As defined above, RL will always be positive, since &quot;P&quot;r can never exceed &quot;P&quot;i . However, return loss has historically been expressed as a negative number, and this convention is still widely found in the literature. Strictly speaking, if a negative sign is ascribed to RL, the ratio of reflected to incident power is implied;

:formula_2
:where &quot;RL&quot;&#x27;(dB) is the negative of &quot;RL&quot;(dB). 
In practice, the sign ascribed to RL is largely immaterial. If a transmission line includes several discontinuities along its length, the total return loss will be the sum of the RLs caused by each discontinuity, and provided all RLs are given the same sign, no error or ambiguity will result. Whichever convention is used, it will always be understood that &quot;P&quot;r can never exceed &quot;P&quot;i .

==Electrical==
In metallic conductor systems, reflections of a signal traveling down a conductor can occur at a discontinuity or impedance mismatch. The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave &quot;Vr&quot; to the amplitude of the incident wave &quot;Vi&quot; is known as the reflection coefficient formula_3.

:formula_4

Return loss is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in dB. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by,

:formula_5

where the vertical bars indicate magnitude. Thus, a large positive return loss indicates the reflected power is small relative to the incident power, which indicates good impedance match between transmission line and load.

If the incident power and the reflected power are expressed in &#x27;absolute&#x27; decibel units, (e.g., dBm), then the return loss in dB can be calculated as the difference between the incident power &quot;P&quot;i (in absolute dBm units) and the reflected power &quot;P&quot;r (also in absolute dBm units),

:formula_6

==Optical==
In optics (particularly in fiber optics) a loss that takes place at discontinuities of refractive index, especially at an air-glass such as a fiber endface. At those interfaces, a fraction of the optical signal is reflected back toward the source. This reflection phenomenon is also called &quot;Fresnel reflection loss,&quot; or simply &quot;Fresnel loss.&quot;

Fiber optic transmission systems use lasers to transmit signals over optical fiber, and a low optical return loss (ORL) can cause the laser to stop transmitting correctly. The measurement of ORL is becoming more important in the characterization of optical networks as the use of wavelength-division multiplexing increases. These systems use lasers that have a lower tolerance for ORL, and introduce elements into the network that are located in close proximity to the laser.

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the reflected power and formula_9 is the incident, or input, power.

<doc id="41669" wikidata="Q7334841" url="?curid=41669" title="Ringdown">
<text>In telephony, ringdown is a method of signaling an operator in which telephone ringing current is sent over the line to operate a lamp or cause the operation of a self-locking relay known as a &quot;drop&quot;.

Ringdown is used in manual operation, and is distinguished from automatic signaling by dialing a number. The signal consists of a continuous or pulsed alternating current (AC) signal transmitted over the line. It may be used with or without a telephone switchboard. The term originated in magneto telephone signaling in which cranking the magneto generator, either integrated into the telephone set or housed in a connected ringer box, would not only &quot;ring&quot; its bell but also cause a drop to fall &quot;down&quot; at the telephone exchange switchboard, marked with the number of the line to which the magneto telephone instrument was connected. At the end of the conversation, one participant would crank to &quot;ring off&quot;, signaling the operator to take down the connection. In modern British English, &quot;ring off&quot; still means ending a telephone conversation, though it is of course done by other means. Ring off is also used figuratively to indicate no longer communicating with a person.

The last ringdown telephone exchange in the United States was located at Bryant Pond, Maine, had 400+ subscribers, and converted to dial service in October 1983.

== Ringdown operator ==
In telephone systems where calls from distant automated exchanges arrive for manual subscribers or non-dialable points, there often would be a ringdown operator (reachable from the distant operator console by dialling NPA+181) who would manually ring the desired subscriber on a party line or toll station. On some systems, this function was carried out by the inward operator (NPA+121). In both cases, this is a telephone operator at the destination who provides assistance solely to other operators on inbound toll calls; the ringdown operator nominally cannot be dialed directly by the subscriber.

==Non-operator use==

In an application &quot;not&quot; involving a telephone operator, a two-point automatic ringdown circuit, or ringdown, has a telephone at each end. When the telephone at one end goes off-hook, the phone at the other end instantly rings. No dialing is involved and therefore telephone sets without dials are sometimes used.

Many ringdown circuits work in both directions. In some cases a circuit is designed to work in one direction only. That is, going off-hook at one end (end A) rings the other (end B). Going off-hook at end B has no effect at end A.

Ringdown features are often part of a key telephone system. In the wire spring relay key service units of the Bell System 1A2, a model 216 automatic ringdown was used to operate the circuit. In the 400-series units, a number of different KTUs operate (supervise) a ringdown, including the model 415. In other situations, the ringdown is powered and operated by equipment inside the telephone exchange.

In the case of enterprises with a private branch exchange (PBX) switch, the ringdown can be operated by the PBX key. The switch is programmed to ring a specific extension (the called phone) when a defined extension (the calling phone) goes off-hook. The PBX does not offer dial tone to the calling extension: it only detects on-hook or off-hook status.

Voice over IP adapters can be networked and configured to provide automatic ringdown by selecting a dial plan which replaces the empty string with a predefined number or SIP address, dialed immediately. (Some Cisco VoIP phones and analog adapters treat a dial plan of (S0 &lt;:1234567890&gt;) as a hotline configuration which dials 1-234-567890 zero seconds after the telephone is taken off-hook, for instance).

These circuits are used:

* over high-volume routes where one site calls another very frequently.
:&quot;Example: an information desk and the information desk staff supervisor&#x27;s desk.&quot;

* where a tamper-proof ability to call from one point to another is needed.
:&quot;Example: a phone used to summon a taxicab to an airport or hotel.&quot;

* where a limited ability to contact one entity (but no ability to make outside calls) is desired.
:&quot;Example: a &quot;house phone&quot; in a hotel lobby to the live operator at the hotel&#x27;s switchboard&quot;

* where the public, or users that are not trained in using a specific office telephone system, must place calls.
:&quot;Example: the after-hours phone to reach the watchman from the front door at a warehouse.&quot;

* in locations where emergencies are handled and the time required to dial digits would cause an unacceptable delay in handling of an emergency.
:&quot;Example: an airport control tower to the airport&#x27;s fire station or fire dispatch center.&quot;
:&quot;Example: Independent System Operator (ISO) communication to a power plant.&quot;

* in situations where the called party needs to be certain of who is calling.
:&quot;Example: a hospital emergency department and an ambulance dispatch center.&quot;

In some cases, automatic ringdown circuits have one-to-many configurations. When one phone goes off-hook, a group of phones is made to ring simultaneously.

In cases where one or both ends of the circuit terminate in a key telephone system, a well designed system will have no hold feature on the ringdown circuit unless supervision provides a Calling Party Control (CPC) signal.

==PLAR==

Private line automatic ringdown (PLAR) is a type of analog signaling often used in telephone-based systems. When a device is taken off-hook, ringing voltage is automatically applied to a circuit to alert other stations on the line. When answered on another station, a call is maintained over the circuit. The telephone company switch is not involved in the process, making this a private line.

<doc id="41670" wikidata="Q4047836" url="?curid=41670" title="Ringer equivalence number">
<text>The ringer equivalence number (REN) is a telecommunications measure that represents the electrical loading effect of a telephone ringer on a telephone line. In the United States, ringer equivalence was first defined by U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 68, based on the load that a standard Bell System model 500 telephone represented, and was later determined in accordance with specification &quot;ANSI/TIA-968-B&quot; (August 2009). Measurement systems analogous to the REN exist internationally.

==Definition==
The ringer equivalence of 1 represents the loading effect of a single traditional telephone ringing circuit, such as that within the Western Electric model 500 telephone. The ringer equivalence of modern telephone equipment may be significantly lower than 1. For example, externally powered electronic ringing telephones may have a value as low as 0.1, while modern line-powered telephones, in which the ringer is powered from the telephone line, typically have a REN of approximately 0.8.

In the United States, the FCC Part 68 specification defined REN 1 as equivalent to a 6930 Ω resistor in series with an (microfarad) capacitor. The modern ANSI/TIA-968-B specification (August 2009) defines it as an impedance of at (type A ringer), or from to (type B ringer).

==Maximum ringer equivalence==
The total ringer load on a subscriber line is the sum of the ringer equivalences of all devices (phone, fax, a separate answerphone, etc.) connected to the line. This represents the overall loading effect of the subscriber equipment on the central office ringing current source. Subscriber telephone lines are usually limited to support a ringer equivalence of 5, per the federal specifications.

If the total allowable ringer load is exceeded, the phone circuit may fail to ring or otherwise malfunction. For example, call waiting, caller ID, and ADSL services are often affected by high ringer load.

Some analog telephone adapters for Internet telephony require analog telephones with low REN, for example, the AT&amp;T 210 is a basic phone which does not require an external electrical connection and has a REN of 0.9B.

==International specifications==

In the United Kingdom a maximum of 4 is allowed on any British Telecom (BT) line.

In Australia a maximum of 3 is allowed on any Telstra or Optus Line.

In Canada it is called a &quot;load number&quot; (LN); which must not exceed 100. The LN of each device represents the percentage of total load allowed.

In Europe 1 REN used to be equivalent to an 1800 Ω resistor in series with a 1 μF capacitor. The latest ETSI specification (2003–09) calls for 1 REN to be greater than 16 kΩ at 25 Hz and 50 Hz.

<text>In a ring network, such as Token Ring, ring latency is the time required for a signal to propagate once around the ring. Ring latency may be measured in seconds or in bits at the data transmission rate. Ring latency includes signal propagation delays in the ring medium, the drop cables, and the data stations connected to the ring network.

<text>In telecommunications, round-trip delay (RTD) or round-trip time (RTT) is the amount of time it takes for a signal to be sent &quot;plus&quot; the amount of time it takes for acknowledgement of that signal having been received. This time delay includes propagation times for the paths between the two communication endpoints. In the context of computer networks, the signal is typically a data packet. RTT is commonly used interchangeably with ping time, which can be determined with the ping command. However, ping time may differ from experienced RTT with other protocols since the payload and priority associated with ICMP messages used by ping may differ from that of other traffic.

End-to-end delay is the length of time it takes for a signal to travel in one direction and is often approximated as half the RTT.

==Protocol design==
RTT is a measure of the amount of time taken for an entire message to be sent to a destination and for a reply to be sent back to the sender. The time to send the message to the destination in its entirety is known as the network latency, and thus RTT is twice the latency in the network plus a processing delay at the destination. The other sources of delay in a network that make up the network latency are processing delay in transmission, propagation time, transmission time and queueing time. Propagation time is dependent on distance. Transmission time for a message is proportional to the message size divided by the bandwidth. Thus higher bandwidth networks will have lower transmission time, but the propagation time will remain unchanged, and so RTT does fall with increased bandwidth, but the delay increasingly represents propagation time.

Networks with both high bandwidth and a high RTT (and thus high bandwidth-delay product) can have large amounts of data in transit at any given time. Such &quot;long fat networks&quot; require a special protocol design. One example is the TCP window scale option.

The RTT was originally estimated in TCP by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is constant weighting factor (formula_3). Choosing a value for formula_2 close to 1 makes the weighted average immune to changes that last a short time (e.g., a single segment that encounters long delay). Choosing a value for formula_2 close to 0 makes the weighted average respond to changes in delay very quickly. This was improved by the Jacobson/Karels algorithm, which takes standard deviation into account as well. Once a new RTT is calculated, it is entered into the equation above to obtain an average RTT for that connection, and the procedure continues for every new calculation.

Accurate round-trip time measurements over Wi-Fi using IEEE 802.11mc are the basis for the Wi-Fi positioning system.

<doc id="41673" wikidata="Q7371624" url="?curid=41673" title="Routing indicator">
<text>In telecommunications, the term routing indicator (RI) has the following meanings:

#In a message header, an address, &quot;i.e.,&quot; group of characters, that specifies routing instructions for the transmission of the message to its final destination.

A Routing Indicator is a group of letters assigned to identify a station within a tape relay network to facilitate routing of traffic. It indicates the status of the station and may indicate its geographical area. The following factors are reflected in routing indicator assignment:

* (a) National or international affiliation and service (when required) of the station.
* (b) The geographical area in which the station is located or area from which it is served.
* (c) Network status of the station, i.e., major or minor relay, or tributary stations.

Routing indicators consist of not less than four, and not more than seven
letters, including suffixes. The intent of allocated letters and of letter position is as follows:

* First Letter - The letter R or the letter “Q” appears as the first letter and distinguishes strategic/worldwide routing indicators from call signs, address groups and theater routing indicators. 
* Second Letter - this letter, in conjunction with the first letter, identifies the nation or international alliance to which allotted. 
* Third Letter - This letter position serves the following purposes:
# Normally identifies the geographical area in which a station is located or from which it is served.
# Exceptionally, may be used by nations or international alliances irrespective of geographical area for specific alternative purposes, such as when the capacity of assigned second letters is insufficient to meet the requirement, or when more than one geographical area is involved as in the case of a tributary actively connected to two different major relay stations. In conjunction with the second letter “J”, may be reallocated, on a national basis, to a country not listed. 
* Fourth Letter - This letter position serves a dual purpose as follows:
# Indicates major relay stations, as generated by assignment requirements.
# Identifies the service or other national/international entity, as shown in the delineation table.

* (e) Fifth and Following Letters - These letters and positions, when added to the four letters of a major relay routing indicator, designate the minor relay or tributary stations of that major relay station.

<text>A rubidium standard or rubidium atomic clock is a frequency standard in which a specified hyperfine transition of electrons in rubidium-87 atoms is used to control the output frequency.

==Synopsis==
The Rb standard is the most inexpensive, compact, and widely produced atomic clock, used to control the frequency of television stations, cell phone base stations, in test equipment, and global navigation satellite systems like GPS. Commercial rubidium clocks are less accurate than caesium atomic clocks, which serve as primary frequency standards, so a rubidium clock is usually used as a secondary frequency standard. 

Commercial rubidium frequency standards operate by disciplining a crystal oscillator to the rubidium hyperfine transition of 6.8 GHz (). The intensity of light from a rubidium discharge lamp that reaches a photodetector through a resonance cell will drop by about 0.1% when the rubidium vapor in the resonance cell is exposed to microwave power near the transition frequency. The crystal oscillator is stabilized to the rubidium transition by detecting the light dip while sweeping an RF synthesizer (referenced to the crystal) through the transition frequency.

<text>Rural radiotelephone service (RRTS) provides basic, analog communications service between locations deemed so remote that traditional wireline service or service by other means is not feasible. RRTS uses channelized radio to provide radiotelephone services such as Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Service between a fixed subscriber location and a remote central office, private line service between a two fixed locations or interconnection between two or more central offices. RRTS does not enable mobile communications.

==Licensing==
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission issues initial rural radiotelephone service licenses on a site-by-site basis. Once a license is issued, the licensee can sell or lease the license to another party.

The FCC service rules for rural radiotelephone are filed in 47 C.F.R. part 22 subpart F.

==Technical information==
In the United States, the ULS radio service code and description for rural radiotelephone licenses is CR – Rural Radiotelephone. The licensed spectrum is divided in 44 channels of 20 kHz each.

<doc id="41679" wikidata="Q4514647" url="?curid=41679" title="Schematic">
<text>A schematic, or schematic diagram, is a designed representation of the elements of a system using abstract, graphic symbols rather than realistic pictures. A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the key information the schematic is intended to convey, and may include oversimplified elements in order to make this essential meaning easier to grasp, as well as additional organization of the information.

For example, a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot. The dot is not intended to resemble the actual station at all but aims to give the viewer information without unnecessary visual clutter. A schematic diagram of a chemical process uses symbols in place of detailed representations of the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment that compose the system, thus emphasizing the functions of the individual elements and the interconnections among them and suppresses their physical details. In an electronic circuit diagram, the layout of the symbols may not look anything like the circuit as it appears in the physical world: instead of representing the way the circuit &quot;looks&quot;, the schematic aims to capture, on a more general level, the way it &quot;works&quot;. This may be contrasted with a wiring diagram, which preserves the spatial relationships between each of its components.

==Types==
Schematics and other types of diagrams, e.g.,
A semi-schematic diagram combines some of the abstraction of a purely schematic diagram with other elements displayed as realistically as possible, for various reasons. It is a compromise between a purely abstract diagram (e.g. the schematic of the Washington Metro) and an exclusively realistic representation (e.g. the corresponding aerial view of Washington).

==Electrical and electronic industry==


In electrical and electronic industry, a schematic diagram is often used to describe the design of equipment. Schematic diagrams are often used for the maintenance and repair of electronic and electromechanical systems. While schematics were traditionally drawn by hand, using standardized templates or pre-printed adhesive symbols, today electronic design automation software (EDA or &quot;electrical CAD&quot;) is often used.

In electronic design automation, until the 1980s schematics were virtually the only formal representation for circuits. More recently, with the progress of computer technology, other representations were introduced and specialized computer languages were developed, since with the explosive growth of the complexity of electronic circuits, traditional schematics are becoming less practical. For example, hardware description languages are indispensable for modern digital circuit design.

Schematics for electronic circuits are prepared by designers using EDA (electronic design automation) tools called schematic capture tools or schematic entry tools. These tools go beyond simple drawing of devices and connections. Usually they are integrated into the whole design flow and linked to other EDA tools for verification and simulation of the circuit under design.

Programmable logic controllers (PLC) can be programmed using ladder diagrams.

In electric power systems design, a schematic drawing called a &quot;one-line&quot; &quot;diagram&quot; is frequently used to represent substations, distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These diagrams simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a three-phase system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical diagrams for switchgear often have common device functions designate by standard function numbers. Another type of diagram used for power systems is a &quot;three-line diagram&quot;.

For analysis purposes of a power system, from the one-line diagram, if the system is balanced, an &quot;equivalent per-phase&quot; (or &quot;single-phase&quot;) &quot;schematic diagram&quot; can be obtained. If all of the parameters are represented as impedances and voltage sources, the equivalent per-phase schematic diagram is called an &quot;impedance diagram&quot;. If all of the parameters are represented as admittances and current sources, the equivalent per-phase schematic diagram is called an &quot;admittance diagram&quot;.

If the power system is unbalanced, but it is linear (or can be approximated by a linear system), then Fortescue&#x27;s theorem (symmetrical components) can be applied. In this way, from the one-line diagram, three different per-phase schematic diagrams are obtained, known as &quot;sequence diagrams&quot;: &quot;positive sequence diagram&quot;, &quot;negative sequence diagram&quot;, and &quot;zero sequence diagram&quot;. Each of these diagrams can be represented as an impedance diagram or as an admittance diagram.

==Schematics in repair manuals==

Schematic diagrams are used extensively in repair manuals to help users understand the interconnections of parts, and to provide graphical instruction to assist in dismantling and rebuilding mechanical assemblies. Many automotive and motorcycle repair manuals devote a significant number of pages to schematic diagrams.

<doc id="41680" wikidata="Q535939" url="?curid=41680" title="Scrambler">
<text>In telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender&#x27;s side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal. Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.

In telecommunications and recording, a &quot;scrambler&quot; (also referred to as a &quot;randomizer&quot;) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a &quot;descrambler&quot; at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.

A scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as &quot;whitening sequences&quot;) with other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.

== Purposes of scrambling ==
A scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:
# An algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly random output string of the same length (e.g., by pseudo-randomly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.
# An analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A &quot;truly&quot; random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) deterministic pseudo-random random number generator, which extends the random seed value.

There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:

* To enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding. It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit (see also clock recovery), an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of &#x27;0&#x27; or &#x27;1&#x27; only).
* For energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal interference. It eliminates the dependence of a signal&#x27;s power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the intermodulation (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).

Scramblers are essential components of physical layer system standards besides interleaved coding and modulation. They are usually defined based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.

It is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and link layer) encryption as scrambling as well. This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.

Some standards for digital television, such as DVB-CA and MPE, refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.

== Types of scramblers ==

=== Additive (synchronous) scramblers ===
&quot;Additive scramblers&quot; (they are also referred to as &quot;synchronous&quot;) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).

In order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, &quot;scrambler&quot; and &quot;descrambler&quot;), a &quot;sync-word&quot; must be used.

A sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined &quot;initial state&quot;.

The &quot;additive descrambler&quot; is just the same device as the additive scrambler.

Additive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is formula_1) and its &quot;initial state&quot;.

=== Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ===


&quot;Multiplicative scramblers&quot; (also known as &quot;feed-through&quot;) are called so because they perform a &quot;multiplication&quot; of the input signal by the scrambler&#x27;s transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.
A multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called &quot;self-synchronizing&quot;. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is formula_2), which is also a &quot;transfer function&quot; of the descrambler.

=== Comparison of scramblers ===
Scramblers have certain drawbacks: 
* Both types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions. 
* Multiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler&#x27;s input will result in &quot;w&quot; errors at its output, where &quot;w&quot; equals the number of the scrambler&#x27;s feedback taps). 
* Additive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled. (Alternatively if you know what was sent, the scrambler can be synchronized)
* The effective length of the random sequence of an additive scrambler is limited by the frame length, which is normally much shorter than the period of the PRBS. By adding frame numbers to the frame sync, it is possible to extend the length of the random sequence, by varying the random sequence in accordance with the frame number.

== Noise ==
The first voice scramblers were invented at Bell Labs in the period just before World War II. These sets consisted of electronics that could mix two signals or alternatively &quot;subtract&quot; one signal back out again. The two signals were provided by a telephone and a record player. A matching pair of records was produced, each containing the same recording of noise. The recording was played into the telephone, and the mixed signal was sent over the wire. The noise was then subtracted out at the far end using the matching record, leaving the original voice signal intact. Eavesdroppers would hear only the noisy signal, unable to understand the voice.

One of those, used (among other duties) for telephone conversations between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt was intercepted and unscrambled by the Germans. At least one German engineer had worked at Bell Labs before the war and came up with a way to break them. Later versions were sufficiently different that the German team was unable to unscramble them. Early versions were known as &quot;A-3&quot; (from AT&amp;T Corporation). An unrelated device called SIGSALY was used for higher-level voice communications.

The noise was provided on large shellac phonograph records made in pairs, shipped as needed, and destroyed after use. This worked, but was enormously awkward. Just achieving synchronization of the two records proved difficult. Post-war electronics made such systems much easier to work with by creating pseudo-random noise based on a short input tone. In use, the caller would play a tone into the phone, and both scrambler units would then listen to the signal and synchronize to it. This provided limited security, however, as any listener with a basic knowledge of the electronic circuitry could often produce a machine of similar-enough settings to break into the communications.

== Cryptographic ==
It was the need to synchronize the scramblers that suggested to James H. Ellis the idea for non-secret encryption, which ultimately led to the invention of both the RSA encryption algorithm and Diffie–Hellman key exchange well before either was reinvented publicly by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, or by Diffie and Hellman.

The latest scramblers are not scramblers in the truest sense of the word, but rather digitizers combined with encryption machines. In these systems the original signal is first converted into digital form, and then the digital data is encrypted and sent. Using modern public-key systems, these &quot;scramblers&quot; are much more secure than their earlier analog counterparts. Only these types of systems are considered secure enough for sensitive data.

Voice inversion scrambling can be as simple as inverting the frequency bands around a static point to various complex methods of changing the inversion point randomly and in real time and using multiple bands. Voice inversion with a fixed frequency offers no security at all and software is available to restore the original voice, which is why it is no longer used to protect conversations today. However, voice inversion is still found in low-end Chinese walkie talkies.

The &quot;scramblers&quot; used in cable television are designed to prevent casual signal theft, not to provide any real security. Early versions of these devices simply &quot;inverted&quot; one important component of the TV signal, re-inverting it at the client end for display. Later devices were only slightly more complex, filtering out that component entirely and then adding it by examining other portions of the signal. In both cases the circuitry could be easily built by any reasonably knowledgeable hobbyist. (see Television encryption.)

Electronic kits for scrambling and descrambling are available from hobbyist suppliers. Scanner enthusiasts often use them to listen in to scrambled communications at car races and some public-service transmissions. It is also common in FRS radios. This is an easy way to learn about scrambling.

The term &quot;scrambling&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used when jamming is meant.

== Descramble ==

Descramble in cable television context is the act of taking a scrambled or encrypted video signal that has been provided by a cable television company for premium television services, processed by a scrambler and then supplied over a coaxial cable and delivered to the household where a set-top box reprocesses the signal, thus descrambling it and making it available for viewing on the television set. A descrambler is a device that restores the picture and sound of a scrambled channel. A descrambler must be used with a cable converter box to be able to unencrypt all of the premium &amp; pay-per-view channels of a Cable Television System.

<text>In telecommunications, a secondary frequency standard is a frequency standard that does not have inherent accuracy, and therefore must be calibrated against a primary frequency standard. 

Secondary standards include crystal oscillators and rubidium standards. A crystal oscillator depends for its frequency on its physical dimensions, which vary with fabrication and environmental conditions. A rubidium standard is a secondary standard even though it uses atomic transitions, because it takes the form of a gas cell through which an optical signal is passed. The gas cell has inherent inaccuracies because of gas pressure variations, including those induced by temperature variations. There are also variations in the concentrations of the required buffer gases, which variations cause frequency deviations.

<doc id="41684" wikidata="Q2526135" url="?curid=41684" title="Security">
<text>Security is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercion). Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems, or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change. 

Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g., freedom from want); as the presence of an essential good (e.g., food security); as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g., a secure telephone line); as containment (e.g., a secure room or cell); and as a state of mind (e.g., emotional security).

Security is both a feeling and a state of reality. One can feel secure, while they aren&#x27;t, but also feel insecure while they are secure. This distinction is usually not very clear to express in the English language.

The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security (security company, security police, security forces, security service, security agency, security guard, cyber security systems, security cameras, remote guarding). Security can be physical and virtual.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;secure&#x27; entered the English language in the 16th century. It is derived from Latin &quot;securus&quot;, meaning freedom from anxiety: &quot;se&quot; (without) + &quot;cura&quot; (care, anxiety).

== Overview ==

===Referent ===
A security referent is the focus of a security policy or discourse; for example, a referent may be a potential beneficiary (or victim) of a security policy or system.

Security referents may be persons or social groups, objects, institutions, ecosystems, or any other phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by the forces of its environment. The referent in question may combine many referents in the same way that, for example, a nation-state is composed of many individual citizens.

=== Context ===
The security context is the relationships between a security referent and its environment. From this perspective, security and insecurity depend first on whether the environment is beneficial or hostile to the referent and also on how capable the referent is of responding to their environment in order to survive and thrive.

=== Capabilities ===
The means by which a referent provides for security (or is provided for) vary widely. They include, for example:
* &quot;Coercive capabilities&quot;, including the capacity to project coercive power into the environment (e.g., aircraft carriers, handguns, firearms);
* &quot;Protective systems&quot; (e.g., lock, fence, wall, antivirus software, air defence system, armour)
* &quot;Warning systems&quot; (e.g., alarm, radar)
* &quot;Diplomatic and social action&quot; intended to prevent insecurity from developing (e.g. conflict prevention and transformation strategies); and
* &quot;Policy&quot; intended to develop the lasting economic, physical, ecological, and other conditions of security (e.g., economic reform, ecological protection, progressive demilitarization, militarization).

=== Effects ===
Any action intended to provide security may have multiple effects. An action may have a wide benefit, enhancing security for several or all security referents in the context; alternatively, the action may be effective only temporarily, benefit one referent at the expense of another, or be entirely ineffective or counterproductive.

=== Contested approaches ===
Approaches to security are contested and the subject of debate. For example, in debate about national security strategies, some argue that security depends principally on developing protective and coercive capabilities in order to protect the security referent in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of strategic supremacy). Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also ensuring that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.

The range of security contexts is illustrated by the following examples (in alphabetical order):

===Computer security===

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, and the Internet. The field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies. It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed. The means of computer security include the physical security of systems and the security of information held on them.

=== Corporate security ===

Corporate security refers to the resilience of corporations against espionage, theft, damage, and other threats. The security of corporations has become more complex as reliance on IT systems has increased, and their physical presence has become more highly distributed across several countries, including environments that are, or may rapidly become, hostile to them.


=== Environmental security ===

Environmental security, also known as ecological security, refers to the integrity of ecosystems and the biosphere, particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a diversity of life-forms (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.
=== Home security ===

Home security normally refers to the security systems used on a property used as a dwelling (commonly including doors, locks, alarm systems, lighting, fencing); and personal security practices (such as ensuring doors are locked, alarms are activated, windows are closed etc.)

=== Human security ===
Human security is an emerging paradigm that, in response to traditional emphasis on the right of nation-states to protect themselves, has focused on the primacy of the security of people (individuals and communities). The concept is supported by the United Nations General Assembly, which has stressed &quot;the right of people to live in freedom and dignity&quot; and recognized &quot;that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want&quot;.

===Information security===

Information security refers to the security of information in any form. Spoken, written, digital, networked, technological, and procedural forms of information are all examples that may be covered in an information security management scheme. Computer security, IT security, ICT security, and network security are thus all subdomains of information security.

=== National security ===
National security refers to the security of a nation-state, including its people, economy, and institutions. In practice, state governments rely on a wide range of means, including diplomacy, economic power, and military capabilities.

===Resource security===

&quot;Resource security&quot; refers to the political and commercial objective of ensuring that supplies of materials needed for the production of goods and the satisfaction of human needs can be reliably sustained into the future. It involves protecting the supply of such resources as water, energy, food and industrial raw materials from risks of global depletion and risks to national supply incurred by trade restrictions, government or terrorist interference or market failures. While critical raw materials such as rare earth minerals are an important focus of resource security planning, resource security covers a broader range of resources. Food security, ensuring that a reliable supply of, and access to, safe and nutritious food, and energy security are important aspects of resource security. Food security is gaining in importance as the world&#x27;s population has grown and productive land has diminished through overuse and climate change.
The UK government published a &quot;Resource Security Action Plan&quot; for England in March 2012, subtitled &quot;Making the most of valuable resources&quot;, responding to concerns raised by businesses and business leaders such as the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Engineering Employers&#x27; Federation (EEF), and work in this field undertaken by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee. The action plan was an interdepartmental initiative for which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) took the lead role as first point of contact for business enquiries. 

Government and business concerns related to &quot;a range of renewable and non-renewable resources&quot;, concentrating on those not already covered by energy security and food security measures, and especially sought to protect the supply of certain specific metals and materials under supply pressure. A generalised fear of resource insufficiency was felt to be inappropriate: thus Vince Cable, then Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills, spoke in December 2011 about a public policy approach to resource management: Similarly the &quot;Action Plan&quot; notes that in general the issue of &quot;resource security&quot; is not concerned with &quot;scarcity&quot; of resources but with availability, supply constraints and the potential financial and environmental costs of opening up new sources of supply.

EEF, the UK&#x27;s manufacturers&#x27; representation organisation (now Make UK) issued a report in 2014 entitled &quot;Materials for Manufacturing: Safeguarding Supply&quot;, along with an appeal to the government seeking action to protect the country&#x27;s supply of essential materials. The report highlighted &quot;over-reliance on China for strategic supplies&quot; as a key issue. The EEF and other partners argued that an &quot;Office of Resource Management&quot; within government &quot;could strategically co-ordinate action across Whitehall&quot;. The office would form part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and maintain an overview of the risks to resource security.

== Perceptions of security ==
Since it is not possible to know with precision the extent to which something is &#x27;secure&#x27; (and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable), perceptions of security vary, often greatly. For example, a fear of death by earthquake is common in the United States (US), but slipping on the bathroom floor kills more people; and in France, the United Kingdom, and the US, there are far fewer deaths caused by terrorism than there are women killed by their partners in the home.

Another problem of perception is the common assumption that the mere presence of a security system (such as armed forces or antivirus software) implies security. For example, two computer security programs installed on the same device can prevent each other from working properly, while the user assumes that he or she benefits from twice the protection that only one program would afford.

Security theater is a critical term for measures that change perceptions of security without necessarily affecting security itself. For example, visual signs of security protections, such as a home that advertises its alarm system, may deter an intruder, whether or not the system functions properly. Similarly, the increased presence of military personnel on the streets of a city after a terrorist attack may help to reassure the public, whether or not it diminishes the risk of further attacks.

==Recurring concepts==
Certain concepts recur throughout different fields of security:
* Access control – the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource.
* Assurance – an expression of confidence that a security measure will perform as expected.
* Authorization – the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.
* Cipher – an algorithm that defines a set of steps to encrypt or decrypt information so that it is incomprehensible.
* Countermeasure – a means of preventing an act or system from having its intended effect.
* Defense in depth – a school of thought holding that a wider range of security measures will enhance security.
* Exploit (noun) – a means of capitalizing on a vulnerability in a security system (usually a cyber-security system).
* Identity management – enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons.
* Password – secret data, typically a string of characters, usually used to confirm a user&#x27;s identity.
* Resilience – the degree to which a person, community, nation or system is able to resist adverse external forces.
* Risk – a possible event which could lead to damage, harm, or loss.
* Security management – identification of an organization&#x27;s assets (including people, buildings, machines, systems and information assets), followed by the development, documentation, and implementation of policies and procedures for protecting these assets.
* Security seal
* Threat – a potential source of harm.
* Vulnerability – the degree to which something may be changed (usually in an unwanted manner) by external forces.

<text>Security management is the identification of an organization&#x27;s assets i.e. including people, buildings, machines, systems and information assets, followed by the development, documentation, and implementation of policies and procedures for protecting assets.

An organization uses such security management procedures for information classification, threat assessment, risk assessment, and risk analysis to identify threats, categorize assets, and rate system vulnerabilities.

==Loss prevention==

Loss prevention focuses on what one&#x27;s critical assets are and how they are going to protect them. A key component to loss prevention is assessing the potential threats to the successful achievement of the goal. This must include the potential opportunities that further the object (why take the risk unless there&#x27;s an upside?) Balance probability and impact determine and implement measures to minimize or eliminate those threats.

Security management includes the theories, concepts, ideas, methods, procedures, and practices that are used to manage and control organizational resources in order to accomplish security goals. Policies, procedures, administration, operations, training, awareness campaigns, financial management, contracting, resource allocation, and dealing with problems like security degradation are all included in this vast sector.

==Security risk management==

The management of security risks applies the principles of risk management to the management of security threats. It consists of identifying threats (or risk causes), assessing the effectiveness of existing controls to face those threats, determining the risks&#x27; consequence(s), prioritizing the risks by rating the likelihood and impact, classifying the type of risk, and selecting an appropriate risk option or risk response. In 2016, a universal standard for managing risks was developed in The Netherlands. In 2017, it was updated and named: Universal Security Management Systems Standard 2017.

===Types of risks===

====External====
* Strategic: Competition and customer demand.
* Operational: Regulations, suppliers, and contract.
* Financial: FX and credit.
* Hazard: Natural disasters, cyber, and external criminal acts.
* Compliance: New regulatory or legal requirements are introduced, or existing ones are changed, exposing the organization to a non-compliance risk if measures are not taken to ensure compliance.

====Internal====
* Strategic: R&amp;D.
* Operational: Systems and processes (H&amp;R, Payroll).
* Financial: Liquidity and cash flow.
* Hazard: Safety and security; employees and equipment.
* Compliance: Concrete or potential changes in an organization&#x27;s systems, processes, suppliers, etc. may create exposure to a legal or regulatory non-compliance.
Risk options

====Risk avoidance====
The first choice to be considered is the possibility of eliminating the existence of criminal opportunity or avoiding the creation of such an opportunity. When additional considerations or factors are not created as a result of this action that would create a greater risk. For example, removing all the cash flow from a retail outlet would eliminate the opportunity for stealing the money, but it would also eliminate the ability to conduct business.

====Risk reduction====
When avoiding or eliminating the criminal opportunity conflicts with the ability to conduct business, the next step is reducing the opportunity of potential loss to the lowest level consistent with the function of the business. In the example above, the application of risk reduction might result in the business keeping only enough cash on hand for one day&#x27;s operation.

====Risk spreading====
Assets that remain exposed after the application of reduction and avoidance are the subjects of risk spreading. This is the concept that limits loss or potential losses by exposing the perpetrator to the probability of detection and apprehension prior to the consummation of the crime through the application of perimeter lighting, barred windows, and intrusion detection systems. The idea is to reduce the time available for thieves to steal assets and escape without apprehension.

====Risk transfer====
The two primary methods of accomplishing risk transfer is to insure the assets or raise prices to cover the loss in the event of a criminal act. Generally speaking, when the first three steps have been properly applied, the cost of transferring risks is much lower.

====Risk acceptance====
All of the remaining risks must simply be assumed by the business as a part of doing business. Included with these accepted losses are deductibles, which have been made as part of the insurance coverage.

==Security policy implementations==

===Intrusion detection===
* Alarm device.

===Access control===
* Locks, simple or sophisticated, such as biometric authentication and keycard locks.

===Physical security===
* Environmental elements (ex. Mountains, Trees, etc.).
* Barricade.
* Security guards (armed or unarmed) with wireless communication devices (e.g., two-way radio).
* Security lighting (spotlight, etc.).
* Security Cameras.
* Motion Detectors.
* IBNS containers for cash in transit.

===Procedures===
* Coordination with law enforcement agencies.
* Fraud management.
* Risk Management.
* CPTED.
* Risk Analysis.
* Risk Mitigation.
* Contingency Planning.

<doc id="41687" wikidata="Q56313399" url="?curid=41687" title="Self-synchronizing code">
<text>In coding theory, especially in telecommunications, a self-synchronizing code is a uniquely decodable code in which the symbol stream formed by a portion of one code word, or by the overlapped portion of any two adjacent code words, is not a valid code word. Put another way, a set of strings (called &quot;code words&quot;) over an alphabet is called a self-synchronizing code if for each string obtained by concatenating two code words, the substring starting at the second symbol and ending at the second-last symbol does not contain any code word as substring. Every self-synchronizing code is a prefix code, but not all prefix codes are self-synchronizing.

Other terms for self-synchronizing code are synchronized code or, ambiguously, comma-free code. A self-synchronizing code permits the proper framing of transmitted code words provided that no uncorrected errors occur in the symbol stream; external synchronization is not required. Self-synchronizing codes also allow recovery from uncorrected errors in the stream; with most prefix codes, an uncorrected error in a single bit may propagate errors further in the stream and make the subsequent data corrupted.

Importance of self-synchronizing codes is not limited to data transmission. Self-synchronization also facilitates some cases of data recovery, for example of a digitally encoded text.

==Examples==
* UTF-8 is self-synchronizing because the leading byte (codice_1) and subsequent bytes (codice_2) of a multi-byte code point have different bit patterns.
* High Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
* Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP)
* Fibonacci coding

Counterexamples:
* The prefix code {00, 11} is not self-synchronizing; while 0, 1, 01 and 10 are not codes, 00 and 11 are.
* The prefix code {&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;ba&quot;} is not self-synchronizing because &quot;abab&quot; contains &quot;ba&quot;.
* The prefix code &quot;b&quot;∗a (using the Kleene star) is not self-synchronizing (even though any new code word simply starts after &quot;a&quot;) because code word &quot;ba&quot; contains code word &quot;a&quot;.

<text>In telecommunications, the term shadow loss has the following meanings: 

# The attenuation caused to a radio signal by obstructions in the propagation path. 
# In a reflector antenna, the relative reduction in the effective aperture of the antenna caused by the masking effect of other antenna parts, such as a feed horn or a secondary reflector, which parts obstruct the radiation path.

<text>A shield is a piece of personal armour held in the hand, which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, whether from close-ranged weaponry like spears or long ranged projectiles such as arrows. They function as means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat.

Shields vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from large panels that protect the user&#x27;s whole body to small models (such as the buckler) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of spears and crossbow bolts, others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes (like the roromaraugi or qauata). Finally, shields vary greatly in shape, ranging in roundness to angularity, proportional length and width, symmetry and edge pattern; different shapes provide more optimal protection for infantry or cavalry, enhance portability, provide secondary uses such as ship protection or as a weapon and so on.

In prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilisations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or wicker. In classical antiquity, the Barbarian Invasions and the Middle Ages, they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry.

Depending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial or scalloped. Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eye-hole, to look through when used with combat. The shield was held by a central grip or by straps with some going over or around the user&#x27;s arm and one or more being held by the hand.

Often shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. It was common for Aristocratic officials such and knights, barons, dukes, and kings to have their shields painted with customary designs known as a coat of arms. These designs developed into systematized heraldic devices during the High Middle Ages for purposes of battlefield identification. Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. In the 18th century, for example, Scottish Highland fighters liked to wield small shields known as targes, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as Zulu warriors) employed them when waging wars.

In the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The first prototype of the shield was believed to be created in the Late Neolithic Age. However the oldest surviving shields date to sometime in the Bronze Age. The oldest form of shield was a protection device designed to block attacks by hand weapons, such as swords, axes and maces, or ranged weapons like sling-stones and arrows. Shields have varied greatly in construction over time and place. Sometimes shields were made of metal, but wood or animal hide construction was much more common; wicker and even turtle shells have been used. Many surviving examples of metal shields are generally felt to be ceremonial rather than practical, for example the Yetholm-type shields of the Bronze Age, or the Iron Age Battersea shield.

===Ancient===

Size and weight varied greatly. Lightly armored warriors relying on speed and surprise would generally carry light shields (&quot;pelte&quot;) that were either small or thin. Heavy troops might be equipped with robust shields that could cover most of the body. Many had a strap called a guige that allowed them to be slung over the user&#x27;s back when not in use or on horseback. During the 14th–13th century BC, the Sards or Shardana, working as mercenaries for the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II, utilized either large or small round shields against the Hittites. The Mycenaean Greeks used two types of shields: the &quot;figure-of-eight&quot; shield and a rectangular &quot;tower&quot; shield. These shields were made primarily from a wicker frame and then reinforced with leather. Covering the body from head to foot, the figure-of-eight and tower shield offered most of the warrior&#x27;s body a good deal of protection in hand-to-hand combat. The Ancient Greek hoplites used a round, bowl-shaped wooden shield that was reinforced with bronze and called an &quot;aspis&quot;. The aspis was also the longest-lasting and most famous and influential of all of the ancient Greek shields. The Spartans used the aspis to create the Greek phalanx formation. Their shields offered protection not only for themselves but for their comrades to their left. 
Examples of Germanic wooden shields circa 350 BC – 500 AD survive from weapons sacrifices in Danish bogs.

The heavily armored Roman legionaries carried large shields (&quot;scuta&quot;) that could provide far more protection, but made swift movement a little more difficult. The &quot;scutum&quot; originally had an oval shape, but gradually the curved tops and sides were cut to produce the familiar rectangular shape most commonly seen in the early Imperial legions. Famously, the Romans used their shields to create a tortoise-like formation called a &quot;testudo&quot; in which entire groups of soldiers would be enclosed in an armoured box to provide protection against missiles. Many ancient shield designs featured incuts of one sort or another. This was done to accommodate the shaft of a spear, thus facilitating tactics requiring the soldiers to stand close together forming a wall of shields.

=== Post-classical ===
Typical in the early European Middle Ages were round shields with light, non-splitting wood like linden, fir, alder, or poplar, usually reinforced with leather cover on one or both sides and occasionally metal rims, encircling a metal shield boss. These light shields suited a fighting style where each incoming blow is intercepted with the boss in order to deflect it. The Normans introduced the kite shield around the 10th century, which was rounded at the top and tapered at the bottom. This gave some protection to the user&#x27;s legs, without adding too much to the total weight of the shield. The kite shield predominantly features enarmes, leather straps used to grip the shield tight to the arm. Used by foot and mounted troops alike, it gradually came to replace the round shield as the common choice until the end of the 12th century, when more efficient limb armour allowed the shields to grow shorter, and be entirely replaced by the 14th century.

As body armour improved, knight&#x27;s shields became smaller, leading to the familiar heater shield style. Both kite and heater style shields were made of several layers of laminated wood, with a gentle curve in cross section. The heater style inspired the shape of the symbolic heraldic shield that is still used today. Eventually, specialised shapes were developed such as the &quot;bouche&quot;, which had a lance rest cut into the upper corner of the lance side, to help guide it in combat or tournament. Free standing shields called pavises, which were propped up on stands, were used by medieval crossbowmen who needed protection while reloading.

In time, some armoured foot knights gave up shields entirely in favour of mobility and two-handed weapons. Other knights and common soldiers adopted the buckler, giving rise to the term &quot;swashbuckler&quot;. The buckler is a small round shield, typically between 8 and 16 inches (20–40 cm) in diameter. The buckler was one of very few types of shield that were usually made of metal. Small and light, the buckler was easily carried by being hung from a belt; it gave little protection from missiles and was reserved for hand-to-hand combat where it served both for protection and offence. The buckler&#x27;s use began in the Middle Ages and continued well into the 16th century.

In Italy, the targa, parma, and rotella were used by common people, fencers and even knights. The development of plate armour made shields less and less common as it eliminated the need for a shield. Lightly armoured troops continued to use shields after men-at-arms and knights ceased to use them. Shields continued in use even after gunpowder powered weapons made them essentially obsolete on the battlefield. In the 18th century, the Scottish clans used a small, round targe that was partially effective against the firearms of the time, although it was arguably more often used against British infantry bayonets and cavalry swords in close-in fighting.

During the 19th century, non-industrial cultures with little access to guns were still using war shields. Zulu warriors carried large lightweight shields called Ishlangu made from a single ox hide supported by a wooden spine. This was used in combination with a short spear (iklwa) and/or club. Other African shields include Glagwa from Cameroon or Nguba from Congo.

=== Modern ===

==== Law enforcement shields ====

Shields for protection from armed attack are still used by many police forces around the world. These modern shields are usually intended for two broadly distinct purposes. The first type, riot shields, are used for riot control and can be made from metal or polymers such as polycarbonate Lexan or Makrolon or boPET Mylar. These typically offer protection from relatively large and low velocity projectiles, such as rocks and bottles, as well as blows from fists or clubs. Synthetic riot shields are normally transparent, allowing full use of the shield without obstructing vision. Similarly, metal riot shields often have a small window at eye level for this purpose. These riot shields are most commonly used to block and push back crowds when the users stand in a &quot;wall&quot; to block protesters, and to protect against shrapnel, projectiles like stones and bricks, molotov cocktails, and during hand-to-hand combat.

The second type of modern police shield is the bullet-resistant ballistic shield, also called tactical shield. These shields are typically manufactured from advanced synthetics such as Kevlar and are designed to be bulletproof, or at least bullet resistant. Two types of shields are available:

# Light level IIIA shields are designed to stop pistol cartridges.
# Heavy level III and IV shields are designed to stop rifle cartridges. 

Tactical shields often have a firing port so that the officer holding the shield can fire a weapon while being protected by the shield, and they often have a bulletproof glass viewing port. They are typically employed by specialist police, such as SWAT teams in high risk entry and siege scenarios, such as hostage rescue and breaching gang compounds, as well as in antiterrorism operations.

Law enforcement shields often have a large signs stating &quot;POLICE&quot; (or the name of a force, such as &quot;US MARSHALS&quot;) to indicate that the user is a law enforcement officer.

<doc id="41699" wikidata="Q746165" url="?curid=41699" title="Shift register">
<text>A shift register is a type of digital circuit using a cascade of flip-flops where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next. They share a single clock signal, which causes the data stored in the system to shift from one location to the next. By connecting the last flip-flop back to the first, the data can cycle within the shifters for extended periods, and in this configuration they were used as computer memory, displacing delay-line memory systems in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In most cases, several parallel shift registers would be used to build a larger memory pool known as a &quot;bit array&quot;. Data was stored into the array and read back out in parallel, often as a computer word, while each bit was stored serially in the shift registers. There is an inherent trade-off in the design of bit arrays; putting more flip-flops in a row allows a single shifter to store more bits, but requires more clock cycles to push the data through all of the shifters before the data can be read back out again.

Shift registers can have both parallel and serial inputs and outputs. These are often configured as &quot;serial-in, parallel-out&quot; (SIPO) or as &quot;parallel-in, serial-out&quot; (PISO). There are also types that have both serial and parallel input and types with serial and parallel output. There are also &quot;bidirectional&quot; shift registers, which allow shifting in both directions: L → R or R → L. The serial input and last output of a shift register can also be connected to create a &quot;circular shift register&quot;. A PIPO register (parallel in, parallel out) is simply a D-type register and is &quot;not&quot; a shift register, but is very fast – an output is given within a single clock pulse. A &quot;universal&quot; shift register provides bidirectional serial-in and serial-out, as well as parallel-in and parallel-out.

== Serial-in serial-out (SISO) ==
=== Destructive readout ===
These are the simplest kind of shift registers. The data string is presented at &quot;data in&quot; and is shifted right one stage each time &quot;data advance&quot; is brought high. At each advance, the bit on the far left (i.e. &quot;data in&quot;) is shifted into the first flip-flop&#x27;s output. The bit on the far right (i.e. &quot;data out&quot;) is shifted out and lost.

The data is stored after each flip-flop on the &quot;Q&quot; output, so there are four storage &quot;slots&quot; available in this arrangement, hence it is a 4-bit register. To give an idea of the shifting pattern, imagine that the register holds 0000 (so all storage slots are empty). As &quot;data in&quot; presents 1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0 (in that order, with a pulse at &quot;data advance&quot; each time—this is called clocking or strobing) to the register, this is the result. The right hand column corresponds to the right-most flip-flop&#x27;s output pin, and so on.

So the serial output of the entire register is 00010110. It can be seen that if data were to be continued to input, it would get exactly what was put in (10110000), but offset by four &quot;data advance&quot; cycles. This arrangement is the hardware equivalent of a queue. Also, at any time, the whole register can be set to zero by bringing the reset (R) pins high.

This arrangement performs &quot;destructive readout&quot; each datum is lost once it has been shifted out of the right-most bit.

==Serial-in parallel-out (SIPO)==

This configuration allows conversion from serial to parallel format. Data input is serial, as described in the SISO section above. Once the data has been clocked in, it may be either read off at each output simultaneously, or it can be shifted out.

In this configuration, each flip-flop is edge triggered. All flip-flops operate at the given clock frequency. Each input bit makes its way down to the Nth output after N clock cycles, leading to parallel output.

In cases where the parallel outputs should not change during the serial loading process, it&#x27;s desirable to use a latched or buffered output. In a latched shift register (such as the 74595) the serial data is first loaded into an internal buffer register, then upon receipt of a load signal the state of the buffer register is copied into a set of output registers. In general, the practical application of the serial-in/parallel-out shift register is to convert data from serial format on a single wire to parallel format on multiple wires.

== Parallel-in serial-out (PISO) ==
This configuration has the data input on lines D1 through D4 in parallel format, D1 being the most significant bit. To write the data to the register, the Write/Shift control line must be held LOW. To shift the data, the W/S control line is brought HIGH and the registers are clocked. The arrangement now acts as a PISO shift register, with D1 as the Data Input. However, as long as the number of clock cycles is not more than the length of the data-string, the Data Output, Q, will be the parallel data read off in order. The animation below shows the write/shift sequence, including the internal state of the shift register. 

==Uses==
=== Serial and parallel conversion ===

One of the most common uses of a shift register is to convert between serial and parallel interfaces.

=== Delay ===

Serial-in serial-out shift registers can be used as simple delay circuits.

=== Stack ===

Several bidirectional shift registers can also be connected in parallel for a hardware implementation of a stack.

=== More I/O pins ===
Shift registers are commonly attached to microcontrollers when more general-purpose input/output pins are required than are available, sometimes over a Serial Peripheral Interface in daisy chain configuration, which allows any number of binary devices to be accessed using only two to four pins, though more slowly than parallel I/O.

For more outputs, SIPO shift registers are used. The parallel outputs of the shift register and the desired state for all those devices can be sent out of the microcontroller using a single serial connection.

For more inputs, PISO shift registers are used. Each binary input (such as a button or more complicated circuitry) is attached to a parallel input of the shift register, then the data is sent back serially to the microcontroller.

=== Pulse extenders ===
Shift registers can also be used as pulse extenders. Compared to monostable multivibrators, the timing does not depend on component values, but it requires an external clock, and the timing accuracy is limited by the granularity of this clock. An example of such a pulse extender is the Ronja Twister, wherein five 74164 shift registers create the core of the timing logic this way (schematic).

=== Data processing ===
In early computers, shift registers were used to handle data processing: two numbers to be added were stored in two shift registers and clocked out into an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) with the result being fed back to the input of one of the shift registers (the accumulator), which was one bit longer, since binary addition can only result in an answer that has the same size or is one bit longer.

=== Bitshift operations ===

Many computer languages include bitwise operations to &quot;shift right&quot; and &quot;shift left&quot; the data in a register, effectively dividing by two or multiplying by two for each place shifted.

=== Shift register memory ===
Very large serial-in serial-out shift registers (thousands of bits in size) were used in a similar manner to the earlier delay-line memory in some devices built in the early 1970s. Shift registers don&#x27;t need many pins or address decoding logic, so was much cheaper than random-access memory back then. Such &quot;shift register memory&quot; was sometimes called &quot;circulating memory&quot;.

Datapoint 3300, for example, stored its terminal display of 25 rows of 72 columns of 6-bit upper-case characters using 54 200-bit shift registers (arranged in 6 tracks of 9 packs), providing storage for 1800 characters. The shift register design meant that scrolling the terminal display could be accomplished by simply pausing the display output to skip one line of characters. A similar design was used for the Apple I&#x27;s terminal.

==History==
One of the first known examples of a shift register was in the Mark 2 Colossus, a code-breaking machine built in 1944. It was a six-stage device built of vacuum tubes and thyratrons. A shift register was also used in the IAS machine, built by John von Neumann and others at the Institute for Advanced Study in the late 1940s. Shift registers made their way into integrated circuits in the 1960s as evidenced by early patents from Frank Wanlass and Kent Smith working at General Instrument.

<text>Shot noise or Poisson noise is a type of noise which can be modeled by a Poisson process. 

In electronics shot noise originates from the discrete nature of electric charge. Shot noise also occurs in photon counting in optical devices, where shot noise is associated with the particle nature of light.

==Origin==

In a statistical experiment such as tossing a fair coin and counting the occurrences of heads and tails, the numbers of heads and tails after many throws will differ by only a tiny percentage, while after only a few throws outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot. From the law of large numbers, one can show that the relative fluctuations reduce as the reciprocal square root of the number of throws, a result valid for all statistical fluctuations, including shot noise.

Shot noise exists because phenomena such as light and electric current consist of the movement of discrete (also called &quot;quantized&quot;) &#x27;packets&#x27;. Consider light—a stream of discrete photons—coming out of a laser pointer and hitting a wall to create a visible spot. The fundamental physical processes that govern light emission are such that these photons are emitted from the laser at random times; but the many billions of photons needed to create a spot are so many that the brightness, the number of photons per unit of time, varies only infinitesimally with time. However, if the laser brightness is reduced until only a handful of photons hit the wall every second, the relative fluctuations in number of photons, i.e., brightness, will be significant, just as when tossing a coin a few times. These fluctuations are shot noise.

The concept of shot noise was first introduced in 1918 by Walter Schottky who studied fluctuations of current in vacuum tubes.

Shot noise may be dominant when the finite number of particles that carry energy (such as electrons in an electronic circuit or photons in an optical device) is sufficiently small so that uncertainties due to the Poisson distribution, which describes the occurrence of independent random events, are significant. It is important in electronics, telecommunications, optical detection, and fundamental physics.

The term can also be used to describe any noise source, even if solely mathematical, of similar origin. For instance, particle simulations may produce a certain amount of &quot;noise&quot;, where because of the small number of particles simulated, the simulation exhibits undue statistical fluctuations which don&#x27;t reflect the real-world system. The magnitude of shot noise increases according to the square root of the expected number of events, such as the electric current or intensity of light. But since the strength of the signal itself increases more rapidly, the &quot;relative&quot; proportion of shot noise decreases and the signal-to-noise ratio (considering only shot noise) increases anyway. Thus shot noise is most frequently observed with small currents or low light intensities that have been amplified.

=== Signal-to-Noise ===
For large numbers, the Poisson distribution approaches a normal distribution about its mean, and the elementary events (photons, electrons, etc.) are no longer individually observed, typically making shot noise in actual observations indistinguishable from true Gaussian noise. Since the standard deviation of shot noise is equal to the square root of the average number of events &quot;N&quot;, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given by:

:formula_1

Thus when &quot;N&quot; is very large, the signal-to-noise ratio is very large as well, and any &quot;relative&quot; fluctuations in &quot;N&quot; due to other sources are more likely to dominate over shot noise. However, when the other noise source is at a fixed level, such as thermal noise, or grows slower than formula_2, increasing &quot;N&quot; (the DC current or light level, etc.) can lead to dominance of shot noise.

==Properties==
===Electronic devices===
Shot noise in electronic circuits consists of random fluctuations of DC current, which is due to electric current being the flow of discrete charges (electrons). Because the electron has such a tiny charge, however, shot noise is of relative insignificance in many (but not all) cases of electrical conduction. For instance 1 ampere of current consists of about electrons per second; even though this number will randomly vary by several billion in any given second, such a fluctuation is minuscule compared to the current itself. In addition, shot noise is often less significant as compared with two other noise sources in electronic circuits, flicker noise and Johnson–Nyquist noise. However, shot noise is temperature and frequency independent, in contrast to Johnson–Nyquist noise, which is proportional to temperature, and flicker noise, with the spectral density decreasing with increasing frequency. Therefore, at high frequencies and low temperatures shot noise may become the dominant source of noise.

With very small currents and considering shorter time scales (thus wider bandwidths) shot noise can be significant. For instance, a microwave circuit operates on time scales of less than a nanosecond and if we were to have a current of 16 nanoamperes that would amount to only 100 electrons passing every nanosecond. According to Poisson statistics the &quot;actual&quot; number of electrons in any nanosecond would vary by 10 electrons rms, so that one sixth of the time less than 90 electrons would pass a point and one sixth of the time more than 110 electrons would be counted in a nanosecond. Now with this small current viewed on this time scale, the shot noise amounts to 1/10 of the DC current itself.

The result by Schottky, based on the assumption that the statistics of electrons passage is Poissonian, reads for the spectral noise density at the frequency formula_3,
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the electron charge, and formula_6 is the average current of the electron stream. The noise spectral power is frequency independent, which means the noise is white. This can be combined with the Landauer formula, which relates the average current with the transmission eigenvalues formula_7 of the contact through which the current is measured (formula_8 labels transport channels). In the simplest case, these transmission eigenvalues can be taken to be energy independent and so the Landauer formula is 
:formula_9
where formula_10 is the applied voltage. This provides for 
:formula_11
commonly referred to as the Poisson value of shot noise, formula_12. This is a classical result in the sense that it does not take into account that electrons obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. The correct result takes into account the quantum statistics of electrons and reads (at zero temperature)
:formula_13
It was obtained in the 1990s by Viktor Khlus, Gordey Lesovik (independently the single-channel case), and Markus Büttiker (multi-channel case). This noise is white and is always suppressed with respect to the Poisson value. The degree of suppression, formula_14, is known as the Fano factor. Noises produced by different transport channels are independent. Fully open (formula_15) and fully closed (formula_16) channels produce no noise, since there are no irregularities in the electron stream.

At finite temperature, a closed expression for noise can be written as well. It interpolates between shot noise (zero temperature) and Nyquist-Johnson noise (high temperature).

====Examples====
* Tunnel junction is characterized by low transmission in all transport channels, therefore the electron flow is Poissonian, and the Fano factor equals one.
* Quantum point contact is characterized by an ideal transmission in all open channels, therefore it does not produce any noise, and the Fano factor equals zero. The exception is the step between plateaus, when one of the channels is partially open and produces noise.
* A metallic diffusive wire has a Fano factor of 1/3 regardless of the geometry and the details of the material.
* In 2DEG exhibiting fractional quantum Hall effect electric current is carried by quasiparticles moving at the sample edge whose charge is a rational fraction of the electron charge. The first direct measurement of their charge was through the shot noise in the current.

====Effects of interactions====
While this is the result when the electrons contributing to the current occur completely randomly, unaffected by each other, there are important cases in which these natural fluctuations are largely suppressed due to a charge build up. Take the previous example in which an average of 100 electrons go from point A to point B every nanosecond. During the first half of a nanosecond we would expect 50 electrons to arrive at point B on the average, but in a particular half nanosecond there might well be 60 electrons which arrive there. This will create a more negative electric charge at point B than average, and that extra charge will tend to &quot;repel&quot; the further flow of electrons from leaving point A during the remaining half nanosecond. Thus the net current integrated over a nanosecond will tend more to stay near its average value of 100 electrons rather than exhibiting the expected fluctuations (10 electrons rms) we calculated. This is the case in ordinary metallic wires and in metal film resistors, where shot noise is almost completely cancelled due to this anti-correlation between the motion of individual electrons, acting on each other through the coulomb force.

However this reduction in shot noise does not apply when the current results from random events at a potential barrier which all the electrons must overcome due to a random excitation, such as by thermal activation. This is the situation in p-n junctions, for instance. A semiconductor diode is thus commonly used as a noise source by passing a particular DC current through it.

In other situations interactions can lead to an enhancement of shot noise, which is the result of a super-poissonian statistics. For example, in a resonant tunneling diode the interplay of electrostatic interaction and of the density of states in the quantum well leads to a strong enhancement of shot noise when the device is biased in the negative differential resistance region of the current-voltage characteristics.

Shot noise is distinct from voltage and current fluctuations expected in thermal equilibrium; this occurs without any applied DC voltage or current flowing. These fluctuations are known as Johnson–Nyquist noise or thermal noise and increase in proportion to the Kelvin temperature of any resistive component. However both are instances of white noise and thus cannot be distinguished simply by observing them even though their origins are quite dissimilar.

Since shot noise is a Poisson process due to the finite charge of an electron, one can compute the root mean square current fluctuations as being of a magnitude

:formula_17

where &quot;q&quot; is the elementary charge of an electron, Δ&quot;f&quot; is the single-sided bandwidth in hertz over which the noise is considered, and &quot;I&quot; is the DC current flowing.

For a current of 100 mA, measuring the current noise over a bandwidth of 1 Hz, we obtain

:formula_18
If this noise current is fed through a resistor a noise voltage of
:formula_19
would be generated. Coupling this noise through a capacitor, one could supply a noise power of
:formula_20
to a matched load.

===Detectors===
The flux signal that is incident on a detector is calculated as follows, in units of photons:
formula_21

where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. Following Poisson statistics, the photon noise is calculated as the square root of the signal:
formula_22

The SNR for a CCD camera can be calculated from the following equation:
formula_23
where:
*&quot;I&quot; = photon flux (photons/pixel/second), 
*&quot;QE&quot; = quantum efficiency, 
*&quot;t&quot; = integration time (seconds), 
*&quot;N&quot;&quot;d&quot; = dark current (electrons/pixel/sec), 
*&quot;N&quot;&quot;r&quot; = read noise (electrons).

===Optics ===
In optics, shot noise describes the fluctuations of the number of photons detected (or simply counted in the abstract) because they occur independently of each other. This is therefore another consequence of discretization, in this case of the energy in the electromagnetic field in terms of photons. In the case of photon &quot;detection&quot;, the relevant process is the random conversion of photons into photo-electrons for instance, thus leading to a larger effective shot noise level when using a detector with a quantum efficiency below unity. Only in an exotic squeezed coherent state can the number of photons measured per unit time have fluctuations smaller than the square root of the expected number of photons counted in that period of time. Of course there are other mechanisms of noise in optical signals which often dwarf the contribution of shot noise. When these are absent, however, optical detection is said to be &quot;photon noise limited&quot; as only the shot noise (also known as &quot;quantum noise&quot; or &quot;photon noise&quot; in this context) remains.

Shot noise is easily observable in the case of photomultipliers and avalanche photodiodes used in the Geiger mode, where individual photon detections are observed. However the same noise source is present with higher light intensities measured by any photo detector, and is directly measurable when it dominates the noise of the subsequent electronic amplifier. Just as with other forms of shot noise, the fluctuations in a photo-current due to shot noise scale as the square-root of the average intensity:

:formula_24

The shot noise of a coherent optical beam (having no other noise sources) is a fundamental physical phenomenon, reflecting quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. In optical homodyne detection, the shot noise in the photodetector can be attributed to either the zero point fluctuations of the quantised electromagnetic field, or to the discrete nature of the photon absorption process. However, shot noise itself is not a distinctive feature of quantised field and can also be explained through semiclassical theory. What the semiclassical theory does not predict, however, is the squeezing of shot noise. Shot noise also sets a lower bound on the noise introduced by quantum amplifiers which preserve the phase of an optical signal.

<text>In radio communications, a sideband is a band of frequencies higher than or lower than the carrier frequency, that are the result of the modulation process. The sidebands carry the information transmitted by the radio signal. The sidebands comprise all the spectral components of the modulated signal except the carrier. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). All forms of modulation produce sidebands.

== Sideband creation ==

We can illustrate the creation of sidebands with one trigonometric identity:

:formula_1

Adding formula_2 to both sides:

:formula_3

Substituting (for instance)  formula_4  and  formula_5  where formula_6 represents time:

:formula_7

Adding more complexity and time-variation to the amplitude modulation also adds it to the sidebands, causing them to widen in bandwidth and change with time. In effect, the sidebands &quot;carry&quot; the information content of the signal.

===Sideband Characterization===

In the example above, a cross-correlation of the modulated signal with a pure sinusoid, formula_8 is zero at all values of formula_9 except 1100, 1000, and 900. And the non-zero values reflect the relative strengths of the three components. A graph of that concept, called a Fourier transform (or &quot;spectrum&quot;), is the customary way of visualizing sidebands and defining their parameters.

==Amplitude modulation==

Amplitude modulation of a carrier signal normally results in two mirror-image sidebands. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). For example, if a 900kHz carrier is amplitude modulated by a 1kHz audio signal, there will be components at 899kHz and 901kHz as well as 900kHz in the generated radio frequency spectrum; so an audio bandwidth of (say) 7kHz will require a radio spectrum bandwidth of 14kHz. In conventional AM transmission, as used by &quot;broadcast band&quot; AM stations, the original audio signal can be recovered (&quot;detected&quot;) by either synchronous detector circuits or by simple envelope detectors because the carrier and both sidebands are present. This is sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation (DSB-AM), but not all variants of DSB are compatible with envelope detectors.

In some forms of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term &quot;DSB reduced-carrier&quot; normally implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a receiver circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least synchronise a phase-locked loop but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing double sideband with &quot;suppressed&quot; carrier (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more sophisticated circuits in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the stereophonic difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo FM broadcasting on a 38 kHz subcarrier where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15kHz) and the bottom of the stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38–15kHz, i.e. 23kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19 kHz pilot tone. In another example, the quadrature modulation used historically for chroma information in PAL television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the &quot;back porch&quot; part of each scan line when no image is transmitted. But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a Costas loop or squaring loop. This is common in digital transmission systems such as BPSK where the signal is continually present.
If part of one sideband and all of the other remain, it is called vestigial sideband, used mostly with television broadcasting, which would otherwise take up an unacceptable amount of bandwidth. Transmission in which only one sideband is transmitted is called single-sideband modulation or SSB. SSB is the predominant voice mode on shortwave radio other than shortwave broadcasting. Since the sidebands are mirror images, which sideband is used is a matter of convention.

In SSB, the carrier is suppressed, significantly reducing the electrical power (by up to 12dB) without affecting the information in the sideband. This makes for more efficient use of transmitter power and RF bandwidth, but a beat frequency oscillator must be used at the receiver to reconstitute the carrier. If the reconstituted carrier frequency is wrong then the output of the receiver will have the wrong frequencies, but for speech small frequency errors are no problem for intelligibility. Another way to look at an SSB receiver is as an RF-to-audio frequency transposer: in USB mode, the dial frequency is subtracted from each radio frequency component to produce a corresponding audio component, while in LSB mode each incoming radio frequency component is subtracted from the dial frequency.

==Frequency modulation==
Frequency modulation also generates sidebands, the bandwidth consumed depending on the modulation index - often requiring significantly more bandwidth than DSB. Bessel functions can be used to calculate the bandwidth requirements of FM transmissions. Carson&#x27;s rule is a useful approximation of bandwidth in several applications.

==Effects==

Sidebands can interfere with adjacent channels. The part of the sideband that would overlap the neighboring channel must be suppressed by filters, before or after modulation (often both). In broadcast band frequency modulation (FM), subcarriers above 75kHz are limited to a small percentage of modulation and are prohibited above 99 kHz altogether to protect the ±75 kHz normal deviation and ±100 kHz channel boundaries. Amateur radio and public service FM transmitters generally utilize ±5 kHz deviation.

To accurately reproduce the modulating waveform, the entire signal processing path of the system of transmitter, propagation path, and receiver must have enough bandwidth so that enough of the sidebands can be used to recreate the modulated signal to the desired degree of accuracy.

In a non-linear system such as an amplifier, sidebands of the original signal frequency components may be generated due to distortion. This is generally minimized but may be intentionally done for the fuzzbox musical effect.

<text>Signal compression is the use of various techniques to increase the quality or quantity of signal parameters transmitted through a given telecommunications channel.

Types of signal compression include:

*Bandwidth compression
*Data compression
*Dynamic range compression
*Gain compression
*Image compression
*Lossy compression
*One-way compression function</text><links>
