<text>Gender dysphoria (GD) is the distress a person experiences due to a mismatch between their gender identitytheir personal sense of their own genderand their sex assigned at birth. The term replaced the previous diagnostic label of gender identity disorder (GID) in 2013 with the release of the diagnostic manual DSM-5. The condition was renamed to remove the stigma associated with the term &quot;disorder&quot;. The International Classification of Diseases uses the term &quot;gender incongruence&quot; instead of &quot;gender dysphoria&quot;, defined as a marked and persistent mismatch between gender identity and assigned gender, regardless of distress or impairment. Not all transgender people have gender dysphoria. Gender nonconformity is not the same thing as gender dysphoria and does not always lead to dysphoria or distress.

The causes of gender incongruence are unknown but a gender identity likely reflects genetic, biological, environmental, and cultural factors. Diagnosis can be given at any age, although gender dysphoria in children and adolescents may manifest differently than in adults. Complications may include anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Treatment for gender dysphoria includes social transitioning and often includes hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or gender-affirming surgeries, and psychotherapy.

Some researchers and transgender people argue for the declassification of the condition because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance and reinforces the binary model of gender. However, this declassification could carry implications for healthcare accessibility, as HRT and gender-affirming surgery could be deemed cosmetic by insurance providers, as opposed to medically necessary treatment, thereby affecting coverage.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Distress arising from an incongruence between a person&#x27;s felt gender and assigned sex or gender (usually at birth) is the cardinal symptom of gender dysphoria.

No particular sexual orientation indicates gender dysphoria. A 2021 review in Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience found no relation to sexual orientation, but acknowledged that historically the two were often erroneously conflated. The British National Health Service also stated &quot;gender dysphoria is not related to sexual orientation&quot;.

Gender dysphoria in those assigned male at birth (AMAB) tends to follow one of two broad trajectories: early-onset or late-onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria is behaviorally visible in childhood but may temporarily subside, leading the person to identify as gay or homosexual for a period of time, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. A 2016 review in the Archives of Sexual Behavior states this group is usually sexually attracted to members of their natal sex in adulthood, commonly identifying as heterosexual. Late-onset gender dysphoria does not include visible signs in early childhood, but some report having had wishes to be the opposite sex in childhood that they did not report to others. Likewise, according to the review, transgender people assigned male at birth who experience late-onset gender dysphoria will usually be attracted to women and may identify as lesbians or bisexual, while those with early-onset will usually be attracted to men. The review states a similar pattern occurs in those assigned female at birth (AFAB), with those experiencing early-onset GD being most likely to be attracted to women and those with late-onset being most likely to be attracted to men and identify as gay.

Symptoms of GD in children include preferences for opposite sex-typical toys, games, activities, or playmates as well as a great dislike of their own genitalia. Some children may also experience social isolation from their peers, anxiety, loneliness, and depression. In adolescents and adults, symptoms include the desire to be and to be treated as a different gender. Adults with GD are at increased risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem, and suicide. Transgender people are also at heightened risk for eating disorders and substance abuse. According to the &quot;American Psychiatric Association&quot;, those who experience gender dysphoria later in life &quot;often report having secretly hidden their gender dysphoric feelings from others when they were younger&quot;.

== Causes ==
The specific causes of gender dysphoria remain unknown, and treatments targeting the etiology or pathogenesis of gender dysphoria do not exist. Evidence from studies of twins suggests that genetic factors play a role in the development of gender dysphoria. Gender identity is thought to likely reflect a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. Neurobiological basis of GD has been suggested by the &quot;distinct gray matter volume and brain activation and connectivity differences&quot; in people with GD when compared to controls; and this &quot;leads to the concept of brain gender&quot;.

== Diagnosis ==

=== DSM-5 ===
The American Psychiatric Association permits a diagnosis of &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; in adolescents or adults if two or more of the following criteria are experienced for at least six months&#x27; duration:

* A significant incongruence between one&#x27;s experienced or expressed gender and one&#x27;s sexual characteristics
* A strong desire to be rid of one&#x27;s sexual characteristics due to incongruence with one&#x27;s experienced or expressed gender
* A strong desire for the sexual characteristics of a gender other than one&#x27;s assigned gender
* A strong desire to be of a gender other than one&#x27;s assigned gender
* A strong desire to be treated as a gender other than one&#x27;s assigned gender
* A strong conviction that one has the typical reactions and feelings of a gender other than one&#x27;s assigned gender
In addition, the condition must be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment.

The DSM-5 moved this diagnosis out of the sexual disorders category and into a category of its own. The diagnosis was renamed from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria, after criticisms that the former term was stigmatizing. Subtyping by sexual orientation was deleted. The diagnosis for children was separated from that for adults, as &quot;gender dysphoria in children&quot;. The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing, or ability to express it if they have insight. &quot;Other specified gender dysphoria&quot; or &quot;unspecified gender dysphoria&quot; can be diagnosed if a person does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria but still has clinically significant distress or impairment. Intersex people are no longer excluded from the diagnosis of GD.

=== ICD-11 ===
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) lists three conditions related to gender identity:
* Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ()
* Gender incongruence of childhood ()
* Gender incongruence, unspecified ()

ICD-11 defines gender incongruence as &quot;a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual&#x27;s experienced gender and the assigned sex&quot;, with no requirement for significant distress or impairment.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for a person diagnosed with GD may include psychological counseling, supporting the individual&#x27;s gender expression, or may involve physical transition resulting from medical interventions such as hormonal treatment, genital surgery, electrolysis, laser hair removal, chest surgery, breast surgery or other reconstructive surgeries. The goal of treatment may simply be to reduce problems resulting from the person&#x27;s transgender status, for example, counseling the patient in order to reduce guilt associated with cross-dressing.

Guidelines have been established to aid clinicians. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care are used by some clinicians as treatment guidelines. Others use guidelines outlined in Gianna Israel and Donald Tarver&#x27;s &quot;Transgender Care&quot;. Guidelines for treatment generally follow a &quot;harm reduction&quot; model.

=== Children ===
Medical, scientific, and governmental organizations have opposed conversion therapy, defined as treatment viewing gender nonconformity as pathological and something to be changed, instead supporting approaches that affirm children&#x27;s diverse gender identities. People are more likely to keep having gender dysphoria the more intense their gender dysphoria, cross-gendered behavior, and verbal identification with the desired/experienced gender are (i.e. stating that they &quot;are&quot; a different gender rather than &quot;wish to be&quot; a different gender).

Professionals who treat gender dysphoria in children sometimes prescribe puberty blockers to delay the onset of puberty until a child is believed to be old enough to make an informed decision on whether hormonal or surgical gender reassignment is in their best interest. Short-term side effects of puberty blockers include headaches, fatigue, insomnia, muscle aches and changes in breast tissue, mood, and weight. Research on the long-term effects on brain development, cognitive function, fertility, and sexual function is limited.

A review published in &quot;Child and Adolescent Mental Health&quot; found that puberty blockers are reversible, and that they are associated with such positive outcomes as decreased suicidality in adulthood, improved affect and psychological functioning, and improved social life.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, &quot;Due to the dynamic nature of puberty development, lack of gender-affirming interventions (i.e. social, psychological, and medical) is not a neutral decision; youth often experience worsening dysphoria and negative impact on mental health as the incongruent and unwanted puberty progresses. Trans-affirming treatment, such as the use of puberty suppression, is associated with the relief of emotional distress, and notable gains in psychosocial and emotional development, in trans and gender diverse youth&quot;.

In its position statement published December 2020, the Endocrine Society stated that there is durable evidence for a biological underpinning to gender identity and that pubertal suppression, hormone therapy, and medically indicated surgery are effective and relatively safe when monitored appropriately and have been established as the standard of care. They noted a decrease in suicidal ideation among youth who have access to gender-affirming care and comparable levels of depression to cisgender peers among socially transitioned pre-pubertal youth. In its 2017 guideline on treating those with gender dysphoria, it recommends puberty blockers be started when the child has started puberty (Tanner Stage 2 for breast or genital development) and cross-sex hormones be started at 16, though they note &quot;there may be compelling reasons to initiate sex hormone treatment prior to the age of 16 years in some adolescents with GD/gender incongruence&quot;. They recommend a multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health professionals manage the treatment for those under 18 and recommend &quot;monitoring clinical pubertal development every 3 to 6 months and laboratory parameters every 6 to 12 months during sex hormone treatment&quot;.

The World Professional Association for Transgender Health&#x27;s Standards of Care 8, published in 2022, declare puberty blocking medication as &quot;medically necessary&quot;, and recommends them for usage in transgender adolescents once the patient has reached Tanner stage 2 of development, and state that longitudinal data shows improved outcomes for transgender patients who receive them. Some medical professionals disagree that adolescents are cognitively mature enough to make a decision with regard to hormone therapy or surgery, and advise that irreversible genital procedures should not be performed on individuals under the age of legal consent in their respective country.

A review commissioned by the UK Department of Health found that there was very low certainty of quality of evidence about puberty blocker outcomes in terms of mental health, quality of life and impact on gender dysphoria. The Finnish government commissioned a review of the research evidence for treatment of minors and the Finnish Ministry of Health concluded that there are no research-based health care methods for minors with gender dysphoria. Nevertheless, they recommend the use of puberty blockers for minors on a case-by-case basis, and the American Academy of Pediatrics state that &quot;pubertal suppression in children who identify as TGD [transgender and gender diverse] generally leads to improved psychological functioning in adolescence and young adulthood.&quot;

In the United States, several states have introduced or are considering legislation that would prohibit the use of puberty blockers in the treatment of transgender children. The American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics oppose bans on puberty blockers for transgender children. In the UK, in the case of &quot;Bell v Tavistock&quot;, an appeal court, overturning the original decision, ruled that children under 16 could give consent to receiving puberty blockers. In 2022, the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden issued new guidelines recommending that puberty blockers only be given in &quot;exceptional cases&quot; and said that their use was grounded in &quot;uncertain science.&quot; Instead, they recommended child psychiatric treatment, psychosocial interventions, and suicide prevention measures to be offered by clinicians.

=== Psychological treatments ===

Until the 1970s, psychotherapy was the primary treatment for gender dysphoria and generally was directed to helping the person adjust to their assigned sex. Psychotherapy is any therapeutic interaction that aims to treat a psychological problem. Psychotherapy may be used in addition to biological interventions, although some clinicians use only psychotherapy to treat gender dysphoria. Psychotherapeutic treatment of GD involves helping the patient to adapt to their gender incongruence or to explorative investigation of confounding co-occurring mental health issues. Attempts to alleviate GD by changing the patient&#x27;s gender identity to reflect assigned sex have been ineffective and are regarded as conversion therapy by most health organizations.

=== Biological treatments ===

Biological treatments physically alter primary and secondary sex characteristics to reduce the discrepancy between an individual&#x27;s physical body and gender identity. Biological treatments for GD are typically undertaken in conjunction with psychotherapy; however, the WPATH Standards of Care state that psychotherapy should not be an absolute requirement for biological treatments.

Hormonal treatments have been shown to reduce a number of symptoms of psychiatric distress associated with gender dysphoria. A WPATH commissioned systematic review of the outcomes of hormone therapy &quot;found evidence that gender-affirming hormone therapy may be associated with improvements in [quality of life] scores and decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms among transgender people.&quot; The strength of the evidence was low due to methodological limitations of the studies undertaken. Some literature suggests that gender-affirming surgery is associated with improvements in quality of life and decreased incidence of depression. Those who choose to undergo gender-affirming surgery report high satisfaction rates with the outcome, though these studies have limitations including risk of bias (lack of randomization, lack of controlled studies, self-reported outcomes) and high loss to follow up.

Disagreement among practitioners regarding treatment of adolescents is in part due to the lack of long-term data. Young people qualifying for biomedical treatment according to the Dutch model (including having GD from early childhood which intensifies at puberty and absence of co-occurring psychiatric conditions that could challenge diagnosis or treatment) found reduction in gender dysphoria, although limitations to these outcome studies have been noted, such as lack of controls or considering alternatives like psychotherapy.

In its position statement published December 2020, the Endocrine Society stated that there is durable evidence for a biological underpinning to gender identity and that pubertal suppression, hormone therapy, and medically indicated surgery are effective and relatively safe when monitored appropriately and have been established as the standard of care. They noted a decrease in suicidal ideation among youth who have access to gender-affirming care and comparable levels of depression to cisgender peers among socially transitioned pre-pubertal youth.

A review published in &quot;Child and Adolescent Mental Health&quot; found that puberty blockers are fully reversible, and that they are associated with such positive outcomes as decreased suicidality in adulthood, improved affect and psychological functioning, and improved social life.

More rigorous studies are needed to assess the effectiveness, safety, and long-term benefits and risks of hormonal and surgical treatments. For instance, a 2020 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether feminizing hormones were safe or effective, due to the lack of &quot;completed studies that met [their] inclusion criteria.&quot; Several studies have found significant long-term psychological and psychiatric pathology after surgical treatments.

In 2021, a review published in &quot;Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&quot; found that less than 1% of people who undergo gender-affirming surgery regret the decision. It concluded that &quot;There is an extremely low prevalence of regret in transgender patients after GAS. We believe this study corroborates the improvements made in regard to selection criteria for GAS. However, there is high subjectivity in the assessment of regret and lack of standardized questionnaires, which highlight the importance of developing validated questionnaires in this population.&quot;

== Co-occurring conditions ==
Among youth, around 20% to 30% of individuals attending gender clinics meet the DSM criteria for an anxiety disorder. Gender dysphoria is also associated with an increased risk of eating disorders in transgender youth.

A widely held view among clinicians is that there is an over-representation of neurodevelopmental conditions amongst individuals with GD, although this view has been questioned due to the low quality of evidence. Studies on children and adolescents with gender dysphoria have found a high prevalence of autistic traits or a confirmed diagnosis of autism. Adults with gender dysphoria attending specialist gender clinics have also been shown to have high rates of autistic traits or an autism diagnosis as well. It has been estimated that autistic children were over four times as likely to be diagnosed with GD, with autism being reported from 6% to over 20% of teens referring to gender identity services.

Children and adolescents with gender dysphoria are also more likely to have ADHD, depression and histories of suicidality, self-harm and adverse childhood experiences.
== Epidemiology ==
Different studies have arrived at different conclusions about the prevalence of gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 gives a gender dysphoria prevalence of 0.005% to 0.014% of people assigned male at birth (5-14 per 100k) and 0.002% to 0.003% of people assigned female at birth (2-3 per 100k). The DSM-5 states that these numbers are likely underestimates, being based on the number of referrals to specialty clinics. Not all adults seeking medical transition are referred to specialty clinics.

According to &quot;Black&#x27;s Medical Dictionary&quot;, gender dysphoria &quot;occurs in one in 30,000 male births and one in 100,000 female births.&quot; Studies in European countries in the early 2000s found that about 1 in 12,000 natal male adults (8 per 100k) and 1 in 30,000 (3 per 100k) natal female adults seek out gender-affirming surgery. Studies of hormonal treatment or legal name change find higher prevalence than sex reassignment, with, for example a 2010 Swedish study finding that 1 in 7,750 (13 per 100k) adult natal males and 1 in 13,120 (8 per 100k) adult natal females requested a legal name change to a name of the opposite gender.

Studies that measure transgender status by self-identification find even greater prevalence of gender identity different from sex assigned at birth (although some of those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming may not experience clinically significant distress and so do not have gender dysphoria). A study in New Zealand found that 1 in 3,630 natal males (13 per 100k) and 1 in 22,714 (4 per 100k) natal females have changed their legal gender markers. A survey of Massachusetts adults found that 0.5% (500 per 100k) identify as transgender. A national survey in New Zealand of 8,500 randomly selected secondary school students from 91 randomly selected high schools found 1.2% (1,200 per 100k) of students responded &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you think you are transgender?&quot;. Outside of a clinical setting, the stability of transgender or non-binary identities is unknown.

Research indicates that among people who transition in adulthood, individuals are up to three times more likely to be male assigned at birth. However, among people transitioning in childhood, the sex ratio is closer to 1:1. The prevalence of gender dysphoria in children remains uncertain due to the lack of formal prevalence studies. A 2022 literature review reported that approximately 36% of adolescents assessed in specialized gender clinics were natal males, and 63% were natal females. One study highlighted in the review found no significant change in these proportions from 2014 to 2016. However, when comparing more recent data with earlier studies, there has been a shift favoring natal females (ratio of 1:3) as opposed to nearly equal proportions in earlier studies (ratios of 0.8–0.9:1).

== History ==
Neither the DSM-I (1952) nor the DSM-II (1968) contained a diagnosis analogous to gender dysphoria. Gender identity disorder first appeared as a diagnosis in the DSM-III (1980), where it appeared under &quot;psychosexual disorders&quot; but was used only for the childhood diagnosis. Adolescents and adults received a diagnosis of transsexualism (homosexual, heterosexual, or asexual type). The DSM-III-R (1987) added &quot;Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence and Adulthood, Non-Transsexual Type&quot; (GIDAANT). DSM-5 (2013) replaced gender identity disorder (GID) with gender dysphoria (GD) to avoid the stigma of the term &quot;disorder&quot;.

== Society and culture ==

Researchers disagree about the nature of distress and impairment in people with GD. Some authors have suggested that people with GD suffer because they are stigmatized and victimized; and that, if society had less strict gender divisions, transgender people would suffer less.

Some controversy surrounds the creation of the GD diagnosis, with Davy et al. stating that although the creators of the diagnosis state that it has rigorous scientific support, &quot;it is impossible to scrutinize such claims, since the discussions, methodological processes, and promised field trials of the diagnosis have not been published.&quot;

Some cultures have three or more defined genders. The existence of accepted social categories other than man or woman may alleviate the distress associated with cross-gender identity. For example, in Samoa, the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot;, a group of feminine males, are mostly socially accepted. The fa&#x27;afafine appear similar to transgender women in terms of their lifelong identities and gendered behavior, but experience far less distress than do transgender women in Western cultures. This suggests that the distress of gender dysphoria is significantly increased by difficulties encountered from social disapproval by one&#x27;s culture. Overall, it is unclear whether or not gender dysphoria persists in cultures with third gender categories.

=== Classification as a disorder ===
The psychiatric diagnosis of gender identity disorder (now gender dysphoria) was introduced in DSM-III in 1980. Arlene Istar Lev and Deborah Rudacille have characterized the addition as a political maneuver to re-stigmatize homosexuality. (Homosexuality was declassified as a mental disorder in the DSM-II in 1974.) By contrast, Kenneth Zucker and Robert Spitzer argue that gender identity disorder was included in DSM-III because it &quot;met the generally accepted criteria used by the framers of DSM-III for inclusion.&quot; Some researchers, including Spitzer and Paul J. Fink, contend that the behaviors and experiences seen in transsexualism are abnormal and constitute a dysfunction. The American Psychiatric Association stated that gender nonconformity is not the same thing as gender dysphoria, and that &quot;gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.&quot;

Individuals with gender dysphoria may or may not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder. Advantages and disadvantages exist to classifying gender dysphoria as a disorder. Because gender dysphoria had been classified as a disorder in medical texts (such as the previous DSM manual, the DSM-IV-TR, under the name &quot;gender identity disorder&quot;), many insurance companies are willing to cover some of the expenses of sex reassignment therapy. Without the classification of gender dysphoria as a medical disorder, sex reassignment therapy may be viewed as a cosmetic treatment, rather than medically necessary treatment, and may not be covered. In the United States, transgender people are less likely than others to have health insurance, and often face hostility and insensitivity from healthcare providers. The Americans with Disabilities Act covers individuals with gender dysphoria, provides some legal protections against discrimination which may aid transgender people in accessing legal protections they otherwise may be unable to. Some researchers and transgender people support declassification of the condition because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance and reinforces the binary model of gender.

An analysis of the Samoan third gender &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; suggests that the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child&#x27;s gender variance. Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.

In December 2002, the British Lord Chancellor&#x27;s office published a &quot;Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People&quot; document that categorically states, &quot;What transsexualism is not ... It is not a mental illness.&quot; In May 2009, the government of France declared that a transsexual gender identity will no longer be classified as a psychiatric condition, but according to French trans rights organizations, beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed. Denmark made a similar statement in 2016.

In the ICD-11, GID is reclassified as &quot;gender incongruence&quot;, a condition related to sexual health. The working group responsible for this recategorization recommended keeping such a diagnosis in ICD-11 to preserve access to health services.

== Gender euphoria ==

&quot;Gender euphoria&quot; (GE) is a term for the satisfaction, enjoyment, or relief felt by trans and non-binary people when they feel their gender expression matches their personal gender identity. &quot;Psych Central&quot; definition is &quot;deep joy when your internal gender identity matches your gender expression.&quot; It is proposed that feelings of gender euphoria require societal acceptance of gender expression. In academics and the medical field, a consensus has not yet been reached on a precise definition of the term, as it has been mainly used within a social context. The first attempt to rigorously define gender euphoria through an online survey took place in 2021, conducted by Will Beischel, Stéphanie Gauvin, and Sari van Anders. &quot;Transgender congruence&quot; is also used to ascribe transgender individuals feeling genuine, authentic, and comfortable with their gender identity and external appearance.

The term &quot;gender euphoria&quot; has been used by the transgender community since at least the mid-1970s. Originally, it referred to the feeling of joy arising from fulfilling a mix of gender roles, which was different from the concept of gender dysphoria, which is used to describe individuals who wished to medically transition to a different sex. In the 1980s, the term was published in trans contexts, coming up in interviews with trans people. For example, in a 1988 interview with a trans man, the subject states, &quot;I think that day [Dr. Charles Ilhenfeld] administered my first shot of the &#x27;wonder-drug&#x27; must have been one of the &#x27;peak-experiences&#x27; of my life -- talk about &#x27;gender euphoria&#x27;!&quot; The interview indicates he is referring to testosterone.

Other figures, including Mariette Pathy Allen and Virginia Prince, have used the term in their work. In 1990, Virginia Prince used the phrase in the trans magazine &quot;Femme Mirror,&quot; ending an article with, &quot;...from here on you can enjoy GENDER EUPHORIA - HAVE A GOOD LIFE!&quot; Starting in 1991, a monthly newsletter named &quot;Gender Euphoria&quot; was released, featuring articles about transgender topics; Leslie Feinberg read the newsletter to better understand the transgender community. However, there are instances in which gender euphoria has been used with a different meaning, such as in 1979, when the Black feminist Michele Wallace used it to describe the male privilege present in Black men.

The term has been embraced as part of a movement to stop pathologizing being transgender. In 1989, Mariette Pathy Allen published an unnamed transgender person&#x27;s quote in her photography book &quot;Transformations&quot;: &quot;The shrinks may call it &#x27;gender dysphoria,&#x27; but for some of us, it&#x27;s gender &#x27;euphoria,&#x27; and we&#x27;re not going to apologize anymore!&quot; The movement to focus on the positive side of gender expression was also advocated for in 1994, when the Scottish &quot;TV/TS&quot; periodical &quot;The Tartan Skirt&quot; wrote, &quot;Let&#x27;s accentuate the positive, discard the negative, and promote the new condition of &#x27;Gender Euphoria.&#x27;&quot; In 1997, Patrick Califia described transgender activists picketing using signs that read &quot;Gender Euphoria NOT Gender Dysphoria&quot; and handing out &quot;thousands of leaflets&quot; at protests. The following year, in 1998, &quot;Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality&quot; reported:

Similarly, Florence Ashley has advocated for the medical field to focus on helping patients achieve gender euphoria instead of treating patients on the basis of gender dysphoria. They argue that currently, in order for individuals to receive gender-affirming care, they must be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is not always accessible and entails people must be experiencing significant distress before they can fully express their own gender identity. Ashley&#x27;s stance that gender euphoria does not need to be preceded by a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and that gender euphoria is complex, is echoed by Elliot Tebbe and Stephanie Budge in their 2022 &quot;Nature Reviews Psychology&quot; article, in which they write, &quot;Gender euphoria is not merely the absence of gender dysphoria, but rather a conglomeration of positive emotions and subjective well-being in response to being affirmed in one’s gender.&quot;

Gender euphoria has also been expressed through art. Photography in the East Village in Manhattan has served as means to express gender euphoria, contrasting fashion photography, which is said to reinforce the gender binary.

In 2019, the Midsumma festival in Australia hosted &quot;Gender Euphoria,&quot; a cabaret focusing on &quot;bliss&quot; in transgender experiences, including musical, ballet, and burlesque performances. A reviewer described it as &quot;triumphant – honest, unpretentious, touching, and a vital celebration.&quot;

The 2020 young adult fantasy novel &quot;Euphoria Kids&quot; by Alison Evans was also inspired by the concept of gender euphoria. In the book&#x27;s foreword, Evans wrote: &quot;I want people to learn about gender euphoria (before) gender dysphoria... I want the young trans kids that will read this book to be proud of who they are, and to imagine wonderful, magic lives for themselves.&quot;

<doc id="43098" wikidata="Q560878" url="?curid=43098" title="William A. Dembski">
<text>William Albert Dembski (born July 18, 1960) is an American mathematician, philosopher and theologian. He was a proponent of intelligent design (ID) pseudoscience, specifically the concept of specified complexity, and was a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture (CSC). On September 23, 2016, he officially retired from intelligent design, resigning all his &quot;formal associations with the ID community, including [his] Discovery Institute fellowship of 20 years&quot;. A February 2021 interview in the CSC&#x27;s blog &quot;Evolution News&quot; announced &quot;his return to the intelligent design arena&quot;.

In 2012, he taught as the Phillip E. Johnson Research Professor of Science and Culture at the Southern Evangelical Seminary in Matthews, North Carolina, near Charlotte.

Dembski has written books about intelligent design, including &quot;The Design Inference&quot; (1998), &quot;Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science &amp; Theology&quot; (1999), &quot;The Design Revolution&quot; (2004), &quot;The End of Christianity&quot; (2009), and &quot;Intelligent Design Uncensored&quot; (2010).

Intelligent design is the argument that an intelligent cause is responsible for the complexity of life and that one can detect that cause empirically. Dembski postulated that probability theory can be used to prove irreducible complexity (IC) and what he called &quot;specified complexity.&quot; The scientific community sees intelligent design—and Dembski&#x27;s concept of specified complexity—as a form of creationism attempting to portray itself as science.

==Biography==
Dembski was born in Chicago, Illinois, the only child of Catholic parents. His mother was an art dealer and his father was a college professor who held a D.Sc. in biology from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and taught evolutionary biology. While growing up, Dembski was neither particularly religious nor did he question the theory of evolution. 

Dembski attended an all-male Catholic preparatory school in Chicago. He finished high school a year early, excelling in math and finishing a calculus course in one summer. After high school, Dembski attended the University of Chicago, where he experienced educational and personal difficulties, struggling with the advanced courses and finding the unfamiliar social milieu of college challenging. He dropped out of school and worked at his mother&#x27;s art business while reading works on creationism and the Bible. Finding the creationist works interesting in their challenge of evolution but their literal interpretations lacking, Dembski returned to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studying statistics.

It was in 1988 at a conference on randomness that Dembski began to believe that there was purpose, order, and design in the universe by the intervention of God. Remaining in academia, Dembski ultimately completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1981 and master&#x27;s degrees in statistics, mathematics, and philosophy (1983, University of Illinois at Chicago; 1985, University of Chicago; 1993, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), two PhDs, one in mathematics and one in philosophy (1988, University of Chicago; 1996, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), and a Master of Divinity in theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary (1996).

At the Princeton Theological Seminary, Dembski met his future wife, Jana. Dissatisfied with what he called the &quot;free-swinging academic style&quot; of the school, Dembski also was involved in a group known as the Charles Hodge Society. Based on the works of the 19th century thinker Charles Hodge, the group was devoted to strengthening the faith of students faced with what members believed to be the &quot;theological disarray&quot; of the times, and to providing an example of how to oppose &quot;false and destructive ideas.&quot; It published a journal (a recreation of the &quot;Princeton Theological Review&quot; (1903–1929)) and met with considerable opposition on the campus, facing two lawsuits, threats of violence, accusations of racism and sexism; being denied funding; and hearing that membership &quot;jeopardized their academic advancement.&quot;

Dembski and Jana have one daughter and two sons. One of his sons has autism and Dembski has attributed some of his son&#x27;s problems to vaccines.

===Early opposition to evolution===
Dembski holds that his knowledge of statistics and his skepticism concerning evolutionary theory led him to believe that the extraordinary diversity of life was statistically unlikely to have been produced by natural selection. His first significant contribution to intelligent design was his 1991 paper, &quot;Randomness by Design,&quot; published in the philosophy journal &quot;Noûs&quot;.

Former UC Berkeley law school professor Phillip E. Johnson&#x27;s book &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; (1991) attracted a group of scholars who shared his view that the exclusion of supernatural explanations by the scientific method was unfair and had led to the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; ruling that teaching creation science in public schools was unconstitutional. Dembski was part of that group at a symposium at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, in March 1992, before they came to call themselves &quot;The Wedge.&quot;

Dembski wrote a contribution to the 1994 book &quot;The Creation Hypothesis&quot;. Another chapter, contributed by the creationists Charles Thaxton and Walter L Bradley, discussed &quot;design detection&quot; and redefined &quot;specified complexity&quot; as a way of measuring information.
These ideas led to Dembski&#x27;s notion of specified complexity, which he developed in &quot;The Design Inference&quot;, a 1998 revision of his PhD dissertation in philosophy.

In 1987, the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; replaced &quot;creation science&quot; in drafts of a book, &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, that was intended for secondary school students. The phrase referred to the idea that life was created through unspecified processes by an intelligent but unidentified designer. The book asserted that there was a logical need for such a designer because of the appearance of design in biological organisms. This replacement was intended to evade the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; ruling. The book was published in 1989 amidst campaigning by the publisher for the introduction of &quot;intelligent design&quot; into school science classes.

Biochemist Michael Behe, another member of &quot;The Wedge,&quot; contributed the argument that he subsequently called &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; to a subsequent edition of &quot;Pandas&quot; in 1993. The book contained concepts which Dembski later elaborated in his treatment of &quot;specified complexity.&quot;

===Discovery Institute===

After completing graduate school in 1996, Dembski was unable to secure a university position; from then until 1999 he received what he calls &quot;a standard academic salary&quot; of $40,000 a year as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture. &quot;I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess,&quot; says Dembski.

Until September 2016, Dembski served as a senior fellow at the CSC, where he played a central role in the center&#x27;s extensive public and political campaigns advancing the concept of intelligent design and its teaching in public schools through its &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign as part of the institute&#x27;s wedge strategy. He has since resigned his fellowship position with the Discovery Institute.

===Baylor University===

====Michael Polanyi Center controversy====

In 1999, Dembski was invited by Robert B. Sloan, President of Baylor University, to establish the Michael Polanyi Center at the university. Named after the Hungarian physical chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi (1891–1976), Dembski described it as &quot;the first intelligent design think tank at a research university.&quot; Dembski had known Sloan for about three years, having taught Sloan&#x27;s daughter at a Christian study summer camp not far from Waco, Texas. Sloan was the first Baptist minister to serve as Baylor&#x27;s president in over 30 years, had read some of Dembski&#x27;s work and liked it; according to Dembski, Sloan &quot;made it clear that he wanted to get me on the faculty in some way.&quot; The salaries were supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

The Polanyi Center was established without much publicity in October 1999, initially consisting of two people – Dembski and a like-minded colleague, Bruce L. Gordon, who were hired directly by Sloan without going through the usual channels of a search committee and departmental consultation. The vast majority of Baylor staff did not know of the center&#x27;s existence until its website went online, and the center stood outside of the existing religion, science, and philosophy departments.

The center&#x27;s mission, and the lack of consultation with the Baylor faculty, became the immediate subject of controversy. The faculty feared for the university&#x27;s reputation – it has historically been well regarded for its contributions to mainstream science – and scientists outside the university questioned whether Baylor had &quot;gone fundamentalist.&quot; Faculty members pointed out that the university&#x27;s existing interdisciplinary Institute for Faith and Learning was already addressing questions about the relationship between science and religion, making the existence of the Polanyi Center somewhat redundant. In April 2000, Dembski hosted a conference on &quot;naturalism in science&quot; sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation and the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, seeking to address the question &quot;Is there anything beyond nature?&quot; Most of the Baylor faculty boycotted the conference.

A few days later, the Baylor faculty senate voted by a margin of 27–2 to ask the administration to dissolve the center and merge it with the Institute for Faith and Learning. President Sloan refused, citing issues of censorship and academic integrity, but agreed to convene an outside committee to review the center. The committee recommended setting up a faculty advisory panel to oversee the science and religion components of the program, dropping the name &quot;Michael Polanyi&quot; and reconstituting the center as part of the Institute for Faith and Learning. These recommendations were accepted in full by the university administration.

In a subsequent press release, Dembski asserted that the committee had given an &quot;unqualified affirmation of my own work on intelligent design,&quot; that its report &quot;marks the triumph of intelligent design as a legitimate form of academic inquiry&quot; and that &quot;dogmatic opponents of design who demanded the Center be shut down have met their Waterloo. Baylor University is to be commended for remaining strong in the face of intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression.&quot;

Dembski&#x27;s remarks were criticized by other members of the Baylor faculty, who protested that they were both an unjustified attack on his critics at Baylor and a false assertion that the university endorsed Dembski&#x27;s controversial views on intelligent design. Charles Weaver, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor and one of the most vocal critics of the Polanyi Center, commented: &quot;In academic arguments, we don&#x27;t seek utter destruction and defeat of our opponents. We don&#x27;t talk about Waterloos.&quot;

President Sloan asked Dembski to withdraw his press release, but Dembski refused, accusing the university of &quot;intellectual McCarthyism&quot; (borrowing a phrase that Sloan himself had used when they first tried to dissolve the center). He declared that the university&#x27;s action had been taken &quot;in the utmost of bad faith ... thereby providing the fig leaf of justification for my removal.&quot; Professor Michael Beaty, director of the Institute for Faith and Learning, said that Dembski&#x27;s remarks violated the spirit of cooperation that the committee had advocated and stated that &quot;Dr. Dembski&#x27;s actions after the release of the report compromised his ability to serve as director.&quot; Dembski was removed as the center&#x27;s director, although he remained an associate research professor until May 2005. He was not asked to teach any courses in that time and instead worked from home, writing books and speaking around the country. &quot;In a sense, Baylor did me a favor,&quot; he said. &quot;I had a five-year sabbatical.&quot;

===Seminary teaching===

From 1999 to 2005, he was on the faculty of Baylor University, where he was a focus of attention and controversy. During the academic year 2005–2006, he was briefly the &quot;Carl F. H. Henry Professor of Theology and Science&quot; at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the first director of the school&#x27;s new Center for Theology and Science (since replaced by prominent creationist Kurt Wise). The seminary teaches creationism but its professors vary on the details, with most adhering to the young Earth creationist viewpoint of a relatively recent creation which occurred literally as described in Genesis; Dembski does not hold to young Earth creationism (YEC). On his position at Southern, Dembski also remarked that &quot;Theology is where my ultimate passion is and I think that is where I can uniquely contribute.&quot; He left Southern in May 2006. Starting in June 2006 he became a professor in philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Since taking up a position within Southwestern&#x27;s School of Theology in June 2006, Dembski has taught a number of courses within its Department of Philosophy of Religion. For some of his courses, he requires that his students promote intelligent design on &quot;hostile&quot; websites for course credit. The Southern Baptist Convention operates both seminaries.

In September 2007, the SWBTS hosted a conference, &quot;Intelligent Design in Business Practice,&quot; presented by Dembski, Acton Institute theologian Jay Richards, and three business academics presently or formerly teaching at universities in the Southern United States.

====Mims–Pianka controversy====

On April 2, 2006, Dembski stated on his blog that he reported Eric Pianka to the Department of Homeland Security because he and fellow Discovery Institute Fellow Forrest Mims felt that Pianka&#x27;s speech while accepting the Texas Academy of Science&#x27;s Distinguished Texas Scientist Award in 2006 fomented bioterrorism. This resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewing Pianka in Austin. On April 5, Dembski wagered that Pianka&#x27;s popularity would drop if the full text of his speech to the Texas Academy of Science were made public.

====Baylor Evolutionary Informatics Lab controversy====
Subsequently, in July and August 2007, Dembski played a central role in the formation of the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (EIL), cofounded with Baylor University Engineering Professor Robert J. Marks II. According to Baylor administration, the EIL website hosted at Baylor was deleted because it violated university policy forbidding professors from creating the impression that their personal views represent Baylor as an institution. Dembski says the website was removed because it dealt with intelligent design. Baylor said they would permit Marks to repost his website on their server, provided a 108-word disclaimer accompany any intelligent design-advancing research to make clear that the work does not represent the university&#x27;s position. The site now resides on a third-party server and still contains the material advancing intelligent design. Dembski&#x27;s participation was funded by a $30,000 grant from the Lifeworks Foundation, which is controlled by researcher Brendan Dixon of the Biologic Institute (which has close ties to the Discovery Institute).

====Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary flood controversy====
While serving as a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski wrote &quot;The End of Christianity&quot;, which argued that a Christian can reconcile an old Earth creationist view with a literal reading of Adam and Eve in the Bible by accepting the scientific consensus of a 4.5 billion year of Earth. He further argued that Noah&#x27;s flood likely was a phenomenon limited to the Middle East. This caused controversy and Dembski&#x27;s reading of the Bible was criticized by Tom Nettles, a young Earth creationist, in &quot;The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology&quot;, Southern Seminary&#x27;s official theological journal. In 2010, the dean of Southwestern&#x27;s School of Theology, David Allen, &quot;released a White Paper through the seminary&#x27;s Center for Theological Research defending Dembski as within the bounds of orthodoxy and critiquing Nettles for misunderstanding the book. The paper included Dembski&#x27;s statement admitting error regarding Noah&#x27;s flood.&quot; Southwestern Seminary president Paige Patterson, a young Earth creationist, &quot;said that when Dembski&#x27;s questionable statements came to light, he convened a meeting with Dembski and several high-ranking administrators at the seminary. At that meeting, Dembski was quick to admit that he was wrong about the flood. &quot;&#x27;Had I had any inkling that Dr. Dembski was actually denying the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible, then that would have, of course, ended his relationship with the school,&#x27; he said.&quot;

==Public advocacy==
In December 2001, Dembski launched the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), of which he is Executive Director. Dembski is also the editor-in-chief of ISCID&#x27;s journal, &quot;Progress in Complexity, Information, and Design&quot; (PCID), which appears to have ceased publication with its November 2005 issue. He has several more books in preparation as well as producing an Adobe Flash animation mocking Judge John E. Jones III, who presided in the landmark 2005 &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case. He is also a member of American Scientific Affiliation, the Evangelical Philosophical Society, and the American Mathematical Society, and is a senior fellow of the Wilberforce Forum.

Dembski frequently gives public talks, principally to religious, pro-ID groups, and creationists. Barbara Forrest and Paul R. Gross noted that Dembski has not been hesitant in associating with young Earth creationists, such as attending conferences with Carl Baugh.

Dembski, along with fellow Discovery Institute associates Michael Behe and David Berlinski, tutored Ann Coulter on science and evolution for her book &quot;&quot; (2006). Approximately one-third of the book is devoted to polemical attacks on evolution, which Coulter, as Dembski often does, terms &quot;Darwinism.&quot;

Dembski participated in the documentary film &quot;,&quot; released in 2008. Dembski told the &quot;Southern Baptist Texan&quot; that those who need to see the movie are the &quot;parents of children in high school or college, as well as those children themselves, who may think that the biological sciences are a dispassionate search for truth about life but many of whose practitioners see biology, especially evolutionary biology, as an ideological weapon to destroy faith in God.&quot; Dembski has appeared on several television shows, including a 2005 interview with Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Edward Larson and Ellie Crystal where he said he accepted religion before science.

===Writing===

In 1998, Dembski published his first book, &quot;The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities&quot;, which became a Cambridge University Press bestselling philosophical monograph.

In 2002, Dembski published his book &quot;No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence.&quot; Dembski&#x27;s work was strongly criticized within the scientific community, which argued that there were a number of major logical inconsistencies and evidential gaps in Dembski&#x27;s hypothesis. David Wolpert, co-creator of the No free lunch theorem on which Dembski based his book, characterized his arguments as &quot;fatally informal and imprecise,&quot; &quot;written in jello,&quot; reminiscent of philosophical discussion &quot;of art, music, and literature, as well as much of ethics&quot; rather than of scientific debate.

Mathematician Mark Perakh has stated he believes Dembski overemphasizes his own self-importance in his writing.

====Peer-review controversy====
One of the common objections to intelligent design being accepted as valid science is that ID proponents have published no scientific papers in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in support of their conjectures. The ruling in the 2005 Dover trial, &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, found that intelligent design had not been tested by the process of being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and was not supported by any peer-reviewed research, data or publications. Despite the Dover trial ruling, the Discovery Institute lists Dembski&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;The Design Inference&quot; under the heading &quot;Peer-Reviewed Scientific Books Supportive of Intelligent Design Published by Trade Presses or University Presses.&quot; The Discovery Institute describes Dembski as a mathematician and philosopher, who includes in his credentials a B.A. in psychology and postdoctoral work in mathematics, physics and computer science.

In an expert report, computer scientist and number theorist Jeffrey Shallit states that despite common claims in the popular and religious press, Dembski is not a scientist by any reasonable standard, has not published any experimental or empirical tests of his claims, submitted his claims to the scrutiny of his peers or been published in a scientific journal. In a footnote, Shallit states that he does not consider mathematics to be science. Shallit describes Dembski&#x27;s published mathematical output as &quot;extremely small&quot; for a research mathematician and remarks that &quot;it is very unlikely that his meagre output would merit tenure at any major university.&quot;

Since Shallit&#x27;s statement, Dembski has (as of May 2010) published four peer-reviewed papers in information theory venues associated with the IEEE professional society. The papers deal with &quot;active information&quot; in the context of searches for solutions to problems. Quantified active information is introduced in &quot;Conservation of Information in Search: Measuring the Cost of Success.&quot; A second paper, &quot;Evolutionary Synthesis of Nand Logic: Dissecting a Digital Organism,&quot; claims to deconstruct the evolution simulation Avida by uncovering the sources of active information in the program. A third paper discusses the role of Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s &quot;principle of indifference&quot; in the analysis of evolution. The most recent paper, &quot;Efficient Per Query Information Extraction from a Hamming Oracle,&quot; calculates the performance of various search algorithms which use the Hamming distance to search for a single string of a certain length in the set of all strings of this length.

Dembski states that his book &quot;The Design Inference&quot; has also been peer-reviewed: &quot;This book was published by Cambridge University Press and peer-reviewed as part of a distinguished monograph series, Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction, and Decision Theory.&quot; In his expert report, Shallit states, &quot;I know that book manuscripts typically do not receive the same sort of scrutiny that research articles do. ...it is not uncommon for a 10-page paper to receive 5 pages or more of comments, whereas a book manuscript of two hundred pages often receives about the same number...&quot; In addition, Mark Isaak claims that Dembski&#x27;s book was reviewed by philosophers and not biologists.

===&quot;The Inner Life of the Cell&quot; copyright controversy===
In November 2007, a graduate student named S. A. Smith brought an apparent case of wholesale academic misuse of unlicensed content to public attention. She noticed that a video used by Dembski in his lecture was identical to &quot;The Inner Life of the Cell&quot; animation created by Harvard University and XVIVO Scientific Animation. The audio track giving a scientific explanation was stripped off and the video was used with an alternative narration. The matter was brought to the attention of Harvard and XVIVO. David Bolinsky, creator of the video, wrote that Dembski was warned about using the video without permission.

In response to the allegations, Dembski has claimed that he downloaded the video from the Internet, and added a voiceover narration that he deemed appropriate for his audience. According to Dembski, the downloaded version omitted the opening credits but contained the closing credits, which were shown to the audience. However, Smith later documented several instances where images from the Harvard/XVIVO animation were apparently removed from his book &quot;The Design of Life&quot; (2008) but the related footnotes and references were not. indicating that Dembski was already aware that permission had been denied for him to use the animation when he delivered his presentation at the University of Oklahoma.

On April 9, 2008, &quot;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&quot;, a movie Dembski appears in, was given a cease-and-desist by XVIVO accusing Premise Media, the &quot;Expelled&quot; producers, of plagiarism concerning the same video. A June 2008 Premise Media press release announced Premise Media and XVIVO, LLC, &quot;reached an agreement&quot; noting &quot;XVIVO has agreed that the Premise Media documentary does not infringe on any of XVIVO&#x27;s intellectual property rights.&quot;

===Evolution===

Dembski&#x27;s views on evolution have been a source of considerable controversy within both the mainstream scientific and creationist communities. Dembski does not accept universal common descent. His mainstream scientific critics have accused him of dishonesty in his representation of scientific facts and writing, and he has also been criticised by the traditional creationist community for not supporting the young Earth creationist position, though this community does defend some of his other arguments.

====Science vs. naturalism====
Dembski objects to the presence of the theory of evolution in a variety of disciplines, presenting intelligent design as an alternative to reductionist materialism that gives a sense of purpose that the unguided evolutionary process lacks and the ultimate significance of ID is its success in undermining materialism and naturalism. Dembski has also stated that ID has little chance as a serious scientific theory as long as methodological naturalism is the basis for science. Although intelligent design proponents (including Dembski) have made little apparent effort to publish peer-reviewed scientific research to support their hypotheses, in recent years they have made vigorous efforts to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools. Dembski is a strong supporter of this drive as a means of making young people more receptive to intelligent design, and said he wants &quot;to see intelligent design flourish as a scientific research program&quot; among a &quot;new generation of scholars&quot; willing to consider the theory and textbooks that include it.

====Intelligent designer====

Dembski&#x27;s theories do not attempt to explain the origin of the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time which are the subject of empirical science.

He has not had any of his pro-intelligent-design articles published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often allege that such failure to be published is due to a pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: &quot;I&#x27;ve just gotten kind of blasé about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. And I find I can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty. And the material gets read more.&quot;

In December 2007, Dembski told Focus on the Family that &quot;The Designer of intelligent
design is, ultimately, the Christian God.&quot;

==== Specified complexity ====

Specified complexity is a concept which Dembski has proposed and used in his works promoting intelligent design, an argument intended to give a formal definition of patterns that are both specified and complex. He claims it is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, a central concept of intelligent design, as opposed to natural selection in modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology. Specified complexity is one of the two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being irreducible complexity.

===Intelligent design and Christianity===
Dembski&#x27;s position on intelligent design&#x27;s relationship with Christianity has been inconsistent. He has suggested that the &quot;intelligent designer&quot; is not necessarily synonymous with a god: &quot;It could be space aliens. There are many possibilities,&quot; but has on several occasions been explicit in labelling the designer as the Christian god and linking ID with a religious revival through which Christianity can be restored to its formerly pre-eminent place in society, supplanting &quot;materialist&quot; science. In his book &quot;Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science &amp; Theology&quot; he states &quot;The conceptual soundings of the [intelligent design] theory can in the end only be located in Christ.&quot; On his website, DesignInference.com, Dembski said that intelligent design provides an intellectual basis to restore Christian philosophy over materialism.

Dembski has also spoken of his motivation for supporting intelligent design in a series of Sunday lectures in the Fellowship Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, the last of which took place on March 7, 2004. Answering a question, Dembski said it was to enable God to receive credit for creation.

===Intelligent design movement===
Dembski sees intelligent design as being a popular movement as well as a scientific hypothesis and claims that it is in the process of dislodging evolution from the public imagination. At the CSICOP&#x27;s 4th World Skeptics Conference, held on June 20–23, 2002, in Burbank, California, he told the audience that &quot;over the next twenty-five years ID will provide the greatest challenge to skepticism.&quot; He asserted that &quot;ID is threatening to be mainstream,&quot; and that polls show 90 percent support for the hypothesis, indicating that it has &quot;already becom[e] mainstream within the public themselves.&quot; &quot;The usual skeptical retorts are not going to work against ID&quot; and ID &quot;turns the tables on skepticism.&quot; Evolution, in his view, &quot;is the ultimate status quo&quot; and &quot;squelches dissent.&quot; Young people, who &quot;love rebellion&quot; see that and are attracted to ID as a result. &quot;The public supports intelligent design. The public is tired of being bullied by an intellectual elite.&quot; He contends that skeptics resort to rhetoric and &quot;artificially define ID out of science,&quot; admitting only materialistic explanations as legitimate. ID &quot;paints the more appealing world picture,&quot; whereas skepticism works by being negative, which &quot;doesn&#x27;t set well with the public... To most people evolution doesn&#x27;t provide a compelling view.&quot;

===Bible code===
Dembski has also indicated an interest in the Bible code. In a favorable book review of Jeffrey Satinover&#x27;s &quot;Cracking the Bible Code&quot; (1997), Dembski wrote that &quot;The philosopher Bertrand Russell was once asked why he didn&#x27;t believe in God. He replied, &#x27;Not enough evidence.&#x27; Satinover&#x27;s fascination with the Bible Code is that it may provide evidence for God&#x27;s existence that would have convinced even a Bertrand Russell.&quot;

===Faith healing===
Dembski once took his family to a meeting conducted by Todd Bentley, a faith healer, in hopes of receiving a &quot;miraculous healing&quot; for his son, who is autistic. In an article for the &quot;Baptist Press&quot; he recalled disappointment with the nature of the meeting and with the prevention of his son and other attendees from joining those in wheelchairs who were selected to receive prayer. He then concluded, &quot;Minimal time was given to healing, though plenty was devoted to assaulting our senses with blaring insipid music and even to Bentley promoting and selling his own products (books and CDs).&quot; He wrote that he did not regret the trip and called it an &quot;education,&quot; which showed &quot;how easily religion can be abused, in this case to exploit our family.&quot;

==Responses to critics==
Dembski previews material on the Internet for open peer review. This helps identify errors and address objections prior to publication, allowing him to get &quot;the last word in the exchange.&quot; Dembski&#x27;s style in response to his critics (particularly of his mathematical papers) is polemical. For instance, in reply to a critique of the &quot;law of conservation of information&quot; posted on talkreason.org, Dembski states: &quot;I&#x27;m not and never have been in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the inability of material mechanisms to generate specified complexity in the same way that no physicist is in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the conservation of energy.&quot;

<text>George Gale &amp; Co. Ltd was a Hampshire brewery with a distinctive range of, mainly, bitter beers. Founded in 1847 it was bought by the London brewers, Fuller&#x27;s of Chiswick in 2005. The brewery was closed in 2006 with production transferred to Chiswick.

==History==
Established in 1847 Gales Brewery (George Gale &amp; Co. Ltd) was an old brewery situated in Horndean, on the edge of Waterlooville, near Portsmouth in Hampshire, England. It made the nutty HSB (Horndean Special Bitter) and the newer Gales Bitter. It took its water from its own well situated under the brewery which is fed from the South Downs, and the yeast and &#x27;liquor&#x27; (local water used for brewing), coupled with the local brewing style, produced beers with a sparse head, quite dark in colour.

In late 2005 Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner bought Gales for £92 million. It raised fears as to the future of Gales Horndean brewery and some of its beers, and the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) launched a campaign to encourage Fuller&#x27;s to continue production of the full Gales line at Horndean. However, in January 2006, Fuller&#x27;s began cutting jobs at the Horndean brewery, and it was announced on 27 February 2006 that the brewery would close at the end of March 2006, although distribution and warehousing would continue in the area.

At that point, production of the Gales brands moved to Fuller&#x27;s Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, London, with the exception of Gales Bitter which was discontinued.

As of 2017, most of the brewery site has been replaced with apartments and retail shops. The main tower remains standing and was converted alongside the construction of new buildings into apartments.

<text>Commandos is a stealth-oriented real-time tactics video game series. The five games released between 1998 and 2006 are all set during World War II and follow the adventures of a fictional Allied commando unit. Each mission is loosely based on historical events during World War II to carry the plot. The series was developed by the Spanish developer Pyro Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. The series has sold a total of 3.3 million copies and generated $41 million of revenue at retail.
==Games==
===&quot;Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines&quot;===

&quot;Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines&quot; (CBEL) was released on 1 July 1998. It was published by Eidos Interactive and developed by Pyro Studios. It features 20 missions. The view is isometric with tactical gameplay. A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of &quot;Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, with the first 5 missions, was also made by Russian homebrew programmers, but lacked sound and certain other features of the PC version.

===&quot;Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty&quot;===

&quot;Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty&quot;, a set of new &quot;Commandos&quot; missions issued as a standalone game, was released on 31 March 1999. Despite it being much shorter than &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, it is a much more difficult game containing levels on a far greater scale to the extent of being comparable to those that were to be seen in &quot;Commandos 2&quot;. It has 8 missions, with locations including Yugoslavia and Greece.

===&quot;Commandos 2: Men of Courage&quot;===

A full sequel, released in 2001, was rebuilt with a 3D engine, more interactive environments, more skills for the commandos, and new characters. Like its predecessor, it drew heavily from war films and titled its levels in reference to such films as &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The game received even greater praise.

Several new characters were added to the series in this sequel: a thief called Paul &quot;Lupin&quot; Toledo, a dog called Whiskey and &quot;Wilson&quot;, a shot-down pilot claiming to be from the &quot;Light Brigade&quot;.

A remastered version of the game, called &quot;Commandos 2 - HD Remaster&quot;, was released in 2020.

===&quot;Commandos 3: Destination Berlin&quot;===

This is the third sequel in the series and was released in October 2003. In this game the mouse wheel can be used to rotate the player&#x27;s vantage point. It was the first in the series to use a true 3D engine, but the game was criticized for its short missions and lack of hotkeys.

A remastered version of the game, called &quot;Commandos 3 - HD Remaster&quot;, was released in 2022.

===&quot;Commandos: Strike Force&quot;===

Released during the first months of 2006, this game marks a diversion from the first three games. Although the missions are set up in a similar fashion (several different objectives, some to be achieved through stealth, others through use of force) and in most occasions the player is allowed to change between different characters, this is the first game in the series to apply a first-person perspective, similar to &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; or &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games than to earlier entries of the series.

&quot;Strike Force&quot; only has three Commandos, making it the only game in the series to have the least amount of playable characters. They are the Green Beret, The Sniper and The Spy but they are not the same characters from previous instalments; they each bear different appearances, names, and skills.

The game attracted an overwhelmingly negative reaction, especially from fans of the earlier games in the series who saw this as a massive modification, concurrent with a great reduction in the series&#x27; trademark difficulty. Similarly, it was promoted as mixing elements of strategy from the past games with traditional first-person shooter game-play but instead only hinted at them whilst being predominantly action-oriented. As a result, both critics and fans felt it did little to distance itself from the recent flood of similar games.

===&quot;Commandos: Origins&quot;===
A sequel, &quot;Commandos: Origins&quot;, is currently in development by Claymore Game Studios and will be published by Kalypso Media. It will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC in March 2025.

==Music==
David Garcia-Morales Inés composed the music of the first game and Mateo Pascual that of the next four installments. All five soundtracks are available on iTunes and Amazon.

==Mods==
Following the discontinuation of the series by Pyro Studios, a couple of mods have been developed by fans. &quot;Commandos: Strike in Narrow Path&quot; is a stand-alone expansion for &quot;Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines&quot; containing 9 missions and was released initially in 2010. &quot;Commandos 2: Destination Paris&quot; tweaks the gameplay of &quot;Commandos 2: Men Of Courage&quot; and adds over 100 missions to the base game.

==Reception==

==Future==
The series was acquired by Kalypso Media, which announced work on a new game in the series in April 2020.

<text>Eldridge Pope &amp; Co. was a traditional brewery situated in Dorchester, Dorset. It originated with a brewery in Durngate Street (on the site of the present Waitrose) run by Charles and Sarah Eldridge from 1837; later, the Pope family of Dorset solicitors entered the business, firstly in the form of a partnership, then as a limited company - Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Ltd. - incorporated in 1897. A new brewery was meanwhile built closer to the railway line in 1880, and opened in 1881. The brewery closed in July 2003 following its sale to a property company, and now forms part of the Brewery Square development. The pub estate went on to be acquired by Marstons in 2007, whereupon Eldridge Pope became a dormant company. Most of the brewery was demolished in 2020, 140 years after it was built.

==History==

The origins of Eldridge Pope can be traced back to 1837, when hotel landlord Charles Eldridge and his wife Sarah bought the Green Dragon Brewery in Durngate Street, Dorchester. Together they turned the brewery into a thriving small business, and following Charles&#x27;s death in 1846, Sarah continued to run it in partnership with local brewer Samuel Mason, under the trading name &#x27;Eldridge, Mason &amp; Co&#x27;.

On his retirement in 1870, Mason sold his stake in the Brewery to Edwin Pope and his younger sibling Alfred Pope. Sarah Eldridge&#x27;s son-in-law John Tizard inherited her share of the business, but when he died in 1871 the Popes assumed full control.

By 1879 the company had outgrown its Durngate Street premises, and the Pope brothers wanted to build a large new brewery to satisfy their expansion plans for the company. They bought up four acres of land next to the railway line, and commissioned distinguished local architect W. R. Crickmay to design the new structure.

The new brewery was officially opened in 1881, and very quickly became the biggest employer in Dorchester. Sixteen years later the Pope brothers incorporated the business as a private limited company under the name &#x27;Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Limited&#x27;.

The following decades saw the next generation of the Pope family take over the running of the company. In 1921 Clement Pope, son of Alfred, created the Huntsman trademark, which became one of the most recognizable and popular brands associated with the company.

In 1922 a huge fire ripped through the brewery, damaging much of the brewhouse and several other buildings. It was not until 1925 that the rebuilding work was completed and the brewery was able to produce beer again.

Denis Edwin Holliday was head brewer at Eldridge Pope throughout the 1960s and 70s. This era was associated with the production of popular real ales such as Royal Oak and Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Ale. Holliday also had an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, 1978 edition, for brewing the strongest commercially brewed beer.

In 1997, the management of the brewery bought the business but not the site. They called their company Thomas Hardy Brewery &amp; Packaging. In 1998, Thomas Hardy acquired another brewery in Burtonwood to form Thomas Hardy Burtonwood.

In 2003, Thomas Hardy Burtonwood offered to buy the site from Eldridge Pope for £8m but the offer was declined. Instead, Eldridge Pope sold the site to property company Landworth Properties. Landworth then raised the rent to what the brewery felt to be an uneconomic level causing it to cease its business there with the loss of 57 jobs.

One year after the brewery&#x27;s closure, the family lost control of the business to pubs entrepreneur Michael Cannon who acquired the pubs for £40m plus £42m debt. He identified the need for a three-year, £14m investment programme and a focus on increasing disappointing food sales. He injected his Que Pasa bar chain into the business.
The company continued to operate for a further three years under Michael Cannon&#x27;s management. In January 2007, the assets of Eldridge Pope &amp; Co. Limited were sold to Marstons plc for £155m. Michael Cannon and his fellow shareholders who included several members of the Pope family made a return of 2.8 times his original investment after turning the business around.

The site of the Eldridge Pope brewery was subsequently developed into a shopping and eating complex with restaurants, shops, apartments, a cinema, gym and a hotel.

== Culture ==
In 1985, the brewery&#x27;s founder, Sarah Eldridge was the subject of &quot;Entertaining Strangers: A play for Dorchester&quot; by the playwright David Edgar and produced as a community play by the people of Dorchester, In 1987 the play was transferred to The National Theatre, with Judi Dench in the role of Sarah Eldridge.

<doc id="43107" wikidata="Q162287" url="?curid=43107" title="Battle of Hürtgen Forest">
<text>The Battle of Hürtgen Forest () was a series of battles fought from 19 September to 16 December 1944, between American and German forces on the Western Front during World War II, in the Hürtgen Forest, a area about east of the Belgian–German border. Lasting 88 days, it was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and is the second longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought after the four-day-longer Battle of Bataan.

The U.S. commanders&#x27; initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the Battle of Aachen, where the US forces were fighting against the Siegfried Line network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes, tank traps, and minefields. The Americans&#x27; initial tactical objectives were to take the village of Schmidt and clear Monschau. In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen.

&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the Battle of Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies&#x27; progress, inflicting heavy casualties, and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the &quot;Westwall&quot;, better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line. The Hürtgen Forest cost the U.S. First Army at least 33,000 killed and wounded, including both combat and non-combat losses, with upper estimates at 55,000; German casualties were 28,000. The city of Aachen in the north eventually fell on 22 October at high cost to the U.S. Ninth Army, but they failed to cross the Rur river or wrest control of its dams from the Germans. The battle was so costly that it has been described as an Allied &quot;defeat of the first magnitude,&quot; with specific credit given to Model.

The Germans fiercely defended the area because it served as a staging area for the 1944 winter offensive &quot;Wacht am Rhein&quot; (known in English-speaking countries as the Battle of the Bulge), and because the mountains commanded access to the Rur Dam at the head of the Rur Reservoir (Rurstausee). The Allies failed to capture the area after several heavy setbacks, and the Germans successfully held the region until they launched their last-ditch offensive into the Ardennes. This was launched on 16 December and ended the Hürtgen offensive. The Battle of the Bulge gained widespread press and public attention, leaving the battle of Hürtgen Forest less well remembered.

The overall cost of the Siegfried Line campaign in American personnel was close to 140,000.

== Background ==

By mid-September 1944, the Allied pursuit of the German army after the landings at Normandy was slowing down due to extended supply lines and increasing German resistance. The next strategic objective was to move up to the Rhine River along its entire length and prepare to cross it. Courtney Hodges′ First Army experienced hard resistance pushing through the Aachen Gap and perceived a potential threat from enemy forces using the Hürtgen Forest as a base.

The U.S. 1st Infantry Division arrived in early October, joining elements of the XIX Corps and VII Corps, which had encircled Aachen. Although the 1st Infantry Division called for the surrender of the German garrison in the city, German commander &quot;Oberst&quot; Gerhard Wilck refused to capitulate until 21 October.

The Allies also thought it was necessary to remove the threat posed by the Rur Dam. The stored water could be released by the Germans, swamping any forces operating downstream. In the view of the American commanders, Omar Bradley, Hodges, and J. Lawton Collins, the direct route to the dam was through the forest.

Some military historians are no longer convinced by these arguments. Charles B. MacDonald—a U.S. Army historian and former company commander who served in the Hürtgen battle—has described it as &quot;...a misconceived and basically fruitless battle that should have been avoided.&quot;

== Geography ==
 

The Hürtgen Forest occupies a rugged area between the Rur River and Aachen. In the autumn and early winter of 1944, the weather was cold, wet, and cloudy, and often prevented air support. Apart from the poor weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of Allied air superiority, which had great difficulties in spotting any targets. The dense conifer forest is broken by few roads, tracks, and firebreaks; vehicular movement is restricted. Conditions on the ground became a muddy morass, further impeding vehicular traffic, especially heavy vehicles such as tanks.

The German defenders had prepared the area with improvised blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the mud and snow. There were also numerous concrete bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks, and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings in the forest had also allowed German machine gun, mortar, and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately.

The American advantage in numbers (as high as 5:1), armor, mobility, and air support was thus greatly reduced by weather and terrain. In the forest, relatively small numbers of determined and prepared defenders could be highly effective. To exacerbate matters, as the American divisions took casualties, inexperienced replacements had to be fed directly into combat.

The densely forested terrain also limited the use of tanks and provided cover for German anti-tank teams equipped with &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; shaped-charge grenade launchers. The Allies made improvised rocket launchers, using rocket tubes from aircraft and spare Jeep trailers. Later in the battle, it proved necessary to blast tank routes through the forest. Transportation was similarly limited by the lack of routes: at critical times, it proved difficult to reinforce or supply front-line units or to evacuate the dead and wounded.

The Germans were hampered by much the same difficulties, worsened because their divisions had already taken heavy losses on the retreat through France and were hastily filled up with untrained boys and old men, often unfit for normal military service. Transportation was also a problem, because of the difficult roads and the lack of trucks and fuel; most supplies had to be manhandled to the front line. Nonetheless, despite increasing numbers of replacements lacking experience, German defenders had the advantage in that their commanders and many of their soldiers had been fighting for years and had learned the necessary tactics for fighting efficiently in winter and forested areas, whereas the Americans were often well-trained but inexperienced.

== Opposing armies ==

The Hürtgen Forest lay within the area of the U.S. First Army under Hodges. Responsibility fluctuated between the V Corps and VII Corps.

At the start, the forest was defended by the German 275th and 353rd Infantry Divisions; understrength but well prepared—5,000 men (1,000 in reserve)—and commanded by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Hans Schmidt. They had little artillery and no tanks. As the battle progressed, German reinforcements were added. American expectations that these troops were weak and ready to withdraw were overly optimistic.

==Battle==
===First phase===

The 9th Infantry Division&#x27;s ultimate objective were the Rur River crossings at Düren. On September 16, 1944, an attack by the 47th Infantry Regiment captured Schevenhütte, on the northern fringes of the forest, with few casualties. The division had surprised the Germans, but lacked the strength to push on as two of their regiments were committed to the south. Attacks on and around the Höfen-Alzen ridge by the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments were met with heavy resistance and pushed back. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 39th captured Lammersdorf, but could not dislodge enemies entrenched in the woods behind the village; the 3rd Battalion suffered heavy losses attacking Hill 554, near Lammersdorf. In these early engagements, the 9th Infantry Division was unable to eject the Germans from the periphery of the forest, and decided to push through it to the northeast and capture Hürtgen and Kleinhau. The engagement began on September 19, 1944. Repeated probes entered the forest toward their objective, but were beaten back by the terrain and Germans dug into prepared positions. On October 5, the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments attacked towards the town of Schmidt while the 47th held a defensive position. The Monschau-Düren road was quickly cut, but both regiments were slowed by defenses and suffered significant casualties: The 60th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was reduced to a third after the first day. The 39th was halted at the Weisser Weh Creek; there were problems with narrow paths, air bursts in trees, and fire breaks which were blocked or enfiladed. Evacuation and supply was difficult or impossible. By 16 October, had been gained at the cost of 4,500 casualties. The U.S. 28th Infantry Division—a Pennsylvania National Guard unit—arrived the same day to relieve the battered 9th. Cota established his division command post in the village of Rott on 25 October and began coordination with the V Corps staff for future operations as his units began to occupy the 9th&#x27;s positions north of Lammersdorf.

When Cota received the operations order for the attack he was perplexed and none too happy. It was far too directive and detailed and left little for him, his staff and his regimental commanders to do except execute it. It was basically the same plan that had been given to the 9th Infantry Division and that plan had failed. Hodges dictated that the 28th was to capture Vossenack and the treeline facing the village of Huertgen. Gerow directed that an entire regiment would assault Huertgen to the north; a second regiment would attack and capture Schmidt in the center and a third regiment attack south towards Rafflesbrand. The 28th Division was reinforced with the attached 707th Tank Battalion, tracked M29 Weasel transport and air support. Of its three regiments, one was deployed to protect the northern flank, another to attack Germeter, and the third to capture Schmidt, the main objective. The area had terrible terrain with the Kall Trail running along a deep river ravine. The terrain was not suited to tanks, despite the need for armor to support the infantry.

&quot;It was during the final days of preparation before the attack that Cota made three crucial mistakes that would have far reaching effects on his division&#x27;s assault into the Huertgen. The first was that neither he nor his staff directed subordinate units to conduct patrolling into the Huertgen Forest [...]; the second mistake was tied to the first. Cota had approved the extremely narrow Kall trail to serve as the division&#x27;s main supply route [...]. Aerial reconnaissance could not confirm the trails condition due to the dense forest covering it but ground patrols would have provided much valuable information, both about the enemy and the trail. The third mistake was his decision not to use armor to support his infantry. Believing that the forest would not allow access and the required road network to support tanks, he kept all but two of his tank companies and all of his tank destroyer units in the rear to augment his division artillery. Had he discussed this with the commander of 9th Infantry Division, he would have learned that tanks could operate in many areas of the forest and with some training and prior coordination they could provide valuable support to the infantry.&quot;

The attack by the 28th Division started on 2 November; the defenders were expecting it and were ready. The U.S. 109th Infantry Regiment, assigned to capture the woods north of Germeter, was impeded after by an unexpected minefield (the &quot;Wild Pig&quot;), pinned down by mortar and artillery fire and harassed by local counterattacks. Just was gained after two days, after which the 109th dug in and endured casualties. This initial attack was nearly all the ground the 109th would take during the battle. The U.S. 110th Infantry Regiment had to clear the woods next to the Kall River, capture Simonskall, and maintain a supply route for the advance on Schmidt: Again, these were very difficult tasks due to weather, prepared defenses, determined defenders, and terrain. The weather prevented tactical air support until 5 November.

The U.S. 112th Infantry Regiment, attacking from Germeter, took Vossenack and the neighboring ridge by the afternoon. The 112th was then halted by strong defenses and difficult terrain. The 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 112th moved across the Kall Valley and captured Kommerscheidt and Schmidt, respectively, on 3 November. The German supply route to Monschau was cut, but American supply, reinforcement, and evacuation were very limited as the Kall Trail had poor terrain and was infiltrated by the Germans. At dawn on November 4, a strong German counter-attack by tanks of the 116th Panzer Division and a chance encirclement by troops from the 89th Infantry Division rapidly expelled the 3rd Battalion from Schmidt, and they were unable to counter-attack. The battalion disintegrated after constant shelling and a fierce attack by the 116th Panzer Division and some men inadvertently fled east, to be captured by the Germans. The rest of the battalion retreated to Kommerscheidt to join the 112th&#x27;s 1st Battalion. Realizing the gravity of the situation, eight M4 Shermans of Company A, 707th Tank Battalion attempted to cross the Kall Valley, but only three actually made it across to support the beleaguered 112th. The 116th Panzer Division again attacked with tanks and infantry several times. The American tanks, along with infantry and air support, destroyed five German Panzer IV tanks. At Vossenack, the 112th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was nearly forced out of the town on November 6 by a fierce German counterattack, but were assisted by engineers in retaking the western part of the town. The Americans across the Kall Valley at Kommerscheidt held on until November 8, when an order to withdraw was given. The positions at Schmidt and the Kall Trail were abandoned. It wasn&#x27;t until February 1945 that the 82nd Airborne Division permanently captured the Kall Trail and Schmidt.

A German regimental doctor, &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Günter Stüttgen, negotiated an unofficial ceasefire with the Americans at the Kall Bridge from 7–12 November, in order to attend to the wounded of both sides, numbering in the thousands. The lives of many American soldiers were saved by German medics.

===Second phase===

The second phase was part of Operation Queen, the Allied thrust to the Rur River. In this phase, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division was to clear the northern half of the forest between Schevenhütte and Hürtgen, capture Hürtgen, and advance to the Rur south of Düren. From 10 November, this would be VII Corps′ responsibility and it was part of the main VII Corps effort to reach the Rur. The 4th Division was now fully committed to the Hürtgen, although its 12th Infantry Regiment was already mauled from its action at Schmidt, leaving just two fully effective regiments to achieve the divisional objectives. U.S. VII Corps was opposed by German forces, mainly from the LXXXI Corps, consisting of three understrength divisions. In the Hürtgen, there was the 275th Infantry Division—6,500 men with 150 artillery pieces. They were well dug-in and prepared.

The abstract of a U.S. report describes what happened:

The attack started on 16 November. The two infantry regiments attacked in parallel columns: the 8th along the northern edge of the forest towards Düren, the 22nd further south in parallel. The open flanks invited infiltration. Similar tactics elsewhere in Hürtgen had &quot;invited disaster&quot;.

Attacks by the 8th Infantry Regiment on Rother Weh Creek hit heavy resistance and were repulsed with heavy losses. The 22nd failed to take Raven&#x27;s Hedge (&quot;Rabenheck&quot;), beaten back by heavy machine-gun and artillery fire along the fire-breaks. After three days, there were 300 casualties, including numerous officers and NCOs.

By 18 November, tanks were deemed essential, so engineers blasted tank routes through the forest. Communications and logistics remained a problem, so the next day the attack paused to allow re-supply and evacuation of the wounded. German reinforcements arrived from 344th and 353rd Infantry Divisions and resistance stiffened further.

Responsibility was returned to V Corps and, on 21 November, 8th Division attacked the Weisser Weh Valley, continuing toward Hürtgen. The 121st Infantry Regiment hit heavy defenses immediately. Despite armored support from the 10th Tank Battalion, daily advances were less than . Hürtgen was taken on 29 November and the battle continued to Kleinhau, north.

The final action in the Hürtgen Forest was at Langerwehe-Merode, on the northeastern edge of the forest. Two American companies took the village, but they were later destroyed in a German counter-attack. More than 300 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division were killed in action on November 29 and 30, 1944.

Later, the secret daily report of the Supreme High Command of the German Army (&quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH)) of 27 November, stated that in the old Langerwehe penetration area, the U.S. Army (&quot;enemy&quot;) won terrain.

Elements of the 8th and the 28th Infantry Divisions then advanced on Brandenberg. The 28th Division—just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th)—also took heavy casualties during its stay in the Hürtgen Forest. On 14 November, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of Hill 400 from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division. Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces. On the last day of the Hürtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945.

From 1–12 December, the 309th, 310th and 311th Infantry Regiments of the 78th Infantry Division (&quot;Lightning&quot;) relieved elements of the 1st Infantry Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl. On 13 December, these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bikerath, Germany, and were fighting the Battle of Kesternich against the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division when General Gerd von Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area. On December 15 the 2nd battalion, 309th Infantry was annihilated when the 272nd Volksgrenadiers counterattacked and took back Kesternich. The Germans knew that from the heights at Kesternich the Americans could detect the troop buildup for the Ardennes Offensive and place artillery there to fire on advancing German troops.

Military actions at the Siegfried Line up to 15 December alone brought death, injury or captivity to more than 250,000 soldiers from both sides. The First and Ninth U.S. Army suffered 57,039 battle casualties (dead, wounded, captured, missing in action); 71,654 non-battle casualties, i.e. accidents, diseases such as pneumonia, trench foot, frostbite, and trauma. German Armed Forces are presumed to be 12,000 dead, 95,000 captured (documented), and an unknown number of wounded.

On 16 December 1944, German forces began the Ardennes Offensive, more commonly known as the Battle of the Bulge and as a result further fighting in the Hürtgen ended.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Hürtgen Forest has been referred to as a stalemate that consumed large amounts of resources on both sides. The Americans suffered 33,000 casualties during the course of the battle which ranged up to 55,000 casualties, included 9,000 non-combat losses and represented a 25 percent casualty rate. The Germans had also suffered heavy losses with 28,000 casualties—many of these were non-combatants and prisoners of war.

The surprise German Ardennes offensive caught Allied forces off guard. The Germans attacked with nearly 30 divisions; including the elite 1st SS, 2nd SS, and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions, with the northernmost point of the battlefront centered on Monschau. They forced a large salient in the American lines almost deep at its maximum extent. However, the Germans never came close to their primary objective, the capture of Antwerp. The Ardennes Offensive came to a complete halt in early January, when German forces in the northern shoulder of the bulge were blocked by a strong American defence, the destruction of bridges by American engineers, and a lack of fuel.

In early February, American forces attacked through the Hürtgen Forest for the final time. On 10 February 1945, the Rur Dam was taken by American forces and the forest itself was not cleared until the 17th when the 82nd Airborne Division reached the Roer river.

==Legacy==
There is a stone monument with a bronze plaque at the Hürtgen Military Cemetery, dedicated by veterans of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division to the memory of Friedrich Lengfeld (29 September 1921 – 12 November 1944), a German lieutenant. Lengfeld died on 12 November 1944, of severe wounds sustained while helping a wounded American soldier out of the &quot;Wild Sow&quot; (&quot;Wilde Sau&quot;) minefield. It is the only such memorial for a German soldier placed by his erstwhile opponents in a German military cemetery.

A memorial sculpture on Kall Bridge recalls that moment of humanity amidst the horrors of war. It was officially dedicated on the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire on the Kall Bridge, November 7, 2004. It was created by Michael Pohlmann, who commented:

The plaque was created by the sculptor Tilman Schmitten, Eupen. The memorial sculpture and plaque were endowed by the Konejung Foundation: Culture

The 1944 Hürtgen Forest Museum was opened on 29 March 1983 in Kleinhau, in a stone barn to commemorate the battle.
==Historical analysis==

Historical discussion revolves around whether or not the American battle plan made any operational or tactical sense. One analysis is that the Allies under-estimated the strength and determination remaining in the psyche of the German soldier, believing his fighting spirit had collapsed under the stress of the Normandy breakout and the reduction of the Falaise pocket.

Trigg describes the battle as one of the &quot;most ill-conceived and unnecessary offensives of the whole northwest Europe campaign&quot; and said that Hodges &quot;lacked tactical imagination&quot; and that &quot;it was a miracle that he retained Eisenhower&#x27;s confidence&quot;.

American commanders, in particular, misunderstood the impassability of the dense Hürtgen Forest, and its effects of reducing artillery effectiveness and making air or armoured support impracticable. The better alternative—breaking through south-east out into the open valley, where their advantages in mobility and airpower could come into play, and then heading northeast towards the actual objectives—seems not to have been really considered by the higher headquarters.

In addition, American forces were concentrated in the village of Schmidt, and neither tried to conquer the strategic Rur Dams nor recognized the importance of Hill 400 until an advanced stage of the battle.

World War Two lieutenant and History professor and academician, Paul Fussell, blames the impracticality of Lieutenant General Courtney H. Hodges&#x27; command and untrained troops&#x27; demoralization for the defeat in the battle, citing the violation of Patton&#x27;s observation that &quot;Plans should be made by those who are going to execute them.&quot;

<text>The Sinhala script (), also known as Sinhalese script, is a writing system used by the Sinhalese people and most Sri Lankans in Sri Lanka and elsewhere to write the Sinhala language as well as the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhalese Akṣara Mālāva, one of the Brahmic scripts, is a descendant of the Ancient Indian Brahmi script. It is also related to the Grantha script.

==History==
The Sinhala script is a Brahmi derivate and was thought to have been imported from Northern India around the 3rd century BCE. It developed in a complex manner, partly independently but also strongly influenced by South Indian scripts at various stages, manifestly influenced by the early Grantha script. Pottery from the 6th century BCE has been found in Anuradhapura with lithic Brahmi inscriptions written in Prakrit or Sinhala Prakrit. It has caused debate as to whether Ceylonese Brahmi influenced Brahmi in the Indian mainland.

Medieval Sinhalese, which emerged around 750 AD, is marked by very strong influence from the Grantha script. Subsequently, Medieval (and modern) Sinhalese resemble the South Indian scripts. By the 9th century CE, literature written in the Sinhala script had emerged and the script began to be used in other contexts. For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used Sinhala script.

Modern Sinhalese emerged in the 13th century and is marked by the composition of the grammar book &quot;Sidat Sangara&quot;. In 1736, the Dutch were the first to print with Sinhala type on the island. The resulting type followed the features of the native Sinhala script used on palm leaves. The type created by the Dutch was monolinear and geometric in fashion, with no separation between words in early documents. During the second half of the 19th century, during the colonial period, a new style of Sinhala letterforms emerged in opposition to the monolinear and geometric form that used high contrast and had varied thicknesses. This high contrast type gradually replaced the monolinear type as the preferred style and continues to be used in the present day. The high contrast style is still preferred for text typesetting in printed newspapers, books, and magazines in Sri Lanka.

Today, the alphabet is used by over 16 million people to write Sinhala in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.

Sinhala is the main language written in this script, but rare instances of its use for writing Sri Lanka Malay have been recorded.

==Structure==
Sinhala script is an abugida written from left to right. It uses consonants as the basic unit for word construction as each consonant has an inherent vowel (), which can be changed with a different vowel stroke. To represent different sounds it is necessary to add vowel strokes, or diacritics called (Pili), that can be used before, after, above, or below the base-consonant. Most of the Sinhala letters are curlicues; straight lines are almost completely absent from the alphabet, and it does not have joining characters. This is because Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred. Upper and lower cases do not exist in Sinhala.

Sinhala letters are ordered into two sets. The core set of letters forms the pure Sinhala ( alphabet, which is a subset of the mixed Sinhala alphabet . The definition of the two sets is thus a historic one. The śuddha alphabet, also called the Eḷu alphabet (), contains everything necessary to write Eḷu, or classical Sinhala, as described in the classical grammar Sidatsan̆garā (1300 AD). The śuddha alphabet is also a good representation of the phoneme inventory of present-day colloquial Sinhala; all native sounds of the Modern Sinhala can be represented by &quot;&quot;. The &quot;śuddha&quot; also includes the letters and diacritics for the retroflex consonants and , which are not phonemic in modern Sinhala but are needed for the representation of Eḷu. However, words which historically contained these two phonemes are still often written with these letters, despite changes in pronunciation.

The alphabet includes letters for Middle Indic aspirate, retroflex and sibilant consonants which are not found in modern Sinhala, but are used in the transcription of are used for transcribing loanwords from Sanskrit (tatsama), Pali or English. Although modern Sinhala sounds are not aspirated, aspiration is marked in the sound where it was historically present, to highlight the differences in modern spelling. The use of letters is mainly a question of prestige. From a purely phonemic point of view, their sounds can all be represented by &quot;śuddha&quot; letters.

Although most phonemes of Sinhala can be represented by a &quot;śuddha&quot; letter or by a &quot;miśra&quot; letter, normally only one of them is considered correct. Additionally, the &quot;śuddha&quot; set itself contains both and , as well as and , and neither pair is distinctive in Modern sinhala. This one-to-many mapping of phonemes onto graphemes is a frequent source of misspellings.

While a phoneme can be represented by more than one grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way, with the exceptions of the inherent vowel sound, which can be either (stressed) or (unstressed), and &quot;ව&quot; where the consonant is either or depending on the word. This means that the actual pronunciation of a word is almost always clear from its spelling. Stress is almost always predictable; only words with or (which are both allophones of &quot;ව&quot;), and a very few other words need to be learnt individually.

===Consonants=== 
The alphabet includes eight plosives, two fricatives, two affricates, two nasals, two liquids and two glides. As in other Brahmic scripts, each consonant carries an inherent vowel, which in Sinhala is .


====Prenasalization====
The prenasalized consonants resemble their plain counterparts. , &quot;m̆ba&quot; is made up of the left half of &quot;ma&quot; and the right half of &quot;ba&quot;, while the other three are just like the grapheme for the plosive with a little stroke added. Vowel diacritics attach to a prenasalised consonant in the same way as they would to the corresponding plain plosives.

====Consonant conjuncts====
Certain combinations of letters are written with ligatures. Some graphical conventions include a &quot;ra&quot; following a consonant represented by and inverted arch (rakāransaya), a &quot;r&quot; preceding a consonant by a loop above (rēpaya), and a , &quot;ya&quot; following a consonant as a half of a &quot;ya&quot; on the right (yansaya. Some very frequent combinations can be written in one stroke, like , &quot;ddha&quot;, , &quot;kwa&quot; or , &quot;kś&quot;.

Touching letters were used in ancient scriptures but are not used in modern Sinhala. Vowels may be attached to any of the ligatures formed, attaching to the rightmost part of the glyph except for vowels that use the &quot;kombuva&quot;, where the &quot;kombuva&quot; is written before the ligature or cluster and the remainder of the vowel, if any, is attached to the rightmost part.

==Vowels and diacritics==
Each vowel has two forms, an independent and a diacritic or vowel stroke (). The independent form is used when a vowel occurs at the beginning of a word. The diacritic is used when a vowel follows a consonant.

While most diacritics are regular, , &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ū&quot; take on a different shape when attached to a , &quot;ka&quot;, , &quot;ga&quot;, , &quot;n̆ga&quot;, , &quot;ta&quot;, , &quot;bha&quot;, or , &quot;śa&quot;. E.g.: , &quot;ku&quot;, , &quot;kū&quot;.

The inherent vowel of a letter can be removed by a hal kirīma (◌්), which has two shapes depending on which consonant it attaches to.

Combinations of ර(r) or ළ(ḷ) with have idiosyncratic shapes, viz රු (ru), රූ (rū), ළු (ḷu) and ළූ (ḷū). The diacritic used for රු (ru) and රූ (rū) is what is normally used for the , and therefore there are idiosyncratic forms for &quot;ræ&quot; and &quot;rǣ&quot;, viz රැ and රෑ.

===Śuddha vowels===

There are six long and six short &quot;śuddha&quot; vowels.

===Miśra vowels and vocalics===
There are six additional vowel and syllabic consonants in the &quot;miśra&quot; alphabet. The two diphthongs are quite common, while the vocalic ṛ is much rarer, and ḷ is all but obsolete. The latter two are almost exclusively found in loanwords from Sanskrit.

The &quot;miśra&quot; can also be written with &quot;śuddha&quot; + or +, which corresponds to the actual pronunciation. The &quot;miśra&quot; syllabic ḷ can be replaced by &quot;śuddha&quot; +. Miśra is rendered as &quot;śuddha&quot; , &quot;miśra&quot; as &quot;śuddha&quot; .


===Other diacritics===
The anusvara (often called &quot;binduva&quot; &#x27;zero&#x27;) is represented by one small circle , and the visarga (technically part of the &quot;miśra&quot; alphabet) by two .

==Letter names==
The Sinhala &quot;śuddha&quot; graphemes are named in a uniform way adding &quot;-yanna&quot; to the sound produced by the letter, including vocalic diacritics. The name for the letter අ is thus &quot;ayanna&quot;, for the letter ආ &quot;āyanna&quot;, for the letter ක &quot;kayanna&quot;, for the letter කා &quot;kāyanna&quot;, for the letter කෙ &quot;keyanna&quot; and so forth. For letters with &quot;hal kirīma&quot;, an epenthetic &quot;a&quot; is added for easier pronunciation: the name for the letter ක් is &quot;akyanna&quot;. Another naming convention is to use &quot;al-&quot; before a letter with suppressed vowel, thus &quot;alkayanna&quot;.

Since the extra &quot;miśra&quot; letters are phonetically not distinguishable from the &quot;śuddha&quot; letters, proceeding in the same way would lead to confusion. Names of &quot;miśra&quot; letters are normally made up of the names of two &quot;śuddha&quot; letters pronounced as one word. The first one indicates the sound, the second one the shape. For example, the aspirated ඛ (kh) is called &quot;bayanu kayanna&quot;. &quot;kayanna&quot; indicates the sound, while &quot;bayanu&quot; indicates the shape: ඛ (kh) is similar in shape to බ (b) (&quot;bayunu = like bayanna&quot;). Another method is to qualify the &quot;miśra&quot; aspirates by &quot;mahāprāna&quot; (ඛ: &quot;mahāprāna kayanna&quot;) and the &quot;miśra&quot; retroflexes by &quot;mūrdhaja&quot; (ළ: &quot;mūrdhaja layanna&quot;).

==Numerals==
Sinhala had its numerals (), which were used from prior to the fall of Kandyan Kingdom in 1815. They can be seen primarily in Royal documents and artefacts. Sinhala Illakkam did not have a zero, but did have signs for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000.

This system has been replaced by the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.

===Astrological numbers===
Prior to the fall of Kandyan Kingdom all calculations were carried out using . After that event, Sinhala lith illakkam became known as or Sinhala astrological number and were primarily used for writing horoscopes. The tradition of writing degrees and minutes of zodiac signs in lith numbers continued into the 20th century. Unlike the Sinhala illakkam, Sinhala lith illakkam included a 0.

Neither the Sinhala numerals nor the Sinhala punctuation mark &quot;kunddaliya&quot; is in general use today, but some use it in social media, Internet messaging and blogs. The kunddaliya was formerly used as a full stop.
==Transliteration==
Sinhala transliteration (Sinhala: රෝම අකුරින් ලිවීම &quot;rōma akurin liwīma&quot;, literally &quot;Roman letter writing&quot;) can be done in analogy to Devanāgarī transliteration.

Layman&#x27;s transliterations in Sri Lanka normally follow neither of these. Vowels are transliterated according to English spelling equivalences, which can yield a variety of spellings for a number of phonemes. for instance can be , , , , etc.
A transliteration pattern peculiar to Sinhala, and facilitated by the absence of phonemic aspirates, is the use of for the voiceless dental plosive, and the use of for the voiceless retroflex plosive.
This is presumably because the retroflex plosive is perceived the same as the English alveolar plosive , and the Sinhala dental plosive is equated with the English voiceless dental fricative . Dental and retroflex voiced plosives are always rendered as , though, presumably because is not found as a representation of in English orthography.

==Use for the Pali language==
Many of the oldest Pali manuscript are written in the Sinhala script. The first instance of the Pali Tripitaka being written down sometime from 29 to 17 BCE occurred in Sri Lanka. At the time, these would have been written in what was still Brahmi script but adapted to palm leaves. Successive copies of Buddhist texts follow the evolution of that version of Brahmi on the island, leading to modern Sinhala.

Many of the consonants are used to represent Pali phonemes that have no Sinhala counterpart, particularly the aspirated consonants. On the other hand, not all set consonants are used; the prenasalised consonants have no counterpart in Pali phonology, and so are not used. Consonant sequences may be combined in ligatures the same way as in Sinhala.

The vowels are a subset of those for writing Sinhala, comprising long and short &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, short &quot;e&quot; and short &quot;o&quot;.

The is represented with the sign ං.

As an example, below is the first verse from the Pali Dhammapada in Sinhala script, along with the corresponding romanization.
 
==Relation to other scripts==
;Similarities
Sinhala is one of the Brahmic scripts, and thus shares many similarities with other members of the family, such as Grantha, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil script and Devanāgarī. As a general example, is the inherent vowel in all these scripts (except Devanagari, where it is /ə/). Other similarities include the diacritic for , which resembles a doubled in all scripts and the diacritic for which is composed of preceding and following .

Likewise, the combination of the diacritics for and yields in all these scripts.
;Differences
Sinhala alphabet differs from other Indo-Aryan alphabets in that it contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it. These are the two vowel sounds that are similar to the two vowel sounds that occur at the beginning of the English words &quot;at&quot; (ඇ) and &quot;ant&quot; (ඈ).

==Computer encoding==

Generally speaking, Sinhala support is less developed than support for Devanāgarī, for instance. A recurring problem is the rendering of diacritics which precede the consonant and diacritic signs which come in different shapes, like the one for .

Sinhala support did not come built in with Microsoft Windows XP, unlike Tamil and Hindi, but was supported by third-party means such as Keyman by SIL International. Thereafter, all versions of Windows Vista and above, including Windows 10 come with Sinhala support by default, and do not require external fonts to be installed to read Sinhala script. &quot;Nirmala UI&quot; is the default Sinhala font in Windows 10. The latest versions of Windows 10 have added support for Sinhala Archaic Numbers that were not supported by default in previous versions.

For macOS, Apple Inc. has provided Sinhala font support for versions of macOS that are Catalina and above through Unicode integration. Keyboard support is available by third-party means such as Helakuru and Keyman. In Mac OS X, Sinhala font and keyboard support were provided by Nickshanks and Xenotypetech.

For Linux, the IBus, and SCIM input methods allow the use Sinhala script in applications with support for a number of key maps and techniques such as traditional, phonetic and assisted techniques. In addition, newer versions of the Android mobile operating system also support both rendering and input of Sinhala script by default and applications like Helakuru serve as dedicated keyboard integrators.

===Unicode===
Sinhala script was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.
This character allocation has been adopted in Sri Lanka as the Standard SLS1134.

The main Unicode block for Sinhala is U+0D80–U+0DFF. Another block, Sinhala Archaic Numbers, was added to Unicode in version 7.0.0 in June 2014. Its range is U+111E0–U+111FF.

<doc id="43113" wikidata="Q228645" url="?curid=43113" title="Ashley Judd">
<text>Ashley Judd (born April 19, 1968) is an American actress and activist. She grew up in a family of performing artists, the daughter of country music singer Naomi Judd and the half-sister of country music singer Wynonna Judd. Her acting career has spanned more than three decades, and she has become heavily involved in global humanitarian efforts and political activism. Judd made her television debut in 1991 with a guest role on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and her film debut in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Kuffs&quot;.

== Early life ==
Judd was born Ashley Tyler Ciminella, in 1968 in Granada Hills, Los Angeles. Her parents are Naomi Judd, who later became a country music singer and motivational speaker, and Michael Charles Ciminella, a marketing analyst for the horse racing industry. Ashley&#x27;s elder half-sister, Wynonna Judd, is also a country music singer.

Ashley&#x27;s paternal grandfather was of Sicilian (Italian) descent, and her paternal grandmother was a descendant of Mayflower pilgrim William Brewster.

When Judd was born, her mother was a homemaker. Judd&#x27;s parents divorced in 1972 when she was four. The following year, Judd&#x27;s mother Naomi returned with Ashley to Kentucky, where Judd lived for most of her childhood. Judd has stated that even if she professionally uses her mother&#x27;s maiden name, her legal surname is still the Ciminella of her father, as &quot;I loved both my last names and the branches of the family they represented&quot;, and the one time she tried to legally change it the judge refused it.

Judd attended 13 schools before college, including the Sayre School (Lexington, Kentucky), Paul G. Blazer High School (Ashland, Kentucky), and Franklin High School in Tennessee. She briefly tried modeling in Japan during a school break. At the University of Kentucky, she majored in French and minored in anthropology, art history, theater, and women&#x27;s studies. She joined the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma. Judd spent a semester studying in France as part of her major. She graduated from the University of Kentucky Honors Program and was nominated to Phi Beta Kappa.

After college Judd moved to Hollywood, where she studied with acting teacher Robert Carnegie at Playhouse West. During this time, she worked as a hostess at The Ivy restaurant and lived in a Malibu rental house. Around that time, she returned East to Williamson County, Tennessee, where she lived near her mother and sister.

== Career ==
Starting in 1991, Judd appeared as Ensign Robin Lefler, a Starfleet officer, in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Darmok&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex (Swoosie Kurtz), on the NBC drama &quot;Sisters&quot;.

She made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Kuffs&quot;. In 1993, she was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in Victor Nuñez&#x27;s &quot;Ruby in Paradise&quot;. This won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. Believing that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous before the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. &quot;From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me&quot;, she told the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;. She received rave reviews in her role as Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself.

Nuñez told biographer James L. Dickerson that Judd created the resonance of this character: &quot;The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.&quot;

Oliver Stone, who had seen Judd in Nuñez&#x27;s film, cast her in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), but her scenes were cut from the version of the film released theatrically. The following year, she gained critical acclaim for her role as Harvey Keitel&#x27;s estranged daughter in Wayne Wang&#x27;s &quot;Smoke&quot; and as Val Kilmer&#x27;s wife in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Heat&quot;. That same year she played the role of Callie in Philip Ridley&#x27;s dark adult fairy tale &quot;The Passion of Darkly Noon&quot;.

In 1996, she co-starred with Mira Sorvino as Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Norma Jean and Marilyn&quot;, where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The same year she had a supporting role in the thriller film &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. It received positive reviews and was a major box office success. By the end of the 1990s, Judd had achieved considerable success as a leading actress, having lead roles in additional thrillers that performed well at the box office, including &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; (1997) and &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; (1999).

In the early 2000s she starred in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (2000), &quot;Someone Like You&quot; (2001), and &quot;High Crimes&quot; (2002). These were moderate box office successes. In 2002, Judd starred in &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, which performed well, and acted in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Frida.&quot;

Judd played the role of Maggie the Cat in the 2003 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;.

In 2004 she received praise and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, for her performance in &quot;De-Lovely&quot;, opposite Kevin Kline, who played Cole Porter. She also starred in &quot;Twisted&quot; (2004). This was widely panned.

In 2010, Judd was Janet Tamaro&#x27;s original choice for the role of Detective Jane Rizzoli in the TV series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; but she declined. Angie Harmon took the role. In 2011, she co-starred in the family film &quot;Dolphin Tale&quot; and its 2014 sequel, &quot;Dolphin Tale 2&quot;. Also in 2011, Judd co-starred with Patrick Dempsey in the film &quot;Flypaper&quot;. In 2012, she starred as Rebecca Winstone on the ABC series &quot;Missing&quot;.

In 2013, Judd played First Lady Margaret Asher in the action thriller &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;. In 2014, she appeared as Natalie Prior in &quot;Divergent&quot;, which she reprised in the 2015 sequel &quot;The Divergent Series: Insurgent&quot; and the 2016 penultimate film of the series &quot;The Divergent Series: Allegiant&quot;.

In 2014, Judd was the narrator of the documentary film about Turkish preacher Fethullah Gülen, &quot;Love Is a Verb&quot;, directed by Terry Spencer Hesser. The following year she became the first woman to narrate the opening for the telecast of the Kentucky Derby.

===Sponsorships===

Starting in 2004, Judd was the advertising &quot;face&quot; of American Beauty, an Estée Lauder cosmetic brand sold at Kohl&#x27;s department stores, and of H. Stern jewelers. In June 2007, Goody&#x27;s Family Clothing launched three fashion clothing lines with Judd in the fall to be called &quot;AJ&quot;, &quot;Love Ashley&quot;, and &quot;Ashley Judd&quot;. In 2008 they added an &quot;Ashley Judd Plus&quot; line.

== Personal life ==
In December 1999, Judd became engaged to Dario Franchitti, a Scottish racing driver who competed in Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). They married in December 2001 at Skibo Castle in Scotland. They did not have any children, as she is known to have said: &quot;It&#x27;s unconscionable to breed with the number of children who are starving to death in impoverished countries.&quot; They divorced in 2013.

Judd is an avid martial arts practitioner: She has practiced kickboxing, judo, and Tae Bo.

In February 2006, she entered a program at Shades of Hope Treatment Center in Buffalo Gap, Texas and stayed for 47 days. She was there for treatment of depression, insomnia, and codependency.

In 2011, Judd released her memoir &quot;All That is Bitter and Sweet&quot;, in which she discusses her life from adolescence to adulthood. The memoir concentrates on her humanitarian work as an adult.

In February 2021, while hiking in the jungle in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Judd shattered her leg. Porters transported her for 55 hours to reach a hospital for surgery in South Africa.

Judd is a Christian and cited her faith as why she went public against Harvey Weinstein.

===Education===

By May 2007, Judd had completed a BA at the University of Kentucky. She was awarded an Honorary DHL degree from Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky, on May 9, 2009. Judd undertook postgraduate study, earning a mid-career MPA degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 2010.

In August 2016, Judd enrolled at UC Berkeley to pursue a PhD in Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy. She took a medical leave of absence two months later because she was suffering from siege migraines.

===Interests===

Judd follows sports at her alma mater, and has attended many University of Kentucky basketball games.

During the 2007 IndyCar season, Judd criticized allowing rookie Milka Duno to race. After the final race, Judd said to reporters &quot;I know this is not very sportsmanlike, but they&#x27;ve got to get the 23 car (Duno) off the track. It&#x27;s very dangerous. I&#x27;m tired of holding my tongue. She shouldn&#x27;t be out there. When a car is 10 miles [an hour] off the pace, it&#x27;s not appropriate to be racing. People&#x27;s lives are at stake.&quot;

===Sexual harassment and assault===

In October 2015, Judd told &quot;Variety&quot; that she had been sexually harassed by a studio mogul but did not name the person. In October 2017, she said the person was Harvey Weinstein, co-founder of Miramax, and said that the sexual harassment occurred during the filming of &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;.

On April 30, 2018, Judd filed a defamation and sexual harassment lawsuit against Weinstein, stating that he hurt her career by spreading lies about her after she rejected his sexual advances. Weinstein filed a motion to dismiss in July. In January 2019, a federal judge in California dismissed Judd&#x27;s claim of sexual harassment against Weinstein but allowed Judd to pursue her defamation claim that Weinstein sabotaged her career.

At the Women in the World summit in April 2019, Judd addressed Georgia&#x27;s six-week abortion ban, which had been passed in March 2019. She said that she had been raped three times, and became pregnant once. She said, &quot;As everyone knows, and I&#x27;m very open about it, I&#x27;m a three-time rape survivor. One of the times that I was raped there was conception and I&#x27;m very thankful I was able to access safe and legal abortion. Because the rapist, who is a Kentuckian, as am I, and I reside in Tennessee, has paternity rights in Kentucky and Tennessee, I would&#x27;ve had to co-parent with my rapist.&quot;

== Humanitarian work ==
Judd has conducted humanitarian work that focuses on gender equality, pro abortion causes and the rights of women and girls. In 2016, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNFPA, the United Nations agency with responsibilities including sexual and reproductive health. As of May 2018, she had visited UNFPA&#x27;s projects for women and girls affected by humanitarian crises in Jordan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Bangladesh, and its development work in India and Sri Lanka.

Judd has travelled with YouthAIDS to places affected by illness and poverty, such as Cambodia, Kenya, and Rwanda. She has become an advocate for preventing poverty and promoting awareness internationally. She has met with political and religious leaders on behalf of the deprived about political and social change. Judd has narrated three documentaries for YouthAIDS that aired on the Discovery Channel, in National Geographic, and on VH1.

In 2011, she joined the Leadership Council of the International Center for Research on Women. Other organizations Judd has been involved with include Women for Women International and Equality Now. She is a member of the advisory board for Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organization fighting sex-trafficking and inter-generational prostitution in India. Judd is active on the speakers&#x27; circuit, giving speeches about gender equality, abuse and humanitarian topics.

== Political activities ==

In 2008, Judd supported Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. In 2009, she appeared in a one-minute video advertisement for the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, in which Judd condemned Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for supporting aerial wolf hunting. In response, Palin stated the reason these wolves are killed is to protect the caribou population in Alaska. Palin called the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund an &quot;extreme fringe group&quot;. In 2010, Judd signed the Animal Legal Defense Fund&#x27;s petition to urge Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear to protect that state&#x27;s homeless animals through tough enforcement of Kentucky&#x27;s Humane Shelter Law.

She was appointed Global Ambassador for YouthAIDS, an education and prevention program of the international NGO Population Services International (PSI), promoting AIDS prevention and treatment. Judd was honored November 10, 2009, as the recipient of the fourth annual &quot;USA Today&quot; Hollywood Hero, awarded for her work with PSI. On October 29, 2006, Judd appeared at a &quot;Women for Ford&quot; event for Democratic Tennessee Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr. She has also campaigned extensively both locally and nationally for a variety of Democratic candidates, including President Barack Obama in critical swing states.

On September 8, 2010, CNN interviewed Judd about her second humanitarian mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Judd traveled with the Enough Project, a project to end genocide and crimes against humanity. In the interview, Judd discussed her efforts to raise awareness about how conflict minerals fuel sexual violence in Congo. During her trip, Judd visited hospitals for victims of sexual violence, camps for displaced persons, mines, and civil society organizations. On September 30, 2010, CNN published an op-ed titled &quot;Ashley Judd: Electronics fuel unspeakable violence&quot; by Judd and Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast regarding the continued violence in Congo. On November 26, 2010, she published a subsequent op-ed, &quot;Costs of Convenience&quot;, excerpted from her trip diary from eastern Congo. These pieces discussed the recent provision in the Dodd-Frank Reform bill that requires companies to prove where their minerals originated, and the link between modern electronics (which rely on those minerals) and mining camps plagued by such violence.

Judd represented Tennessee as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She also considered returning to Kentucky and challenging Senator Mitch McConnell in 2014. In response, the conservative Super PAC American Crossroads released an attack ad against Judd in Kentucky.

In February 2013, she invited her Twitter followers to join a mailing list, hinting that she might ultimately announce a run for the Senate to those on the list. However, she announced on March 27, 2013, that she would not run, citing her need to be focused on her family. Judd later endorsed Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.

On July 26, 2016, Judd attended a Creative Coalition luncheon in support of DC Statehood that took place during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The event, hosted by Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, also included actors Elizabeth Banks, Tim Daly, Josh Gad, William Baldwin, and David Schwimmer.

In January 2020, Judd endorsed Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren in her run for the presidency.

On July 12, 2024, Judd wrote an op-ed for &quot;USA Today&quot; calling on President Joe Biden to suspend his 2024 reelection campaign. She wrote Biden was &quot;incapable of countering Trump, while he, unchecked, gushed a firehose of galling lies&quot; at the first presidential debate of the cycle in late June, 2024. &quot;The Independent&quot; called it &quot;a deeply personal and heartfelt op-ed&quot;.

<text>Ava Lavinia Gardner (December 24, 1922 – January 25, 1990) was an American actress. She first signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1941 and appeared mainly in small roles until she drew critics&#x27; attention in 1946 with her performance in Robert Siodmak&#x27;s film noir &quot;The Killers&quot;. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953), and for best actress for both a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for her performance in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964). She was a part of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

During the 1950s, Gardner established herself as a leading lady and one of the era&#x27;s top stars with films like &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot; (both 1951), &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1952), &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953), &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954), &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956) and &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959). She continued her film career for three more decades, appearing in the films &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966), and &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1968). She continued to act regularly until 1986, four years before her death in 1990, at the age of 67.

In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Gardner No.25 on its greatest female screen legends list.

==Early life==

Gardner was born on December 24, 1922, in Grabtown, North Carolina, the youngest of seven children. When Gardner was born, by community standards, they were “better than well-to-do” with her father having the deed to their tobacco and cotton farm, and owning a sawmill and a country store. She was of English and Scotch-Irish ancestry.

She was raised in the Baptist faith of her mother. While the children were still young, during the Depression the family lost their property. Gardner&#x27;s mother received an offer to work as a cook and housekeeper at a dormitory for teachers at the nearby Brogden School that included board for the family, and Gardner&#x27;s father sharecropped tobacco and supplemented the dwindling work with odd jobs at sawmills. In 1931, the teachers&#x27; school closed, forcing the family to finally give up on their property dreams and move to Newport News, Virginia, where Gardner&#x27;s mother found work managing a boarding house for the city&#x27;s many shipworkers. While in Newport News, Gardner&#x27;s father became ill and died from bronchitis in 1938, when Gardner was 15 years old. After her father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Rock Ridge near Wilson, North Carolina, where Gardner&#x27;s mother ran another boarding house for teachers. Gardner attended high school in Rock Ridge and she graduated from there in 1939. The family was not well off and, to the ridicule of her classmates, she had to wear hand-me-down clothes to school. She then attended secretarial classes at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson for about a year.

==Career==

Gardner was visiting her sister in New York City in the summer of 1940 when her brother-in-law, a professional photographer, offered to take her portrait as a gift for her mother. He was so pleased with the results that he displayed the finished product in the front window of his photography studio on Fifth Avenue.

Barnard Duhan, a legal clerk at Loews Theatres, spotted Gardner&#x27;s portrait in her brother-in-law&#x27;s studio. At the time, Duhan often posed as a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) talent scout to meet girls, using the fact that MGM was a subsidiary of Loews. Duhan entered Gardner&#x27;s brother-in-law&#x27;s studio and tried to get her number, but he was rebuffed by the receptionist. Duhan made the comment &quot;Somebody should send her info to MGM&quot;, and her brother-in-law did so immediately. Shortly after, Gardner, who at the time was a student at Atlantic Christian College, traveled to New York to be interviewed at MGM&#x27;s New York office by Al Altman, head of MGM&#x27;s New York talent department. With cameras rolling, he directed the 18-year-old to walk toward the camera, turn and walk away, then rearrange some flowers in a vase. He did not attempt to record her voice because her strong Southern accent made understanding her difficult for him. Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, however, sent a telegram to Altman: &quot;She can&#x27;t sing. She can&#x27;t act. She can&#x27;t talk. She&#x27;s terrific!&quot; She was offered a standard contract by the studio and left school for Hollywood in 1941, with her sister accompanying her. MGM&#x27;s first order of business was to provide her with a speech coach because her Carolina drawl was nearly incomprehensible to them, and Harriet Lee as her singing teacher.

Her first appearance in a feature film was as a walk-on in the Norma Shearer vehicle &quot;We Were Dancing&quot; (1942). Fifteen bit parts later, she received her first screen billing in &quot;Ghosts on the Loose&quot; (1943), and she is featured by name on the theatrical poster. After five years of bit parts, mostly at MGM and many of them uncredited, Gardner came to prominence in the Mark Hellinger production &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946), playing the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Kitty Collins. Although she had good reviews, she kept a fragile self-image. “Ava wouldn’t even go eat in the commissary because she was so scared to walk in and see Lana Turner and Greer Garson,” says actress Arlene Dahl.

Films from the next decade or so include &quot;The Hucksters&quot; (1947), &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1948), &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951), &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1952), &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1952), &quot;Mogambo&quot;, nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award (1953), &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954), &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956), &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957) and &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959). Off-camera, she could be witty and pithy, as in her assessment of director John Ford, who directed &quot;Mogambo&quot; (&quot;The meanest man on earth. Thoroughly evil. Adored him!&quot;). In &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;, she played the role of doomed beauty Maria Vargas, a fiercely independent woman who goes from Spanish dancer to international movie star with the help of a Hollywood director played by Humphrey Bogart, with tragic consequences. Gardner&#x27;s decision to accept the role was influenced by her own lifelong habit of going barefoot. Gardner played the role of Guinevere in &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953), with actor Robert Taylor as Sir Lancelot. Indicative of her sophistication, she portrayed a duchess, a baroness, and other women of noble lineage in her films of the 1950s.

Gardner played the role of Soledad in &quot;The Angel Wore Red&quot; (1960) with Dirk Bogarde as the male lead. She was billed between Charlton Heston and David Niven for &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963), which was set in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The following year, she played her last major leading role in the critically acclaimed &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), based upon a Tennessee Williams play, and starring Richard Burton as an atheist clergyman and Deborah Kerr as a gentle artist traveling with her aged poet grandfather. John Huston directed the movie in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, insisting on making the film in black-and-white – a decision he later regretted because of the vivid colors of the flora. Gardner received billing below Burton, but above Kerr. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance.

She next appeared again with Burt Lancaster, her co-star from &quot;The Killers&quot;, this time with Kirk Douglas and Fredric March, in &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), a thriller about an attempted military takeover of the US government. Gardner played a former love interest of Lancaster&#x27;s who could have been instrumental in Douglas preventing a coup against the President of the United States.

John Huston chose Gardner for the part of Sarah, the wife of Abraham (played by George C. Scott), in the Dino De Laurentiis film &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot;, which was released in 1966. In a 1964 interview, she talked about why she accepted the role:
Two years later, in 1966, Gardner briefly sought the role of Mrs. Robinson in Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967). She reportedly called Nichols and said &quot;I want to see you! I want to talk about this &quot;Graduate&quot; thing!&quot; Nichols never seriously considered her for the part, preferring to cast a younger woman (Anne Bancroft was 35, while Gardner was 44), but he did visit her hotel, where he later said &quot;she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star cliché. She said, &#x27;All right, let&#x27;s talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.&#x27;&quot;

Gardner moved to Tokyo in 1966, undergoing an elective hysterectomy to allay her worries of contracting the uterine cancer that had claimed the life of her mother. Two years later, she appeared in &quot;Mayerling&quot;, in which she played the supporting role of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Austria, with James Mason as Emperor Franz Joseph I.

Her last appearance was in 1986 in the television film &quot;Maggie&quot;. Gardner authored a book about her life titled &quot;Ava: My Story&quot; published by Random House Publishing Group in 1990.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
Soon after Gardner arrived in Los Angeles, she met fellow MGM contract player Mickey Rooney; they married on January 10, 1942. The ceremony was held in the remote town of Ballard, California because MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer was worried that fans would desert Rooney&#x27;s Andy Hardy movie series if it became known that their star was married. Gardner divorced Rooney in 1943, citing mental cruelty, privately blaming his gambling and womanizing. She did not ruin his on-screen image as the clean-cut, judge&#x27;s son Andy Hardy that the public adored.

Gardner&#x27;s second marriage was equally brief, to jazz musician and bandleader Artie Shaw, from 1945 to 1946. Shaw previously had been married to Lana Turner. Gardner&#x27;s third was to singer and actor Frank Sinatra from 1951 to 1957. She later said in her autobiography that he was the love of her life. Sinatra left his wife Nancy for Gardner, and their marriage made headlines.
Sinatra was blasted by gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, the Hollywood establishment, the Catholic Church, and by his fans for leaving his wife. Gardner used her considerable influence, particularly with Harry Cohn, to get Sinatra cast in his Oscar-winning role in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953). This role and the award revitalized both Sinatra&#x27;s acting and singing careers.

The Gardner–Sinatra marriage was tumultuous. Gardner confided to Artie Shaw, her second husband, that, &quot;With him [Frank], it&#x27;s impossible...It&#x27;s like being with a woman. He&#x27;s so gentle. It&#x27;s as though he thinks I&#x27;ll break, as though I&#x27;m a piece of Dresden china, and he&#x27;s gonna hurt me.&quot; During their marriage, Gardner became pregnant twice, but aborted both babies. &quot;MGM had all sorts of penalty clauses about their stars having babies&quot;, according to her autobiography, which was published eight months after her death. Gardner filed for divorce in 1954, and the divorce was finalized in 1957.
Following their divorce, Gardner and Sinatra remained good friends for the rest of her life.

=== Relationships ===

Gardner became a friend and protegé of businessman and aviator Howard Hughes in the early to mid-1940s, and the relationship lasted into the 1950s. Gardner stated in her autobiography, &quot;Ava: My Story&quot;, that she was never in love with Hughes, but he was in and out of her life for about 20 years. Hughes&#x27; trust in Gardner was what kept their relationship alive. She described him as &quot;painfully shy, completely enigmatic, and more eccentric...than anyone [she] had ever met&quot;.

Gardner had several other affairs including with actor Fred MacMurray, matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, actor George C. Scott, novelist, short-story writer, and journalist Ernest Hemingway, and Claude Terrail, the restaurateur of the Paris restaurant La Tour d&#x27;Argent.

Gardner lived her last 35 years outside of the United States. She first visited Spain in 1951, and she moved to that country in 1955, living there until 1966, when she moved to London. She lived at 34 Ennismore Gardens in Westminster in London, her final residence when she died.

Gardner had a close friendship with Gregory Peck, with whom she starred together in three films, the first one being &quot;The Great Sinner&quot; (1949). Their friendship lasted the rest of Gardner&#x27;s life, and, upon her death in 1990, Peck took in both her housekeeper and her dog.

=== Religion and political views ===

Although Gardner was raised Baptist, at the end of her life she said she had no religion. Christianity never played a positive role in her life, according to biographers and Gardner, in her autobiography &quot;Ava: My Story&quot;. Her friend Zoe Sallis, who met her on the set of &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; when Gardner was living with John Huston in Puerto Vallarta, said Gardner always seemed unconcerned about religion. When Sallis asked her about religion once, Gardner replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not anything Christian&quot;. Another factor that contributed to this outlook was the death of Gardner&#x27;s father in her youth. She said, &quot;Nobody wanted to know Daddy when he was dying. He was so alone. He was scared. I could see the fear in his eyes when he was smiling. I went to see the preacher, the guy who&#x27;d baptized me. I begged him to come and visit Daddy, just to talk to him, you know? Give him a blessing or something. But he never did. He never came. God, I hated him. Cold-arse bastards like that ought to...I don&#x27;t know...they should be in some other racket, I know that. I had no time for Christianity after that. I never prayed. I never said another prayer. At least not a Christian one&quot;. Concerning politics, Gardner was a lifelong Democrat, and she supported Adlai Stevenson II in the 1952 United States presidential election.

Gardner was a staunch supporter of civil rights for African-Americans throughout her life. As a child growing up in North Carolina, she would often sit with African-American children in segregated parts of movie theaters. Her personal assistant, Rene Jordan, was African-American, and Gardner would often take her to clubs that were for whites only. She supported Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party, whose campaign in 1948 for the presidential election sought racial equality and desegregation.

She became a member of the NAACP in August 1968.

== Death ==

In 1986, Gardner suffered a stroke. Although she could afford her medical expenses, Frank Sinatra wanted to pay for her visit to a specialist in the United States, and she allowed him to make the arrangements for a medically staffed private plane. She died at age 67 of bronchopneumonia on January 25, 1990 in Westminster, London, England.

Gardner was buried on January 29 in Sunset Memorial Park in Smithfield, North Carolina, next to her siblings and their parents, Jonas and Molly Gardner. The Ava Gardner Museum, incorporated in 1996, is located nearby.

==Bibliography==
Gardner authored a book about her life titled &quot;Ava: My Story&quot; published by Random House Publishing Group in 1990 with an illustrated reprint by Random House&#x27;s subsidiary Bantam Books in 1992.

In the last years of her life, Gardner asked Peter Evans to ghostwrite her autobiography, stating: &quot;I either write the book or sell the jewels.&quot; Despite meeting with Evans frequently, and approving of most of his copy, Gardner eventually learned that Evans, along with the BBC, had once been sued by her ex-husband Frank Sinatra. Gardner and Evans&#x27;s friendship subsequently cooled, and Evans left the project. Evans&#x27; notes and sections of his draft of Gardner&#x27;s autobiography, which he based on their taped conversations, were published in his book &quot;Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations&quot; after Evans&#x27; death in 2012.

== Accolades ==
Gardner was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953); which Audrey Hepburn won for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. Her role in &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964) was well reviewed, and she was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe. Additionally, Gardner won the Silver Shell for Best Actress at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in 1964 for &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;.

== Film portrayals ==
Gardner has been portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden in the 1992 miniseries &quot;Sinatra&quot;, by Deborah Kara Unger in the 1998 television film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, by Kate Beckinsale in the 2004 Howard Hughes biopic &quot;The Aviator&quot;, Anna Drijver in the 2012 Italian TV film &quot;Walter Chiari – Fino all&#x27;ultima risata&quot;, and Emily Elicia Low in &quot;Frank &amp; Ava&quot; (2018).

The images of Gardner and Clark Gable are featured on the cover of Robin Gibb&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;How Old Are You?&quot;

The 2018 Spanish television series &quot;Arde Madrid&quot; is a comedy-drama with thriller elements based on elements of Ava Gardner&#x27;s life in mid-20th century Spain. Gardner is portrayed by Debi Mazar.

<text>NoCGV &quot;Svalbard&quot; (W303) is a Norwegian Coast Guard icebreaker and offshore patrol vessel constructed by Langsten at Tangen Verft shipyard in Kragerø and launched on 17 February 2001. She was named 15 December 2001 in Tomrefjord with Minister of Defence Kristin Krohn Devold as godmother, and delivered to the Coast Guard on 18 January 2002. She entered service in mid-2002 and is homeported in Sortland. Her primary operating area is in the Arctic waters north of Norway, the Barents Sea and around the Svalbard islands.

&quot;Svalbard&quot; is the second largest ship in Norway&#x27;s military armed forces (by tonnage), designed to supplement the three other helicopter-carrying ships of the Norwegian Coast Guard - the s. She is NBC-protected with constant overpressure, and is capable of icebreaking and emergency towing up to 100,000 tons. The Norwegian coastline is generally free of ice, thus &quot;Svalbard&quot; is the one of just two Norwegian icebreaking-capable vessel, the other being . A double acting ship, &quot;Svalbard&quot; is designed to break ice both ahead and astern.

==Career==
On 21 August 2019, &quot;Svalbard&quot; became the first Norwegian ship to reach the North Pole.

In October 2020, &quot;Svalbard&quot; was deployed to the Bering Sea to retrieve scientific instruments belonging to the Coordinated Arctic Acoustic Thermometry Experiment (CAATEX) from the seabed, a task previously assigned to the United States Coast Guard icebreaker that had been sidelined earlier that year following an onboard fire. The vessel sailed to the western hemisphere along a high-latitude route north of Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, and outside of Russian territorial waters. Despite the scientific mission, a number of Russian media outlets interpreted this voyage as an &quot;intrusion&quot; to the Russian Arctic by an &quot;armed NATO warship&quot;.

The 2023 defence acquisition plan indicated that the ship would receive necessary upgrades to permit her to continue in service.

==Foreign analogs==

On 9 July 2007 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada would build six to eight arctic offshore patrol ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), modeled after &quot;Svalbard&quot;″s design. The vessels&#x27; design was modified to meet the needs of the RCN. Some of the modifications include: increasing the ships&#x27; ice breaking capabilities, adding a larger and fully enclosed forecastle/cable deck for greater arctic protection, addition of a multipurpose operational space, updated command and control systems, an updated sensor suite, and an extended hangar for the larger Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter. The project was criticized for its high costs. For example, Irving Shipbuilding was awarded a CA$288 million design contract for the vessel while the design of &quot;Svalbard&quot; and similar patrol ships within other countries paid less than one-tenth as much. The first ship in its class, , was delivered to the RCN on 31 July 2020, with its commissioning anticipated in mid-2021 following the completion of post-acceptance sea trials.

In 2015 Russia started constructing the first of several vessels in its Project 23550. Think tank Global Security pointed out these vessels are almost the same length, displacement, power and endurance as the &quot;Svalbard&quot; class. They will also be able to travel through roughly the same depth of ice. The Russian vessels will be more heavily armed, with a main cannon, an anti-missile gatling gun, and launchers for eight cruise missiles.

<doc id="43118" wikidata="Q180436" url="?curid=43118" title="Cilium">
<text>The cilium (: cilia; ; in Medieval Latin and in anatomy, &quot;cilium&quot;) is a short hair-like membrane protrusion from many types of eukaryotic cell. (Cilia are absent in bacteria and archaea.) The cilium has the shape of a slender threadlike projection that extends from the surface of the much larger cell body. Eukaryotic flagella found on sperm cells and many protozoans have a similar structure to motile cilia that enables swimming through liquids; they are longer than cilia and have a different undulating motion.

There are two major classes of cilia: &quot;motile&quot; and &quot;non-motile&quot; cilia, each with two subtypes, giving four types in all. A cell will typically have one primary cilium or many motile cilia. The structure of the cilium core, called the axoneme, determines the cilium class. Most motile cilia have a central pair of single microtubules surrounded by nine pairs of double microtubules called a 9+2 axoneme. Most non-motile cilia have a 9+0 axoneme that lacks the central pair of microtubules. Also lacking are the associated components that enable motility including the outer and inner dynein arms, and radial spokes. Some motile cilia lack the central pair, and some non-motile cilia have the central pair, hence the four types.

Most non-motile cilia, termed &quot;primary cilia&quot; or &quot;sensory cilia&quot;, serve solely as sensory organelles. Most vertebrate cell types possess a single non-motile primary cilium, which functions as a cellular antenna. Olfactory neurons possess a great many non-motile cilia. Non-motile cilia that have a central pair of microtubules are the kinocilia present on hair cells.

Motile cilia are found in large numbers on respiratory epithelial cells – around 200 cilia per cell, where they function in mucociliary clearance, and also have mechanosensory and chemosensory functions. Motile cilia on ependymal cells move the cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system of the brain. Motile cilia are also present in the oviducts (fallopian tubes) of female (therian) mammals, where they function in moving egg cells from the ovary to the uterus. Motile cilia that lack the central pair of microtubules are found in the cells of the embryonic primitive node; termed &quot;nodal cells&quot;, these nodal cilia are responsible for the left-right asymmetry of bilaterians.

== Structure==

A cilium is assembled and built from a basal body on the cell surface. From the basal body, the ciliary rootlet forms ahead of the transition plate and transition zone where the earlier microtubule triplets change to the microtubule doublets of the axoneme.

===Basal body===
The foundation of the cilium is the basal body, a term applied to the mother centriole when it is associated with a cilium. Mammalian basal bodies consist of a barrel of nine triplet microtubules, subdistal appendages and nine strut-like structures, known as distal appendages, which attach the basal body to the membrane at the base of the cilium. Two of each of the basal body&#x27;s triplet microtubules extend during growth of the axoneme to become the doublet microtubules.

===Ciliary rootlet===
The ciliary rootlet is a cytoskeleton-like structure that originates from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. Rootlets are typically 80-100 nm in diameter and contain cross striae distributed at regular intervals of approximately 55-70 nm. A prominent component of the rootlet is rootletin a coiled coil rootlet protein coded for by the &quot;CROCC&quot; gene.

===Transition zone===
To achieve its distinct composition, the proximal-most region of the cilium consists of a transition zone, also known as the ciliary gate, that controls the entry and exit of proteins to and from the cilium. At the transition zone, Y-shaped structures connect the ciliary membrane to the underlying axoneme. Control of selective entry into cilia may involve a sieve-like function of transition zone. Inherited defects in components of the transition zone cause ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome. Transition zone structure and function is conserved across diverse organisms, including vertebrates, &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; and &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot;. In mammals, disruption of the transition zone reduces the ciliary abundance of membrane-associated ciliary proteins, such as those involved in Hedgehog signal transduction, compromising Hedgehog-dependent embryonic development of digit number and central nervous system patterning.

===Axoneme===
Inside a cilium is a microtubule-based cytoskeletal core called the axoneme. The axoneme of a primary cilium typically has a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets (called a 9+0 axoneme), and the axoneme of a motile cilium has, in addition to the nine outer doublets, two central microtubule singlets (called a 9+2 axoneme). This is the same axoneme type of the flagellum. The axoneme in a motile cilium acts as a scaffold for the inner and outer dynein arms that move the cilium, and provides tracks for the microtubule motor proteins of kinesin and dynein. The transport of ciliary components is carried out by intraflagellar transport (IFT) which is similar to the axonal transport in a nerve fibre. Transport is bidirectional and cytoskeletal motor proteins kinesin and dynein transport ciliary components along the microtubule tracks; kinesin in an anterograde movement towards the ciliary tip and dynein in a retrograde movement towards the cell body. The cilium has its own ciliary membrane enclosed within the surrounding cell membrane.

==Types==
===Non-motile cilia===
In animals, non-motile primary cilia are found on nearly every type of cell, blood cells being a prominent exception. Most cells only possess one, in contrast to cells with motile cilia, an exception being olfactory sensory neurons, where the odorant receptors are located, which each possess about ten cilia. Some cell types, such as retinal photoreceptor cells, possess highly specialized primary cilia.

Although the primary cilium was discovered in 1898, it was largely ignored for a century and considered a vestigial organelle without important function. Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemosensation, signal transduction, and cell growth control, have revealed its importance in cell function. Its importance to human biology has been underscored by the discovery of its role in a diverse group of diseases caused by the dysgenesis or dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease, congenital heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, and retinal degeneration, called ciliopathies. The primary cilium is now known to play an important role in the function of many human organs. Primary cilia on pancreatic beta cells regulate their function and energy metabolism. Cilia deletion can lead to islet dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.

Cilia are assembled during the G1 phase and are disassembled before mitosis occurs. Disassembly of cilia requires the action of aurora kinase A. 
The current scientific understanding of primary cilia views them as &quot;sensory cellular antennae that coordinate many cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.&quot;
The cilium is composed of subdomains and enclosed by a plasma membrane continuous with the plasma membrane of the cell. For many cilia, the basal body, where the cilium originates, is located within a membrane invagination called the ciliary pocket. The cilium membrane and the basal body microtubules are connected by distal appendages (also called transition fibers). Vesicles carrying molecules for the cilia dock at the distal appendages. Distal to the transition fibers form a transition zone where entry and exit of molecules is regulated to and from the cilia. Some of the signaling with these cilia occur through ligand binding such as Hedgehog signaling. Other forms of signaling include G protein-coupled receptors including the somatostatin receptor 3 in neurons.
====Modified non-motile cilia====
Kinocilia that are found on hair cells in the inner ear are termed as specialized primary cilia, or modified non-motile cilia. They possess the 9+2 axoneme of the motile cilia but lack the inner dynein arms that give movement. They do move passively following the detection of sound, allowed by the outer dynein arms.

===Motile cilia===

Mammals also have motile cilia or secondary cilia that are usually present on a cell&#x27;s surface in large numbers (multiciliate), and beat in coordinated metachronal waves. Multiciliated cells are found lining the respiratory tract where they function in mucociliary clearance sweeping mucus containing debris away from the lungs. Each cell in the respiratory epithelium has around 200 motile cilia.

In the reproductive tract, smooth muscle contractions help the beating of the cilia in moving the egg cell from the ovary to the uterus.
In the ventricles of the brain ciliated ependymal cells circulate the cerebrospinal fluid.

The functioning of motile cilia is strongly dependent on the maintenance of optimal levels of periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are specifically expressed along the entire length of cilia in the respiratory tract, and fallopian tube or &quot;oviduct&quot; that apparently serve as sensors to regulate the periciliary fluid.

====Modified motile cilia====
Motile cilia without the central pair of singlets (9+0) are found in early embryonic development. They are present as nodal cilia on the nodal cells of the primitive node. Nodal cells are responsible for the left-right asymmetry in bilateral animals. While lacking the central apparatus there are dynein arms present that allow the nodal cilia to move in a spinning fashion. The movement creates a current flow of the extraembryonic fluid across the nodal surface in a leftward direction that initiates the left-right asymmetry in the developing embryo.
Motile, multiple, 9+0 cilia are found on the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. Cilia also can change structure when introduced to hot temperatures and become sharp. They are present in large numbers on each cell and move relatively slowly, making them intermediate between motile and primary cilia. In addition to 9+0 cilia that are mobile, there are also solitary 9+2 cilia that stay immobile found in hair cells.

====Nodal cilia====

Nodal cells have a single cilium called a monocilium. They are present in the very early development of the embryo on the primitive node. There are two areas of the node with different types of nodal cilia. On the central node are motile cilia, and on the peripheral area of the node the nodal cilia are modified motile.

The motile cilia on the central cells rotate to generate the leftward flow of extracellular fluid needed to initiate the left-right asymmetry.

===Cilia versus flagella===

The motile cilia on sperm cells and many protozoans enables swimming through liquids and are traditionally referred to as &quot;flagella&quot;. As these protrusions are structurally identical to motile cilia, attempts at preserving this terminology include making a distinction by morphology (&quot;flagella&quot; are typically longer than ordinary cilia and have a different undulating motion) and by number.

===Microorganisms===
Ciliates are eukaryotic microorganisms that possess motile cilia exclusively and use them for either locomotion or to simply move liquid over their surface. A &quot;Paramecium&quot; for example is covered in thousands of cilia that enable its swimming. These motile cilia have been shown to be also sensory.

==Ciliogenesis==

Cilia are formed through the process of ciliogenesis. An early step is docking of the basal body to the growing ciliary membrane, after which the transition zone forms. The building blocks of the ciliary axoneme, such as tubulins, are added at the ciliary tips through a process that depends partly on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Exceptions include &quot;Drosophila&quot; sperm and &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; flagella formation, in which cilia assemble in the cytoplasm.

At the base of the cilium where it attaches to the cell body is the microtubule organizing center, the basal body. Some basal body proteins as CEP164, ODF2
and CEP170, are required for the formation and the stability of the cilium.

In effect, the cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines. Flexible linkers allow the 
mobile protein domains
connected by them to recruit their binding partners and induce 
long-range allostery via 
protein domain dynamics.

== Function ==
The dynein in the axoneme – axonemal dynein forms bridges between neighbouring microtubule doublets. When ATP activates the motor domain of dynein, it attempts to walk along the adjoining microtubule doublet. This would force the adjacent doublets to slide over one another if not for the presence of nexin between the microtubule doublets. And thus the force generated by dynein is instead converted into a bending motion.

===Sensing the extracellular environment===
Some primary cilia on epithelial cells in eukaryotes act as &quot;cellular antennae&quot;, providing chemosensation, thermosensation and mechanosensation of the extracellular environment. These cilia then play a role in mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a secretory role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are motile.

Some epithelial cells are ciliated, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarized cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the lumen. This sensory and signalling role puts cilia in a central role for maintaining the local cellular environment and may be why ciliary defects cause such a wide range of human diseases.

In the embryo, nodal cilia are used to direct the flow of extracellular fluid. This leftward movement is to generate left-right asymmetry across the midline of the embryo. Central cilia coordinate their rotational beating while the immotile cilia on the sides sense the direction of the flow. Studies in mice suggest a biophysical mechanism by which the direction of flow is sensed.

===Axo-ciliary synapse===
With axo-ciliary synapses, there is communication between serotonergic axons and primary cilia of CA1 pyramidal neurons that alters the neuron&#x27;s epigenetic state in the nucleus – &quot;a way to change what is being transcribed or made in the nucleus&quot; via this signalling distinct from that at the plasma membrane which also is longer-term.

==Clinical significance==

Ciliary defects can lead to a number of human diseases. Defects in cilia adversely affect many critical signaling pathways essential to embryonic development and to adult physiology, and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of diverse ciliopathies. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration. Genetic mutations compromising the proper functioning of cilia, ciliopathies, can cause chronic disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), nephronophthisis, and Senior–Løken syndrome. In addition, a defect of the primary cilium in the renal tubule cells can lead to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In another genetic disorder called Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS), the mutant gene products are the components in the basal body and cilia. Defects in cilia cells are linked to obesity and often pronounced in type 2 diabetes. Several studies already showed impaired glucose tolerance and reduction in the insulin secretion in the ciliopathy models. Moreover, the number and length of cilia was decreased in the type 2 diabetes models.

Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) that are expressed along the length of cilia regulate periciliary fluid level. Mutations that decrease the activity of ENaCs result in multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism, that is associated with fertility problems. In cystic fibrosis that results from mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, ENaC activity is enhanced leading to a severe reduction of the fluid level that causes complications and infections in the respiratory airways.

Since the flagellum of human sperm has the same internal structure of a cilium, ciliary dysfunction can also be responsible for male infertility.

There is an association of primary ciliary dyskinesia with left-right anatomic abnormalities such as situs inversus (a combination of findings is known as Kartagener syndrome), and situs ambiguus (also known as &quot;Heterotaxy syndrome&quot;). These left-right anatomic abnormalities can also result in congenital heart disease. It has been shown that proper cilial function is responsible for the normal left-right asymmetry in mammals.

The diverse outcomes caused by ciliary dysfunction may result from alleles of different strengths that compromise ciliary functions in different ways or to different extents. Many ciliopathies are inherited in a Mendelian manner, but specific genetic interactions between distinct functional ciliary complexes, such as transition zone and BBS complexes, can alter the phenotypic manifestations of recessive ciliopathies. Some mutations in transition zone proteins can cause specific serious ciliopathies.

===Extracellular changes===
Reduction of cilia function can also result from infection. Research into biofilms has shown that bacteria can alter cilia. A biofilm is a community of bacteria of either the same or multiple species of bacteria. The cluster of cells secretes different factors which form an extracellular matrix. Cilia in the respiratory system is known to move mucus and pathogens out of the airways. It has been found that patients with biofilm positive infections have impaired cilia function. The impairment may present as decreased motion or reduction in the number of cilia. Though these changes result from an external source, they still effect the pathogenicity of the bacteria, progression of infection, and how it is treated.

The transportation of the immature egg cell, and the embryo to the uterus for implantation depends on the combination of regulated smooth muscle contractions, and ciliary beating. Dysfunction in this transportation can result in an ectopic pregnancy where the embryo is implanted (usually) in the fallopian tube before reaching its proper destination of the uterus. Many factors can affect this stage including infection and menstrual cycle hormones. Smoking (causing inflammation), and infection can reduce the numbers of cilia, and the ciliary beat can be affected by hormonal changes.

=== Primary cilia in pancreatic cells ===
The pancreas is a mixture of highly differentiated exocrine and endocrine cells. Primary cilia are present in exocrine cells, which are centroacinar duct cells. Endocrine tissue is composed of different hormone-secreting cells. Insulin-secreting beta cells and glucagon-secreting alpha cells are highly ciliated.

<text>Breakbeat hardcore (also referred to as hardcore rave, oldskool hardcore or simply hardcore) is a music genre that spawned from the UK rave scene during the early 1990s. It combines four-on-the-floor rhythms with breakbeats usually sampled from hip hop. In addition to the inclusion of breakbeats, the genre also features shuffled drum machine patterns, hoover, and other noises originating from new beat and Belgian techno, sounds from acid house and bleep techno, and often upbeat house piano riffs and vocals.

== History ==
=== Early 1990s: origins ===
The rave scene expanded rapidly in the very early 1990s, both at clubs up and down the country including Labrynth, Shelley&#x27;s Laserdome, The Eclipse, and Sanctuary Music Arena, and large raves in Warehouses and in the open air attracting 20–50,000 whether put on legally from promoters such as Fantazia and Raindance, or unlicensed by free party sound systems such as Spiral Tribe. Breakbeat hardcore drew its melting pot of sound from a vast array of influences – from new beat and Belgian techno that had for a short period been prominent in the UK rave scene, to house and acid house, and furthermore drawing on hip hop and reggae culture. Amongst the influences from within the rave scene itself upon which this strain of hardcore drew were such acts as Manix, The Hypnotist, CJ Bolland with his &quot;Ravesignal&quot; series, and T99. The huge increase in producers was also driven by the increasing availability of cheap home computer-based studio setups, particularly Cubase for the Atari ST.

=== Mid-1990s: fragmentation ===
By late 1992, breakbeat hardcore started to fragment into a number of subsequent genres: darkcore (piano rolls giving way to dark-themed samples and stabs), hardcore jungle (where reggae basslines and samples became prominent), and happy hardcore (retaining piano rolls and more uplifting vocals).

=== 2000s: revival ===
In the 2000s, the style experienced a revival as part of the nu-rave scene.

Hardcore breaks is a style of breakbeat hardcore that appeared in early-to-mid 2000s as part of growing nu-rave scene. The style is inspired by the sound and characteristics of old school breakbeat, while being fused with modern production techniques that distinguish the genre from the classic hardcore breakbeat sound. The music is composed of looped, edited and processed breakbeat samples, intense bassline sounds, melodic piano lines, staccato synthesizer riffs, and various vocal samples (mostly taken from old house records). The speed of this genre typically fell between the range of 145–155 bpm, while the speed may variate on live sets. Originally being produced by a small group of artists with the vision of carrying on where oldskool hardcore left off before the jungle and happy hardcore split using new production techniques and technology, its appeal has now expanded to include artists from the original breakbeat hardcore scene creating new productions. By the late 2000s, hardcore breaks tend to be produced and played at a bit faster tempos, often between 160–180 bpm. Therefore, it is often played at UK hardcore, freeform hardcore and drum and bass events.

<doc id="43125" wikidata="Q263128" url="?curid=43125" title="Hugh Dowding">
<text>Air Chief Marshal Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding, (24 April 1882 – 15 February 1970) was a senior officer in the Royal Air Force. He was Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and is generally credited with playing a crucial role in Britain&#x27;s defence, and hence, the defeat of Operation Sea Lion, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade Britain.

Born in Moffat, Scotland, Dowding was an officer in the British Army in the 1900s and early 1910s. He joined the Royal Flying Corps at the start of the First World War and went on to serve as a fighter pilot and then as commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron. During the inter-war years he became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research. In July 1936, Dowding was appointed chief of the newly created RAF Fighter Command.

During the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, Dowding&#x27;s Fighter Command successfully defended the UK against the attacks of the Luftwaffe, thanks to his prudent management of RAF resources and detailed preparation of Britain&#x27;s air defences (the Dowding system). He subsequently came into conflict with proponents of the Big Wing tactic, most notably Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Douglas Bader, which along with the inadaquacies of RAF&#x27;s night-time defence during the Blitz led to his eventual downfall. In November 1940, Dowding was replaced in command against his wishes by Sholto Douglas, another Big Wing advocate.

Dowding retired from the Royal Air Force in July 1942 and was made a peer in June 1943. Upon retirement, Dowding subsequently became an influential member of the British spiritualist, theosophical, and animal rights movements. He died on 15 February 1970, aged 87.

==Early life==
Dowding was born at St. Ninian&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Preparatory School in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, the son of Arthur John Caswall Dowding and Maud Caroline Dowding (née Tremenheere). His father had taught at Fettes College in Edinburgh before moving to Moffat. Dowding was educated at St Ninian&#x27;s School and Winchester College. He trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 18 August 1900.

==Military career==
Promoted to lieutenant on 8 May 1902, Dowding served with the Royal Garrison Artillery at Gibraltar, in Ceylon and in Hong Kong before being posted to No. 7 Mountain Artillery Battery in India in 1904. After returning to the United Kingdom, he attended the Army Staff College 1912 before being promoted to captain on 18 August 1913 and being posted with the Royal Garrison Artillery on the Isle of Wight later that year. After becoming interested in aviation, Dowding gained Aviator&#x27;s Certificate no. 711 on 19 December 1913 in a Vickers biplane at the Vickers School of Flying, Brooklands. He then attended the Central Flying School, where he was awarded his wings. Although added to the Reserve List of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Dowding returned to the Isle of Wight to resume his Royal Garrison Artillery duties. However, this arrangement was short lived and in August 1914, he joined the RFC as a pilot on No. 7 Squadron.

===First World War===
Dowding transferred to No. 6 Squadron in October 1914 and then, after two weeks as a staff officer in France, became a Flight Commander, first with No. 9 Squadron and then with No. 6 Squadron. He served from December 1914 as a general staff officer, grade 3 and was seconded. He became commanding officer of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Brooklands in March 1915 and went on to be commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron in July 1915, which was based at La Gorgue in northern France. After the Battle of the Somme, Dowding clashed with General Hugh Trenchard, the commander of the RFC, over the need to give pilots some rest and recuperation. In September 1915 Duncan Grinnell-Milne joined No 16 squadron as a junior pilot. Years later he published an account of his time in the squadron, in which he criticises Dowding as being &quot;too reserved and aloof from his juniors&quot;, although efficient. Promoted to major on 30 December 1915, Dowding was recalled to England in January 1916, and, having been promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1916 was given command of 7 Wing at Farnborough later that month. He transferred to the command of 9 Wing at Fienvillers in June 1916. Returning to England, he was promoted to temporary colonel on 1 January 1917 on appointment as commander of the Southern Group Command and promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 23 June 1917 before being given command of the southern training brigade in August 1917. He was sent to York as chief staff officer to the RAF&#x27;s senior administrative officer in the area in April 1918. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919.

===Inter-war years===
Dowding was given a permanent commission in the RAF on 1 August 1919 with the rank of group captain. He commanded No. 16 Group from October 1919 and then No. 1 Group from February 1920 where he was responsible for organising two of the annual air displays at Hendon. He was promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1922, and served as chief staff officer at Inland Area headquarters at Uxbridge from February 1922 before being appointed Chief Staff Officer for RAF Iraq Command in August 1924.

Dowding was an accomplished skier, winner of the first ever National Slalom Championship, and president of the Ski Club of Great Britain from 1924 to 1925. The dominant personality within the RAF in the 1920s was Hugh Trenchard who ardently believed in strategic bombing as a war-winning measure and as a result, the interwar RAF was dominated by a &quot;bomber cult&quot; as Trenchard tended to promote officers who shared his views about strategic bombing. Dowding stood out as one of the few RAF officers not totally englamoured with bombers and who was more interested in fighters. 

In May 1926 Dowding was appointed director of training at the Air Ministry. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1928 and promoted to air vice-marshal on 1 January 1929. Trenchard sent him to Palestine and Transjordan to study security problems caused by Arab–Jewish unrest: his reports, which gained Trenchard&#x27;s approval, were a cause of further career advancement. Dowding became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain in December 1929 and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research in September 1930. One of his first responsibilities in this post was the approval of the granting of a certificate of airworthiness to the R101 airship shortly before it set off on its ill-fated voyage to India; he later said &quot;I think I was wrong not to insist on much more extensive trials and tests&quot; and that his decision had been based on optimistic technical advice. Dowding&#x27;s time in this office coincided with a period of rapid development in aircraft design and a growing fear that another major war was on the horizon. Although without scientific or technical training, he displayed a great capacity for understanding technical matters. He was promoted to air marshal on 1 January 1933 and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1933.

In July 1936 Dowding was appointed commanding officer of the newly created RAF Fighter Command, and was perhaps the one important person in Britain, and perhaps the world, who did not agree with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s 1932 declaration that &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;. He conceived and oversaw the development of the &quot;Dowding system&quot;. This consisted of an integrated air defence system which included (i) radar (whose potential Dowding was among the first to appreciate), (ii) human observers (including the Royal Observer Corps), who filled crucial gaps in what radar was capable of detecting at the time (the early radar systems, for example, did not provide accurate information on the altitude of incoming German aircraft), (iii) raid plotting, and (iv) radio control of aircraft. The whole network was linked in many cases by dedicated telephone cables buried sufficiently deeply to provide protection against bombing. The network had its centre at RAF Bentley Priory, a converted country house on the outskirts of London. The system as a whole later became known as Ground-controlled interception (GCI). 

A major problem for the RAF was the way that the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King from 1935 onward repeatedly vetoed plans for the Empire Air Training Scheme for training pilots from all the Commonwealth nations in Canada, which prevented Fighter Command from building up a reserve of properly trained pilots. By the time the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was finally launched in the autumn of 1939 after Mackenzie King gave his consent, it was far too late for Dowding. On an average, it took about one year to train a pilot plus another year of squadron flying to prepare a pilot for war. In lieu of the Empire Air Training Scheme that he wanted, Dowding was forced to depend upon the Auxiliary Air Force, the RAF Volunteer Reserve and the University Air Squadrons to provide him with a reserve of trained pilots. However despite all the efforts to give Fighter Command a reserve of pilots, Dowding complained in 1939 that he lacked sufficient reserves of properly trained pilots to face the Luftwaffe. On the basis of the First World War experiences, Dowding predicated that many of his pilots would be rapidly killed or seriously injured in the event of war, all the more because the Luftwaffe had many combat-experienced pilots who had served in the Spanish Civil War, and it still took a year to train a pilot, leading him to warn that he would almost certainly face a shortage of pilots. 

Dowding also brought modern aircraft into service during the pre-war period, including the eight gun Spitfire and Hurricane. He is also credited with having fought the Air Ministry so that fighters were equipped with bullet-proof wind shields. At a meeting with the Air Ministry when told that bullet-proof windows were too expensive, Dowding replied: &quot;If Chicago gangsters can have bulletproof glass in their cars I can&#x27;t see any reason why my pilots cannot have the same&quot;. Dowding was a quiet, reserved man, but was greatly admired by those who served under him. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 January 1937 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 23 January 1937.

===Second World War===

====Battle of Britain====

At the time of his retirement in June 1939, Dowding was asked to stay on until March 1940 because of the tense international situation. He was again permitted to continue serving through the Battle of Britain, first until July and finally until November 1940. In 1940, Dowding, nicknamed &quot;Stuffy&quot; by his men for his alleged lack of humour, proved unwilling to sacrifice aircraft and pilots in the attempt to aid Allied troops during the Battle of France. He, along with his immediate superior Sir Cyril Newall, then Chief of the Air Staff, resisted repeated requests from Winston Churchill to weaken the home defence by sending precious squadrons to France. 

Dowding lacked tact when it came to dealing with politicians, and right from the onset he did not get along well with Churchill. The British historian Len Deighton wrote: &quot;But Dowding was no paragon. Too often he resorted to caustic comments when a kind word of advice would have produced the same or better results...Dowding was indifferent to the boardroom politics of higher office, impatient and abrasive to men who failed to understand his reasoning&quot;. Just before a cabinet meeting on 15 May 1940, Dowding protested before an informal committee that consisted of Churchill; the minister of aircraft production, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Minister Sir Archibald Sinclair that the number of fighter squadrons available to Fighter Command had been reduced from 52 to 36, and at present rate of losses in France, he would have no squadrons available within two weeks. Dowding attended the subsequent cabinet meeting, but did not speak. The meeting ended with the cabinet voting to send four more squadrons to France. On 16 May 1940, Churchill held a summit In Paris with the French Premier Paul Reynaud, and telephoned London afterwards to ask for six more fighter squadrons to be sent to France. At a cabinet meeting late in the afternoon of the same day, Sinclair mentioned Dowding&#x27;s argument, which led to the cabinet to agree that the additional six squadrons could operate from French airfields in the day, but had to return to the United Kingdom at night. Churchill was angered by the way that Dowding&#x27;s arguments had swayed the cabinet into a decision that he did not want and came to feel a grudge against Dowding. In a clear sign of disfavour, Churchill barely mentioned Dowding in &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot;, volume 2 of his memoirs/history of the Second World, and in the few times that he did, he gave distorted accounts that cast Dowding in a dark light. In &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot;, Churchill wrote: &quot;Air Chief Marshal Dowding, at the head of the metropolitan Fighter Command, had declared to me that with twenty-five squadrons of fighters he could defend the island against the whole of the German Air Force, but that with less he would be overpowered&quot;. Deighton wrote that this statement was &quot;nonsense&quot; as Dowding in a letter to Churchill dated 15 May 1940 had expressed grave concerns about the ability of Fighter Command to hold out against the Luftwaffe with only thirty-six squadrons.. When the Allied resistance in France collapsed, he worked closely with Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, the commander of 11 Fighter Group, in organising cover for the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk.

Through the summer and autumn of 1940 in the Battle of Britain, Dowding&#x27;s Fighter Command resisted the attacks of the Luftwaffe. Beyond the critical importance of the overall system of integrated air defence which he had developed for Fighter Command, his major contribution was to marshal resources behind the scenes (including replacement aircraft and air crew) and to maintain a significant fighter reserve, while leaving his subordinate commanders&#x27; hands largely free to run the battle in detail. The first phrase of the Battle of Britain, namely Luftwaffe attacks on British shipping in the English Channel were what Deighton called a classic &quot;heads I win, tails you lose&quot; gambit. If Dowding committed his fighters at the near-range of German aircraft, he risked having the strength of Fighter Command reduced via attrition while he did not think the Luftwaffe would sink the merchantmen. Because of a shortage of pilots, Dowding only committed the minimal number of fighters during what the Germans called the &quot;Kanalkampf&quot; (Channel battle), which led to increased shipping losses in July-August 1940. He was forced to commit more fighter squadrons close to the coast even though he knew it was highly dangerous. The Luftwaffe planes were already flying at the optimal height over the Channel while it took time for the British fighters taking off at coastal airfields to reach the proper flying height, which thereby gave the Luftwaffe the advantage in any dogfights over the Channel. An additional concern for Dowding was that the planes of Fighter Command had no dinghies or sea dye while Britain at this point lacked an air-sea rescue organisation, so that any pilot shot down over the Channel were more likely than not to be lost. As more colliers were sunk in the Channel while Fighter Command losses increased, Dowding stoutly resisted pressure to send more fighters in the &quot;Kanalkampf&quot; and instead urged that more trains be used to move coal from Wales to London. By end of July 1940, Fighter Command had lost 145 aircraft in the &quot;Kanalkampf&quot;. Dowding had an influential patron in the form of Lord Beaverbrook, who became fond of him, all the more so because the civil servants of the Air Ministry disliked Dowding. On a more personal note, Beaverbrook&#x27;s son, Maxwell Aitken, was serving in Fighter Command and Beaverbrook decided that Dowding with his concern for the lives of his pilots was the best man to keep his son alive. 

British aircraft production continued at a brisk rate and it was the loss of pilots that was most concerning to Dowding. It took nearly a year to train a pilot to properly fly an aircraft, and the losses of pilots in the Battle of Britain imposed immense strain on Fighter Command, all the more so because the remaining pilots were forced to fly more to replace those killed or wounded. The majority of the 3,000 pilots under Dowding&#x27;s command, namely 80% were British, but the fighter squadrons sent from the Commonwealth along with squadrons of emigres from Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, and Belgium were greatly appreciated to help ease the strain imposed by Fighter Command&#x27;s losses. In early August 1940, Dowding learned via Ultra intelligence that the Luftwaffe was preparing for &quot;Adlertag&quot; (Eagle Day) set for 13 August 1940, which was intended to be a series of aerial attacks to win command of the sky. Eagle Day failed to achieve its stated goals as Fighter Command lost 34 planes in aerial combat while another 16 destroyed on the ground while shooting down 75 German planes. Eagle Day came to be known in the Luftwaffe as &quot;der schwarze Donnerstag&quot;&quot; (&quot;the black Thursday&quot;) owning to the heavy losses taken. During the fighting on Eagle Day, Dowding observed that the Luftwaffe bombers were no match for the Spitfires and Hurricanes, and that German bombers could only operate in the day with the escort of Bf-109 fighters. As the Bf-109 fighters could only fly over south-eastern England owing to their fuel ranges, it was possible to move RAF fighters to airfields out of range for the Bf-109s, which provided a respite of sorts for Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the grim irony that the more successful Fighter Command was at shooting down Luftwaffe bombers during the day, the more likely it was that the Luftwaffe would switch over to bombing by night, a course that Fighter Command was not prepared for. It was also during Eagle Day that Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the GOC of 12 Group, started to become increasing vocal in expressing criticism of Park for not adopting his favoured &quot;big wing&quot; tactics of forming up a large wing of fighters as Park much preferred to send in fighters in looser, informal small groups. Leigh-Mallory also started to attack Dowding for not imposing the &quot;big wing&quot; tactics upon all of Fighter Command. The requirement that not all of Fighter Command&#x27;s planes be on the ground being fuelled and armed led Dowding to commit small groups to attack the Luftwaffe bombers and their fighter escorts in waves. It was during the summer of 1940 that Dowding first learned of the &quot;Knickebein&quot; (literally &quot;dog-leg&quot;) radio beam system, which guided Luftwaffe bombers to their targets during the night. The British called the &quot;Knickebein&quot; radio guidance system &quot;headache&quot; and called their electronic jamming countermeasures &quot;aspirins&quot;. Owing to the threat posed by bombers guided by the &quot;Knickebein&quot; radio beams, Dowding ordered that electronic jamming of the radio beams be made a priority. 

By late August 1940, Dowding was seriously concerned about Fighter Command&#x27;s losses along with a decline in pilot quality as the RAF was forced to transfer pilots from Bomber Command and Coastal Command to Fighter Command and training was degraded to allow more pilots to graduate on a shortened training course. The great advantage for Fighter Command in August 1940 was that Dowding rotated his fighter squadrons to give his pilots a rest while the opposing German commanders, Albert Kesselring and Hugo Sperrle, did not. On 1 September 1940, Dowding realised that the losses taken during the fighting in July-August 1940 was such that there were no more squadrons to rotate into the area of 11 Group of Fighter Command, which always endured the most heavy fighting. That day, Dowding took what he called &quot;a desperate expedient&quot; of breaking the squadrons into A, B and C types. The A type squadrons stationed in 11 Group were to continue to defend south-eastern England; the B type squadrons in 10 and 12 Groups were to relieve the A squadrons and the C type squadrons stationed elsewhere were to serve as training units, feeding new pilots into the A squadrons as needed. On 3 September 1940, Dowding reported to Churchill that 25% of all Fighter Command&#x27;s pilots had been lost since the beginning of the Battle of Britain on top of the losses taken in France in the spring, and at current rate of losses Fighter Command would not be able to last much longer. Dowding also noted that about a quarter of his pilots were new pilots who had just graduated from the Operational Training Units who had less than two weeks&#x27; flying experience. Hermann Göring took personal charge of the Luftwaffe forces attacking Britain and on 7 September 1940 dispatched a huge force of 1,000 bombers to strike London. That day, Dowding was having a meeting with Park, when he learned via reports from radar operators of the bomber force heading towards London. During the fighting on 7 September, the &quot;Big Wing&quot; tactics favoured by Trafford Leigh-Mallory of 12 Group failed as it took too long to form up the &quot;big wing&quot; while Park&#x27;s tactics proved superior as 11 Group actually met the Luftwaffe. On 9 September 1940, Göring dispatched another huge bombing raid on London, which met with fierce resistance from 11 Group. Deighton wrote: &quot;Park&#x27;s handling of the fighting of 9 September was as brilliant as any in the war. Virtually none of the German bombers achieved hits on its primary target&quot;. 

Dowding received advance notice via Ultra intelligence of another large German raid scheduled for 15 September 1940. Park planned to attack the Luftwaffe both on its way to London and back, which forced his ground crews to work in record time to refuel and rearm his fighters as they landed after attacking the bombers on their way to London. The aerial battles on 15 September 1940 saw about 300 RAF fighters take on 400 Luftwaffe fighters. The Luftwaffe lost about 50 aircraft which convinced its commanders that Fighter Command possessed deeper reserves of pilots than what the RAF actually possessed. Churchill&#x27;s speech on the radio that evening claimed: &quot;Aided by Czech and Polish squadrons and using only a small proportion of their total strength, the Royal Air Force cut to rags and tatters separate waves of murderous assault upon the civil population of their native land&quot;. Fighter Command did not win command of the sky as the Luftwaffe continued to bomb Britain long after the battle of 15 September 1940, but the mere fact that Fighter Command had prevented the Luftwaffe from gaining command of the sky was sufficient to win the Battle of Britain. In an operational sense, Dowding had fought the Luftwaffe to a draw, but in strategical sense the battle was a British victory as the German invasion of Britain was strictly postulated on winning command of the sky first. On 17 September 1940, Hitler postponed Operation Sealion, the codename for the invasion of Britain, until &quot;further notice&quot;. 

Dowding was known for his humility and great sincerity. Fighter Command pilots came to characterise Dowding as one who cared for his men and had their best interests at heart. Dowding often referred to his &quot;dear fighter boys&quot; as his &quot;chicks&quot;: indeed his son Derek was one of them. Because of his brilliant detailed preparation of Britain&#x27;s air defences for the German assault, and his prudent management of his resources during the battle, Dowding is today generally given the credit for Britain&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Britain.

Dowding&#x27;s subsequent downfall has been attributed by some to his single-mindedness and perceived lack of diplomacy and political savoir faire in dealing with intra-RAF challenges and intrigues, most obviously the still, even now, hotly debated Big Wing controversy in which a number of senior and active service officers had argued in favour of large set-piece air battles with the Luftwaffe as an alternative to Dowding&#x27;s successful Fabian strategy. Another reason often cited for his removal, but characterised by some contemporary commentators more as a pretext, was the difficulty of countering German nighttime bombing raids on British cities. 

The account of radar pioneer, E. G. Bowen in &quot;Radar Days&quot; (1987) rebuts the claim that Dowding&#x27;s grasp of the problems of British night fighters was inadequate. He suggests that if Dowding had been left to follow his own path, the ultimately effective British response to night bombing (which depended completely on developments in air-borne radar) would have come somewhat sooner. 

Dowding himself showed that he had a good grasp of night fighter defence and was planning a defence system against night bombing in a letter he wrote some time after the Battle of Britain. However, there was great political and public pressure during the Blitz for something to be done, and Fighter Command&#x27;s existing resources without, as yet, airborne radar, proved woefully inadequate. A committee of enquiry chaired by Sir John Salmond produced a long list of recommendations to improve night air defence; when Dowding approved only some of them, his erstwhile supporters, Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill, decided that it was time for him to step down.

On 8 October 1940, Dowding was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. Before the war, the leadership of the RAF was committed to winning the next war via strategical bombing, and it was an article of faith amongst the senior Air Marshals that it would be impossible for fighter aircraft to stop a bombing offensive. Deighton wrote that the RAF leadership &quot;acted more vindictively&quot; against Dowding and Park for winning the Battle of Britain than Hermann Göring did with the defeated Luftwaffe generals largely because Dowding and Park had proven the Air Ministry wrong by defeating a strategical bombing offensive. Dowding and Park were summoned to meet what Beaverbrook called a gang of &quot;bloody Air Marshals&quot; who in a quasi-trial accused Dowding and Park of failure in the Battle of Britain. Both Trafford Leigh-Mallory and the fighter ace Douglas Bader argued at the meeting that the Big Wing tactics were superior to those practiced by Dowding and Park, who were effectively treated as if they had lost the Battle of Britain. 

Dowding unwillingly relinquished command on 24 November 1940 and was replaced by Big Wing advocate Sholto Douglas. Churchill tried to soften the blow by putting him in charge of the British Air Mission to the United States, responsible for the procurement of new aircraft types.

Publication of his book &quot;Twelve Legions of Angels&quot; was suppressed in November 1941. The British Government considered that it contained information which might be of use to the Germans. The book was finally published in 1946, soon after the war ended.

====Ministry of Aircraft Production====
After leaving Fighter Command, Dowding was sent on special duty to the United States for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but there he made himself unpopular with his outspokenness. On his return he headed a study into economies of RAF manpower before retiring from the Royal Air Force in July 1942. He was elevated to the peerage, as Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory on 2 June 1943.

==Later life==

Later in life, because of his belief that he was unjustly treated by the RAF, Dowding became increasingly bitter. The RAF passed him over for promotion to Marshal of the Royal Air Force.

He approved Robert Wright&#x27;s book &quot;Dowding and the Battle of Britain&quot;, which argued that a conspiracy of Big Wing proponents, including Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Douglas Bader, had engineered his sacking from Fighter Command.

In 1951, Dowding laid the foundation stone of the Chapel of St George at RAF Biggin Hill, now London Biggin Hill Airport, in memory of fallen airmen.

Dowding and his second wife Baroness Dowding were both anti-vivisectionists, and in 1973 Britain&#x27;s National Anti-Vivisection Society founded the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research in his honour.

===Spiritualism===
In his retirement, Dowding became actively interested in spiritualism, both as a writer and speaker. His first book on the subject, &quot;Many Mansions&quot;, was written in 1943, followed by &quot;Lychgate&quot; (1945), &quot;The Dark Star&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Magic&quot;. Rejecting conventional Christianity, he joined the Theosophical Society which advocated belief in reincarnation. He wrote of meeting dead &quot;RAF boys&quot; in his sleep – spirits who flew fighters from mountain-top runways made of light. Dowding became a vegetarian, based on his beliefs as a theosophist and spiritualist. Although he was a vegetarian, he believed that &quot;animals will be killed to satisfy human needs for many a long day to come&quot;, and he made several appeals in the House of Lords for the humane killing of animals intended for food. He was also a member of the Fairy Investigation Society. Although he knew that people considered him a crank for his belief in fairies, Dowding believed that fairies &quot;are essential to the growth of plants and the welfare of the vegetable kingdom&quot;.

==Death==
Dowding died at his home in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 15 February 1970. His body was cremated and his ashes were placed below the &quot;Battle of Britain Memorial Window&quot; in the Royal Air Force chapel in Westminster Abbey. Dowding&#x27;s son Derek (1919–1992) inherited the title of Baron Dowding.

==Personal life==
Dowding married Clarice Maud Vancourt, the daughter of an officer in the Indian Army, on 16 February 1918. She had one child from a previous marriage, Marjorie Brenda Williams (1911–2003) and they had one child together, Derek Hugh Tremenheere (1919–1992). Clarice died in 1920, and Dowding&#x27;s sister Hilda helped Dowding look after the two children.

Dowding married Muriel Whiting () on 25 September 1951; they had no children.

==Legacy==

In the 1940s and 1950s, H.D. wrote several novels, memoirs, and book-length poems about Dowding.

===Portrayals===
Dowding has been portrayed by:
* Charles Carson (1956) &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;
* Laurence Olivier (1969) &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;; Olivier had himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War. During filming in summer 1968, 86 years old and wheelchair-bound by severe arthritis, Dowding visited the set at Hawkinge airfield in Kent. Olivier told Dowding he had sat behind the latter&#x27;s desk all day &quot;pretending to be you&quot; and was &quot;making an awful mess of it too&quot;, to which Dowding replied, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m sure you are.&quot; The crew and Olivier broke into laughter. Footage of this can be seen in the special features section of the film&#x27;s Special Edition DVD.
* Adrian Rawlins (2017) &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;
* Nicholas Farrell (2018) &quot;Hurricane: 303 Squadron&quot; 

==Honours and tributes==
A statue of Dowding stands outside St Clement Danes church on the Strand, London. The inscription reads:

Other monuments to Dowding can be found in Station Park in Moffat, the town of his birth, and in Calverley Gardens in Tunbridge Wells where he died. The RAF Association in conjunction with the RAF Benevolent Fund, purchased his birthplace, the former St Ninian&#x27;s School, Moffat; the building was renamed Dowding House and restored to provide sheltered housing for former members of the Royal Air Force or their dependents.

The Dowding Centre at the School of Aerospace Battle Management (formerly the School of Fighter Control) at RAF Boulmer is named after Dowding.

A green ceramic commemorative plaque was unveiled at his former residence (1951–1967) in Darnley Drive, Southborough on 6 May 2012.

Dowding Place, Stanmore, the site of former RAF Stanmore Park is named after him.

The 1946-built Southern Railway Battle of Britain pacific (4-6-2) locomotive 21C152 was named &quot;Lord Dowding&quot; in his honour.

Callisto ( ), or Jupiter IV, is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede. In the Solar System it is the third-largest moon after Ganymede and Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan, and nearly as large as the smallest planet Mercury. Callisto is, with a diameter of , roughly a third larger than Earth&#x27;s Moon and orbits Jupiter on average at a distance of , which is about five times further out than the Moon orbiting Earth. It is the outermost of the four large Galilean moons of Jupiter, which were discovered in 1610 with one of the first telescopes, and is today visible from Earth with common binoculars.

The surface of Callisto is the oldest and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is completely covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (&quot;catenae&quot;) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.
Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ice, with a density of about , the lowest density and surface gravity of Jupiter&#x27;s major moons. Compounds detected spectroscopically on the surface include water ice, carbon dioxide, silicates and organic compounds. Investigation by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft revealed that Callisto may have a small silicate core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths greater than .

It is not in an orbital resonance like the three other Galilean satellites—Io, Europa and Ganymede—and is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto&#x27;s rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that it always faces the same direction, making Jupiter appear to hang directly overhead over its near-side. It is less affected by Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter&#x27;s main radiation belt. Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto&#x27;s gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100–150 km and a small, rocky core.

The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from &quot;Pioneers 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; to &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable to base possible future crewed missions on to study the Jovian system.

==History==

===Discovery===
Callisto was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei in 1610, along with the three other large Jovian moons—Ganymede, Io and Europa.

===Name===
Callisto, like all of Jupiter&#x27;s moons, is named after one of Zeus&#x27;s many lovers or other sexual partners in Greek mythology. Callisto was a nymph (or, according to some sources, the daughter of Lycaon) who was associated with the goddess of the hunt, Artemis. The name was suggested by Simon Marius soon after Callisto&#x27;s discovery. Marius attributed the suggestion to Johannes Kepler.

However, the names of the Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not revived in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Callisto is referred to by its Roman numeral designation, a system introduced by Galileo, as or as &quot;the fourth satellite of Jupiter&quot;.

There&#x27;s no established English adjectival form of the name. The adjectival form of Greek Καλλιστῴ &quot;Kallistōi&quot; is Καλλιστῴος &quot;Kallistōi-os&quot;, from which one might expect Latin &quot;Callistōius&quot; and English *Callistóian (with 5 syllables), parallel to Sapphóian (4 syllables) for &quot;Sapphōi&quot; and Letóian for &quot;Lētōi&quot;. However, the iota subscript is often omitted from such Greek names (cf. &quot;Inóan&quot; from &quot;Īnōi&quot; and &quot;Argóan&quot; from &quot;Argōi&quot;), and indeed the analogous form Callistoan is found.
In Virgil, a second oblique stem appears in Latin: &quot;Callistōn-,&quot; but the corresponding Callistonian has rarely appeared in English. One also sees &quot;ad hoc&quot; forms, such as Callistan, Callistian and Callistean.

==Orbit and rotation==
Callisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of approximately 1,880,000 km (26.3 times the 71,492 km radius of Jupiter itself). This is significantly larger than the orbital radius—1,070,000 km—of the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in mean-motion resonance—in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked—and probably never has. Callisto is expected to be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, completing the 1:2:4:8 chain.

Like most other regular planetary moons, Callisto&#x27;s rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto&#x27;s day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0072–0.0076 and 0.20–0.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.

The dynamical isolation of Callisto means that it has never been appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere at its surface is relatively low—about 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto&#x27;s surface. The radiation level at Callisto&#x27;s surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is just over ten times higher than Earth&#x27;s average background radiation, but less than in Low Earth Orbit or on Mars.

==Physical characteristics==

===Composition===
The average density of Callisto, 1.83 g/cm3, suggests a composition of approximately equal parts of rocky material and water ice, with some additional volatile ices such as ammonia. The mass fraction of ices is 49–55%. The exact composition of Callisto&#x27;s rock component is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 0.9–1.3 in Callisto, whereas the solar ratio is around 1:8.

Callisto&#x27;s surface has an albedo of about 20%. Its surface composition is thought to be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 25–50%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto&#x27;s surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.

The Callistoan surface is asymmetric: the leading hemisphere is darker than the trailing one. This is different from other Galilean satellites, where the reverse is true. The trailing hemisphere of Callisto appears to be enriched in carbon dioxide, whereas the leading hemisphere has more sulfur dioxide. Many fresh impact craters like Lofn also show enrichment in carbon dioxide. Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of carbonaceous material.

===Internal structure===

Callisto&#x27;s battered surface lies on top of a cold, stiff and icy lithosphere that is between 80 and 150 km thick. A salty ocean 150–200 km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter&#x27;s varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10 km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250–300 km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300 km.

Beneath the lithosphere and putative ocean, Callisto&#x27;s interior appears to be neither entirely uniform nor particularly variable. &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter data (especially the dimensionless moment of inertia—0.3549 ± 0.0042—determined during close flybys) suggest that, if Callisto is in hydrostatic equilibrium, its interior is composed of compressed rocks and ices, with the amount of rock increasing with depth due to partial settling of its constituents. In other words, Callisto may be only partially differentiated. The density and moment of inertia for an equilibrium Callisto are compatible with the existence of a small silicate core in the center of Callisto. The radius of any such core cannot exceed 600 km, and the density may lie between 3.1 and 3.6 g/cm3. In this case, Callisto&#x27;s interior would be in stark contrast to that of Ganymede, which appears to be fully differentiated.

However, a 2011 reanalysis of Galileo data suggests that Callisto is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. In that case, the gravity data may be more consistent with a more thoroughly differentiated Callisto with a hydrated silicate core.

===Surface features===

The ancient surface of Callisto is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System. In fact, the crater density is close to : any new crater will tend to erase an older one. The large-scale geology is relatively simple; on Callisto there are no large mountains, volcanoes or other endogenic tectonic features. The impact craters and multi-ring structures—together with associated fractures, scarps and deposits—are the only large features to be found on the surface.

Callisto&#x27;s surface can be divided into several geologically different parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains make up most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains make up a small fraction of Callisto&#x27;s surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution &quot;Galileo&quot; images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The &quot;Galileo&quot; images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000 km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.
Impact crater diameters seen range from 0.1 km—a limit defined by the imaging resolution—to over 100 km, not counting the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5 km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 5–40 km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25–100 km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60 km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very large—more than 100 km in diameter—and bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto&#x27;s craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.
The largest impact features on Callisto&#x27;s surface are multi-ring basins. Two are enormous. Valhalla is the largest, with a bright central region 600 km in diameter, and rings extending as far as 1,800 km from the center (see figure). The second largest is Asgard, measuring about 1,600 km in diameter. Multi-ring structures probably originated as a result of a post-impact concentric fracturing of the lithosphere lying on a layer of soft or liquid material, possibly an ocean. The catenae—for example Gomul Catena—are long chains of impact craters lined up in straight lines across the surface. They were probably created by objects that were tidally disrupted as they passed close to Jupiter prior to the impact on Callisto, or by very impacts. A historical example of a disruption was Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9.

As mentioned above, small patches of pure water ice with an albedo as high as 80% are found on the surface of Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution &quot;Galileo&quot; images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5 km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.
On a sub-kilometer scale the surface of Callisto is more degraded than the surfaces of other icy Galilean moons. Typically there is a deficit of small impact craters with diameters less than 1 km as compared with, for instance, the dark plains on Ganymede. Instead of small craters, the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits. The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as-yet uncertain process. The most likely candidate process is the slow sublimation of ice, which is enabled by a temperature of up to 165 K, reached at a subsolar point. Such sublimation of water or other volatiles from the dirty ice that is the bedrock causes its decomposition. The non-ice remnants form debris avalanches descending from the slopes of the crater walls. Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed &quot;debris aprons&quot;. Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley-like incisions called &quot;gullies&quot;, which resemble certain Martian surface features. In the ice sublimation hypothesis, the low-lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non-ice debris, which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock.

The relative ages of the different surface units on Callisto can be determined from the density of impact craters on them. The older the surface, the denser the crater population. Absolute dating has not been carried out, but based on theoretical considerations, the cratered plains are thought to be ~4.5 billion years old, dating back almost to the formation of the Solar System. The ages of multi-ring structures and impact craters depend on chosen background cratering rates and are estimated by different authors to vary between 1 and 4 billion years.

===Atmosphere and ionosphere===

Callisto has a very tenuous atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably oxygen. It was detected by the &quot;Galileo&quot; Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2 micrometers. The surface pressure is estimated to be 7.5 picobar (0.75 μPa) and particle density 4 cm−3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about four years &quot;(see atmospheric escape)&quot;, it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto&#x27;s icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.

Callisto&#x27;s ionosphere was first detected during &quot;Galileo&quot; flybys; its high electron density of 7–17 cm−3 cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone. Hence, it is suspected that the atmosphere of Callisto is actually dominated by molecular oxygen (in amounts 10–100 times greater than ). However, oxygen has not yet been directly detected in the atmosphere of Callisto. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) placed an upper limit on its possible concentration in the atmosphere, based on lack of detection, which is still compatible with the ionospheric measurements. At the same time, HST was able to detect condensed oxygen trapped on the surface of Callisto.

Atomic hydrogen has also been detected in Callisto&#x27;s atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen corona. The observed brightness from the scattered sunlight in Callisto&#x27;s hydrogen corona is approximately two times larger when the leading hemisphere is observed. This asymmetry may originate from a different hydrogen abundance in both the leading and trailing hemispheres. However, this hemispheric difference in Callisto&#x27;s hydrogen corona brightness is likely to originate from the extinction of the signal in Earth&#x27;s geocorona, which is greater when the trailing hemisphere is observed.

==Origin and evolution==
The partial differentiation of Callisto (inferred e.g. from moment of inertia measurements) means that it has never been heated enough to melt its ice component. Therefore, the most favorable model of its formation is a slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula—a disk of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation. Such a prolonged accretion stage would allow cooling to largely keep up with the heat accumulation caused by impacts, radioactive decay and contraction, thereby preventing melting and fast differentiation. The allowable timescale for the formation of Callisto lies then in the range 0.1 million–10 million years.
The further evolution of Callisto after accretion was determined by the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1 centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100 km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.

The current understanding of the evolution of Callisto allows for the existence of a layer or &quot;ocean&quot; of liquid water in its interior. This is connected with the anomalous behavior of ice I phase&#x27;s melting temperature, which decreases with pressure, achieving temperatures as low as 251 K at 2,070 bar (207 MPa). In all realistic models of Callisto the temperature in the layer between 100 and 200 km in depth is very close to, or exceeds slightly, this anomalous melting temperature. The presence of even small amounts of ammonia—about 1–2% by weight—almost guarantees the liquid&#x27;s existence because ammonia would lower the melting temperature even further.

Although Callisto is very similar in bulk properties to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface appears to have been shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.

==Habitability==
It is speculated that there could be life in Callisto&#x27;s subsurface ocean. Like Europa and Ganymede, as well as Saturn&#x27;s moons Enceladus, Dione and Titan and Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, a possible subsurface ocean might be composed of salt water.

It is possible that halophiles could thrive in the ocean.
As with Europa and Ganymede, the idea has been raised that habitable conditions and even extraterrestrial microbial life may exist in the salty ocean under the Callistoan surface. However, the environmental conditions necessary for life appear to be less favorable on Callisto than on Europa. The principal reasons are the lack of contact with rocky material and the lower heat flux from the interior of Callisto. Callisto&#x27;s ocean is heated only by radioactive decay, while Europa&#x27;s is also heated by tidal energy, as it is much closer to Jupiter. It is thought that of all of Jupiter&#x27;s moons, Europa has the greatest chance of supporting microbial life.

==Exploration==
===Past===
The &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; Jupiter encounters in the early 1970s contributed little new information about Callisto in comparison with what was already known from Earth-based observations. The real breakthrough happened later with the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flybys in 1979. They imaged more than half of the Callistoan surface with a resolution of 1–2 km, and precisely measured its temperature, mass and shape. A second round of exploration lasted from 1994 to 2003, when the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft had eight close encounters with Callisto, the last flyby during the C30 orbit in 2001 came as close as 138 km to the surface. The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter completed the global imaging of the surface and delivered a number of pictures with a resolution as high as 15 meters of selected areas of Callisto. In 2000, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft en route to Saturn acquired high-quality infrared spectra of the Galilean satellites including Callisto. In February–March 2007, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe on its way to Pluto obtained new images and spectra of Callisto.

===Future exploration===
Callisto will be visited by three spacecraft in the near future.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which launched on 14 April 2023, will perform 21 close flybys of Callisto between 2031 and 2034.

NASA&#x27;s Europa Clipper, which launched on 14 October 2024, will conduct nine close flybys of Callisto beginning in 2030.

China&#x27;s CNSA Tianwen-4 is planned to launch to Jupiter around 2030 before entering orbit around Callisto.

===Old proposals===
Formerly proposed for a launch in 2020, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter&#x27;s moons. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. At the time ESA&#x27;s contribution still faced funding competition from other ESA projects. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.

=== Potential crewed exploration and habitation ===

In 2003 NASA conducted a conceptual study called Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the outer Solar System. The target chosen to consider in detail was Callisto.

The study proposed a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further exploration of the Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading farther into the outer Solar System, using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.

In December 2003, NASA reported that a crewed mission to Callisto might be possible in the 2040s.

<text>Europa , or Jupiter II, is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 95 known moons of Jupiter. It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei and was named (by Marius) after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter).

Slightly smaller than Earth&#x27;s Moon, Europa is made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its geologically young white-beige surface is striated by light tan cracks and streaks, with very few impact craters. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. In September 2022, the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft flew within about 320 km (200 miles) of Europa for a more recent close-up view.

Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface is due to a water ocean beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life, although such life would most likely be that of single celled organisms and bacteria-like creatures. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor. This may be important in determining whether Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated analysis of data obtained from the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon. In March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.

The &quot;Galileo&quot; mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions. The European Space Agency&#x27;s Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Ganymede launched on 14 April 2023, that will include two flybys of Europa. NASA&#x27;s Europa Clipper was launched on 14 October 2024.
==Discovery and naming==
Europa, along with Jupiter&#x27;s three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was discovered by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. On 7 January, Galileo had observed Io and Europa together using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua, but the low resolution could not separate the two objects. The following night, he saw Io and Europa for the first time as separate bodies.

The moon is the namesake of Europa, in Greek mythology the daughter of the Phoenician king of Tyre. Like all the Galilean satellites, Europa is named after a lover of Zeus, the Greek counterpart of Jupiter. Europa was courted by Zeus and became the queen of Crete. The naming scheme was suggested by Simon Marius, who attributed the proposal to Johannes Kepler:

The names fell out of favor for a considerable time and were not revived in general use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Europa is simply referred to by its Roman numeral designation as &quot;&quot; (a system also introduced by Galileo) or as the &quot;second satellite of Jupiter&quot;. In 1892, the discovery of Amalthea, whose orbit lay closer to Jupiter than those of the Galilean moons, pushed Europa to the third position. The &quot;Voyager&quot; probes discovered three more inner satellites in 1979, so Europa is now counted as Jupiter&#x27;s sixth satellite, though it is still referred to as .
The adjectival form has stabilized as &quot;Europan&quot;.

== Orbit and rotation ==
Europa orbits Jupiter in roughly 3.55 days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900 km. With an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter&#x27;s equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa&#x27;s surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa&#x27;s prime meridian is a line passing through this point. Research suggests that tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.

The slight eccentricity of Europa&#x27;s orbit, maintained by gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa&#x27;s sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate towards and away from it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa&#x27;s interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter&#x27;s rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.

Analysis of the unique cracks lining Europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa&#x27;s features. Europa&#x27;s immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa&#x27;s tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa&#x27;s axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect estimates of the age of Europa&#x27;s ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa&#x27;s ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.

==Physical characteristics==

Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth&#x27;s moon. At just over in diameter, it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the Solar System. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Its bulk density suggests that it is similar in composition to terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of silicate rock.

===Internal structure===
It is estimated that Europa has an outer layer of water around thick – a part frozen as its crust and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice. Recent magnetic-field data from the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter showed that Europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with Jupiter&#x27;s, which suggests the presence of a subsurface conductive layer. This layer is likely to be a salty liquid-water ocean. Portions of the crust are estimated to have undergone a rotation of nearly 80°, nearly flipping over (see true polar wander), which would be unlikely if the ice were solidly attached to the mantle. Europa probably contains a metallic iron core.

===Surface features===

Europa is the smoothest known object in the Solar System, lacking large-scale features such as mountains and craters. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to be mainly albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Its icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, one of the highest of any moon. This indicates a young and active surface: based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. There is no scientific consensus about the explanation for Europa&#x27;s surface features.

It has been postulated Europa&#x27;s equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to 15 meters high. Their formation is due to direct overhead sunlight near the equator causing the ice to sublime, forming vertical cracks. Although the imaging available from the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter does not have the resolution for confirmation, radar and thermal data are consistent with this speculation.

The ionizing radiation level at Europa&#x27;s surface is equivalent to a daily dose of about 5.4 Sv (540 rem), an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single Earth day (24 hours). A Europan day is about 3.5 times as long as an Earth day.

==== Lineae ====
Europa&#x27;s most striking surface features are a series of dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe, called lineae (). Close examination shows that the edges of Europa&#x27;s crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other. The larger bands are more than across, often with dark, diffuse outer edges, regular striations, and a central band of lighter material.

The most likely hypothesis is that the lineae on Europa were produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as Europa&#x27;s crust slowly spreads open to expose warmer layers beneath. The effect would have been similar to that seen on Earth&#x27;s oceanic ridges. These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal flexing exerted by Jupiter. Because Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, and therefore always maintains approximately the same orientation towards Jupiter, the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa&#x27;s fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This could be explained if Europa&#x27;s surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa&#x27;s surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter&#x27;s gravity tugging on Europa&#x27;s outer ice crust. Comparisons of &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage. A full revolution of the outer rigid shell relative to the interior of Europa takes at least 12,000 years. Studies of &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; images have revealed evidence of subduction on Europa&#x27;s surface, suggesting that, just as the cracks are analogous to ocean ridges, so plates of icy crust analogous to tectonic plates on Earth are recycled into the molten interior. This evidence of both crustal spreading at bands and convergence at other sites suggests that Europa may have active plate tectonics, similar to Earth. However, the physics driving these plate tectonics are not likely to resemble those driving terrestrial plate tectonics, as the forces resisting potential Earth-like plate motions in Europa&#x27;s crust are significantly stronger than the forces that could drive them.

==== Chaos and lenticulae ====

Other features present on Europa are circular and elliptical (Latin for &quot;freckles&quot;). Many are domes, some are pits and some are smooth, dark spots. Others have a jumbled or rough texture. The dome tops look like pieces of the older plains around them, suggesting that the domes formed when the plains were pushed up from below.

One hypothesis states that these lenticulae were formed by diapirs of warm ice rising up through the colder ice of the outer crust, much like magma chambers in Earth&#x27;s crust. The smooth, dark spots could be formed by meltwater released when the warm ice breaks through the surface. The rough, jumbled lenticulae (called regions of &quot;chaos&quot;; for example, Conamara Chaos) would then be formed from many small fragments of crust, embedded in hummocky, dark material, appearing like icebergs in a frozen sea.

An alternative hypothesis suggests that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos and that the claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from the over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. The implication is that the ice is too thin to support the convective diapir model of feature formation.

In November 2011, a team of researchers, including researchers at University of Texas at Austin, presented evidence suggesting that many &quot;chaos terrain&quot; features on Europa sit atop vast lakes of liquid water. These lakes would be entirely encased in Europa&#x27;s icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. Full confirmation of the lakes&#x27; existence will require a space mission designed to probe the ice shell either physically or indirectly, e.g. using radar. Chaos features may also be a result of increased melting of the ice shell and deposition of marine ice at low latitudes as a result of heterogeneous heating.

Work published by researchers from Williams College suggests that chaos terrain may represent sites where impacting comets penetrated through the ice crust and into an underlying ocean.

=== Subsurface ocean ===

The scientific consensus is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath Europa&#x27;s surface, and that heat from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid. Europa&#x27;s surface temperature averages about at the equator and only at the poles, keeping Europa&#x27;s icy crust as hard as granite. The first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating (a consequence of Europa&#x27;s slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other Galilean moons). &quot;Galileo&quot; imaging team members argue for the existence of a subsurface ocean from analysis of &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; images. The most dramatic example is &quot;chaos terrain&quot;, a common feature on Europa&#x27;s surface that some interpret as a region where the subsurface ocean has melted through the icy crust. This interpretation is controversial. Most geologists who have studied Europa favor what is commonly called the &quot;thick ice&quot; model, in which the ocean has rarely, if ever, directly interacted with the present surface. The best evidence for the thick-ice model is a study of Europa&#x27;s large craters. The largest impact structures are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat, fresh ice; based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by Europan tides, it is estimated that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately thick, including a ductile &quot;warm ice&quot; layer, which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be about deep. This leads to a volume of Europa&#x27;s oceans of 3×1018m3, between two or three times the volume of Earth&#x27;s oceans.

The thin-ice model suggests that Europa&#x27;s ice shell may be only a few kilometers thick. However, most planetary scientists conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of Europa&#x27;s crust that behave elastically when affected by Jupiter&#x27;s tides. One example is flexure analysis, in which Europa&#x27;s crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load. Models such as this suggest the outer elastic portion of the ice crust could be as thin as . If the ice shell of Europa is really only a few kilometers thick, this &quot;thin ice&quot; model would mean that regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface could occur through open ridges, causing the formation of areas of chaotic terrain. Large impacts going fully through the ice crust would also be a way that the subsurface ocean could be exposed.

====Composition====

The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter found that Europa has a weak magnetic moment, which is induced by the varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede&#x27;s field and six times the value of Callisto&#x27;s. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa&#x27;s interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.

Since the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft flew past Europa in 1979, scientists have worked to understand the composition of the reddish-brown material that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on Europa&#x27;s surface. Spectrographic evidence suggests that the darker, reddish streaks and features on Europa&#x27;s surface may be rich in salts such as magnesium sulfate, deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within. Sulfuric acid hydrate is another possible explanation for the contaminant observed spectroscopically. In either case, because these materials are colorless or white when pure, some other material must also be present to account for the reddish color, and sulfur compounds are suspected.
Another hypothesis for the colored regions is that they are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa&#x27;s impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa, there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring important astrobiological implications, as they may play a role in prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis.

The presence of sodium chloride in the internal ocean has been suggested by a 450 nm absorption feature, characteristic of irradiated NaCl crystals, that has been spotted in HST observations of the chaos regions, presumed to be areas of recent subsurface upwelling. The subterranean ocean of Europa contains carbon and was observed on the surface ice as a concentration of carbon dioxide within Tara Regio, a geologically recently resurfaced terrain.
====Sources of heat====

Europa receives thermal energy from tidal heating, which occurs through the tidal friction and tidal flexing processes caused by tidal acceleration: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the core of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.

=====Tidal friction=====
Ocean tides are converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa&#x27;s oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger than that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa&#x27;s ocean.

=====Tidal flexing=====
Tidal flexing kneads Europa&#x27;s interior and ice shell, which becomes a source of heat. Depending on the amount of tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa&#x27;s rocky core in response to the gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa&#x27;s seafloor could be heated by the moon&#x27;s constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth&#x27;s oceans.

Experiments and ice modeling published in 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one order of magnitude more heat in Europa&#x27;s ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicate that most of the heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice&#x27;s crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.

=====Radioactive decay=====
In addition to tidal heating, the interior of Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has a leading role in Europa.

==== Plumes ====

The Hubble Space Telescope acquired an image of Europa in 2012 that was interpreted to be a plume of water vapour erupting from near its south pole. The image suggests the plume may be high, or more than 20 times the height of Mt. Everest., though recent observations and modeling suggest that typical Europan plumes may be much smaller. It has been suggested that if plumes exist, they are episodic and likely to appear when Europa is at its farthest point from Jupiter, in agreement with tidal force modeling predictions. Additional imaging evidence from the Hubble Space Telescope was presented in September 2016.

In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe, which orbited Jupiter between 1995 and 2003. &quot;Galileo&quot; flew by Europa in 1997 within of the moon&#x27;s surface and the researchers suggest it may have flown through a water plume. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon.

The tidal forces are about 1,000 times stronger than the Moon&#x27;s effect on Earth. The only other moon in the Solar System exhibiting water vapor plumes is Enceladus. The estimated eruption rate at Europa is about 7000 kg/s compared to about 200 kg/s for the plumes of Enceladus. If confirmed, it would open the possibility of a flyby through the plume and obtain a sample to analyze &quot;in situ&quot; without having to use a lander and drill through kilometres of ice.

In November 2020, a study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; suggesting that the plumes may originate from water within the crust of Europa as opposed to its subsurface ocean. The study&#x27;s model, using images from the Galileo space probe, proposed that a combination of freezing and pressurization may result in at least some of the cryovolcanic activity. The pressure generated by migrating briny water pockets would thus, eventually, burst through the crust, thereby creating these plumes. The hypothesis that cryovolcanism on Europa could be triggered by freezing and pressurization of liquid pockets in the icy crust was first proposed by Sarah Fagents at the University of Hawai&#x27;i at Mānoa, who in 2003, was the first to model and publish work on this process. A press release from NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory referencing the November 2020 study suggested that plumes sourced from migrating liquid pockets could potentially be less hospitable to life. This is due to a lack of substantial energy for organisms to thrive off, unlike proposed hydrothermal vents on the subsurface ocean floor.

=== Atmosphere ===

The atmosphere of Europa can be categorized as thin and tenuous (often called an exosphere), primarily composed of oxygen and trace amounts of water vapor. However, this quantity of oxygen is produced in a non-biological manner. Given that Europa&#x27;s surface is icy, and subsequently very cold; as solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles (ions and electrons) from the Jovian magnetospheric environment collide with Europa&#x27;s surface, water vapor is created and instantaneously separated into oxygen and hydrogen constituents. As it continues to move, the hydrogen is light enough to pass through the surface gravity of the atmosphere leaving behind only oxygen. The surface-bounded atmosphere forms through radiolysis, the dissociation of molecules through radiation. This accumulated oxygen atmosphere can get to a height of above the surface of Europa. Molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere because it has a long lifetime; after returning to the surface, it does not stick (freeze) like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather desorbs from the surface and starts another ballistic arc. Molecular hydrogen never reaches the surface, as it is light enough to escape Europa&#x27;s surface gravity. Europa is one of the few moons in our solar system with a quantifiable atmosphere, along with Titan, Io, Triton, Ganymede and Callisto. Europa is also one of several moons in our solar system with very large quantities of ice (volatiles), otherwise known as &quot;icy moons&quot;.Europa is also considered to be geologically active due to the constant release of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures into space. As a result of the moon&#x27;s particle venting, the atmosphere requires continuous replenishment. Europa also contains a small magnetosphere (approximately 25% of Ganymede&#x27;s). However, this magnetosphere varies in size as Europa orbits through Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field. This confirms that a conductive element, such as a large ocean, likely lies below its icy surface. As multiple studies have been conducted over Europa&#x27;s atmosphere, several findings conclude that not all oxygen molecules are released into the atmosphere. This unknown percentage of oxygen may be absorbed into the surface and sink into the subsurface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa&#x27;s surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.

Through the slow release of oxygen and hydrogen, a neutral torus around Europa&#x27;s orbital plane is formed. This &quot;neutral cloud&quot; has been detected by both the &quot;Cassini&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, and has a greater content (number of atoms and molecules) than the neutral cloud surrounding Jupiter&#x27;s inner moon Io. This torus was officially confirmed using Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imaging. Europa&#x27;s torus ionizes through the process of neutral particles exchanging electrons with its charged particles. Since Europa&#x27;s magnetic field rotates faster than its orbital velocity, these ions are left in the path of its magnetic field trajectory, forming a plasma. It has been hypothesized that these ions are responsible for the plasma within Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere.

On 4 March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.

==== Discovery of atmosphere ====
The atmosphere of Europa was first discovered in 1995 by astronomers D. T. Hall and collaborators using the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope. This observation was further supported in 1997 by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter during its mission within the Jovian system. The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter performed three radio occultation events of Europa, where the probe&#x27;s radio contact with Earth was temporarily blocked by passing behind Europa. By analyzing the effects Europa&#x27;s sparse atmosphere had on the radio signal just before and after the occultation, for a total of six events, a team of astronomers led by A. J. Kliore established the presence of an ionized layer in Europa&#x27;s atmosphere.

==== Climate and weather ====
Despite the presence of a gas torus, Europa has no weather producing clouds. As a whole, Europa has no wind, precipitation, or presence of sky color as its gravity is too low to hold an atmosphere substantial enough for those features. Europa&#x27;s gravity is approximately 13% of Earth&#x27;s. The temperature on Europa varies from −160 °C at the equator, to −220 °C at either of its poles. Europa&#x27;s subsurface ocean is thought to be significantly warmer however. It is hypothesized that because of radioactive and tidal heating (as mentioned in the sections above), there are points in the depths of Europa&#x27;s ocean that may be only slightly cooler than Earth&#x27;s oceans. Studies have also concluded that Europa&#x27;s ocean would have been rather acidic at first, with large concentrations of sulfate, calcium, and carbon dioxide. But over the course of 4.5 billion years, it became full of chloride, thus resembling our 1.94% chloride oceans on Earth.

== Exploration ==
Exploration of Europa began with the Jupiter flybys of &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; in 1973 and 1974, respectively. The first closeup photos were of low resolution compared to later missions. The two Voyager probes traveled through the Jovian system in 1979, providing more-detailed images of Europa&#x27;s icy surface. The images caused many scientists to speculate about the possibility of a liquid ocean underneath. 
Starting in 1995, the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe orbited Jupiter for eight years, until 2003, and provided the most detailed examination of the Galilean moons to date. It included the &quot;Galileo Europa Mission&quot; and &quot;Galileo Millennium Mission&quot;, with numerous close flybys of Europa. In 2007, &quot;New Horizons&quot; imaged Europa, as it flew by the Jovian system while on its way to Pluto. In 2022, the &quot;Juno&quot; orbiter flew by Europa at a distance of 352 km (219 mi).

In 2012, &quot;Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer&quot; (JUICE) was selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as a planned mission. That mission includes two flybys of Europa, but is more focused on Ganymede. It was launched in 2023, and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after four gravity assists and eight years of travel.

In 2011, a Europa mission was recommended by the U.S. Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In response, NASA commissioned concept studies of a Europa lander in 2011, along with concepts for a Europa flyby (&quot;Europa Clipper&quot;), and a Europa orbiter. The orbiter element option concentrates on the &quot;ocean&quot; science, while the multiple-flyby element (&quot;Clipper&quot;) concentrates on the chemistry and energy science. On 13 January 2014, the House Appropriations Committee announced a new bipartisan bill that includes $80 million in funding to continue the Europa mission concept studies.

In July 2013 an updated concept for a flyby Europa mission called &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; was presented by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; mission, and revealed the instruments it would use. The aim of &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid in selecting sites for a future lander. The &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer. The mission was launched on 14 October 2024 aboard a Falcon Heavy.

=== Future missions ===

Conjectures regarding extraterrestrial life have ensured a high profile for Europa and have led to steady lobbying for future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa&#x27;s chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around Jupiter. Because it is deeply embedded within Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.

* Europa Lander is a recent NASA concept mission under study. 2018 research suggests Europa may be covered in tall, jagged ice spikes, presenting a problem for any potential landing on its surface.

=== Old proposals ===

In the early 2000s, &quot;Jupiter Europa Orbiter&quot; led by NASA and the &quot;Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter&quot; led by the ESA were proposed together as an Outer Planet Flagship Mission to Jupiter&#x27;s icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over &quot;Titan Saturn System Mission&quot;. At that time, there was competition from other proposals. Japan proposed &quot;Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter&quot;.

&quot;Jovian Europa Orbiter&quot; was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept study from 2007. Another concept was &quot;Ice Clipper&quot;, which would have used an impactor similar to the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission—it would make a controlled crash into the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.

&quot;Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter&quot; (JIMO) was a partially developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It was part of Project Prometheus. The &quot;Europa Lander Mission&quot; proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa lander for JIMO. It would travel with the orbiter, which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.

&quot;Europa Orbiter&quot; – Its objective would be to characterize the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The &quot;Europa Orbiter&quot; received the go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.

More ambitious ideas have been put forward including an impactor in combination with a thermal drill to search for biosignatures that might be frozen in the shallow subsurface.

Another proposal put forward in 2001 calls for a large nuclear-powered &quot;melt probe&quot; (cryobot) that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below. Once it reached the water, it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle (hydrobot) that would gather information and send it back to Earth. Both the cryobot and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of Earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of the subsurface ocean. This suggested approach has not yet reached a formal conceptual planning stage.

==Habitability==
So far, there is no evidence that life exists on Europa, but the moon has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth&#x27;s deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa&#x27;s rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.

The energy provided by tidal forces drives active geological processes within Europa&#x27;s interior, just as they do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa&#x27;s ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth&#x27;s polar regions, or float freely in Europa&#x27;s ocean. Should Europa&#x27;s oceans be too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not occur; too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa&#x27;s surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported by tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa&#x27;s ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.

Evidence suggests the existence of lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa&#x27;s icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell, as well as pockets of water that form M-shaped ice ridges when the water freezes on the surface – as in Greenland. If confirmed, the lakes and pockets of water could be yet another potential habitat for life. Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide is abundant across much of the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms. Nonetheless, on 4 March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.

Clay-like minerals (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet. Some scientists have speculated that life on Earth could have been blasted into space by asteroid collisions and arrived on the moons of Jupiter in a process called lithopanspermia.

<text>The Sipuncula or Sipunculida (common names sipunculid worms or peanut worms) is a class containing about 162 species of unsegmented marine annelid worms. Sipuncula was once considered a phylum, but was demoted to a class of Annelida, based on recent molecular work.

Sipunculans vary in size but most species are under in length. The body is divided into an unsegmented, bulbous trunk and a narrower, anterior section, called the &quot;introvert&quot;, which can be retracted into the trunk. The mouth is at the tip of the introvert and is surrounded in most groups by a ring of short tentacles. With no hard parts, the body is flexible and mobile. Although found in a range of habitats throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, the majority of species live in shallow water habitats, burrowing under the surface of sandy and muddy substrates. Others live under stones, in rock crevices or in other concealed locations.

Most sipunculans are deposit feeders, extending the introvert to gather food particles and draw them into the mouth, and retracting the introvert when feeding conditions are unsuitable or danger threatens. With a few exceptions, reproduction is sexual and involves a planktonic larval stage. Sipunculid worms are used as food in some countries in south-east Asia.
==Taxonomy==

 is a feminine variant of the now-obsolete genus name , itself a variant of the Latin (&quot;little tube&quot;), a diminutive of from Greek (&quot;síphōn&quot;, &quot;tube, pipe&quot;).

The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described the worm in his in 1767. In 1814, the French zoologist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque used the word &quot;Sipuncula&quot; to describe the family (now Sipunculidae), and in time, the term came to be used for the whole class. This is a relatively understudied group, and it is estimated there may be around 162 species worldwide.

The phylogenetic placement of this group in the past has proved troublesome. Originally classified as annelids, despite the complete lack of segmentation, bristles and other annelid characters, the phylum Sipuncula was later allied with the Mollusca, mostly on the basis of developmental and larval characters. These phyla have been included in a larger group, the Lophotrochozoa, that also includes the annelids, the ribbon worms and several other phyla. Phylogenetic analyses based on 79 ribosomal proteins indicated a position of Sipuncula within Annelida. Subsequent analysis of the mitochondrion&#x27;s DNA has confirmed their close relationship to the Annelida (including echiurans and pogonophorans). It has also been shown that a rudimentary neural segmentation similar to that of annelids occurs in the early larval stage, even if these traits are absent in the adults.

==Anatomy==

Sipunculans are worms ranging from in length, with most species being under . The sipunculan body is divided into an unsegmented, bulbous trunk and a narrower, anterior section, called the &quot;introvert&quot;. Sipunculans have a body wall somewhat similar to that of most other annelids (though unsegmented) in that it consists of an epidermis without cilia overlain by a cuticle, an outer layer of circular and an inner layer of longitudinal musculature. The body wall surrounds the coelom (body cavity) that is filled with fluid on which the body wall musculature acts as a hydrostatic skeleton to extend or contract the animal. When threatened, Sipunculid worms can contract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel—a practice that has given rise to the name &quot;peanut worm&quot;. The introvert is pulled inside the trunk by two pairs of retractor muscles that extend as narrow ribbons from the trunk wall to attachment points in the introvert. It can be protruded from the trunk by contracting the muscles of the trunk wall, thus forcing the fluid in the body cavity forwards. The introvert can vary in size from half the length of the trunk to several times its length, but whatever their comparative sizes, it is fully retractable.

The mouth is located at the anterior end of the animal; in the subclass Sipunculidea, the mouth is surrounded by a mass of 18 to 24 ciliated tentacles, while in the subclass Phascolosomatidea, the tentacles are arranged in an arc above the mouth, surrounding the nuchal organ, also located at the tip of the introvert. The tentacles each have a deep groove along which food is moved to the mouth by cilia. They are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and probably also function as gills. In the family Themistidae the tentacles form an elaborate crown-like structure, the members of this group being specialized filter feeders, unlike the other groups of sipunculans which are deposit feeders. The tentacles are hollow and are extended via hydrostatic pressure in a similar manner as the introvert, but have a different mechanism from that of the rest of the introvert, being connected, via a system of ducts, to one or two contractile sacs next to the oesophagus. Hooks are often present near the mouth on the introvert. These are proteinaceous, non-chitinous specializations of the epidermis, either arranged in rings or scattered. They may be involved in scraping algae off rock, or alternatively provide anchorage.

Three genera (&quot;Aspidosiphon&quot;, &quot;Lithacrosiphon&quot; and &quot;Cloeosiphon&quot;) in the Aspidosiphonidae family possess epidermal structures, known as anal and caudal shields. These are patches of thickened, hard plates, and are used for boring into rock; the anal shield is near the anteriorly-located anus on the trunk, just below the introvert of the animal, while the caudal shield is at the posterior of the body. In &quot;Aspidosiphon&quot; and &quot;Lithacrosiphon&quot; the anal shield is restricted to the dorsal side, causing the introvert to emerge at an angle, whereas it surrounds the anterior trunk in &quot;Cloeosiphon&quot; with the introvert emerging from its center. In &quot;Aspidosiphon&quot; the shield is a hardened, horny structure; in &quot;Lithacrosiphon&quot; it is a calcareous cone; in &quot;Cloeosiphon&quot; it is composed of separate plates. When the introvert is retracted in these animals, the anal shield blocks the entrance to its burrow. At the posterior end of the trunk, a hardened caudal shield is sometimes present in &quot;Aspidosiphon&quot;; this may help with anchoring the animal in its burrow or may be used in the boring process.

===Digestive system===
The digestive tract of sipunculans starts with the esophagus, located between the introvert retractor muscles. In the trunk the intestine runs posteriorly, forms a loop and turns anteriorly again. The downward and upward sections of the gut are coiled around each other, forming a double helix. At the termination of the gut coil, the rectum emerges and ends in the anus, located in the anterior third of the trunk. Digestion is extra-cellular, taking place in the lumen of the intestine. A rectal caecum, present in most species, is a blind ending sac at the transition between intestine and rectum with unknown function. The anus is often not visible when the introvert is retracted into the trunk.

===Circulation===
Sipunculans do not have a vascular blood system. Fluid transport and gas exchange are instead accomplished by the coelom, which contains the respiratory pigment haemerythrin, and the separate tentacular system, the two being separated by an elaborate septum. The coelomic fluid contains five types of coelomic cells: haemocytes, granulocytes, large multinuclear cells, ciliated urn-shaped cells and immature cells. The ciliated urn cells may also be attached to the peritoneum and assist in waste filtering from the coelomic fluid. Nitrogenous waste is excreted through a pair of metanephridia opening close to the anus, except in &quot;Phascolion&quot; and &quot;Onchnesoma&quot;, which have only a single nephridium. A ciliated funnel, or nephrostome, opens into the coelomic cavity at the anterior end, close to the nephridiopore. The metanephridia have an osmoregulation function but it is unclear whether the mechanism is via filtration or secretion. They also serve as gamete storage and maintenance organs.

The tentacular coelom connects the tentacles at the tip of the introvert to a ring canal at their base, from which a contractile vessel runs along beside the esophagus and ends blindly posteriorly. Some evidence points towards the involvement of these structures in ultrafiltration. In crevice-dwelling sipunculans, respiration is mainly through the tentacular system, with oxygen diffusing into the trunk coelom from the tentacular coelom. However, in other species the skin is thin and respiration is mainly through the cuticle of the trunk, where oxygen uptake is assisted by the presence of dermal coelomic canals just beneath the epidermis.

===Nervous system===

The nervous system consists of dorsal cerebral ganglion, brain above the oesophagus and a nerve ring around the oesophagus, which links the brain with the single ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body. Lateral nerves lead off this to innervate the muscles of the body wall.

In some species, there are simple light-sensitive ocelli associated with the brain. Two organs, likely functioning as a unit for chemoreception are located near its anterior margin; the non-ciliated cerebral organ, which possesses bipolar sensory cells, and the nuchal organ, located posterior to the brain. Similar light-sensing tubes have been reported in the fauveliopsid annelids. In addition, all sipunculans have numerous sensory nerve endings on the body wall, especially at the forward end of the introvert which is used for exploring the surrounding environment.

==Distribution and habitat==

All sipunculid worms are marine and benthic; they are found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans including polar waters, equatorial waters and the abyssal zone, but the majority of species occur in shallow water, where they are relatively common. They inhabit a range of habitats including burrowing in sand, mud, clay and gravel, hiding under stones, in rock crevices, in hollow coral heads, in wood, in empty seashells and inside the bones of dead whales. Some hide in kelp holdfasts, under tangles of eelgrass, inside sponges and in the empty tubes of other organisms, and some live among fouling organisms on man-made structures. Some bore into solid rocks to make a shelter for themselves.

They are common below the surface of the sediment on tidal flats. These worms may stay submerged in the sea bed for between 10 and 18 hours a day. They are sensitive to low salinities, and thus not commonly found near estuaries. They can also be abundant in coralline rock, and in Hawaii, up to seven hundred individuals have been found per square metre in burrows in the rock.

==Reproduction==
Both asexual and sexual reproduction can be found in sipunculans, although asexual reproduction is uncommon and has only been observed in &quot;Aspidosiphon elegans&quot; and &quot;Sipunculus robustus&quot;. These reproduce asexually through transverse fission, followed by regeneration of vital body components, with &quot;S. robustus&quot; also reproducing by budding. One species of sipunculan, &quot;Themiste lageniformis&quot;, has been recorded as reproducing parthenogenetically; eggs produced in the absence of sperm developed through the normal stages.

Most sipunculan species are dioecious. Their gametes are produced in the coelomic lining, where they are released into the coelom to mature. These gametes are then picked up by the metanephridia system and released into the aquatic environment, where fertilisation takes place. In at least one species, &quot;Themiste pyroides&quot;, swarming behaviour occurs with adults creating compact masses among rocks immediately before spawning.

Although some species hatch directly into the adult form, many have a trochophore larva, which metamorphoses into the adult after anything from a day to a month, depending on species. In a few species, the trochophore does not develop directly into the adult, but into an intermediate &quot;pelagosphaera&quot; stage, that possesses a greatly enlarged metatroch (ciliated band). Metamorphosis occurs only in the presence of suitable habitat conditions, and is triggered by the presence of adults.

==Behaviour==
Most sipunculans are deposit feeders employing a number of different methods to obtain their foods. Those living in burrows extend their tentacles over the surface of the sediment. Food particles get trapped in mucous secretions and the beating of cilia transport the particles to the mouth. Among those that burrow through the sand, the tentacles are replaced by fluted folds which scoop up sediment and food particles. Most of this material is swallowed but larger particles are discarded. Species dwelling in crevices are able to withdraw their introverts, blocking the crevice entrance with their thickened trunks and presumably ingesting any food they have snared at the same time. One species, &quot;Thysanocardia procera&quot; is thought to be carnivorous, gaining entrance in some way to the interior of the sea mouse &quot;Aphrodita aculeata&quot; and sucking out its liquefied contents.

==Fossil record==
Because of their soft-bodied structure, fossils of sipunculans are extremely rare, and are only known from a few genera. &quot;Archaeogolfingia&quot; and &quot;Cambrosipunculus&quot; appear in the Cambrian Chengjiang biota in China. These fossils appear to belong to the crown group, and demonstrate that sipunculans have changed little (morphologically) since the early Cambrian, about 520 million years ago.

An unnamed sipunculid worm from the Cambrian period has been discovered in the Burgess Shale in Alberta, Canada, and &quot;Lecthaylus&quot; has been identified from the Granton Shrimp Bed, near Edinburgh, Scotland, dating to the Silurian period. Trace fossils of burrows that may have been formed by sipunculans have been found from the Paleozoic.

Some scientists once hypothesized a close relationship between sipunculans and the extinct hyoliths, operculate shells from the Palaeozoic with which they share a helical gut; but this hypothesis has since been discounted.

== As food ==
Sipunculid worm jelly (土笋凍) is a delicacy in southeast China, originally from Anhai, near Quanzhou. A sipunculid worm dish is also considered a delicacy in the islands of the Visayas region, Philippines. The muscle is first prepared by soaking it in spiced vinegar and then served with other ingredients as a dish similar to ceviche. It is a basic food for local fisherman and is sometimes seen in city restaurants as an appetizer. This style of food preparation is locally called kilawin or kinilaw, and is also used for fish, conch and vegetables.

The worms, especially in dried form, are considered a delicacy in Vietnam as well, where they are caught on the coasts of Minh Chao island, in Van Don District. The relatively high market price of the worms have made them a significant source of income for the local population of fishermen families.

<doc id="43138" wikidata="Q809618" url="?curid=43138" title="Siboglinidae">
<text>Siboglinidae is a family of polychaete annelid worms whose members made up the former phyla Pogonophora and Vestimentifera (the giant tube worms). The family is composed of around 100 species of vermiform creatures which live in thin tubes buried in sediment (Pogonophora) or in tubes attached to hard substratum (Vestimentifera) at ocean depths ranging from . They can also be found in association with hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, sunken plant material, and whale carcasses.

The first specimen was dredged from the waters of Indonesia in 1900. These specimens were given to French zoologist Maurice Caullery, who studied them for nearly 50 years.

==Anatomy==
Most siboglinids are less than in diameter, but in length. They inhabit tubular structures composed of chitin which are fixed to rocks or substrates. The tubes are often clustered together in large colonies.

Their bodies are divided into four regions. The anterior end is called the cephalic lobe, which ranges from one to over 200 thin branchial ciliated tentacles, each with tiny side branches known as pinnules. Behind this is a glandular forepart, which helps to secrete the tube. The main part of the body is the trunk, which is greatly elongated and bears various annuli, papillae, and ciliary tracts. Posterior to the trunk is the short metamerically segmented opisthosoma, bearing external paired chaetae, which help to anchor the animal to the base of its tube.

The body cavity has a separate compartment in each of the first three regions of the body and extends into the tentacles. The opisthosoma has a coelomic chamber in each of its 5 to 23 segments, separated by septa. The worms have a complex closed circulatory system and a well-developed nervous system, but as adults, siboglinids completely lack a mouth, gut, and anus.

==Evolution==
The family Siboglinidae has been difficult to place in an evolutionary context. After examination of genetic differences between annelids, Siboglinidae were placed within the order Polychaeta by scientific consensus. The fossil record along with molecular clocks suggest the family has Mesozoic (250 – 66 Mya) or Cenozoic (66 Mya – recent) origins. However, some fossils of crystallized tubes are attributed to early Siboglinidae dating back to 500 Mya. The oldest definitive specimens referred to the family came from Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian-Toarcian) Figueroa Sulfide deposits from San Rafael Mountains, found to be similar to modern &quot;Ridgeia&quot;. This tubes, known as ‘Figueroa tubes’, along the ‘Troodos collared tubes’ (Cyprus, Turonian) were resolved among modern vestimentiferans. Molecular work aligning five genes has identified four distinct clades within Siboglinidae. The clades are &quot;Vestimentifera&quot;, &quot;Sclerolinum&quot;, &quot;Frenulata&quot;, and &quot;Osedax&quot;. Vestimentiferans live in vent and seep habitats. Separation of vestimentiferans into seep and deep-sea-dwelling clades is still debated due to some phylogenies based on sequencing data placing the genera along a continuum. &quot;Sclerolinum&quot; is a monogeneric clade (which may be called Monilifera) living on organic-rich remains. Frenulates live in organic-rich sediment habitats. &quot;Osedax&quot; is a monogeneric clade specialized in living on whale bones, although recent evidence shows them living on fish bones as well.

One probable relationship between the four clades is shown in the cladogram below. The position of &quot;Osedax&quot; is weakly supported.
==Vestimentiferans==
Like other tube worms, vestimentiferans are benthic marine creatures. &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot;, a vestimentiferan, is known only from the hydrothermal vent systems. 

===Anatomy of vestimentiferans===

Vestimentiferan bodies are divided into four regions: the obturaculum, vestimentum, trunk, and opisthosome. The main trunk of the body bears wing-like extensions. Unlike other siboglinids that never have a digestive tract, they have one that they completely lose during metamorphosis.

The obturaculum is the first anterior body part. It is possible that the obturaculum is actually an outgrowth of the vestimentum rather than a separate body segment which would distinguish it from other siboglinids.

The vestimentum, from which the group&#x27;s name is derived, is a wing-like body part with glands that secrete the tube. In a ventroanterior position in the vestimentum is the brain which is postulated to be simpler than relatives that maintain a gut in the adult form. The opisthosome is the anchoring rear body part.

===Vestimentiferan ecology===
Their primary nutrition is derived from the sulfide-rich fluids emanating from the hydrothermal vents where they live. The sulfides are metabolized by symbiotic hydrogen sulfide- or methane-oxidizing bacteria living in an internal organ, the trophosome. One gram of trophosome tissue can contain one billion bacteria. The origin of this symbiotic relationship is not currently known. The bacteria appear to colonize the host animal larvae after they have settled on a surface, entering them through their skin. This method of entry, known as horizontal transmission, means that each organism may have different species of bacteria assisting in this symbiosis. However, these bacteria all play similar roles in sustaining the vestimentiferans. Endosymbionts have a wide variety of metabolic genes, which may allow them to switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic methods of nutrient acquisition. When the host dies, the bacteria are released and return to the free-living population in the seawater.

Discovery of the hydrothermal vents in the eastern Pacific Ocean was quickly followed by the discovery and description of new vestimentiferan tubeworm species. These tubeworms are one of the most dominant organisms associated with the hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Tubeworms anchor themselves to the substratum of the hydrocarbon seep by roots located at the basal portion of their bodies. Intact tubeworm roots have proven very difficult to obtain for study because they are extremely delicate, and often break off when a tubeworm is removed from hypothermal vent regions. How long the roots of the tube worms can grow is unknown, but roots have been recovered longer than 30 m.

A single aggregation of tubeworms can contain thousands of individuals, and the roots produced by each tubeworm can become tangled with the roots of neighbouring tubeworms. These mats of roots are known as &quot;ropes&quot;, and travel down the tubes of dead tubeworms, and run through holes in rocks. The diameter and wall thickness of the tubeworm roots do not appear to change with distance from the trunk portion of the tubeworm&#x27;s body.

Like the trunk portion of the body, the roots of the vestimentiferan tubeworms are composed of chitin crystallites, which support and protect the tubeworm from predation and environmental stresses. Tubeworms build the external chitin structure themselves by secreting chitin from specialized glands located in their body walls.

<doc id="43139" wikidata="Q131040" url="?curid=43139" title="Placozoa">
<text>Placozoa ( ; ) is a phylum of free-living (non-parasitic) marine invertebrates. They are blob-like animals composed of aggregations of cells. Moving in water by ciliary motion, eating food by engulfment, reproducing by fission or budding, placozoans are described as &quot;the simplest animals on Earth.&quot; Structural and molecular analyses have supported them as among the most basal animals, thus, constituting a primitive metazoan phylum.

The first known placozoan, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;, was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze (1840–1921). Describing the uniqueness, another German, Karl Gottlieb Grell (1912–1994), erected a new phylum, Placozoa, for it in 1971. Remaining a monotypic phylum for over a century, new species began to be added since 2018. So far, three other extant species have been described, in two distinct classes: Uniplacotomia (&quot;Hoilungia hongkongensis&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Cladtertia collaboinventa&quot; in 2022) and Polyplacotomia (&quot;Polyplacotoma mediterranea&quot;, the most basal, in 2019). A single putative fossil species is known, the Middle Triassic &quot;Maculicorpus microbialis&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Trichoplax&quot; was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze, in a seawater aquarium at the Zoological Institute in Graz, Austria. The generic name is derived from the classical Greek (&#x27;), meaning &quot;hair&quot;, and (&#x27;), &quot;plate&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;adhaerens&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;adherent&quot;, reflecting its propensity to stick to the glass slides and pipettes used in its examination. Schulze realized that the animal could not be a member of any existing phyla, and based on the simple structure and behaviour, concluded in 1891 that it must be an early metazoan. He also observed the reproduction by fission, cell layers and locomotion. 

In 1893, Italian zoologist Francesco Saverio Monticelli described another animal which he named &quot;Treptoplax&quot;, the specimens of which he collected from Naples. He gave the species name &quot;T. reptans&quot; in 1896. Monticelli did not preserve them and no other specimens were found again, as a result of which the identification is ruled as doubtful, and the species rejected.

Schulze&#x27;s description was opposed by other zoologists. For instance, in 1890, F.C. Noll argued that the animal was a flat worm (Turbellaria). In 1907, Thilo Krumbach published a hypothesis that &quot;Trichoplax&quot; is not a distinct animal but that it is a form of the planula larva of the anemone-like hydrozoan &quot;Eleutheria krohni&quot;. Although this was refuted in print by Schulze and others, Krumbach&#x27;s analysis became the standard textbook explanation, and nothing was printed in zoological journals about &quot;Trichoplax&quot; until the 1960s. 

The development of electron microscopy in the mid-20th century allowed in-depth observation of the cellular components of organisms, following which there was renewed interest in &quot;Trichoplax&quot; starting in 1966. The most important descriptions were made by Karl Gottlieb Grell at the University of Tübingen since 1971. That year, Grell revived Schulze&#x27;s interpretation that the animals are unique and created a new phylum Placozoa. Grell derived the name from the placula hypothesis, Otto Bütschli&#x27;s notion on the origin of metazoans.

==Biology==

Placozoans do not have well-defined body plans, much like amoebas, unicellular eukaryotes. As Andrew Masterson reported: &quot;they are as close as it is possible to get to being simply a little living blob.&quot; An individual body measures about 0.55 mm in diameter. There are no body parts; as one of the researchers Michael Eitel described: &quot;There&#x27;s no mouth, there&#x27;s no back, no nerve cells, nothing.&quot; Animals studied in laboratories have bodies consisting of everything from hundreds to millions of cells. 

Placozoans have only three anatomical parts as tissue layers inside its body: the upper, intermediate (middle) and lower epithelia. There are at least six different cell types. The upper epithelium is the thinnest portion and essentially comprises flat cells with their cell body hanging underneath the surface, and each cell having a cilium. Crystal cells are sparsely distributed near the marginal edge. A few cells have unusually large number of mitochondria. The middle layer is the thickest made up of numerous fiber cells, which contain mitochondrial complexes, vacuoles and endosymbiotic bacteria in the endoplasmic reticulum. The lower epithelium consists of numerous monociliated cylinder cells along with a few endocrine-like gland cells and lipophil cells. Each lipophil cell contains numerous middle-sized granules, one of which is a secretory granule.

The body axes of &quot;Hoilungia&quot; and &quot;Trichoplax&quot; are overtly similar to the oral–aboral axis of cnidarians, animals from another phylum with which they are most closely related. Structurally, they can not be distinguished from other placozoans, so that identification is purely on genetic (mitochondrial DNA) differences. Genome sequencing has shown that each species has a set of unique genes and several uniquely missing genes.

&quot;Trichoplax&quot; is a small, flattened, animal around across. An amorphous multi-celled body, analogous to a single-celled &quot;amoeba&quot;, it has no regular outline, although the lower surface is somewhat concave, and the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of stellate cells resembling the mesenchyme of some more complex animals. The epithelial cells bear cilia, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor.

The lower surface engulfs small particles of organic detritus, on which the animal feeds. All placozoans can reproduce asexually, budding off smaller individuals, and the lower surface may also bud off eggs into the mesenchyme.
Sexual reproduction has been reported to occur in one clade of placozoans, whose strain H8 was later found to belong to genus &quot;Cladtertia&quot;, where intergenic recombination was observed as well as other hallmarks of sexual reproduction.

Some &quot;Trichoplax&quot; species contain &quot;Rickettsiales&quot; bacteria as endosymbionts.
One of the at least 20 described species turned out to have two bacterial endosymbionts; &quot;Grellia&quot; which lives in the animal&#x27;s endoplasmic reticulum and is assumed to play a role in the protein and membrane production. The other endosymbiont is the first described &quot;Margulisbacteria&quot;, that lives inside cells used for algal digestion. It appears to eat the fats and other lipids of the algae and provide its host with vitamins and amino acids in return.
Studies suggest that aragonite crystals in crystal cells have the same function as statoliths, allowing it to use gravity for spatial orientation.

Located in the dorsal epithelium there are lipid granules called shiny spheres which release a cocktail of venoms and toxins as an anti-predator defense, and can induce paralysis or death in some predators. Genes has been found in Trichoplax with a strong resemblance to the venom genes of some poisonous snakes, like the American copperhead and the West African carpet viper.

The Placozoa show substantial evolutionary radiation in regard to sodium channels, of which they have 5–7 different types, more than any other invertebrate species studied to date.

Three modes of population dynamics depended upon feeding sources, including induction of social behaviors, morphogenesis, and reproductive strategies. 

In addition to fission, representatives of all species produced “swarmers” (a separate vegetative reproduction stage), which could also be formed from the lower epithelium with greater cell-type diversity.

==Evolutionary relationships==
There is no convincing fossil record of the Placozoa, although the Ediacaran biota (Precambrian, ) organism &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; appears somewhat similar to placozoans. Knaust (2021) reported preservation of placozoan fossils in a microbialite bed from the Middle Triassic Muschelkalk (Germany).

Traditionally, classification was based on their level of organization, i.e., they possess no tissues or organs. However this may be as a result of secondary loss and thus is inadequate to exclude them from relationships with more complex animals. More recent work has attempted to classify them based on the DNA sequences in their genome; this has placed the phylum between the sponges and the Eumetazoa. In such a feature-poor phylum, molecular data are considered to provide the most reliable approximation of the placozoans&#x27; phylogeny.

Their exact position on the phylogenetic tree would give important information about the origin of neurons and muscles. If the absence of these features is an original trait of the Placozoa, it would mean that a nervous system and muscles evolved three times should placozoans and cnidarians be a sister group; once in the Ctenophora, once in the Cnidaria and once in the Bilateria. If they branched off before the Cnidaria and Bilateria split, the neurons and muscles would have the same origin in the two latter groups.

===Functional-morphology hypothesis===

On the basis of their simple structure, the Placozoa were frequently viewed as a model organism for the transition from unicellular organisms to the multicellular animals (Metazoa) and are thus considered a sister taxon to all other metazoans:

According to a functional-morphology model, all or most animals are descended from a &quot;gallertoid&quot;, a free-living (pelagic) sphere in seawater, consisting of a single ciliated layer of cells supported by a thin, noncellular separating layer, the basal lamina. The interior of the sphere is filled with contractile fibrous cells and a gelatinous extracellular matrix. Both the modern Placozoa and all other animals then descended from this multicellular beginning stage via two different processes:

* Infolding of the epithelium led to the formation of an internal system of ducts and thus to the development of a modified gallertoid from which the sponges (Porifera), Cnidaria and Ctenophora subsequently developed.
* Other gallertoids, according to this model, made the transition over time to a benthic mode of life; that is, their habitat has shifted from the open ocean to the floor (benthic zone). This results naturally in a selective advantage for flattening of the body, as of course can be seen in many benthic species.
While the probability of encountering food, potential sexual partners, or predators is the same in all directions for animals floating freely in the water, there is a clear difference on the seafloor between the functions useful on body sides facing toward and away from the substrate, leading their sensory, defensive, and food-gathering cells to differentiate and orient according to the vertical – the direction perpendicular to the substrate. In the proposed functional-morphology model, the Placozoa, and possibly several similar organisms only known from the fossils, are descended from such a life form, which is now termed &quot;placuloid&quot;. 

Three different life strategies have accordingly led to three different possible lines of development:
# Animals that live interstitially in the sand of the ocean floor were responsible for the fossil crawling traces that are considered the earliest evidence of animals; and are detectable even prior to the dawn of the Ediacaran Period in geology. These are usually attributed to bilaterally symmetrical worms, but the hypothesis presented here views animals derived from placuloids, and thus close relatives of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;, to be the producers of the traces.
# Animals that incorporated algae as photosynthetically active endosymbionts, i.e. primarily obtaining their nutrients from their partners in symbiosis, were accordingly responsible for the mysterious creatures of the Ediacara fauna that are not assigned to any modern animal taxon and lived during the Ediacaran Period, before the start of the Paleozoic. However, recent work has shown that some of the Ediacaran assemblages (e.g. Mistaken Point) were in deep water, below the photic zone, and hence those individuals could not dependent on endosymbiotic photosynthesisers.
# Animals that grazed on algal mats would ultimately have been the direct ancestors of the Placozoa. The advantages of an amoeboid multiplicity of shapes thus allowed a previously present basal lamina and a gelatinous extracellular matrix to be lost &quot;secondarily&quot;. Pronounced differentiation between the surface facing the substrate (ventral) and the surface facing away from it (dorsal) accordingly led to the physiologically distinct cell layers of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; that can still be seen today. Consequently, these are &quot;analogous&quot;, but not &quot;homologous&quot;, to ectoderm and endoderm – the &quot;external&quot; and &quot;internal&quot; cell layers in eumetazoans – i.e. the structures corresponding functionally to one another have, according to the proposed hypothesis, no common evolutionary origin.

Should any of the analyses presented above turn out to be correct, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; would be the oldest branch of the multicellular animals, and a relic of the Ediacaran fauna, or even the pre-Ediacara fauna. Although very successful in their ecological niche, due to the absence of extracellular matrix and basal lamina, the development potential of these animals was of course limited, which would explain the low rate of evolution of their phenotype (their outward form as adults) – referred to as &quot;bradytely&quot;. 

This hypothesis was supported by a recent analysis of the &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; mitochondrial genome in comparison to those of other animals. The hypothesis was, however, rejected in a statistical analysis of the &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species, but only at which indicates a marginal level of statistical significance.

===Epitheliozoa hypothesis===
A concept based on purely morphological characteristics pictures the Placozoa as the nearest relative of the animals with true tissues (Eumetazoa). The taxon they share, called the Epitheliozoa, is itself construed to be a sister group to the sponges (Porifera):

The above view could be correct, although there is some evidence that the ctenophores, traditionally seen as Eumetazoa, may be the sister to all other animals.
This is now a disputed classification. Placozoans are estimated to have emerged 750–800 million years ago, and the first modern neuron to have originated in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians about 650 million years ago (many of the genes expressed in modern neurons are absent in ctenopheres, although some of these missing genes are present in placozoans).

The principal support for such a relationship comes from special cell to cell junctions – belt desmosomes – that occur not just in the Placozoa but in all animals &quot;except&quot; the sponges: They enable the cells to join together in an unbroken layer like the epitheloid of the Placozoa. &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; also shares the ventral gland cells with most eumetazoans. Both characteristics can be considered evolutionarily derived features (apomorphies), and thus form the basis of a common taxon for all animals that possess them. 

One possible scenario inspired by the proposed hypothesis starts with the idea that the monociliated cells of the epitheloid in &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; evolved by reduction of the collars in the collar cells (choanocytes) of sponges as the hypothesized ancestors of the Placozoa abandoned a filtering mode of life. The epitheloid would then have served as the precursor to the true epithelial tissue of the eumetazoans.

In contrast to the model based on functional morphology described earlier, in the Epitheliozoa hypothesis, the ventral and dorsal cell layers of the Placozoa are homologs of endoderm and ectoderm — the two basic embryonic cell layers of the eumetazoans. The digestive &quot;gastrodermis&quot; in the Cnidaria or the gut epithelium in the bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria) may have developed from endoderm, whereas ectoderm is the precursor to the external skin layer (epidermis), among other things. The interior space pervaded by a fiber syncytium in the Placozoa would then correspond to connective tissue in the other animals. It is unclear whether the calcium ions stored in the syncytium would be related to the lime skeletons of many cnidarians.

As noted above, this hypothesis was supported in a statistical analysis of the &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; whole genome sequence, as compared to the whole-genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species.

===Eumetazoa hypothesis===
A third hypothesis, based primarily on molecular genetics, views the Placozoa as highly simplified eumetazoans. According to this, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; is descended from considerably more complex animals that already had muscles and nerve tissues. Both tissue types, as well as the basal lamina of the epithelium, were accordingly lost more recently by radical secondary simplification.

Various studies in this regard so far yield differing results for identifying the exact sister group: In one case, the Placozoa would qualify as the nearest relatives of the Cnidaria, while in another they would be a sister group to the Ctenophora, and occasionally they are placed directly next to the Bilateria. Currently, they are typically placed according to the cladogram below:

In this cladogram the Epitheliozoa and Eumetazoa are synonyms to each other and to the Diploblasts, and the Ctenophora are basal to them.

An argument raised against the proposed scenario is that it leaves morphological features of the animals completely out of consideration. The extreme degree of simplification that would have to be postulated for the Placozoa in this model, moreover, is only known for parasitic organisms, but would be difficult to explain functionally in a free-living species like &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;.

This version is supported by statistical analysis of the &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species. However, Ctenophora was not included in the analyses, placing the placozoans outside of the sampled Eumetazoans.

==== Cnidaria-sister hypothesis ====
DNA comparisons suggest that placozoans are related to Cnidaria, derived from planula larva (as seen in some Cnidaria). The Bilateria also are thought to be derived from planuloids. The Cnidaria and Placozoa body axis are overtly similar, and placozoan and cnidarian cells are responsive to the same neuropeptide antibodies despite extant placozoans not developing any neurons.

<text>Symbion is a genus of commensal aquatic animals, less than 0.5 mm wide, found living attached to the mouthparts of cold-water lobsters. They have sac-like bodies, and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their two-stage life-cycle. They appear so different from other animals that they were assigned their own, new phylum Cycliophora shortly after they were discovered in 1995. This was the first new phylum of multicelled organism to be discovered since the Loricifera in 1983.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Symbion pandora&quot; was discovered in 1995 by Reinhardt Kristensen and Peter Funch on the mouthparts of the Norway lobster (&quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;). Other, related, species have since been discovered on:
* the American lobster (&quot;Homarus americanus&quot;, host to &quot;Symbion americanus&quot;)
* the European lobster (&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;, host to an as yet unnamed species of &quot;Symbion&quot;)

The genus is so named because of its commensal relationship with the lobster (a form of symbiosis) – it feeds on the leftovers from the lobster&#x27;s own meals.

They are peculiar microscopic animals, with no obvious close relatives, which were therefore given their own phylum, called Cycliophora. The phylogenetic position of &quot;Symbion&quot; is still not finally settled. Currently it is placed in the clade Polyzoa along with the phyla Ectoprocta and Entoprocta, based on genetic analysis.

== Description ==

&quot;Symbion pandora&quot; has a bilateral, sac-like body with no coelom. There are three basic life stages:

* Asexual Feeding Stage – At this stage, &quot;S. pandora&quot; is neither male nor female. It has a length of 347 μm and a width of 113 μm. On the posterior end of the sac-like body is a stalk with an adhesive disc, which attaches itself to the host. On the anterior end is a ciliated funnel (mouth) and an anus.
* Sexual Stage
** Male – &quot;S. pandora&quot; has a length of 84 μm and a width of 42 μm during this stage. It has no mouth or anus, which signifies the absence of a digestive system. It also has two reproductive organs.
** Female – &quot;S. pandora&quot; is the same size as the male in this stage. It does, however, have a digestive system which collapses and reconstitutes itself as a larva.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Symbion&quot; reproduces both asexually and sexually, and has a complex reproduction cycle, a strategy evolved to produce as many offspring as possible that can survive and find a new host when the lobster they live on sheds its shell. The asexual individuals are the largest ones. The sexual individuals do not eat.

During the autumn they make copies of themselves, where a new individual grows inside the parent body, one offspring at the time. The new offspring attach themselves to an available spot on the lobster, begin to feed and eventually start making new copies of themselves. 

In early winter, the asexual animals start producing males. When a male is born, it crawls away from its parent and glues itself to another asexual individual. Once attached, the male produces two dwarf males inside its body, which turns into a hollow pouch. Each of the two dwarf males are about one hundred times smaller than the asexual individual to which they are attached. Their bodies start out with about 200 cells, but this number has been reduced to just 47 by the time they reach maturity. Thirty-four of the cells form its nervous system, and three more become sensory cells used to help them feel their surroundings. Eight cells becomes mucous glands, which produce mucus that helps them move across the surface. The final two cells form the testes, which make the sperm that fertilize the female&#x27;s egg. Most of the cells of the dwarf males also lose their nucleus and shrink to almost half their size, which is an adaptation that allows two mature individuals to fit inside the body of the parent male. Two males increases their chances to fertilize a female. 

By late winter, when the large feeding individuals in the colony have males attached to their bodies, they start making females. Each female has a single egg inside her. When she is about to be born, one of the two dwarf males fertilizes her when she comes out. The fertilized female finds herself a place on the host&#x27;s whiskers where she attaches herself. Inside her the developing embryo extracts all the nutrients it needs to grow from its mother, and by the time it is ready to be born, all that remains of the mother is an empty husk. This new offspring is a strong swimmer unlike all the other forms in the colony, and those who succeed in finding a new host will attach themselves to its mouthparts, where it will grow a stomach and mouthparts, morphing into a large, feeding and asexual type, starting the cycle all over again.
The larval stage may be unscientifically referred to as sea worms.

<text>An echinoderm () is any animal of the phylum Echinodermata (), which includes starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers, as well as the sessile sea lilies or &quot;stone lilies&quot;. While bilaterally symmetrical as larvae, as adults echinoderms are recognisable by their usually five-pointed radial symmetry (pentamerous symmetry), and are found on the sea bed at every ocean depth from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7,600 living species, making it the second-largest group of deuterostomes after the chordates, as well as the largest marine-only phylum. The first definitive echinoderms appeared near the start of the Cambrian.

Echinoderms are important both ecologically and geologically. Ecologically, there are few other groupings so abundant in the deep sea, as well as shallower oceans. Most echinoderms are able to reproduce asexually and regenerate tissue, organs and limbs; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of echinoderms is in their ossified dermal endoskeletons, which are major contributors to many limestone formations and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries. Further, some scientists hold that the radiation of echinoderms was responsible for the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.

==Etymology==
The name echinoderm is .

The name Echinodermata was originated by Jacob Theodor Klein in 1734, but only in reference to echinoids. It was expanded to the phylum level by Jean Guillaume Bruguière, first informally in 1789 and then in formal Latin in 1791. In 1955, Libbie Hyman attributed the name to &quot;Bruguière, 1791 [ex Klein, 1734].&quot;

This attribution has become common and is listed by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), although some workers believe that the ITIS rules should result in attributing &quot;Klein, 1778&quot; due to a 2nd edition of his work published by Leske in that year.

While Echinodermata has been in common use since the mid-1800s, several other names had been proposed. Notably, F. A. Bather called the phylum &quot;Echinoderma&quot; (apparently after Latreille, 1825) in his 1900 treatise on the phylum, but this name now refers to a fungus.

==Diversity==

There are about 7,600 extant species of echinoderm as well as about 13,000 extinct species. 
All echinoderms are marine, but they are found in habitats ranging from shallow intertidal areas to abyssal depths. Five extant classes of echinoderms are generally recognized: the Asteroidea (starfish, with over 1900 species), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars, with around 2,300 species), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars, with some 900 species), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers, with about 1,430 species), and Crinoidea (feather stars and sea lilies, with around 580 species).

==Anatomy and physiology==
Echinoderms evolved from animals with bilateral symmetry. Although adult echinoderms possess pentaradial symmetry, their larvae are ciliated, free-swimming organisms with bilateral symmetry. Later, during metamorphosis, the left side of the body grows at the expense of the right side, which is eventually absorbed. The left side then grows in a pentaradially symmetric fashion, in which the body is arranged in five parts around a central axis. Within the Asterozoa, there are a few exceptions from the rule. Most starfish in the genus &quot;Leptasterias&quot; have six arms, although five-armed individuals can occur. The Brisingida also contain some six-armed species. Amongst the brittle stars, six-armed species such as &quot;Ophiothela danae&quot;, &quot;Ophiactis savignyi&quot;, and &quot;Ophionotus hexactis&quot; exist, and &quot;Ophiacantha vivipara&quot; often has more than six.

Echinoderms have secondary radial symmetry in portions of their body at some stage of life, most likely an adaptation to a sessile or slow-moving existence. Many crinoids and some seastars are symmetrical in multiples of the basic five; starfish such as &quot;Labidiaster annulatus&quot; possess up to fifty arms, while the sea-lily &quot;Comaster schlegelii&quot; has two hundred.

Genetic studies have shown that genes directing anterior-most development are expressed along ambulacra in the center of starfish rays, with the next-most-anterior genes expressed in the surrounding fringe of tube feet. Genes related to the beginning of the trunk are expressed at the ray margins, but trunk genes are only expressed in interior tissue rather than on the body surface. This means that a starfish body can more-or-less be considered to consist only of a head.

===Skin and skeleton===

Echinoderms have a mesodermal skeleton in the dermis, composed of calcite-based plates known as ossicles. If solid, these would form a heavy skeleton, so they have a sponge-like porous structure known as stereom. Ossicles may be fused together, as in the test of sea urchins, or may articulate to form flexible joints as in the arms of sea stars, brittle stars and crinoids. The ossicles may bear external projections in the form of spines, granules or warts and they are supported by a tough epidermis. Skeletal elements are sometimes deployed in specialized ways, such as the chewing organ called &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s lantern&quot; in sea urchins, the supportive stalks of crinoids, and the structural &quot;lime ring&quot; of sea cucumbers.

Although individual ossicles are robust and fossilize readily, complete skeletons of starfish, brittle stars and crinoids are rare in the fossil record. On the other hand, sea urchins are often well preserved in chalk beds or limestone. During fossilization, the cavities in the stereom are filled in with calcite that is continuous with the surrounding rock. On fracturing such rock, paleontologists can observe distinctive cleavage patterns and sometimes even the intricate internal and external structure of the test.

The epidermis contains pigment cells that provide the often vivid colours of echinoderms, which include deep red, stripes of black and white, and intense purple. These cells may be light-sensitive, causing many echinoderms to change appearance completely as night falls. The reaction can happen quickly: the sea urchin &quot;Centrostephanus longispinus&quot; changes colour in just fifty minutes when exposed to light.

One characteristic of most echinoderms is a special kind of tissue known as catch connective tissue. This collagen-based material can change its mechanical properties under nervous control rather than by muscular means. This tissue enables a starfish to go from moving flexibly around the seabed to becoming rigid while prying open a bivalve mollusc or preventing itself from being extracted from a crevice. Similarly, sea urchins can lock their normally mobile spines upright as a defensive mechanism when attacked.

===The water vascular system===


Echinoderms possess a unique water vascular system, a network of fluid-filled canals modified from the coelom (body cavity) that function in gas exchange, feeding, sensory reception and locomotion. This system varies between different classes of echinoderm but typically opens to the exterior through a sieve-like madreporite on the aboral (upper) surface of the animal. The madreporite is linked to a slender duct, the stone canal, which extends to a ring canal that encircles the mouth or oesophagus. The ring canal branches into a set of radial canals, which in asteroids extend along the arms, and in echinoids adjoin the test in the ambulacral areas. Short lateral canals branch off the radial canals, each one ending in an ampulla. Part of the ampulla can protrude through a pore (or a pair of pores in sea urchins) to the exterior, forming a podium or tube foot. The water vascular system assists with the distribution of nutrients throughout the animal&#x27;s body; it is most visible in the tube feet which can be extended or contracted by the redistribution of fluid between the foot and the internal ampulla.

The organisation of the water vascular system is somewhat different in ophiuroids, where the madreporite may be on the oral surface and the podia lack suckers. In holothuroids, the system is reduced, often with few tube feet other than the specialised feeding tentacles, and the madreporite opens on to the coelom. Some holothuroids like the Apodida lack tube feet and canals along the body; others have longitudinal canals. The arrangement in crinoids is similar to that in asteroids, but the tube feet lack suckers and are used in a back-and-forth wafting motion to pass food particles captured by the arms towards the central mouth. In the asteroids, the same motion is employed to move the animal across the ground.

===Other organs===

Echinoderms possess a simple digestive system which varies according to the animal&#x27;s diet. Starfish are mostly carnivorous and have a mouth, oesophagus, two-part stomach, intestine and rectum, with the anus located in the centre of the aboral body surface. With a few exceptions, the members of the order Paxillosida do not possess an anus. In many species of starfish, the large cardiac stomach can be everted to digest food outside the body. Some other species are able to ingest whole food items such as molluscs. Brittle stars, which have varying diets, have a blind gut with no intestine or anus; they expel food waste through their mouth. Sea urchins are herbivores and use their specialised mouthparts to graze, tear and chew their food, mainly algae. They have an oesophagus, a large stomach and a rectum with the anus at the apex of the test. Sea cucumbers are mostly detritivores, sorting through the sediment with modified tube feet around their mouth, the buccal tentacles. Sand and mud accompanies their food through their simple gut, which has a long coiled intestine and a large cloaca. Crinoids are suspension feeders, passively catching plankton which drift into their outstretched arms. Boluses of mucus-trapped food are passed to the mouth, which is linked to the anus by a loop consisting of a short oesophagus and longer intestine.

The coelomic cavities of echinoderms are complex. Aside from the water vascular system, echinoderms have a haemal coelom, a perivisceral coelom, a gonadal coelom and often also a perihaemal coelom. During development, echinoderm coelom is divided into the metacoel, mesocoel and protocoel (also called somatocoel, hydrocoel and axocoel, respectively). The water vascular system, haemal system and perihaemal system form the tubular coelomic system. Echinoderms are unusual in having both a coelomic circulatory system (the water vascular system) and a haemal circulatory system, as most groups of animals have just one of the two.

Haemal and perihaemal systems are derived from the original coelom, forming an open and reduced circulatory system. This usually consists of a central ring and five radial vessels. There is no true heart, and the blood often lacks any respiratory pigment. Gaseous exchange occurs via dermal branchiae or papulae in starfish, genital bursae in brittle stars, peristominal gills in sea urchins and cloacal trees in sea cucumbers. Exchange of gases also takes place through the tube feet. Echinoderms lack specialized excretory (waste disposal) organs and so nitrogenous waste, chiefly in the form of ammonia, diffuses out through the respiratory surfaces.

The coelomic fluid contains the coelomocytes, or immune cells. There are several types of immune cells, which vary among classes and species. All classes possess a type of phagocytic amebocyte, which engulf invading particles and infected cells, aggregate or clot, and may be involved in cytotoxicity. These cells are usually large and granular, and are believed to be a main line of defence against potential pathogens. Depending on the class, echinoderms may have spherule cells (for cytotoxicity, inflammation, and anti-bacterial activity), vibratile cells (for coelomic fluid movement and clotting), and crystal cells (which may serve for osmoregulation in sea cucumbers). The coelomocytes secrete antimicrobial peptides against bacteria, and have a set of lectins and complement proteins as part of an innate immune system that is still being characterised.

Echinoderms have a simple radial nervous system that consists of a modified nerve net of interconnected neurons with no central brain, although some do possess ganglia. Nerves radiate from central rings around the mouth into each arm or along the body wall; the branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the organism and the synchronisation of the tube feet. Starfish have sensory cells in the epithelium and have simple eyespots and touch-sensitive tentacle-like tube feet at the tips of their arms. Sea urchins have no particular sense organs but do have statocysts that assist in gravitational orientation, and they too have sensory cells in their epidermis, particularly in the tube feet, spines and pedicellariae. Brittle stars, crinoids and sea cucumbers in general do not have sensory organs, but some burrowing sea cucumbers of the order Apodida have a single statocyst adjoining each radial nerve, and some have an eyespot at the base of each tentacle.

The gonads at least periodically occupy much of the body cavities of sea urchins and sea cucumbers, while the less voluminous crinoids, brittle stars and starfish have two gonads in each arm. While the ancestors of modern echinoderms are believed to have had one genital aperture, many organisms have multiple gonopores through which eggs or sperm may be released.

==Regeneration==


Many echinoderms have great powers of regeneration. Many species routinely autotomize and regenerate arms and viscera. Sea cucumbers often discharge parts of their internal organs if they perceive themselves to be threatened, regenerating them over the course of several months. Sea urchins constantly replace spines lost through damage, while sea stars and sea lilies readily lose and regenerate their arms. In most cases, a single severed arm cannot grow into a new starfish in the absence of at least part of the disc. However, in a few species a single arm can survive and develop into a complete individual, and arms are sometimes intentionally detached for the purpose of asexual reproduction. During periods when they have lost their digestive tracts, sea cucumbers live off stored nutrients and absorb dissolved organic matter directly from the water.

The regeneration of lost parts involves both epimorphosis and morphallaxis. In epimorphosis stem cells, either from a reserve pool or those produced by dedifferentiation, form a blastema and generate new tissues. Morphallactic regeneration involves the movement and remodelling of existing tissues to replace lost parts. Direct transdifferentiation of one type of tissue to another during tissue replacement is also observed.

==Reproduction==

===Sexual reproduction===

Echinoderms become sexually mature after approximately two to three years, depending on the species and the environmental conditions. Almost all species have separate male and female sexes, though some are hermaphroditic. The eggs and sperm cells are typically released into open water, where fertilisation takes place. The release of sperm and eggs is synchronised in some species, usually with regard to the lunar cycle. In other species, individuals may aggregate during the reproductive season, increasing the likelihood of successful fertilisation. Internal fertilisation has been observed in three species of sea star, three brittle stars and a deep-water sea cucumber. Even at abyssal depths, where no light penetrates, echinoderms often synchronise their reproductive activity.

Some echinoderms brood their eggs. This is especially common in cold water species where planktonic larvae might not be able to find sufficient food. These retained eggs are usually few in number and are supplied with large yolks to nourish the developing embryos. In starfish, the female may carry the eggs in special pouches, under her arms, under her arched body, or even in her cardiac stomach. Many brittle stars are hermaphrodites; they often brood their eggs, usually in special chambers on their oral surfaces, but sometimes in the ovary or coelom. In these starfish and brittle stars, development is usually direct to the adult form, without passing through a bilateral larval stage. A few sea urchins and one species of sand dollar carry their eggs in cavities, or near their anus, holding them in place with their spines. Some sea cucumbers use their buccal tentacles to transfer their eggs to their underside or back, where they are retained. In a very small number of species, the eggs are retained in the coelom where they develop viviparously, later emerging through ruptures in the body wall. In some crinoids, the embryos develop in special breeding bags, where the eggs are held until sperm released by a male happens to find them.

===Asexual reproduction===

One species of seastar, &quot;Ophidiaster granifer&quot;, reproduces asexually by parthenogenesis. In certain other asterozoans, adults reproduce asexually until they mature, then reproduce sexually. In most of these species, asexual reproduction is by transverse fission with the disc splitting in two. Both the lost disc area and the missing arms regrow, so an individual may have arms of varying lengths. During the period of regrowth, they have a few tiny arms and one large arm, and are thus often known as &quot;comets&quot;.

Adult sea cucumbers reproduce asexually by transverse fission. &quot;Holothuria parvula&quot; uses this method frequently, splitting into two a little in front of the midpoint. The two halves each regenerate their missing organs over a period of several months, but the missing genital organs are often very slow to develop.

The larvae of some echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction. This has long been known to occur among starfish and brittle stars, but has more recently been observed in a sea cucumber, a sand dollar and a sea urchin. This may be by autotomising parts that develop into secondary larvae, by budding, or by splitting transversely. Autotomised parts or buds may develop directly into fully formed larvae, or may pass through a gastrula or even a blastula stage. New larvae can develop from the preoral hood (a mound like structure above the mouth), the side body wall, the postero-lateral arms, or their rear ends.

Cloning is costly to the larva both in resources and in development time. Larvae undergo this process when food is plentiful or temperature conditions are optimal. Cloning may occur to make use of the tissues that are normally lost during metamorphosis. The larvae of some sand dollars clone themselves when they detect dissolved fish mucus, indicating the presence of predators. Asexual reproduction produces many smaller larvae that escape better from planktivorous fish, implying that the mechanism may be an anti-predator adaptation.

===Larval development===
Development begins with a bilaterally symmetrical embryo, with a coeloblastula developing first. Gastrulation marks the opening of the &quot;second mouth&quot; that places echinoderms within the deuterostomes, and the mesoderm, which will host the skeleton, migrates inwards. The secondary body cavity, the coelom, forms by the partitioning of three body cavities. The larvae are often planktonic, but in some species the eggs are retained inside the female, while in some the female broods the larvae.

The larvae pass through several stages, which have specific names derived from the taxonomic names of the adults or from their appearance. For example, a sea urchin has an &#x27;echinopluteus&#x27; larva while a brittle star has an &#x27;ophiopluteus&#x27; larva. A starfish has a &#x27;bipinnaria&#x27; larva, which develops into a multi-armed &#x27;brachiolaria&#x27; larva. A sea cucumber&#x27;s larva is an &#x27;auricularia&#x27; while a crinoid&#x27;s is a &#x27;vitellaria&#x27;. All these larvae are bilaterally symmetrical and have bands of cilia with which they swim; some, usually known as &#x27;pluteus&#x27; larvae, have arms. When fully developed, they settle on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis, and the larval arms and gut degenerate. The left-hand side of the larva develops into the oral surface of the juvenile, while the right side becomes the aboral surface. At this stage, the pentaradial symmetry develops.

A plankton-eating larva, living and feeding in the water column, is considered to be the ancestral larval type for echinoderms, but in extant echinoderms, some 68% of species develop using a yolk-feeding larva. The provision of a yolk-sac means that smaller numbers of eggs are produced, the larvae have a shorter development period and a smaller dispersal potential, but a greater chance of survival.

==Distribution and habitat==

Echinoderms are globally distributed in almost all depths, latitudes and environments in the ocean. Living echinoderms are known from between 0 to over 10,000 meters. Adults are mainly benthic, living on the seabed, whereas larvae are often pelagic, living as plankton in the open ocean. Some holothuroid adults such as &quot;Pelagothuria&quot; are pelagic. In the fossil record, some crinoids were pseudo-planktonic, attaching themselves to floating logs and debris. Some Paleozoic taxa displayed this life mode, before competition from organisms such as barnacles restricted the extent of the behaviour.

== Mode of life ==

===Locomotion===

Echinoderms primarily use their tube feet to move about, though some sea urchins also use their spines. The tube feet typically have a tip shaped like a suction pad in which a vacuum can be created by contraction of muscles. This combines with some stickiness from the secretion of mucus to provide adhesion. The tube feet contract and relax in waves which move along the adherent surface, and the animal moves slowly along.

Brittle stars are the most agile of the echinoderms. Any one of the arms can form the axis of symmetry, pointing either forwards or back. The animal then moves in a co-ordinated way, propelled by the other four arms. During locomotion, the propelling arms can made either snake-like or rowing movements. Starfish move using their tube feet, keeping their arms almost still, including in genera like &quot;Pycnopodia&quot; where the arms are flexible. The oral surface is covered with thousands of tube feet which move out of time with each other, but not in a metachronal rhythm; in some way, however, the tube feet are coordinated, as the animal glides steadily along. Some burrowing starfish have points rather than suckers on their tube feet and they are able to &quot;glide&quot; across the seabed at a faster rate.

Sea urchins use their tube feet to move around in a similar way to starfish. Some also use their articulated spines to push or lever themselves along or lift their oral surfaces off the substrate. If a sea urchin is overturned, it can extend its tube feet in one ambulacral area far enough to bring them within reach of the substrate and then successively attach feet from the adjoining area until it is righted. Some species bore into rock, usually by grinding away at the surface with their mouthparts.

Most sea cucumber species move on the surface of the seabed or burrow through sand or mud using peristaltic movements; some have short tube feet on their under surface with which they can creep along in the manner of a starfish. Some species drag themselves along using their buccal tentacles, while others manage to swim with peristaltic movements or rhythmic flexing. Many live in cracks, hollows and burrows and hardly move at all. Some deep-water species are pelagic and can float in the water with webbed papillae forming sails or fins.

The majority of feather stars (also called Comatulida or &quot;unstalked crinoids&quot;) and some stalked forms are motile. Several stalked crinoid species are sessile, attached permanently to the substratum. Movement in most sea lilies is limited to bending (their stems can bend) and rolling and unrolling their arms; a few species can relocate themselves on the seabed by crawling. Feather stars are unattached and usually live in crevices, under corals or inside sponges with their arms the only visible part. Some feather stars emerge at night and perch themselves on nearby eminences to better exploit food-bearing currents. Many species can &quot;walk&quot; across the seabed, raising their body with the help of their arms, or swim using their arms. Most species of feather stars, however, are largely sedentary, seldom moving far from their chosen place of concealment.

===Feeding===

The modes of feeding vary greatly between the different echinoderm taxa. Crinoids and some brittle stars tend to be passive filter-feeders, enmeshing suspended particles from passing water. Most sea urchins are grazers; sea cucumbers are deposit feeders; and the majority of starfish are active hunters.

Crinoids catch food particles using the tube feet on their outspread pinnules, move them into the ambulacral grooves, wrap them in mucus, and convey them to the mouth using the cilia lining the grooves. The exact dietary requirements of crinoids have been little researched, but in the laboratory, they can be fed with diatoms.

Basket stars are suspension feeders, raising their branched arms to collect zooplankton, while other brittle stars use several methods of feeding. Some are suspension feeders, securing food particles with mucus strands, spines or tube feet on their raised arms. Others are scavengers and detritus feeders. Others again are voracious carnivores and able to lasso their waterborne prey with a sudden encirclement by their flexible arms. The limbs then bend under the disc to transfer the food to the jaws and mouth.

Many sea urchins feed on algae, often scraping off the thin layer of algae covering the surfaces of rocks with their specialised mouthparts known as Aristotle&#x27;s lantern. Other species devour smaller organisms, which they may catch with their tube feet. They may also feed on dead fish and other animal matter. Sand dollars may perform suspension feeding and feed on phytoplankton, detritus, algal pieces and the bacterial layer surrounding grains of sand.

Sea cucumbers are often mobile deposit or suspension feeders, using their buccal podia to actively capture food and then stuffing the particles individually into their buccal cavities. Others ingest large quantities of sediment, absorb the organic matter and pass the indigestible mineral particles through their guts. In this way they disturb and process large volumes of substrate, often leaving characteristic ridges of sediment on the seabed. Some sea cucumbers live infaunally in burrows, anterior-end down and anus on the surface, swallowing sediment and passing it through their gut. Other burrowers live anterior-end up and wait for detritus to fall into the entrances of the burrows or rake in debris from the surface nearby with their buccal podia.

Nearly all starfish are detritus feeders or carnivores, though a few are suspension feeders. Small fish landing on the upper surface may be captured by pedicilaria and dead animal matter may be scavenged but the main prey items are living invertebrates, mostly bivalve molluscs. To feed on one of these, the starfish moves over it, attaches its tube feet and exerts pressure on the valves by arching its back. When a small gap between the valves is formed, the starfish inserts part of its stomach into the prey, excretes digestive enzymes and slowly liquefies the soft body parts. As the adductor muscle of the bivalve relaxes, more stomach is inserted and when digestion is complete, the stomach is returned to its usual position in the starfish with its now liquefied bivalve meal inside it. Other starfish evert the stomach to feed on sponges, sea anemones, corals, detritus and algal films.

===Antipredator defence===
Despite their low nutrition value and the abundance of indigestible calcite, echinoderms are preyed upon by many organisms, including bony fish, sharks, eider ducks, gulls, crabs, gastropod molluscs, other echinoderms, sea otters, Arctic foxes and humans. Larger starfish prey on smaller ones; the great quantity of eggs and larva that they produce form part of the zooplankton, consumed by many marine creatures. Crinoids, on the other hand, are relatively free from predation.

Antipredator defences include the presence of spines, toxins (inherent or delivered through the tube feet), and the discharge of sticky entangling threads by sea cucumbers. Although most echinoderm spines are blunt, those of the crown-of-thorns starfish are long and sharp and can cause a painful puncture wound as the epithelium covering them contains a toxin. Because of their catch connective tissue, which can change rapidly from a flaccid to a rigid state, echinoderms are very difficult to dislodge from crevices. Some sea cucumbers have a cluster of cuvierian tubules which can be ejected as long sticky threads from their anus to entangle and permanently disable an attacker. Sea cucumbers occasionally defend themselves by rupturing their body wall and discharging the gut and internal organs. Starfish and brittle stars may undergo autotomy when attacked, detaching an arm; this may distract the predator for long enough for the animal to escape. Some starfish species can swim away from danger.

==Ecology==

Echinoderms are numerous invertebrates whose adults play an important role in benthic ecosystems, while the larvae are a major component of the plankton. Among the ecological roles of adults are the grazing of sea urchins, the sediment processing of heart urchins, and the suspension and deposit feeding of crinoids and sea cucumbers. Some sea urchins can bore into solid rock, destabilising rock faces and releasing nutrients into the ocean. Coral reefs are also bored into in this way, but the rate of accretion of carbonate material is often greater than the erosion produced by the sea urchin. Echinoderms sequester about 0.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year as calcium carbonate, making them important contributors in the global carbon cycle.

Echinoderms sometimes have large population swings which can transform ecosystems. In 1983, for example, the mass mortality of the tropical sea urchin &quot;Diadema antillarum&quot; in the Caribbean caused a change from a coral-dominated reef system to an alga-dominated one. Sea urchins are among the main herbivores on reefs and there is usually a fine balance between the urchins and the kelp and other algae on which they graze. A diminution of the numbers of predators (otters, lobsters and fish) can result in an increase in urchin numbers, causing overgrazing of kelp forests, resulting in an alga-denuded &quot;urchin barren&quot;. On the Great Barrier Reef, an unexplained increase in the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (&quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;), which graze on living coral tissue, has greatly increased coral mortality and reduced coral reef biodiversity.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The characteristics of adult echinoderms are the possession of a water vascular system with external tube feet and a stereom endoskeleton. 
Stereom is a calcareous material consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres, which is unique to this phylum.

===Phylogeny===

Echinoderm phylogeny has long been a contentious subject. While the relationships among extant taxa are well-understood, there is no broadly accepted consensus regarding the phylum&#x27;s origins or the relationships among its extinct groups. Echinoderm evolution shows a high degree of homoplasy, meaning that many features have evolved multiple times independently. This means that many features initiatlly assumed to indicate a genetic connection do not, in fact, do so, which has obscured the true relationships of various groups.

====External phylogeny====

Echinoderms are bilaterians, meaning that their ancestors were mirror-symmetric. Among the bilaterians, they belong to the deuterostome division, meaning that the blastopore, the first opening to form during embryo development, becomes the anus instead of the mouth.

Echinoderms are the sister group of the Hemichordata, with which they form the crown group Ambulacraria. Two taxa of uncertain placement, Vetulocystida and &quot;Yanjiahella&quot;, have each been proposed as either stem-group echinoderms or stem-group ambulacrarians. Vetulocystids have also been proposed as stem-group chordates, while &quot;Yanjiahella&quot; has also been proposed to be a stem-group hemichordate.

The Ambulacrarian context of the echinoderms is shown below, simplified from Li et al. 2023, with the possible ambulacrarian placements of the uncertain taxa shown with dashed lines and question marks:


====Internal phylogeny: extant classes====

The extant echinoderms consist of the Crinoidea and the Eleutherozoa, the latter of which is divided into the Asterozoa and the Echinozoa.


====Internal phylogeny: total group====

The lack of a consensus cladistic phylogeny incorporating extinct echinoderm groups has resulted in the continued use of terms from Linnaean taxonomies, even when the named taxa are known to be paraphyletic and/or polyphyletic.

=====Linnaean taxonomies=====

Three taxonomies introduced nearly all of the traditional subphyla and class divisions that continue to be referenced in cladistic work:

* F. A. Bather produced the earliest widely referenced classification of both fossil and extant echinoderms in 1900, using a two-subphylum system.
* In 1966, the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot;, rejected Bather&#x27;s classification, replacing it with a new four-subphylum scheme that had been previously proposed by H. B. Fell.
* James Sprinkle which added a fifth subphylum to the &quot;Treatise&quot; taxonomy in 1973. His later class-level taxonomy of the five subphyla was the most recent approach cited in an early cladistic re-assessment of the phylum.


Other proposed classes not included at that rank in any of the above taxonomies include:

* Cryptosyringida 
* Somasteroidea 
* Stenuroidea 
* Coronoidea 
* Concentricycloidea 

There are also several common alternative names involving homalozoans:

* Carpoidea for Homalozoa, giving rise to the term &quot;carpoids&quot;
* Cincta as either the senior synonym of or sole order within Homostelea
* Soluta as either the senior synonym of or sole order within Homoiostelea
* Calcichordata , a subphylum effectively identical to Stylophora that was central to the now-disproven calcichordate hypothesis

=====Cladograms=====

According to 2024 review, there are two main schools of thought regarding echinoderm phylogeny: One that sees pentaradiality as a plesiomorphic trait of the phylum, and another that considers it a derived trait (apomorphy).

Note that neither cladogram shown below includes all of the traditional classes, or even all of the classes mentioned in accompanying text.

; Pentaradiality as a plesiomorphy

Supporters of pentaradiality as an initial condition of the phylum note that radial forms are the first uncontested echinoderms to appear in the fossil record. They also define homologies of echinoderm anatomy based on a division of the skeleton into two parts: those that are or are not associated with the water vascular system.

The following cladogram is based on David &amp; Mooi (1999) and David, Lefebvre, Mooi, and Parsley (2000):

In this theory, the controversial Ediacaran fossil &quot;Arkarua&quot; is tentatively placed as the sister to all other echinoderms. Helicoplacoidea and Edrioasteroidea join it in the stem group. Pelmatozoa, Eocrinoidea, and Cystoidea are shown to be paraphyletic while Homalozoa is polyphyletic.

; Pentaradiality as an apomorphy

Those who find pentaradiality to be derived incorporate the recently-discovered fossils &quot;Ctenoimbricata&quot; (seen as a possible sister to all other echinoderms) and &quot;Helicocystis&quot; (seen as bridging the triradial helicoplacoids and the pentaradial crown group). They cite research indicating that the early appearance of pentaradial forms is likely due to an incomplete fossil record, as well as multiple studies showing non-radial forms as an early stem group, to argue that this is phylogeny represents an emerging consensus. They reject &quot;Arkarua&quot; as an echinoderm due to its lack of stereom and possession of true pentaradiality instead of the 2-1-2 pseudo-pentaradiality seen in all early forms.

The following cladogram is based on Rahman &amp; Zamora (2024), incorporating class and subphylum names from the text:

Here, Homalozoa (with uncertain placement of Stylophora) is shown to be a paraphyletic assemblage along the stem group, followed by Helicoplacoidea and then &quot;Helicocystis&quot; as the sister of the crown group. The details of Blastozoa vs Crinozoa are not addressed, as they are represented only by the classes Eocrinoidea and Crinoidea, respectively, and the overall nature of Pelmatozoa remains unresolved. The four-way polytomy including the Eleutherozoa and Crinoidea shows either &quot;Camptostroma&quot; or &quot;Gogia&quot; or both could prove to be outside of the crown group.

===Fossil history===

Echinoderms have a rich fossil record due to their mineralized endoskeletons.

====Possible early echinoderms====
The three oldest known candidate echinoderms all lack stereom and other echinoderm apomorphies, making their inclusion in the phylum controversial.

The oldest potential echinoderm fossil is &quot;Arkarua&quot; from the late Ediacaran of Australia &quot;circa&quot; 555 Ma. These fossils are disc-like, with radial ridges on the rim and a five-pointed central depression marked with radial lines. However, the fossils have no stereom or internal structure indicating a water vascular system, so they cannot be conclusively identified. Additionally, all known early pentaradial echinoderms are pseudo-pentaradial in a 2-1-2 pattern, with true pentaradiality as seen in &quot;Arkarua&quot; not seen until the emergence of the Eleutherozoa.

The next possible echinoderms are the vetulocystids, which date to the early to mid Cambrian, 541–501 Ma. While the youngest vetulocystid, &quot;Thylacocercus&quot;, displays some characteristics that could be interemediate between older vetulocystids and &quot;Yanjiahella&quot;, its discoverers consider vetulocystids more likely to be stem ambulacrarians than stem echinoderms.

&quot;Yanjiahella&quot;, from the Fortunian (&quot;circa&quot; 539–529 Ma), is unlike the older fossils in that it has a plated theca, albeit one without evidence of stereom. To some, this is a reason to place it as a stem ambulacrarian or stem hemichordate. Others argue that absence of evidence for stereom is not evidence of absence, and consider a stem echinoderm position more likely.

====Echinoderms in the Cambrian and Ordovician====

The first universally accepted echinoderms appear in the Lower Cambrian period; asterozoans appeared in the Ordovician, while the crinoids were a dominant group in the Paleozoic.

It is hypothesised that the ancestor of all echinoderms was a simple, motile, bilaterally symmetrical animal with a mouth, gut and anus. This ancestral organism adopted an attached mode of life with suspension feeding, and developed radial symmetry. Even so, the larvae of all echinoderms are bilaterally symmetrical, and all develop radial symmetry at metamorphosis. Like their ancestor, the starfish and crinoids still attach themselves to the seabed while changing to their adult form.

The first known echinoderms were non-motile, but evolved into animals able to move freely. These soon developed endoskeletal plates with stereom structure, and external ciliary grooves for feeding. The Paleozoic echinoderms were globular, attached to the substrate and were orientated with their oral surfaces facing upwards. These early echinoderms had ambulacral grooves extending down the side of the body, fringed on either side by brachioles, like the pinnules of a modern crinoid. Eventually, the mobile eleutherozoans reversed their orientation to become mouth-downward. Before this happened, the podia probably had a feeding function, as they do in the crinoids today. The locomotor function of the podia came later, when the re-orientation of the mouth brought the podia into contact with the substrate for the first time.

==Use by humans==

=== As food and medicine ===

In 2019, 129,052 tonnes of echinoderms were harvested. The majority of these were sea cucumbers (59,262 tonnes) and sea urchins (66,341 tonnes). These are used mainly for food, but also in traditional Chinese medicine. Sea cucumbers are considered a delicacy in some countries of southeast Asia; as such, they are in imminent danger of being over-harvested. Popular species include the pineapple roller &quot;Thelenota ananas&quot; (&quot;susuhan&quot;) and the red sea cucumber &quot;Holothuria edulis&quot;. These and other species are colloquially known as &quot;bêche de mer&quot; or &quot;trepang&quot; in China and Indonesia. The sea cucumbers are boiled for twenty minutes and then dried both naturally and later over a fire which gives them a smoky tang. In China, they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews. Both male and female gonads of sea urchins are consumed, particularly in Japan and France. The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea urchin breeding trials have been undertaken to try to compensate for overexploitation.

=== In research ===

Because of their robust larval growth, sea urchins are widely used in research, particularly as model organisms in developmental biology and ecotoxicology. &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; and &quot;Arbacia punctulata&quot; are used for this purpose in embryological studies. The large size and the transparency of the eggs enables the observation of sperm cells in the process of fertilising ova. The arm regeneration potential of brittle stars is being studied in connection with understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Genomic data relevant to echinoderm model organisms are collected in Echinobase. Currently, there are four species of echinoderms fully supported (gene pages, BLAST, JBrowse tracks, genome downloads) including &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; (purple sea urchin), &quot;Lytechinus variegatus&quot; (green sea urchin), &quot;Patiria miniata&quot; (bat star) and &quot;Acanthaster planci&quot; (crown-of-thorns sea star). Partially supported species (no gene pages) include &quot;Lytechinus pictus&quot; (painted sea urchin), &quot;Asterias rubens&quot; (sugar star) and &quot;Anneissia japonica&quot; (feather star crinoid).

=== Other uses ===

The calcareous tests or shells of echinoderms are used as a source of lime by farmers in areas where limestone is unavailable and some are used in the manufacture of fish meal. 4,000 tons of the animals are used annually for these purposes. This trade is often carried out in conjunction with shellfish farmers, for whom the starfish pose a major threat by eating their cultured stock. Other uses for the starfish they recover include the manufacture of animal feed, composting and the preparation of dried specimens for the arts and craft trade.

<text>The Echiura, or spoon worms, are a small group of marine animals. Once treated as a separate phylum, they are now considered to belong to Annelida. Annelids typically have their bodies divided into segments, but echiurans have secondarily lost their segmentation. The majority of echiurans live in burrows in soft sediment in shallow water, but some live in rock crevices or under boulders, and there are also deep sea forms. More than 230 species have been described.
Spoon worms are cylindrical, soft-bodied animals usually possessing a non-retractable proboscis which can be rolled into a scoop-shape to feed. In some species the proboscis is ribbon-like, longer than the trunk and may have a forked tip. Spoon worms vary in size from less than a centimetre in length to more than a metre.

Most are deposit feeders, collecting detritus from the sea floor. Fossils of these worms are seldom found and the earliest known fossil specimen is from the Middle Ordovician.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The spoonworm &quot;Echiurus echiurus&quot; was first described by the Prussian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766; he placed it in the earth worm genus &quot;Lumbricus&quot;. In the mid-nineteenth century Echiura was placed, alongside Sipuncula and Priapulida, in the now defunct class Gephyrea (meaning a &quot;bridge&quot;) in Annelida, because it was believed that they provided a link between annelids and holothurians. In 1898, Sedgwick raised the sipunculids and priapulids to phylum status but considered Echiuroids to be a class of the Annelida. During the early 1900s, a biologist named Jon Stanton Whited devoted his working life to study the echiurans and classify many of its different species. In 1940, after the American marine biologist W. W. Newby had studied the embryology and development of &quot;Urechis caupo&quot;, he raised the group to phylum status.

They are now universally considered to represent derived annelid worms; as such, their ancestors were segmented worms but echiurans have secondarily lost their segmentation. Their presumed sister group is the Capitellidae.

Having no hard parts, these worms are seldom found as fossils. One of the oldest known unambiguous examples is &quot;Coprinoscolex ellogimus&quot; from the Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois, dating back to the Middle Pennsylvanian period. This exhibits a proboscis, cigar‐shaped body and convoluted gut, and shows that already at that time, echiurans were unsegmented and were essentially similar to modern forms. However, U-shaped burrow fossils that could be Echiuran have been found dating back to the Cambrian, and an Ordovician species of thalassematid named &quot;Llwygarua suzannae&quot; was found in the Castle Bank lagerstätte.

==Anatomy==
Spoon worms vary in size from the giant &quot;Ikeda taenioides&quot;, nearly long with its proboscis extended, to the minute &quot;Lissomyema&quot;, measuring just . 
Their bodies are generally cylindrical with two wider regions separated by a narrower region. There is a large extendible, scoop-shaped proboscis in front of the mouth which gives the animals their common name. This proboscis resembles that of peanut worms but it cannot be retracted into the body. It houses a brain and may be homologous to the prostomium of other annelids. The proboscis has rolled-in margins and a groove on the ventral surface. The distal end is sometimes forked. The proboscis can be very long; in the case of the Japanese species &quot;Ikeda taenioides&quot;, the proboscis can be long while the body is only . Even smaller species like &quot;Bonellia&quot; can have a proboscis a metre (yard) long. The proboscis is used primarily for feeding. Respiration takes place through the proboscis and the body wall, with some larger species also using cloacal irrigation. In this process, water is pumped into and out of the rear end of the gut through the anus.

Compared with other annelids, echiurans have relatively few setae (bristles). In most species, there are just two, located on the underside of the body just behind the proboscis, and often hooked. In others, such as &quot;Echiurus&quot;, there are also further setae near the posterior end of the animal. Unlike most annelids, adult echiurans have no trace of segmentation. Most echiurans are a dull grey or brown but a few species are more brightly coloured, such as the translucent green &quot;Listriolobus pelodes&quot;.

The body wall is muscular. It surrounds a large coelom which leads to a long looped intestine with an anus at the rear tip of the body. The intestine is highly coiled, giving it a considerable length in relation to the size of the animal. A pair of simple or branched diverticula are connected to the rectum. These are lined with numerous minute ciliated funnels that open directly into the body cavity, and are presumed to be excretory organs. The proboscis has a small coelomic cavity separated from the main coelom by a septum.

Echiurans do not have a distinct respiratory system, absorbing oxygen through the body wall of both the trunk and proboscis, and through the cloaca in &quot;Urechis&quot;. Although some species lack a blood vascular system, where it is present, it resembles that of other annelids. The blood is essentially colourless, although some haemoglobin-containing cells are present in the coelomic fluid of the main body cavity. There can be anywhere from one to over a hundred metanephridia for excreting nitrogenous waste, which typically open near the anterior end of the animal. The nervous system consists of a brain near the base of the proboscis, and a ventral nerve cord running the length of the body. Aside from the absence of segmentation, this is a similar arrangement to that of other annelids. Echiurans do not have any eyes or other distinct sense organs, but the proboscis is presumed to have a tactile sensory function.

==Distribution and habitat==

Echiurans are exclusively marine and the majority of species live in the Atlantic Ocean. They are mostly infaunal, occupying burrows in the seabed, either in the lower intertidal zone or the shallow subtidal (e.g. the genera &quot;Echiurus&quot;, &quot;Urechis&quot;, and &quot;Ikeda&quot;). Others live in holes in coral heads, and in rock crevices. Some are found in deep waters including at abyssal depths; in fact more than half the 70 species in Bonelliidae live below . They often congregate in sediments with high concentrations of organic matter. One species, &quot;Lissomyema mellita&quot;, which lives off the southeastern coast of the US, inhabits the tests (exoskeleton) of dead sand dollars. When the worm is very small, it enters the test and later becomes too large to leave.

In the 1970s, the spoon worm &quot;Listriolobus pelodes&quot; was found on the continental shelf off Los Angeles in numbers of up to 1,500 per square metre (11 square feet) near sewage outlets. The burrowing and feeding activities of these worms churned up and aerated the sediment and promoted a balanced ecosystem with a more diverse fauna than would otherwise have existed in this heavily polluted area.

==Behaviour==
A spoon worm can move about on the surface by extending its proboscis and grasping some object before pulling its body forward. Some worms, such as &quot;Echiurus&quot;, can leave the substrate entirely, swimming by use of the proboscis and contractions of the body wall.

Digging behaviour has been studied in &quot;Echiurus echiurus&quot;. When burrowing, the proboscis is raised and folded backwards and plays no part in the digging process. The front of the trunk is shaped into a wedge and pushed forward, with the two anterior chaetae (hooked chitinous bristles) being driven into the sediment. Next the rear end of the trunk is drawn forward and the posterior chaetae anchor it in place. These manoeuvres are repeated and the worm slowly digs its way forwards and downwards. It takes about forty minutes for the worm to disappear from view. The burrow descends diagonally and then flattens out, and it may be a metre or so long before ascending vertically to the surface.

Spoon worms are typically detritivores, extending the flexible and mobile proboscis and gathering organic particles that are within reach. Some species can expand the proboscis by ten times its contracted length. The proboscis is moved by the action of cilia on the lower (ventral) surface &quot;creeping&quot; it forward. When food particles are encountered, the sides of the proboscis curl inward to form a ciliated channel.

A worm such as &quot;Echiurus&quot;, living in the sediment, extends its proboscis from the rim of its burrow with the ventral side on the substrate. The surface of the proboscis is well equipped with mucous glands to which food particles adhere. The mucus is bundled into boluses by cilia and these are passed along the feeding groove by cilia to the mouth. The proboscis is periodically withdrawn into the burrow and later extended in another direction.

&quot;Urechidae&quot;, another group of tube-dwellers, has become filter feeders. It has a short proboscis and a ring of mucous glands at the front of its body. It expands its muscular body wall to deposit a ring of mucus on the burrow wall then retreats backwards, exuding mucus as it goes and spinning a mucus net. It then draws water through the burrow by peristaltic contractions and food particles stick to the net. When this is sufficiently clogged up, the spoon worm moves forward along its burrow devouring the net and the trapped particles. This process is then repeated and in a nutrient-rich area may take only a few minutes to complete. Large particles are squeezed out of the net and eaten by other invertebrates living commensally in the burrow. These typically include a small crab, a scale worm and often a fish lurking just inside the back entrance.

&quot;Ochetostoma erythrogrammon&quot; obtains its food by another method. it has two vertical burrows connected by a horizontal one. Stretching out its proboscis across the substrate it shovels material into its mouth before separating the edible particles. It can lengthen the proboscis dramatically while exploring new areas and periodically reverses its orientation in the burrow so as to use the back entrance to feed. Other spoon worms live concealed in rock crevices, empty gastropod shells, sand dollar tests and similar places, extending their proboscises into the open water to feed. Some are scavengers or detritivores, while others are interface grazers and some are suspension feeders.

While the proboscis of a burrowing spoon worm is on the surface it is at risk of predation by bottom-feeding fish. In some species, the proboscis will autotomise (break off) if attacked and the worm will regenerate a proboscis over the course of a few weeks. In a study in California, one of the most commonly found dietary items of the leopard shark was found to be the tube-dwelling innkeeper worm (&quot;Urechis caupo&quot;) which it extracted from the sediment by suction.

==Reproduction==
Echiurans are dioecious, with separate male and female individuals. The gonads are associated with the peritoneal membrane lining the body cavity, into which they release the gametes. The sperm and eggs complete their maturation in the body cavity, before being stored in genital sacs, which are specialised metanephridia. At spawning time, the genital sacs contract and the gametes are squeezed into the water column through pores on the worm&#x27;s ventral surface. Fertilization is external.

Fertilization is internal in the sexual dimorphic order Bonelliida, which has dwarf males living inside the female. Members of the order Echiurida have external fertilization and are sexual monomorphic.

Fertilized eggs hatch into free-swimming trochophore larvae. In some species, the larva briefly develops a segmented body before transforming into the adult body plan, supporting the theory that echiurans evolved from segmented ancestors resembling more typical annelids.

The species &quot;Bonellia viridis&quot;, also remarkable for the possible antibiotic properties of bonellin, the green chemical in its skin, is unusual for its extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are typically in body length, excluding the proboscis, but the males are only long, and spend their adult lives within the uterus of the female.

==Culinary Use==

Spoon worms are eaten in East and Southeast Asia. In South Korea fat innkeeper worms (&quot;Urechis unicinctus&quot;) are known as &quot;gaebul&quot; (개불). These worms are much prized and are often available at markets and stalls, chopped up and served raw in combination with raw sea cucumber, sea squirt and sea urchin, dressed with chili sauce and soy sauce. They are also eaten as a fermented product known as &quot;gaebul-jeot&quot;.

<text>The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), commonly referred to as hairybellies or hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06–3.0 mm), cylindrical, acoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly 800 species of gastrotrich have been described.

Gastrotrichs have a simple body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the reproductive organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, and at least one species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The name &quot;gastrotrich&quot; comes from Greek γαστήρ, &quot;gaster&quot; &#x27;stomach&#x27; and θρίξ, &quot;thrix&quot; &#x27;hair&#x27;. The name was coined by the Russian zoologist Élie Metchnikoff in 1865. The common name &quot;hairyback&quot; apparently arises from a mistranslation of &quot;gastrotrich&quot;.

The relationship of gastrotrichs to other phyla is unclear. Morphology suggests that they are close to the Gnathostomulida, the Rotifera, or the Nematoda. On the other hand, genetic studies place them as close relatives of the Platyhelminthes, the Ecdysozoa or the Lophotrochozoa. As of 2011, around 790 species have been described. The phylum contains a single class, divided into two orders: the Macrodasyida and the Chaetonotida. Edward Ruppert &quot;et al.&quot; report that the Macrodasyida are wholly marine, but two rare and poorly known species, &quot;Marinellina flagellata&quot; and &quot;Redudasys fornerise&quot;, are known from fresh water. The Chaetonotida comprises both marine and freshwater species.

==Anatomy==

Gastrotrichs vary in size from about in body length. They are bilaterally symmetrical, with a transparent strap-shaped or bowling pin-shaped body, arched dorsally and flattened ventrally. The anterior end is not clearly defined as a head but contains the sense organs, brain and pharynx. Cilia are found around the mouth and on the ventral surface of the head and body. The trunk contains the gut and the reproductive organs. At the posterior end of the body are two projections with cement glands that serve in adhesion. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive agent to sever the connection. In the Macrodasyida, there are additional adhesive glands at the anterior end and on the sides of the body.

The body wall consists of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and the interior of the animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.

The mouth is at the anterior end and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus is located on the ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.

In the chaetonotidans, the excretory system consists of a single pair of protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening along the side of the body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed &quot;cyrtocytes&quot;, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.

As is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.

==Distribution and habitat==

Gastrotrichs are cosmopolitan in distribution. They inhabit the interstitial spaces between particles in marine and freshwater environments, the surfaces of aquatic plants and other submerged objects and the surface film of water surrounding soil particles on land. They are also found in stagnant pools and anaerobic mud, where they thrive even in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. When pools dry up they can survive periods of desiccation as eggs, and some species are capable of forming cysts in harsh conditions. In marine sediments they have been known to reach 364 individuals per making them the third most common invertebrate in the sediment after nematodes and harpacticoid copepods. In freshwater they may reach a density of 158 individuals per and are the fifth most abundant group of invertebrates in the sediment.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In marine and freshwater environments, gastrotrichs form part of the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous: they feed by sucking small dead or living organic materials, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.

Like many microscopic animals, gastrotrich locomotion is primarily powered by hydrostatics, but movement occurs through different methods in different members of the group. Chaetonotids only have adhesive glands at the back and, in them, locomotion typically proceeds in a smooth gliding manner; the whole body is propelled forward by the rhythmic action of the cilia on the ventral surface. In the pelagic chaetonotid genus &quot;Stylochaeta&quot;, however, movement proceeds in jerks as the long, muscle-activated spines are forced rhythmically towards the side of the body. By contrast, with chaetonotids, macrodasyidans typically have multiple adhesive glands and move forward with a creeping action similar to that of a &quot;looper&quot; caterpillar. In response to a threat, the head and trunk can be rapidly pulled backwards, or the creeping movement can be reversed. Muscular action is important when the animal turns sideways and during copulation, when two individuals twine around each other.

==Reproduction and lifespan==

Gastrotrich reproduction and reproductive behaviour has been little studied. That of macrodasiyds probably most represents that of the ancestral lineage and these more primitive gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, possessing both male and female sex organs. There is generally a single pair of gonads, the anterior portion of which contains sperm-producing cells and the posterior portion producing ova. The sperm is sometimes packaged in spermatophores and is released through male gonopores that open, often temporarily, on the underside of the animal, roughly two-thirds of the way along the body. A copulatory organ on the tail collects the sperm and transfers it to the partner&#x27;s seminal receptacle through the female gonopore. Details of the process and the behaviour involved vary with the species, and there is a range of different accessory reproductive organs. During copulation, the &quot;male&quot; individual uses his copulatory organ to transfer sperm to his partner&#x27;s gonopore and fertilisation is internal. The fertilised eggs are released by rupture of the body wall which afterwards repairs itself. As is the case in most protostomes, development of the embryo is determinate, with each cell destined to become a specific part of the animal&#x27;s body. At least one species of gastrotrich, &quot;Urodasys viviparus&quot;, is viviparous.

Many species of chaetotonid gastrotrichs reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male portions of the reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 μm, they are still very large in comparison with the animals&#x27; size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days. In the laboratory, &quot;Lepidodermella squamatum&quot; has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.

Gastrotrichs demonstrate eutely, each species having an invariant genetically fixed number of cells as adults. Cell division ceases at the end of embryonic development and further growth is solely due to cell enlargement.

<text>Hemichordata ( ) is a phylum which consists of triploblastic, eucoelomate, and bilaterally symmetrical marine deuterostome animals, generally considered the sister group of the echinoderms. They appear in the Lower or Middle Cambrian and include two main classes: Enteropneusta (acorn worms), and Pterobranchia. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is known only from the larva of a single species, &quot;Planctosphaera pelagica&quot;. The class Graptolithina, formerly considered extinct, is now placed within the pterobranchs, represented by a single living genus &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;.

Acorn worms are solitary worm-shaped organisms. They generally live in burrows (the earliest secreted tubes) and are deposit feeders, but some species are pharyngeal filter feeders, while the family are free living detritivores. Many are well known for their production and accumulation of various halogenated phenols and pyrroles. Pterobranchs are filter-feeders, mostly colonial, living in a collagenous tubular structure called a coenecium.

The discovery of the stem group hemichordate &quot;Gyaltsenglossus&quot; shows that early hemichordates combined aspects of the two morphologically disparate classes.

== Anatomy ==
The body plan of hemichordates is characterized by a muscular organization. The anteroposterior axis is divided into three parts: the anterior prosome, the intermediate mesosome, and the posterior metasome.

The body of acorn worms is worm-shaped and divided into an anterior proboscis, an intermediate collar, and a posterior trunk. The proboscis is a muscular and ciliated organ used in locomotion and in the collection and transport of food particles. The mouth is located between the proboscis and the collar. The trunk is the longest part of the animal. It contains the pharynx, which is perforated with gill slits (or pharyngeal slits), the oesophagus, a long intestine, and a terminal anus. It also contains the gonads. A post-anal tail is present in juvenile members of the acorn worm family Harrimaniidae.

The prosome of pterobranchs is specialized into a muscular and ciliated cephalic shield used in locomotion and in secreting the coenecium. The mesosome extends into one pair (in the genus &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;) or several pairs (in the genus &quot;Cephalodiscus&quot;) of tentaculated arms used in filter feeding. The metasome, or trunk, contains a looped digestive tract, gonads, and extends into a contractile stalk that connects individuals to the other members of the colony, produced by asexual budding. In the genus &quot;Cephalodiscus&quot;, asexually produced individuals stay attached to the contractile stalk of the parent individual until completing their development. In the genus &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;, zooids are permanently connected to the rest of the colony via a common stolon system.

They have a diverticulum of the foregut called a stomochord, previously thought to be related to the chordate notochord, but this is most likely the result of convergent evolution rather than a homology. A hollow neural tube exists among some species (at least in early life), probably a primitive trait that they share with the common ancestor of chordata and the rest of the deuterostomes. Hemichordates have a nerve net and longitudinal nerves, but no brain.

Some species biomineralize in calcium carbonate.

===Circulatory system===

Hemichordates have an open circulatory system. The heart vesicle is located dorsally within the proboscis complex, and does not contain any blood. Instead it moves the blood indirectly by pulsating against the dorsal blood vessel.

== Development ==
Together with the echinoderms, the hemichordates form the Ambulacraria, which are the closest extant phylogenetic relatives of chordates. Thus these marine worms are of great interest for the study of the origins of chordate development. There are several species of hemichordates, with a moderate diversity of embryological development among these species. Hemichordates are classically known to develop in two ways, both directly and indirectly. Hemichordates are a phylum composed of two classes, the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs, both being forms of marine worm.

The enteropneusts have two developmental strategies: direct and indirect development. The indirect developmental strategy includes an extended pelagic plankotrophic tornaria larval stage, which means that this hemichordate exists in a larval stage that feeds on plankton before turning into an adult worm. The Pterobranch genus most extensively studied is &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; from Plymouth, England and from Bermuda.

The following details the development of two popularly studied species of the hemichordata phylum &quot;Saccoglossus kowalevskii&quot; and &quot;Ptychodera flava&quot;. &quot;Saccoglossus kowalevskii&quot; is a direct developer and &quot;Ptychodera flava&quot; is an indirect developer. Most of what has been detailed in Hemichordate development has come from hemichordates that develop directly.

=== &quot;Ptychodera flava&quot; ===
&quot;P. flava’s&quot; early cleavage pattern is similar to that of &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot;. The first and second cleavages from the single cell zygote of &quot;P. flava&quot; are equal cleavages, are orthogonal to each other and both include the animal and vegetal poles of the embryo. The third cleavage is equal and equatorial so that the embryo has four blastomeres both in the vegetal and the animal pole. The fourth division occurs mainly in blastomeres in the animal pole, which divide transversally as well as equally to make eight blastomeres. The four vegetal blastomeres divide equatorially but unequally and they give rise to four big macromeres and four smaller micromeres. Once this fourth division has occurred, the embryo has reached a 16 cell stage. &quot;P. flava&quot; has a 16 cell embryo with four vegetal micromeres, eight animal mesomeres and four larger macromeres. Further divisions occur until &quot;P. flava&quot; finishes the blastula stage and goes on to gastrulation. The animal mesomeres of &quot;P. flava&quot; go on to give rise to the larva’s ectoderm, animal blastomeres also appear to give rise to these structures though the exact contribution varies from embryo to embryo. The macromeres give rise to the posterior larval ectoderm and the vegetal micromeres give rise to the internal endomesodermal tissues. Studies done on the potential of the embryo at different stages have shown that at both the two and four cell stage of development &quot;P. flava&quot; blastomeres can go on to give rise to a tornaria larvae, so fates of these embryonic cells don’t seem to be established till after this stage.

=== &quot;Saccoglossus kowalevskii&quot; ===
Eggs of &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot; are oval in shape and become spherical in shape after fertilization. The first cleavage occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole and usually is equal though very often can also be unequal. The second cleavage to reach the embryos four cell stage also occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole in an approximately equal fashion though like the first cleavage it’s possible to have an unequal division. The eight cell stage cleavage is latitudinal; so that each cell from the four cell stage goes on to make two cells. The fourth division occurs first in the cells of the animal pole, which end up making eight blastomeres (mesomeres) that are not radially symmetric, then the four vegetal pole blastomeres divide to make a level of four large blastomeres (macromeres) and four very small blastomeres (micromeres). The fifth cleavage occurs first in the animal cells and then in the vegetal cells to give a 32 cell blastomere. The sixth cleavage occurs in a similar order and completes a 64 cell stage, finally the seventh cleavage marks the end of the cleavage stage with a blastula with 128 blastomeres. This structure goes on to go through gastrulation movements which will determine the body plan of the resulting gill slit larva, this larva will ultimately give rise to the marine acorn worm.

=== Genetic control of dorsal-ventral hemichordate patterning ===
Much of the genetic work done on hemichordates has been done to make comparison with chordates, so many of the genetic markers identified in this group are also found in chordates or are homologous to chordates in some way. Studies of this nature have been done particularly on &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot;, and like chordates &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot; has dorsalizing bmp-like factors such as &quot;bmp 2/4&quot;, which is homologous to &quot;Drosophila&quot;’s decapentaplegic dpp. The expression of &quot;bmp2/4&quot; begins at the onset of gastrulation on the ectodermal side of the embryo, and as gastrulation progresses its expression is narrowed down to the dorsal midline but is not expressed in the post-anal tail. The bmp antagonist chordin is also expressed in the endoderm of gastrulating &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot;. Besides these well known dorsalizing factors, further molecules known to be involved in dorsal ventral patterning are also present in &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot;, such as a netrin that groups with netrin gene class 1 and 2. Netrin is important in patterning of the neural system in chordates, as well as is the molecule Shh, but &quot;S. kowalevskii&quot; was only found to have one hh gene and it appears to be expressed in a region that is uncommon to where it is usually expressed in developing chordates along the ventral midline.

== Classification ==

Hemichordata are divided into two classes: the Enteropneusta, commonly called acorn worms, and the Pterobranchia, which includes the graptolites. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is proposed based on a single species known only from larvae. The phylum contains about 120 living species. Hemichordata appears to be sister to the Echinodermata as Ambulacraria; Xenoturbellida may be basal to that grouping. Pterobranchia may be derived from within Enteropneusta, making Enteropneusta paraphyletic. It is possible that the extinct organism &quot;Etacystis&quot; is a member of the Hemichordata, either within or with close affinity to the Pterobranchia.

There are 130 described species of Hemichordata and many new species are being discovered, especially in the deep sea.

<text>Acanthocephala (Greek , &#x27; &#x27;thorn&#x27; + ,&#x27; &#x27;head&#x27;) is a group of parasitic worms known as acanthocephalans, thorny-headed worms, or spiny-headed worms, characterized by the presence of an proboscis, armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the gut wall of its host. Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, involving at least two hosts, which may include invertebrates, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. About 1,420 species have been described.

The Acanthocephala were long thought to be a discrete phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are descended from, and should be considered as, highly modified rotifers. This unified taxon is sometimes known as Syndermata, or simply as Rotifera, with the acanthocephalans described as a subclass of a rotifer class Hemirotatoria.

== History ==

The earliest recognisable description of Acanthocephala – a worm with a proboscis armed with hooks – was made by Italian author Francesco Redi (1684). In 1771, Joseph Koelreuter proposed the name Acanthocephala. Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller independently called them &quot;Echinorhynchus&quot; in 1776. Karl Rudolphi in 1809 formally named them Acanthocephala.

== Evolutionary history ==

The oldest known remains of acanthocephalans are eggs found in a coprolite from the Late Cretaceous Bauru Group of Brazil, around 70–80 million years old, likely from a crocodyliform. The group may have originated substantially earlier.

== Phylogeny ==
Acanthocephalans are highly adapted to a parasitic mode of life, and have lost many organs and structures through evolutionary processes. This makes determining relationships with other higher taxa through morphological comparison problematic. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S ribosomal gene has revealed that the Acanthocephala are most closely related to the rotifers. They are possibly closer to the two rotifer classes Bdelloidea and Monogononta than to the other class, Seisonidea, producing the names and relationships shown in the cladogram below.

The three rotifer classes and the Acanthocephala make up a clade called Syndermata. This clade is placed in the Gnathifera.

A study of the gene order in the mitochondria suggests that Seisonidea and Acanthocephala are sister clades and that the Bdelloidea are the sister clade to this group.

Currently the phylum is divided into four classes – Palaeacanthocephala, Archiacanthocephala, Polyacanthocephala and Eoacanthocephala. The monophyletic Archiacanthocephala are the sister taxon of a clade comprising Eoacanthocephala and the monophyletic Palaeacanthocephala.

==Morphology==


Several morphological characteristics distinguish acanthocephalans from other phyla of parasitic worms.

===Digestion===

Acanthocephalans lack a mouth or alimentary canal. This is a feature they share with the cestoda (tapeworms), although the two groups are not closely related. Adult stages live in the intestines of their host and uptake nutrients which have been digested by the host, directly, through their body surface. The acanthocephalans lack an excretory system, although some species have been shown to possess flame cells (protonephridia).

===Proboscis===

The most notable feature of the acanthocephala is the presence of an anterior, protrudable proboscis that is usually covered with spiny hooks (hence the common name: thorny or spiny headed worm). The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host. The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually: longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis. The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.

Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a &quot;septum&quot; or &quot;proboscis sheath&quot;. Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other. Their contraction causes the proboscis to be invaginated into its cavity. The whole proboscis apparatus can also be, at least partially, withdrawn into the body cavity, and this is effected by two retractor muscles which run from the posterior aspect of the septum to the body wall.

Some of the acanthocephalans (perforating acanthocephalans) can insert their proboscis in the intestine of the host and open the way to the abdominal cavity.

=== Size ===

The size of these animals varies greatly, ranging from a few millimetres in length to &quot;Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus&quot;, which measures from . A curious feature shared by both larva and adult is the large size of many of the cells, e.g. the nerve cells and cells forming the uterine bell. Polyploidy is common, with up to 343n having been recorded in some species.

===Skin===

The body surface of the acanthocephala is peculiar. Externally, the skin has a thin tegument covering the epidermis, which consists of a syncytium with no cell walls. The syncytium is traversed by a series of branching tubules containing fluid and is controlled by a few wandering, amoeboid nuclei. Inside the syncytium is an irregular layer of circular muscle fibres, and within this again some rather scattered longitudinal fibres; there is no endothelium. In their micro-structure the muscular fibres resemble those of nematodes.

Except for the absence of the longitudinal fibres the skin of the proboscis resembles that of the body, but the fluid-containing tubules of the proboscis are shut off from those of the body. The canals of the proboscis open into a circular vessel which runs round its base. From the circular canal two sac-like projections called the &quot;lemnisci&quot; run into the cavity of the body, alongside the proboscis cavity. Each consists of a prolongation of the syncytial material of the proboscis skin, penetrated by canals and sheathed with a muscular coat. They seem to act as reservoirs into which the fluid which is used to keep the proboscis &quot;erect&quot; can withdraw when it is retracted, and from which the fluid can be driven out when it is wished to expand the proboscis.

===Nervous system===
The central ganglion of the nervous system lies behind the proboscis sheath or septum. It innervates the proboscis and projects two stout trunks posteriorly which supply the body. Each of these trunks is surrounded by muscles, and this nerve-muscle complex is called a &quot;retinaculum&quot;. In the male at least there is also a genital ganglion. Some scattered may possibly be sense-organs.

==Life cycles==
Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, involving a number of hosts, for both developmental and resting stages. Complete life cycles have been worked out for only 25 species.

===Reproduction===

The Acanthocephala are dioecious (an individual organism is either male or female). There is a structure called the &quot;genital ligament&quot; which runs from the posterior end of the proboscis sheath to the posterior end of the body. In the male, two testes lie on either side of this. Each opens in a vas deferens which bears three diverticula or &quot;vesiculae seminales&quot;. The male also possesses three pairs of cement glands, found behind the testes, which pour their secretions through a duct into the vasa deferentia. These unite and end in a penis which opens posteriorly.

In the female, the ovaries are found, like the testes, as rounded bodies along the ligament. From the ovaries, masses of ova dehisce into the body cavity, floating in its fluids for fertilization by male&#x27;s sperm. After fertilization, each egg contains a developing embryo. (These embryos hatch into first stage larva.) The fertilized eggs are brought into the uterus by actions of the &quot;uterine bell&quot;, a funnel like opening continuous with the uterus. At the junction of the bell and the uterus there is a second, smaller opening situated dorsally. The bell &quot;swallows&quot; the matured eggs and passes them on into the uterus. (Immature embryos are passed back into the body cavity through the dorsal opening.) From the uterus, mature eggs leave the female&#x27;s body via her oviduct, pass into the host&#x27;s alimentary canal and are expelled from the host&#x27;s body within feces.

===Release===

Having been expelled by the female, the acanthocephalan egg is released along with the feces of the host. For development to occur, the egg, containing the acanthor, needs to be ingested by an arthropod, usually a crustacean (there is one known life cycle which uses a mollusc as a first intermediate host). Inside the intermediate host, the acanthor is released from the egg and develops into an acanthella. It then penetrates the gut wall, moves into the body cavity, encysts, and begins transformation into the infective cystacanth stage. This form has all the organs of the adult save the reproductive ones.

The parasite is released when the first intermediate host is ingested. This can be by a suitable final host, in which case the cystacanth develops into a mature adult, or by a paratenic host, in which the parasite again forms a cyst. When consumed by a suitable final host, the cycstacant &quot;excysts&quot;, everts its proboscis and pierces the gut wall. It then feeds, grows and develops its sexual organs. Adult worms then mate. The male uses the excretions of its &quot;cement glands&quot; to plug the vagina of the female, preventing subsequent matings from occurring. Embryos develop inside the female, and the life cycle repeats.

===Host control===

Thorny-headed worms begin their life cycle inside invertebrates that reside in marine or freshwater systems. One example is &quot;Polymorphus paradoxus.&quot; &quot;Gammarus lacustris&quot;, a small crustacean that inhabits ponds and rivers, is one invertebrate that &quot;P. paradoxus&quot; may occupy; ducks are one of the definitive hosts.

This crustacean is preyed on by ducks and hides by avoiding light and staying away from the surface. However, infection by &quot;P. paradoxus&quot; changes its behavior and appearance in a number of ways that increase its chance of being eaten. First, infection significantly reduces &quot;G. lacustris&quot;&#x27;s photophobia; as a result, it becomes attracted toward light and swims to the surface. Second, an infected organism will even go so far as to find a rock or a plant on the surface, clamp its mouth down, and latch on, making it easy prey for the duck. Finally, infection reduces the pigment distribution and amount in &quot;G. lacustris,&quot; causing the host to turn blue; unlike their normal brown colour, this makes the crustacean stand out and increases the chance the duck will see it.

Experiments have shown that altered serotonin levels are likely responsible for at least some of these changes in behaviour. One experiment found that serotonin induces clinging behavior in &quot;G. lacustris&quot; similar to that seen in infected organisms. Another showed that infected &quot;G. lacustris&quot; had approximately 3 times as many serotonin-producing sites in its ventral nerve cord. Furthermore, experiments in closely-related species of &quot;Polymorphus&quot; and &quot;Pomphorhynchus&quot; infecting other &quot;Gammarus&quot; species confirmed this relation: infected organisms were considerably more attracted to light and had higher serotonin levels, while the phototropism could be duplicated by injections of serotonin.

=== Effects on hosts ===
&quot;Polymorphus&quot; spp. are parasites of seabirds, particularly the eider duck (&quot;Somateria mollissima&quot;). Heavy infections of up to 750 parasites per bird are common, causing ulceration to the gut, disease and seasonal mortality. Recent research has suggested that there is no evidence of pathogenicity of &quot;Polymorphus&quot; spp. to intermediate crab hosts. The cystacanth stage is long lived and probably remains infectious throughout the life of the crab.

== Economic impact ==
Acanthocephalosis, a disease caused by &quot;Acanthacephalus&quot; infection, is prevalent in aquaculture, occurring in Atlantic salmon, rainbow and brown trout, tilapia, and tambaqui. Increasing occurrence in Brazilian farming of tambaqui has been reported, and in 2003 &quot;Acanthacephalus&quot; was first reported in cultured red snapper in Taiwan. 

The life cycle of &quot;Polymorphus&quot; spp. normally occurs between sea ducks (e.g. eiders and scoters) and small crabs. Infections found in commercial-sized lobsters in Canada were probably acquired from crabs that form an important dietary item of lobsters. Cystacanths occurring in lobsters can cause economic loss to fishermen. There are no known methods of prevention or control.

== Human infections ==

In humans, it causes the disease acanthocephaliasis. The earliest known infection was found in a prehistoric man in Utah. This infection was dated to 1869 ± 160 BC. The species involved was thought to be &quot;Moniliformis clarki&quot; which is still common in the area. 

The first report of an isolate in historic times was by Lambl in 1859 when he isolated &quot;Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus&quot; from a child in Prague. Lindemann in 1865 reported that this organism was commonly isolated in Russia. The reason for this was discovered by Schneider in 1871 when he found that an intermediate host, the scarabaeid beetle grub, was commonly eaten raw. 

The first report of clinical symptoms was by Calandruccio who in 1888 while in Italy infected himself by ingesting larvae. He reported gastrointestinal disturbances and shed eggs in two weeks. Subsequent natural infections have since been reported. 

Eight species have been isolated from humans to date. &quot;Moniliformis moniliformis&quot; is the most common isolate. Other isolates include &quot;Acanthocephalus bufonis&quot; and &quot;Corynosoma strumosum&quot;.

<doc id="43148" wikidata="Q5183" url="?curid=43148" title="Loricifera">
<text>Loricifera (from Latin, &quot;&quot;, corselet (armour) + &quot;ferre&quot;, to bear) is a phylum of very small to microscopic marine cycloneuralian sediment-dwelling animals with 43 described species. and approximately 100 more that have been collected and not yet described. Their sizes range from 100 μm to .

They are characterised by a protective outer case called a lorica and their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. The phylum was discovered in 1983 by R.M. Kristensen, near Roscoff, France. They are among the most recently discovered groups of animals. They attach themselves quite firmly to the substrate, and hence remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and described in 1983. They are found at all depths, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes.

==Morphology==
The animals have a head, mouth, and digestive system, as well as the lorica. The head (which contains the mouth and the brain), a trunk region surrounded by six plates that make up the &#x27;lorica&#x27; or corselet and – in between these two – the neck region. Loricifera have a well developed brain and each scalid is individually connected to the brain by nerves.
The armor-like lorica consists of a protective external shell or case of encircling plicae. There is no circulatory system and no endocrine system. Many of the larvae are acoelomate, with some adults being pseudocoelomate, and some remaining acoelomate. Development is generally direct, though there are so-called Higgins larvae, which differ from adults in several respects. As adults, the animals are gonochoric. Very complex and plastic life cycles of pliciloricids include also paedogenetic stages with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction. Most Loricifera are dioecious, meaning there are males and females. However, there are a few species known to be hermaphroditic, which means they contain both male and female reproductive organs. Fossils have been dated to the late Cambrian.

==Taxonomic affinity==

Morphological studies have traditionally placed the phylum in the Vinctiplicata with the Priapulida; this plus the Kinorhyncha constitutes the taxon Scalidophora. The three phyla share four characters in common – chitinous cuticle, rings of scalids on the introvert, flosculi, and two rings of introvert retracts. However, despite a 2015 study showing the phylum&#x27;s closest relatives being the Panarthropoda, a 2022 study again showed that it belonged to the Scalidophora and told that further, more comprehensive genetic tests will be required to find its actual position in Ecdysozoa.
==Evolutionary history==
The loriciferans are believed to be miniaturized descendants of a larger organism, perhaps resembling the Cambrian fossil &quot;Sirilorica&quot;. However, the fossil record of the microscopic non-mineralized group is (perhaps unsurprisingly) scarce, so it is difficult to trace out the evolutionary history of the phylum in any detail.

The 2017 discovery of the Cambrian &quot;Eolorica deadwoodensis&quot; may shed some light on the group&#x27;s history.

==In anoxic environments==
Three species of Loricifera have been found in the oxygen-free sediments at the bottom of the L&#x27;Atalante basin in Mediterranean Sea, more than 3,000 meters down, the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an anoxic environment. Initially, it was thought that they are able to do this because their mitochondria act like hydrogenosomes, allowing them to respire anaerobically. However, by 2021, questions arose as to whether or not they have mitochondria.

The newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen, and they are less than a millimetre in size. They were collected from a deep basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where they inhabit a nearly salt-saturated brine that, because of its density (&gt; 1.2 g/cm3), does not mix with the waters above. As a consequence, this environment is completely anoxic and, due to the activity of sulfate reducers, contains sulphide at a concentration of 2.9 mM. Despite such harsh conditions, this anoxic and sulphidic environment is teeming with microbial life, both chemosynthetic prokaryotes that are primary producers, and a broad diversity of eukaryotic heterotrophs at the next trophic level.

<doc id="43149" wikidata="Q299965" url="?curid=43149" title="Ralph Ellison">
<text>Ralph Waldo Ellison (March 1, 1913 – April 16, 1994) was an American writer, literary critic, and scholar best known for his novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, which won the National Book Award in 1953.

Ellison wrote &quot;Shadow and Act&quot; (1964), a collection of political, social, and critical essays, and &quot;Going to the Territory&quot; (1986). &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed him &quot;among the gods of America&#x27;s literary Parnassus&quot;.

A posthumous novel, &quot;Juneteenth&quot;, was published after being assembled from voluminous notes Ellison left upon his death.

==Early life==
Ralph Waldo Ellison, named after Ralph Waldo Emerson, was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Lewis Alfred Ellison and Ida Millsap, on March 1, 1913. He was the second of three sons; firstborn Alfred died in infancy, and younger brother Herbert Maurice (or Millsap) was born in 1916. Lewis Alfred Ellison, a small-business owner and a construction foreman, died in 1916, after work-related injury and a failed operation. The elder Ellison loved literature, and doted on his children. Ralph later discovered, as an adult, that his father had hoped he would grow up to be a poet.

In 1921, Ellison&#x27;s mother and her children moved to Gary, Indiana, where she had a brother. According to Ellison, his mother felt that &quot;my brother and I would have a better chance of reaching manhood if we grew up in the north.&quot; When she did not find a job and her brother lost his, the family returned to Oklahoma, where Ellison worked as a busboy, a shoeshine boy, hotel waiter, and a dentist&#x27;s assistant. From the father of a neighborhood friend, he received free lessons for playing trumpet and alto saxophone, and would go on to become the school bandmaster.

Ida remarried three times after Lewis died. However, the family life was precarious, and Ralph worked various jobs during his youth and teens to assist with family support. While attending Douglass High School, he also found time to play on the school&#x27;s football team. He graduated from high school in 1931. He worked for a year, and found the money to make a down payment on a trumpet, using it to play with local musicians, and to take further music lessons. At Douglass, he was influenced by principal Inman E. Page and his daughter, music teacher Zelia N. Breaux.

==At Tuskegee Institute==
Ellison applied twice for admission to Tuskegee Institute, the prestigious all-black university in Alabama founded by Booker T. Washington. He was finally admitted in 1933 for lack of a trumpet player in its orchestra. Ellison hopped freight trains to get to Alabama, and was soon to find out that the institution was no less class-conscious than white institutions generally were.

Ellison&#x27;s outsider position at Tuskegee &quot;sharpened his satirical lens,&quot; critic Hilton Als believes: &quot;Standing apart from the university&#x27;s air of sanctimonious Negritude enabled him to write about it.&quot; In passages of &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;he looks back with scorn and despair on the snivelling ethos that ruled at Tuskegee.&quot;

Tuskegee&#x27;s music department was perhaps the most renowned department at the school, headed by composer William L. Dawson. Ellison also was guided by the department&#x27;s piano instructor, Hazel Harrison. While he studied music primarily in his classes, he spent his free time in the library with modernist classics. He cited reading T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; as a major awakening moment. In 1934, he began to work as a desk clerk at the university library, where he read James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. Librarian Walter Bowie Williams enthusiastically let Ellison share in his knowledge.

A major influence upon Ellison was English teacher Morteza Drexel Sprague, to whom Ellison later dedicated his essay collection &quot;Shadow and Act&quot;. He opened Ellison&#x27;s eyes to &quot;the possibilities of literature as a living art&quot; and to &quot;the glamour he would always associate with the literary life.&quot; Through Sprague, Ellison became familiar with Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, identifying with the &quot;brilliant, tortured anti-heroes&quot; of those works.

As a child, Ellison evidenced what would become a lifelong interest in audio technology, starting by taking apart and rebuilding radios, and later moving on to constructing and customizing elaborate hi-fi stereo systems as an adult. He discussed this passion in a December 1955 essay, &quot;Living With Music&quot;, in &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine. Ellison scholar John S. Wright contends that this deftness with the ins-and-outs of electronic devices went on to inform Ellison&#x27;s approach to writing and the novel form. Ellison remained at Tuskegee until 1936, and decided to leave before completing the requirements for a degree.

==In New York==
Desiring to study sculpture, he moved to New York City on July 5, 1936, and found lodging at a YMCA on 135th Street in Harlem, then &quot;the culture capital of black America&quot;. He met Langston Hughes, &quot;Harlem&#x27;s unofficial diplomat&quot; of the Depression era, and one—as one of the country&#x27;s celebrity black authors—who could live from his writing. Hughes introduced him to the black literary establishment with Communist sympathies.

He met several artists who would influence his later life, including the artist Romare Bearden and the author Richard Wright (with whom he would have a long and complicated relationship). After Ellison wrote a book review for Wright, Wright encouraged him to write fiction as a career. Ellison&#x27;s first published story was &quot;Hymie&#x27;s Bull&quot;, inspired by his 1933 hoboing on a train with his uncle to get to Tuskegee. From 1937 to 1944, Ellison had more than 20 book reviews, as well as short stories and articles, published in magazines such as &quot;New Challenge&quot; and &quot;The New Masses&quot;.

Wright was then openly associated with the Communist Party, and Ellison was publishing and editing for communist publications, although his &quot;affiliation was quieter&quot;, according to historian Carol Polsgrove in &quot;Divided Minds&quot;. Both Wright and Ellison lost their faith in the Communist Party during World War II, when they felt the party had betrayed African Americans and replaced Marxist class politics with social reformism. In a letter to Wright, dated August 18, 1945, Ellison poured out his anger with party leaders: &quot;If they want to play ball with the bourgeoisie they needn&#x27;t think they can get away with it. ... Maybe we can&#x27;t smash the atom, but we can, with a few well chosen, well written words, smash all that crummy filth to hell.&quot; In the wake of this disillusion, Ellison began writing &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; a novel that was, in part, his response to the party&#x27;s betrayal.
In 1938, Ellison met Rose Araminta Poindexter, a woman two years his senior. Rose Araminta Poindexter was an actress, starring in films such as &quot;The Upright Sinner&quot; (1931). Poindexter and Ellison were married in late 1938. Rose was a stage actress, and continued her career after their marriage. In biographer Arnold Rampersad&#x27;s assessment of Ellison&#x27;s taste in women, he was searching for one &quot;physically attractive and smart who would love, honor, and obey him—but not challenge his intellect.&quot; At first they lived at 312 West 122nd Street, Rose&#x27;s apartment, but moved to 453 West 140th Street after her income shrank. In 1941 he briefly had an affair with Sanora Babb, which he confessed to his wife afterward, and in 1943 the marriage was over. The couple officially divorced in 1945. As of April 2023, Poindexter remains alive at 111 years old.

At the start of World War II, Ellison was classed 1A by the local Selective Service System, and thus eligible for the draft. However, he was not drafted. Toward the end of the war, he enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine. In 1946, he married Fanny McConnell, an accomplished person in her own right: a scholarship graduate of the University of Iowa who was a founder of the Negro People&#x27;s Theater in Chicago and a writer for &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;. While he wrote &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, she helped support Ellison financially by working for American Medical Center for Burma Frontiers (the charity supporting Gordon S. Seagrave&#x27;s medical missionary work). In 1946, Ellison composed and wrote the lyrics for at least two songs, &quot;Flirty&quot; and &quot;It Would Only Hurt Me If I Knew&quot;. From 1947 to 1951, he earned some money writing book reviews but spent most of his time working on &quot;Invisible Man&quot;. Fanny also helped type Ellison&#x27;s longhand text and assisted him in editing the typescript as it progressed.

Published in 1952, &quot;Invisible Man&quot; explores the theme of a person&#x27;s search for their identity and place in society, as seen from the perspective of the first-person narrator, an unnamed African American man, first in the Deep South and then in the New York City of the 1930s. In contrast to his contemporaries such as Richard Wright and James Baldwin, Ellison created characters that are dispassionate, educated, articulate, and self-aware. Through the protagonist, Ellison explores the contrasts between the Northern and Southern varieties of racism and their alienating effect. The narrator is &quot;invisible&quot; in a figurative sense, in that &quot;people refuse to see&quot; him, and also experiences a kind of dissociation. The novel also contains taboo issues such as incest and the controversial subject of communism.

== Later years ==
In 1962, the futurist Herman Kahn recruited Ellison as a consultant to the Hudson Institute in an attempt to broaden its scope beyond defense-related research.

In 1964, Ellison published &quot;Shadow and Act&quot;, a collection of essays, and began to teach at Bard College, Rutgers University and Yale University, while continuing to work on his novel. The following year, a Book Week poll of 200 critics, authors, and editors was released that proclaimed &quot;Invisible Man&quot; the most important novel since World War II.

In 1967, Ellison experienced a major house fire at his summer home in Plainfield, Massachusetts, in which he claimed more than 300 pages of his second novel manuscript were lost. A perfectionist regarding the art of the novel, Ellison had said in accepting his National Book Award for &quot;Invisible Man&quot; that he felt he had made &quot;an attempt at a major novel&quot; and, despite the award, he was unsatisfied with the book. Ellison ultimately wrote more than 2,000 pages of this second novel but never finished it.

Ellison died on April 16, 1994, of pancreatic cancer and was interred in a crypt at Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan.

==Awards and recognition==

&quot;Invisible Man&quot; won the 1953 US National Book Award for Fiction.

The award was his ticket into the American literary establishment. He eventually was admitted to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, received two President&#x27;s Medals (from Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan) and a State Medal from France. He was the first African-American admitted to the Century Association and was awarded an honorary Doctorate from Harvard University. Disillusioned by his experience with the Communist Party, he used his new fame to speak out for literature as a moral instrument. In 1955 he traveled to Europe, visiting and lecturing, settling for a time in Rome, where he wrote an essay that appeared in a 1957 Bantam anthology called &quot;A New Southern Harvest&quot;. Robert Penn Warren was in Rome during the same period, and the two writers became close friends. Later, Warren would interview Ellison about his thoughts on race, history, and the Civil Rights Movement for his book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot; In 1958, Ellison returned to the United States to take a position teaching American and Russian literature at Bard College and to begin a second novel, &quot;Juneteenth&quot;. During the 1950s, he corresponded with his lifelong friend, the writer Albert Murray. In their letters they commented on the development of their careers, the Civil Rights Movement, and other common interests including jazz. Much of this material was published in the collection &quot;Trading Twelves&quot; (2000).

Writing essays about both the black experience and his love for jazz music, Ellison continued to receive major awards for his work. In 1969, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom; the following year, he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France and became a permanent member of the faculty at New York University as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities, serving from 1970 to 1980.

In 1975, Ellison was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and his hometown of Oklahoma City honored him with the dedication of the Ralph Waldo Ellison Library. Continuing to teach, Ellison published mostly essays, and in 1984, he received the New York City College&#x27;s Langston Hughes Medal. In 1985, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1986, his &quot;Going to the Territory&quot; was published; this is a collection of seventeen essays that included insight into southern novelist William Faulkner and Ellison&#x27;s friend Richard Wright, as well as the music of Duke Ellington and the contributions of African Americans to America&#x27;s national identity.
In 1992, Ellison was awarded a special achievement award from the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards; his artistic achievements included work as a sculptor, musician, photographer, and college professor as well as his writing output. He taught at Bard College, Rutgers University, the University of Chicago, and New York University. Ellison was also a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.

==Legacy and posthumous publications==
After Ellison&#x27;s death, more manuscripts were discovered in his home, resulting in the publication of &quot;Flying Home and Other Stories&quot; in 1996. In 1999, his second novel, &quot;Juneteenth&quot;, was published under the editorship of John F. Callahan, a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark College and Ellison&#x27;s literary executor. It was a 368-page condensation of more than 2,000 pages written by Ellison over a period of 40 years. All the manuscripts of this incomplete novel were published collectively on January 26, 2010, by Modern Library, under the title &quot;Three Days Before the Shooting...&quot;

On February 18, 2014, the USPS issued a 91¢ stamp honoring Ralph Ellison in its Literary Arts series.

A park on 150th Street and Riverside Drive in Harlem (near 730 Riverside Drive, Ellison&#x27;s principal residence from the early 1950s until his death) was dedicated to Ellison on May 1, 2003. In the park stands a 15 by 8-foot bronze slab with a &quot;cut-out man figure&quot; inspired by his book &quot;Invisible Man&quot;.

<text>Richard Nathaniel Wright (September 4, 1908 – November 28, 1960) was an American author of novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction. Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid 20th centuries suffering discrimination and violence. His best known works include the novella collection &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; (1938), the novel &quot;Native Son&quot; (1940), and the memoir &quot;Black Boy&quot; (1945). Literary critics believe his work helped change race relations in the United States in the mid-20th century.

== Early life and education ==
===Childhood in the South===
Richard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908, at Rucker&#x27;s Plantation, between the train town of Roxie and the larger river city of Natchez, Mississippi. He was the son of Nathan Wright, a sharecropper, and Ella (Wilson), a schoolteacher. His parents were born free after the Civil War; both sets of his grandparents had been born into slavery and freed as a result of the war. Each of his grandfathers had taken part in the U.S. Civil War and gained freedom through service: his paternal grandfather, Nathan Wright, had served in the 28th United States Colored Troops; his maternal grandfather, Richard Wilson, escaped from slavery in the South to serve in the U.S. Navy as a Landsman in April 1865.

Richard&#x27;s father left the family when Richard was six years old, and he did not see Richard for 25 years. In 1911 or 1912, Ella moved to Natchez, Mississippi, to be with her parents. While living in his grandparents&#x27; home, he accidentally set the house on fire. Wright&#x27;s mother was so angry that she beat him until he was unconscious. In 1915, Ella put her sons in Settlement House, a Methodist orphanage, for a short time. He was enrolled at Howe Institute in Memphis from 1915 to 1916. In 1916, his mother moved with Richard and his younger brother to live with her sister Maggie (Wilson) and Maggie&#x27;s husband Silas Hoskins (born 1882) in Elaine, Arkansas. This part of Arkansas was in the Mississippi Delta, where former cotton plantations had been. The Wrights were forced to flee after Silas Hoskins &quot;disappeared&quot;, reportedly killed by a white man who coveted his successful saloon business. After his mother became incapacitated by a stroke, Richard was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle Clark Wilson and aunt Jodie in Greenwood, Mississippi. At the age of 12, Richard had not yet had a single complete year of schooling.

Soon Richard with his younger brother and mother returned to the home of his maternal grandmother, which was now in the state capital, Jackson, Mississippi, where he lived from early 1920 until late 1925. His grandparents, still angry at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother. But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher. After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.

In his grandparents&#x27; Seventh-day Adventist home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray so he might build a relationship with God. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother&#x27;s home when she would not allow him to work on the Adventist Sabbath, Saturday. His aunt&#x27;s and grandparents&#x27; overbearing attempts to control him caused him to carry over hostility towards Biblical and Christian teachings to solve life&#x27;s problems. This theme would weave through his writings throughout his life.

At the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, &quot;The Voodoo of Hell&#x27;s Half-Acre&quot;, in the local Black newspaper &quot;Southern Register.&quot; No copies survive. In Chapter 7 of &quot;Black Boy&quot;, he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow&#x27;s home.

In 1923, after excelling in grade school and junior high, Wright earned the position of class valedictorian of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925. He was assigned to write a speech to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Before graduation day, he was called to the principal&#x27;s office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying: &quot;[T]he people are coming to hear the students, and I won&#x27;t make a speech that you&#x27;ve written.&quot; The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an Uncle Tom, Richard refused to deliver the principal&#x27;s address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. He was able to convince everyone to allow him to read the words he had written himself.

In September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new Lanier High School, constructed for black students in Jackson—the state&#x27;s schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws—but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money to support his family.

In November 1925 at the age of 17, Wright moved on his own to Memphis, Tennessee. There he fed his appetite for reading. His hunger for books was so great that Wright devised a successful ploy to borrow books from the segregated white library. Using a library card lent by a white coworker, which he presented with forged notes that claimed he was picking up books for the white man, Wright was able to obtain and read books forbidden to black people in the Jim Crow South. This stratagem also allowed him access to publications such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and &quot;The American Mercury&quot;.

He planned to have his mother come and live with him once he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the Jim Crow South and go to Chicago. His family joined the Great Migration, when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.

Wright&#x27;s childhood in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.

=== Coming of age in Chicago ===

Wright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927, where he secured employment as a United States postal clerk. He used his time in between shifts to study other writers including H.L. Mencken, whose vision of the American South as a version of Hell made an impression. When he lost his job there during the Great Depression, Wright was forced to go on relief in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the John Reed Club, a Marxist literary organization. Wright established relationships and networked with party members. Wright formally joined the Communist Party and the John Reed Club in late 1933 at the urging of his friend Abraham Aaron. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote proletarian poems (&quot;We of the Red Leaves of Red Books&quot;, for example), for &quot;New Masses&quot; and other communist-leaning periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club&#x27;s leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club&#x27;s party members if he was willing to join the party.

In 1933, Wright founded the South Side Writers Group, whose members included Arna Bontemps and Margaret Walker. Through the group and his membership in the John Reed Club, Wright founded and edited &quot;Left Front&quot;, a literary magazine. Wright began publishing his poetry (&quot;A Red Love Note&quot; and &quot;Rest for the Weary&quot;, for example) there in 1934. There is dispute about the demise in 1935 of &quot;Left Front Magazine&quot; as Wright blamed the Communist Party despite his protests. It is, however, likely due to the proposal at the 1934 Midwest Writers Congress that the John Reed Club be replaced by a Communist Party-sanctioned First American Party Congress. Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to &quot;New Masses&quot; magazine, revealing the path his writings would ultimately take.

By 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, &quot;Cesspool&quot;, which was rejected by eight publishers and published posthumously as &quot;Lawd Today&quot; (1963). This first work featured autobiographical anecdotes about working at a post office in Chicago during the Great Depression.

In January 1936, his story &quot;Big Boy Leaves Home&quot; was accepted for publication in the anthology &quot;New Caravan&quot; and the anthology &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot;, focusing on black life in the rural American South.

In February of that year, he began working with the National Negro Congress (NNC), speaking at the Chicago convention on &quot;The Role of the Negro Artist and Writer in the Changing Social Order&quot;. His ultimate goal (looking at other labor unions as inspiration) was the development of NNC-sponsored publications, exhibits, and conferences alongside the Federal Writers&#x27; Project to get work for black artists.

In 1937, he became the Harlem editor of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. This assignment compiled quotes from interviews preceded by an introductory paragraph, thus allowing him time for other pursuits like the publication of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; a year later.

Pleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race. Some black Communists denounced Wright as a &quot;bourgeois intellectual&quot;. Wright was essentially autodidactic. He had been forced to end his public education to support his mother and brother after completing junior high school.

Throughout the Soviet pact with Nazi Germany in 1940, Wright continued to focus his attention on racism in the United States. He would ultimately break from the Communist Party when they broke from a tradition against segregation and racism and joined Stalinists supporting the US entering World War II in 1941.

Wright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents. He later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, an African-American communist, in his essay &quot;I tried to be a Communist&quot;, published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as &quot;American Hunger&quot; but was removed from the actual publication of &quot;Black Boy&quot; upon request by the Book of the Month Club. Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knifepoint by fellow-traveler co-workers, denounced as a Trotskyite in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 Labour Day march.

==Career==

In Chicago in 1932, Wright began writing with the Federal Writer&#x27;s Project and became a member of the American Communist Party. In 1937, he relocated to New York and became the Bureau Chief of the communist publication, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. He would write over 200 articles for the publication from 1937 to 1938. This allowed him to cover stories and issues that interested him, revealing depression-era America into light with well-written prose.

He worked on the Federal Writers&#x27; Project guidebook to the city, &quot;New York Panorama&quot; (1938), and wrote the book&#x27;s essay on Harlem. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine, &quot;New Challenge.&quot; The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer Ralph Ellison that would last for years. He was awarded the &quot;Story&quot; magazine first prize of $500 for his short story &quot;Fire and Cloud&quot;.

After receiving the &quot;Story&quot; prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of &quot;Lawd Today&quot; and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher Harper all of Wright&#x27;s prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.

Wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; (1938). He based some stories on lynching in the Deep South. The publication and favorable reception of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; improved Wright&#x27;s status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of &quot;New Masses.&quot; Granville Hicks, a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel &quot;Native Son&quot;, which was published in 1940.

Based on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete &quot;Native Son.&quot; During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent Communists whom Wright had known in Chicago. They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in Brooklyn in the Fort Greene neighborhood.

After publication, &quot;Native Son&quot; was selected by the Book of the Month Club as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, is bound by the limitations that society places on African Americans. Unlike most in this situation, he gains his own agency and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts. Wright&#x27;s characterization of Bigger led to him being criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of &quot;Native Son&quot;, people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites&#x27; worst fears. The period following publication of &quot;Native Son&quot; was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam. While in Chicago he visited the American Negro Exposition with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and Claude McKay.
Wright traveled to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to collaborate with playwright Paul Green on a dramatic adaptation of &quot;Native Son.&quot; In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious Spingarn Medal of the NAACP for noteworthy achievement. His play &quot;Native Son&quot; opened on Broadway in March 1941, with Orson Welles as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the Farm Security Administration. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, &quot;12 Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States&quot;, was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.

Wright&#x27;s memoir &quot;Black Boy&quot; (1945) describes his early life from Roxie up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It includes his clashes with his Seventh-day Adventist family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. &quot;American Hunger&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of &quot;Black Boy.&quot; The Library of America edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.

&quot;American Hunger&quot; details Wright&#x27;s participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implies he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944. In the book&#x27;s restored form, Wright used the diptych structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned &quot;bourgeois&quot; books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge in the Soviet Union.

===Move to France, later life and death===
Following a stay of a few months in Québec, Canada, including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-Pétronille on the Île d&#x27;Orléans, Wright moved to Paris in 1946. He became a permanent American expatriate.

In Paris, Wright became friends with French writers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, whom he had met while still in New York, and he and his wife became particularly good friends with Simone de Beauvoir, who stayed with them in 1947. However, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright&#x27;s existentialist leanings were more influenced by Søren Kierkegaard, Edmund Husserl, and especially Martin Heidegger. In following Fabre&#x27;s argument, with respect to Wright&#x27;s existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright&#x27;s exposure to Husserl and Heidegger &quot;directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre&#x27;s synthesis of existentialism and Marxism for Wright&quot;. His Existentialist phase was expressed in his second novel, &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1953), which described an African-American character&#x27;s involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers Chester Himes and James Baldwin. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel&quot; (collected in &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;), in which he criticized Wright&#x27;s portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published &quot;Savage Holiday&quot;.

After becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology &quot;The God That Failed;&quot; his essay had been published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of &quot;Black Boy.&quot; He was invited to join the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the CIA. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the FBI had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was blacklisted by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as Bigger Thomas in an Argentinian film version of &quot;Native Son.&quot;

In mid-1953, Wright traveled to the Gold Coast, where Kwame Nkrumah was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as Ghana. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in Accra on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the U.S. State Department. The officer&#x27;s report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah&#x27;s adviser George Padmore about Nkrumah&#x27;s plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a Trinidadian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright&#x27;s book on his African journey, &quot;Black Power&quot;, was published in 1954; its London publisher was Dennis Dobson, who also published Padmore&#x27;s work.

Whatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer Addison Gayle, a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the Smith Act.

Historian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the civil rights movement during the 1950s in the United States. She found that he was under what his friend Chester Himes called &quot;extraordinary pressure&quot; to avoid writing about the US. As &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine delayed publishing his essay &quot;I Choose Exile&quot;, Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that &quot;a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty&quot;. He thought the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.

In 1955, Wright visited Indonesia for the Bandung Conference. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in &quot;The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference&quot;. Wright praised the conference extensively. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including PEN Club Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write &quot;The Color Curtain&quot;. Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his travel writing.

Other works by Wright included &quot;White Man, Listen!&quot; (1957) and a novel &quot;The Long Dream&quot; (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by Ketti Frings. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father. A collection of short stories, &quot;Eight Men&quot;, was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright&#x27;s death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.

His agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright&#x27;s 400-page &quot;Island of Hallucinations&quot; manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.

On June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of &quot;White Man, Listen!&quot;, Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of amoebic dysentery, probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959, his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright&#x27;s illness and &quot;four hassles in twelve days&quot; with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.

On February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of &quot;The Long Dream&quot; had received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get &quot;The Long Dream&quot; published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of &quot;Island of Hallucinations&quot;, for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from Doubleday and Company.

In June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia&#x27;s move from London to Paris to attend the Sorbonne, Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.

In spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of Leo Tolstoy. Still interested in literature, Wright helped Kyle Onstott get his novel &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1957) published in France.

Wright&#x27;s last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture &quot;The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States&quot;, delivered to students and members of the American Church in Paris. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against &quot;Native Son&quot; and the quarrels that James Baldwin and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work &quot;Daddy Goodness&quot; and gave him the manuscript.

Wright died of a heart attack in Paris on November 28, 1960, at the age of 52. He was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Wright&#x27;s daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.

A number of Wright&#x27;s works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright&#x27;s more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of &quot;Native Son&quot;, &quot;Black Boy&quot;, and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; was published for the first time.

In the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form haiku and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (&quot;Haiku: This Other World&quot;) with 817 of his own favorite haiku. Many of these haiku have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.

A collection of Wright&#x27;s travel writings was published by the University Press of Mississippi in 2001. At his death, Wright left an unfinished book, &quot;A Father&#x27;s Law&quot;, dealing with a black policeman and the son he suspects of murder. His daughter Julia Wright published &quot;A Father&#x27;s Law&quot; in January 2008. An omnibus edition containing Wright&#x27;s political works was published under the title &quot;Three Books from Exile: Black Power; The Color Curtain&quot;; and &quot;White Man, Listen!&quot;

==Personal life==
In August 1939, with Ralph Ellison as best man, Wright married Dhimah Rose Meidman, a modern dance teacher of Russian Jewish ancestry. The marriage ended a year later.

On March 12, 1941, he married Ellen Poplar (née Poplowitz), a Communist organizer from Brooklyn. They had two daughters: Julia, born in 1942, and Rachel, born in 1949.

Ellen Wright, who died on April 6, 2004, aged 92, was the executor of Wright&#x27;s estate. In this capacity, she unsuccessfully sued a biographer, the poet and writer Margaret Walker, in &quot;Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.&quot; She was a literary agent, and her clients included Simone de Beauvoir, Eldridge Cleaver, and Violette Leduc.

==Awards and honors==
* The Spingarn Medal in 1941 from the NAACP
* Guggenheim Fellowship in 1939
* &quot;Story&quot; Magazine Award in 1938.
* In April 2009, Wright was featured on a U.S. postage stamp. The 61-cent, two-ounce rate stamp is the 25th installment of the literary arts series, and features a portrait of Wright in front of snow-swept tenements on the South Side of Chicago, a scene that recalls the setting of &quot;Native Son.&quot;
* In 2010, Wright was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.
* In 2012, the Historic Districts Council and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, in collaboration with the Fort Greene Association and writer/musician Carl Hancock Rux, erected a cultural medallion at 175 Carlton Avenue, Brooklyn, where Wright lived in 1938 and completed &quot;Native Son.&quot; The group unveiled the plaque at a public ceremony with guest speakers, including playwright Lynn Nottage and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Black Boy&quot; became an instant best-seller upon its publication in 1945. Wright&#x27;s stories published during the 1950s disappointed some critics who said that his move to Europe had alienated him from African Americans and separated him from his emotional and psychological roots. Many of Wright&#x27;s works failed to satisfy the rigid standards of New Criticism during a period when the works of younger black writers gained in popularity.

During the 1950s Wright grew more internationalist in outlook. While he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation, his creative work did decline.

While interest in &quot;Black Boy&quot; ebbed during the 1950s, this has remained one of his best selling books. Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. &quot;Black Boy&quot; remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man&#x27;s search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison. John A. Williams included a fictionalized version of Wright&#x27;s life and death in his 1967 novel &quot;The Man Who Cried I Am&quot;.

It is generally agreed that the influence of Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; is not a matter of literary style or technique. Rather, this book affected ideas and attitudes, and &quot;Native Son&quot; has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. &quot;Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,&quot; said writer Amiri Baraka. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals. Richard Wright conferences were held on university campuses from Mississippi to New Jersey. A new film version of &quot;Native Son&quot;, with a screenplay by Richard Wesley, was released in December 1986. Certain Wright novels became required reading in a number of American high schools, universities and colleges.

Recent critics have called for a reassessment of Wright&#x27;s later work in view of his philosophical project. Notably, Paul Gilroy has argued that &quot;the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary inquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing&quot;.

Wright was featured in a 90-minute documentary about the WPA Writers&#x27; Project entitled &quot;Soul of a People: Writing America&#x27;s Story&quot; (2009). His life and work during the 1930s is highlighted in the companion book, &quot;Soul of a People: The WPA Writers&#x27; Project Uncovers Depression America&quot;.
