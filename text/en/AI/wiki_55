<text>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), later joined by John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.

Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name &quot;Queen&quot;. Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, &quot;Queen II&quot;, in 1974. &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; later that year and &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which topped the UK singles chart for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;News of the World&quot; contained &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; from &quot;The Game&quot; (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified 9x Platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.

Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, &quot;The Miracle&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Innuendo&quot; in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed his AIDS diagnosis, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury&#x27;s vocals, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as &quot;Queen +&quot;, with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.

Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million, making them one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==History==

===1968–1971: Foundations===
The founding members of Queen met in west London during the late 1960s. Guitarist Brian May had built his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after Orwell&#x27;s novel) the following year with singer Tim Staffell. May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infrared Astronomy at Imperial College and find a group that could write original material. He formed the group Smile with Staffell (now playing bass) and keyboardist Chris Smith. To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a &quot;Mitch Mitchell/Ginger Baker type&quot; drummer; Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job. Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the Royal Albert Hall with Free and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.
While attending Ealing Art College in west London, Staffell became friends with fellow student Farrokh &quot;Freddie&quot; Bulsara, who was from Zanzibar and of Indian Parsi descent. Bulsara had studied fashion design for a year before switching to graphic art and design, and soon became a keen fan of Smile. He asked if he could join the group as lead singer, but May felt Staffell would not give up that role. He also ran a stall in Kensington Market with Taylor.
In 1970, Staffell quit Smile, feeling his interests in soul and R&amp;B clashed with the group&#x27;s hard rock sound and being fed up with the lack of success. He formed the group Humpy Bong with former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen. The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor&#x27;s friend Mike Grose as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in Truro on 27 June 1970. Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to &quot;Queen&quot;. The others were uncertain at first, but he said, &quot;it&#x27;s wonderful, dear, people will love it&quot;. At the same time, he decided to change his surname to Mercury, inspired by the line &quot;Mother Mercury, look what they&#x27;ve done to me&quot; in the song &quot;My Fairy King&quot;. The group played their first London gig on 18 July. The early set consisted of material that later appeared on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as Cliff Richard and the Shadows&#x27; &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tease&quot;. They attracted the attention of producer John Anthony, who was interested in the group&#x27;s sound but thought they had the wrong bass player. After three live gigs, Mike Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by Barry Mitchell (ex Crushed Butler). Mitchell played thirteen gigs with Queen between August 1970 and January 1971. In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by Doug Bogie for two live gigs.

===1971–1974: &quot;Queen&quot; and &quot;Queen II&quot;===
In February 1971, John Deacon joined Queen. In addition to being an experienced bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics. On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London. May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to De Lane Lea Studios&#x27; new premises in Wembley, and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking the Kinks but couldn&#x27;t get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio&#x27;s acoustic tests. They recorded five of their own songs, &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;Great King Rat&quot;, &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;. During the recording, producers John Anthony and Roy Thomas Baker visited the band. The two were taken with &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and began promoting the band to several record companies.
Promoter Ken Testi managed to attract the interest of Charisma Records, who offered Queen an advance of around £25,000, but the group turned them down as they realised the label would promote Genesis as a priority. Testi then entered discussions with Trident Studios&#x27; Norman Sheffield, who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, while the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians. Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as &quot;gold dust&quot;.

Queen began 1972 with a gig at Bedford College, London where only six people turned up. After a few more shows, they stopped live performances for eight months to work on the album with Anthony and Baker. During the sessions at Trident, they saw David Bowie with the Spiders from Mars live and realised they needed to make an impact with the album, otherwise they would be left behind. Co-producers Anthony and Baker initially clashed with the band (May in particular) on the direction of the album, bringing the band&#x27;s inexperience in the studio to bear. The band&#x27;s fighting centered around their efforts to integrate technical perfection with the reality of live performances, leading to what Baker referred to as &quot;kitchen sink overproduction&quot;. The resulting album was a mix of heavy metal and progressive rock. The group were unhappy with the re-recording of &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, so the finished album uses the De Lane Lea demo. Another track, &quot;Mad the Swine&quot; was dropped from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix. Mike Stone created the final mix for &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, and he went on to work on several other Queen albums. By January 1972, the band finished recording their debut album, but had yet to secure a record contract. In order to attract record company interest, Trident booked a &quot;showcase&quot; gig on 6 November at The Pheasantry, followed by a show at the Marquee Club on 20 December.

Queen promoted the unreleased album in February 1973 on BBC Radio 1, still unsigned. The following month, Trident managed to strike a deal with EMI Records. &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; was released as a single on 6 July, with the album &quot;Queen&quot; appearing a week later. The front cover showed a shot of Mercury live on stage taken by Taylor&#x27;s friend Douglass Puddifoot. Deacon was credited as &quot;Deacon John&quot; while Taylor used his full name, Roger Meddows-Taylor. The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;superb&quot;, and Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Daily Herald&quot; called it an &quot;above-average debut&quot;. However, it drew little mainstream attention, and &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; sold poorly. Retrospectively, it is cited as the album&#x27;s highlight, and in 2008 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 31st in the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;an entire album&#x27;s worth of riffs crammed into a single song&quot;. The album was certified gold in the UK and the US.
The group began to record their second album, &quot;Queen II&quot; in August 1973. Now able to use regular studio time, they decided to make full use of the facilities available. May created a multi-layer guitar introduction &quot;Procession&quot;, while Mercury wrote &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master Stroke&quot; based on the painting of the same name by Richard Dadd. The group spent the remainder of the year touring the UK, supporting Mott the Hoople, and began to attract an audience. The tour ended with two shows at the Hammersmith Odeon on 14 December, playing to 7,000 people.

In January 1974, Queen played the Sunbury Pop Festival in Australia. They arrived late, and were jeered and taunted by the audience who expected to see home grown acts. Before leaving, Mercury announced, &quot;when we come back to Australia, Queen will be the biggest band in the world!&quot; &quot;Queen II&quot; was released in March, and features Mick Rock&#x27;s iconic Dietrich-inspired image of the band on the cover. This image would later be used as the basis for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; music video production. The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK. The Mercury-written lead single &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; reached number 10 in the UK, giving the band their first hit. The album featured a &#x27;layered&#x27; sound which would become their signature, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and instrumental virtuosity. Aside from its only single, the album also included the song &quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;, a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus. Critical reaction was mixed; the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, while praising the band&#x27;s debut album, described &quot;Queen II&quot; as an &quot;over-produced monstrosity&quot;. AllMusic has described the album as a favourite among the band&#x27;s hardcore fans, and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The group ended their early 1974 UK tour with a show at the Rainbow Theatre on 31 March. Mercury chose to a wear a Zandra Rhodes-designed tunic for the gig, changing into a slashed black top midway through the show.

===1974–1976: &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;===

In May 1974, a month into the band&#x27;s first US tour opening for Mott the Hoople, May collapsed and was diagnosed with hepatitis, forcing the cancellation of their remaining dates. May was still absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. Released in 1974, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; reached number two in the UK, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the US. It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. May&#x27;s &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; documented the group&#x27;s curtailed American tour, and &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; served as a vehicle for his regular on-stage solo guitar spot. Deacon wrote his first song for the group, &quot;Misfire&quot;, while the live favourite &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; was credited to the whole band. Mercury wrote the closing number, &quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot;, with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played live. This would be repeated later on, more successfully, in songs such as &quot;We Are the Champions.
The single &quot;Killer Queen&quot; was written by Mercury about a high-class prostitute. It reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was partly recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales. With Mercury playing the grand piano, it combines camp, vaudeville, and British music hall with May&#x27;s guitar. &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; was released as the second single, reached number eleven. In 2006, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; ranked &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; number 28 in &quot;The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever&quot;, and in 2007, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked it No.88 in &quot;The 100 Records That Changed the World&quot;. It is also the second of three Queen albums to feature in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In January 1975, Queen left for a world tour with an upgraded light show. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time. Several dates were cancelled after Mercury contracted laryngitis. The band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. They were greeted by thousands of screaming fans, and played eight times in seven cities. Despite the success, Queen were still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. They were all living in relative poverty in bedsits, and Deacon was refused money for a deposit on a house. EMI contacted lawyer Jim Beach, who tried to find a way of extracting them from their contract. Trident complained that they had invested £200,000 in Queen and wanted their money back first. In August, after an acrimonious split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract and searched for new management. One of the options they considered was an offer from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager, Peter Grant, who wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin&#x27;s own production company, Swan Song Records. The band were concerned about being a lower priority than Zeppelin and Bad Company (also signed to Swan Song) and instead contacted Elton John&#x27;s manager, John Reid, who accepted the position. Reid&#x27;s first instruction to the band was &quot;I&#x27;ll take care of the business; you make the best record you can&quot;.

Queen started work on their fourth album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced, costing £40,000 and using three different studios. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. Mercury wrote the opening song &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;, a savage dig at perceived wrongdoers (and later dedicated to Trident in concert) and the camp vaudeville &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;. May&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; was an eight-minute epic; the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies.
The best-known song on the album, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, originated from pieces of music that Mercury had written at Ealing College. Mercury played a run-through of the track on piano in his flat to Baker, stopping suddenly to announce, &quot;This is where the opera section comes in&quot;. When the rest of the band started recording the song they were unsure as to how it would be pieced together. After recording the backing track, Baker left a 30-second section of tape to add the operatic vocals. Reportedly, 180 overdubs were used, to the extent that the original tape wore thin. EMI initially refused to release the single, thinking it too long, and demanded a radio edit which Queen refused. Mercury&#x27;s close friend and advisor, Capital London radio DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving the single exposure. He was given a promotional copy on the condition he didn&#x27;t play it, but ended up doing so fourteen times over a single weekend. Capital&#x27;s switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released. With EMI forced to release &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; due to public demand, the single reached number one in the UK for nine weeks. It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK, surpassed only by Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;, and is the best-selling commercial single (i.e. &quot;not&quot; for charity) in the UK. It also reached number nine in the US (a 1992 re-release reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks). It is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions, and became the Christmas number one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. It has also been voted the greatest song of all time in three different polls.

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was promoted with a music video directed by Bruce Gowers, who had already shot several of Queen&#x27;s live concerts. The group wanted a video so they could avoid appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, which would clash with tour dates, and it would have looked strange miming to such a complex song. Filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, the video cost £3,500, five times the typical promotional budget, and was shot in three hours. The operatic section featured a reprise of the &quot;Queen II&quot; cover, with the band member&#x27;s heads animated. On the impact of the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; promotional video, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; states: &quot;Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.&quot; Ranking it number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated it &quot;ensured videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music&quot;. Radio broadcaster Tommy Vance states, &quot;It became the first record to be pushed into the forefront by virtue of a video. Queen were certainly the first band to create a &#x27;concept&#x27; video. The video captured the musical imagery perfectly. You cannot hear that music without seeing the visuals in your mind&#x27;s eye.&quot;

&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was very successful in the UK, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th-greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th-greatest of all time, and an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th-greatest of all time. &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; has frequently appeared in &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 50 Best British Albums Ever&quot; in 2004, a poll done in collaboration with British music and entertainment retailer HMV. It was also placed at number 230 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003. &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The second single from the album was Deacon&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot;, which peaked at number sixteen on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and went on to become a worldwide top-ten hit. The band&#x27;s A Night at the Opera Tour began in November 1975, and covered Europe, the US, Japan, and Australia. On 24 December, Queen played a special concert at the Hammersmith Odeon which was broadcast live on the BBC show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, with the audio being later broadcast on BBC Radio 1. It became one of the band&#x27;s most popular bootleg recordings for decades before being officially released in 2015.

===1976–1979: &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; to &quot;Live Killers&quot;===
By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, which is often regarded as a sequel album to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, a variation on the same Queen logo. The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed &quot;&#x27;39&quot; &quot;a cappella&quot;. Baker did not return to produce the album; instead the band self-produced with assistance from Mike Stone, who performed several of the backing vocals. The major hit on the album was &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a gospel choir. The song went to number two in the UK, and number thirteen in the US. The album also featured one of the band&#x27;s heaviest songs, May&#x27;s &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, which became a staple of their live shows. Musically, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; was by both fans&#x27; and critics&#x27; standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US.

Queen played a landmark gig on 18 September 1976, a free concert in Hyde Park, London, organised by the entrepreneur Richard Branson. It set an attendance record at the park, with 150,000 people confirmed in the audience. Queen were late arriving onstage and ran out of time to play an encore; the police informed Mercury that he would be arrested if he attempted to go on stage again. May enjoyed the gig particularly, as he had been to see previous concerts at the park, such as the first one organised by Blackhill Enterprises in 1968, featuring Pink Floyd.
On 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London&#x27;s early evening &quot;Today&quot; programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, EMI labelmate the Sex Pistols, give their infamous expletive-strewn interview with Bill Grundy. During the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, Queen performed sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, New York, in February, supported by Thin Lizzy, and Mercury and Taylor socialised with that group&#x27;s leader Phil Lynott. They ended the tour with two concerts at Earls Court, London, in June, which commemorated the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, and at the cost of £50,000 the band used a lighting rig in the shape of a crown for the first time.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;News of the World&quot; was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the US, and twice in the UK. The album contained many songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock&#x27;s most recognisable anthems, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and the rock ballad &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, both of which became enduring international sports anthems, and the latter reached number four in the US. Queen commenced the News of the World Tour in November 1977, and Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called this concert tour the band&#x27;s &quot;most spectacularly staged and finely honed show&quot;. During the tour they sold out another two shows at MSG, and in 1978 they received the Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award for passing more than 100,000 unit ticket sales at the venue.

 In 1978, Queen released &quot;Jazz&quot;, which reached number two in the UK and number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US. The album included the hit singles &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; and &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; on a double-sided record. Critical reviews of the album in the years since its release have been more favourable than initial reviews. Another notable track from &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;, provides another example of the band&#x27;s exuberant vocal harmonies.

In 1978, Queen toured the US and Canada, and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan. They released their first live album, &quot;Live Killers&quot;, in 1979; it went platinum twice in the US. Queen also released the very successful single &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley. The song made the top 10 in many countries, topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks, and was the band&#x27;s first number one single in the US where it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks. Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record, Mercury played rhythm guitar when performing the song live, the first time he ever played guitar in concert. On 26 December 1979, Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London, having accepted a request by the event&#x27;s organiser, Paul McCartney. The concert was the last date of their Crazy Tour of London.

===1980–1982: &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;Hot Space&quot; and stadium tours ===
Queen began their 1980s career with &quot;The Game&quot;. It featured the singles &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, both of which reached number one in the US. After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive &quot;No Synthesisers!&quot; sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-&quot;hard&quot;-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums&#x27; multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.

In February 1981, Queen travelled to South America as part of The Game Tour, and became the first rock band to play stadiums in Latin America. On playing the concerts, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine states, &quot;They were under the spotlight from all quarters, as the entire music industry waited to see if their ambitious plans would bear fruit&quot;. Tom Pinnock in the March 1981 issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, 

The tour included five shows in Argentina, one of which drew the largest single concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in Buenos Aires and two concerts at the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, where they played to more than 131,000 people in the first night (then the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world) and more than 120,000 people the following night. A region then largely ruled by military dictatorships, the band were greeted with scenes of fan-fever, and the promoter of their first shows at the Vélez Sarsfield Stadium in Buenos Aires was moved to say: &quot;For music in Argentina, this has been a case of before the war and after the war. Queen have liberated this country, musically speaking.&quot; The group&#x27;s second show at Vélez Sarsfield was broadcast on national television and watched by over 30 million. Backstage, they were introduced to footballer Diego Maradona.

Topping the charts in Brazil and Argentina, the ballad &quot;Love of My Life&quot; stole the show in South American concerts. Mercury would stop singing and would then conduct the audience as they took over, with Lesley-Ann Jones writing &quot;the fans knew the song by heart. Their English was word-perfect.&quot; Later that year Queen performed for more than 150,000 on 9 October at Monterrey (Estadio Universitario) and 17 and 18 at Puebla (Estadio Zaragoza), Mexico. Though the gigs were successful, they were marred by a lack of planning and suitable facilities, with audiences throwing projectiles on stage. Mercury finished the final gig saying, &quot;Adios, amigos, you motherfuckers!&quot; On 24 and 25 November, Queen played two nights at the Montreal Forum, Quebec, Canada. One of Mercury&#x27;s most notable performances of &quot;The Game&quot; final track, &quot;Save Me&quot;, took place in Montreal, and the concert is recorded in the live album, &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot;.

Queen worked with David Bowie on the 1981 single &quot;Under Pressure&quot;. The first-time collaboration with another artist was spontaneous, as Bowie happened to drop by the studio while Queen were recording. Mercury and Bowie recorded their vocals on the track separately to each other, each coming up with individual ideas. The song topped the UK charts. In October, Queen released their first compilation album, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which showcased the group&#x27;s highlights from 1974 to 1981. The best-selling album in UK chart history, it is the only album to sell over seven million copies in the UK. As of July 2022, it has spent over 1000 weeks in the UK Album Chart. According to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, approximately one in three families in the UK own a copy. The album is certified nine times platinum in the US. As of August 2024, it has spent over 600 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.
In 1982, the band released the album &quot;Hot Space&quot;, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of pop rock, dance, disco, funk, and R&amp;B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band&#x27;s history. Mercury and Deacon enjoyed the new soul and funk influences, but Taylor and May were less favourable, and were critical of the influence Mercury&#x27;s personal manager Paul Prenter had on him. According to Mack, Queen&#x27;s producer, Prenter loathed rock music and was in Mercury&#x27;s ear throughout the &quot;Hot Space&quot; sessions. May was also scathing of Prenter—Mercury&#x27;s manager from 1977 to 1984—for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. May states, &quot;this guy, in the course of one tour, told every record station to fuck off&quot;. Queen roadie Peter Hince wrote &quot;None of the band cared for him [Prenter], apart from Freddie&quot;, with Hince regarding Mercury&#x27;s favouring of Prenter as an act of &quot;misguided loyalty&quot;. During the Munich sessions, Mercury spent time with Mack and his family, becoming godfather to Mack&#x27;s first child. &quot;Q&quot; magazine would list &quot;Hot Space&quot; as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot. Though the album confused some fans with the change of musical direction, it still reached number 4 in the UK.
Queen toured to promote &quot;Hot Space&quot;, but found some audience unreceptive to the new material. At a gig in Frankfurt, Mercury told some people heckling the new material, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to listen to it, go home!&quot; Former Mott the Hoople keyboardist Morgan Fisher joined as an additional touring member. Shows were planned at Arsenal Stadium and Old Trafford, but these were cancelled as Pope John Paul II was touring Britain, leading to a lack of available outdoor facilities such as toilets. The gigs were moved to the Milton Keynes Bowl and Elland Road, Leeds instead. The Milton Keynes concert was filmed by Tyne Tees Television and later released on DVD. On 14 and 15 September 1982, the band performed their last two gigs in the US with Mercury on lead vocals, playing at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Fisher was replaced as touring keyboardist by Fred Mandel for the North American shows. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they performed on American television for the only time during the eighth-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 25 September of the same year; it became the final public performance of the band in North America before the death of their frontman. Their fall in popularity in the US has been partially attributed to homophobia: Mikal Gilmore for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes, &quot;At some shows on the band&#x27;s 1980 American tour, fans tossed disposable razor blades onstage: They didn&#x27;t like this identity of Mercury—what they perceived as a brazenly gay rock &amp; roll hero—and they wanted him to shed it.&quot; The group finished the year with a Japanese tour.

===1983–1984: &quot;The Works&quot; ===
After the Hot Space Tour concluded with a concert at Seibu Lions Stadium in Tokorozawa, Japan in November 1982, Queen decided they would take a significant amount of time off. May later said at that point, &quot;we hated each other for a while&quot;. The band reconvened nine months later to begin recording a new album at the Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles and Musicland Studios, Munich. Several members of the band also explored side projects and solo work. Taylor released his second solo album, &quot;Strange Frontier&quot;. May released the mini-album &quot;Star Fleet Project&quot;, collaborating with Eddie Van Halen. Queen left Elektra Records, their label in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records.
In February 1984, Queen released their eleventh studio album, &quot;The Works&quot;. Hit singles included &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, which makes a nostalgic defence of the radio format, &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; and &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; hailed the album as &quot;the &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; of the eighties.&quot; In the UK &quot;The Works&quot; went triple platinum and remained in the albums chart for two years. The album failed to do well in the US, where, in addition to issues with their new record label Capitol Records (who had recently severed ties with their independent promotions teams due to a government report on payola), the cross-dressing video for &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;, a spoof of the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, proved controversial and was banned by MTV. The concept of the video came from Roger Taylor via a suggestion from his girlfriend. He told &quot;Q&quot; magazine: &quot;We had done some really serious, epic videos in the past, and we just thought we&#x27;d have some fun. We wanted people to know that we didn&#x27;t take ourselves too seriously, that we could still laugh at ourselves.&quot; Director of the video David Mallet said Mercury was reluctant to do it, commenting &quot;it was a hell of a job to get him out of the dressing room&quot;.

That year, Queen began The Works Tour, the first tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney as an extra live musician. The tour featured nine sold-out dates in October in Bophuthatswana, South Africa, at the arena in Sun City. Upon returning to England, they were the subject of outrage, having played in South Africa during the height of apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural boycott. The band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in South Africa, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences. Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians&#x27; Union and placed on the United Nations&#x27; blacklisted artists. In 2021, Taylor voiced his regret for the decision to perform at Sun City, saying that &quot;we went with the best intentions, but I still think it was kind of a mistake.&quot;

===1985–1986: Live Aid, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; and tours===
In January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described it as a &quot;mesmerising performance&quot;. Highlights from both nights were released on VHS as &quot;Queen: Live in Rio&quot;, which was broadcast on MTV in the US. In April and May 1985, Queen completed the Works Tour with sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.
At Live Aid, held at Wembley on 13 July 1985, in front of the biggest-ever TV audience of an estimated 400 million, Queen performed some of their greatest hits. Many of the sold-out stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison. The show&#x27;s organisers, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure; other musicians such as Elton John and Cliff Richard; and journalists writing for the BBC, CNN, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, MTV, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, among others, described Queen as the highlight. Interviewed backstage, Roger Waters stated: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s been buzzing about Queen that I&#x27;ve run into. They had everybody completely spellbound.&quot; An industry poll in 2005 ranked it the greatest rock performance of all time. Mercury&#x27;s powerful, sustained note—&quot;Aaaaaay-o&quot;—during the call-and-response &quot;a cappella&quot; segment came to be known as &quot;The Note Heard Round the World&quot;. The band were revitalised by the response to Live Aid—a &quot;shot in the arm&quot; Roger Taylor called it—and the ensuing increase in record sales. In 1986 Mercury commented: &quot;From our perspective, the fact that Live Aid happened when it did was really lucky. It came out of nowhere to save us. For sure that was a turning point. Maybe you could say that in the history of Queen, it was a really special moment.&quot;

Queen ended 1985 by releasing the single &quot;One Vision&quot; and a limited-edition boxed set of Queen albums, &quot;The Complete Works&quot;. The package included the 1984 Christmas single &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; and previously unreleased material. In early 1986, Queen recorded the album &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, containing several reworkings of songs written for the fantasy action film &quot;Highlander&quot;. The album was successful in the UK, West Germany and several other countries, producing a string of hits including &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;; the latter featuring an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. The album was less successful in North America, reaching 46 in the US, and was described by biographer Mark Blake as &quot;a so-so album&quot; and &quot;a somewhat uneven listening experience&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; ranked it the 28th greatest soundtrack album of all time.
In mid-1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final tour with Mercury. They once again hired Spike Edney. Queen began the tour at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, Sweden, and later performed a concert at Slane Castle, Ireland, in front of an audience of 95,000, which broke the venue&#x27;s attendance record. The band also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 at the Népstadion in Budapest (released in the concert film &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest&quot;), in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe. More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the UK alone, a record at the time.

The Magic Tour&#x27;s highlight was at Wembley Stadium and resulted in the live double album &quot;Queen at Wembley&quot;, released on CD and as a live concert VHS/DVD, which has gone five times platinum in the US and four times platinum in the UK. The demand for tickets saw extra dates added to the tour, with concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith stating &quot;they seem to have an endless market.&quot; Queen could not book Wembley for a third night, but played at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire on 9 August. The show sold out within two hours and over 120,000 fans packed the park for what was Queen&#x27;s final performance with Mercury. At the end of the concert the band appeared on stage for the final time to an encore of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, with Mercury, in his crown and gown, bidding the crowd &quot;goodnight and sweet dreams&quot;. Roadie Peter Hince states, &quot;At Knebworth, I somehow felt it was going to be the last for all of us&quot;; Brian May recalled Mercury saying &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be doing this forever. This is probably the last time.&quot;

===1988–1992: &quot;The Miracle&quot;, &quot;Innuendo&quot; and Mercury&#x27;s final years===
In October 1986, two months after his final concert, Mercury, on his return to London from holiday, was confronted by a tabloid frenzy at Heathrow Airport with the British newspapers the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; reporting he had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at a Harley Street clinic, but Mercury was quoted as saying he was &quot;perfectly fit and healthy&quot;. Fans noticed his increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, with Mercury insisting he was merely &quot;exhausted&quot; and too busy to provide interviews; he was now 42 years old and had been involved in music for nearly two decades. He had in fact been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public, with only his inner circle of colleagues and friends aware of his condition.
After working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury&#x27;s collaboration with Montserrat Caballé, &quot;Barcelona&quot;), the band released &quot;The Miracle&quot; in 1989. The album continued the direction of &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. It spawned the hit singles &quot;I Want It All&quot;—which became an anti-apartheid anthem in South Africa—&quot;Scandal&quot;, and &quot;The Miracle&quot;. &quot;The Miracle&quot; also began a change in direction of Queen&#x27;s songwriting philosophy. Beforehand, nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member. With &quot;The Miracle&quot;, their songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed to credit the final product only to Queen as a group.

In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Hollywood Records; through the deal, Disney acquired the North American distribution rights to Queen&#x27;s catalogue for $10 million, and remains the group&#x27;s music catalogue owner and distributor in the US and Canada; the band retained ownership of the global rights through the UK-based Queen Productions Ltd. In February that year, Mercury made what would prove to be his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen onstage at the Dominion Theatre in London to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Innuendo&quot;, was released in early 1991 with &quot;Innuendo&quot; and other charting singles released later in the year. The music video for &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; featured archive footage of Queen&#x27;s performances between 1981 and 1989, and along with the manner of the song&#x27;s lyrics, fuelled reports that Mercury was dying. Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; in 1990. Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it, but May recalled that he &quot;completely killed it&quot;. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May says of Mercury: &quot;He just kept saying. &#x27;Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.&#x27; He had no fear, really.&quot; The band&#x27;s second-greatest hits compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;, followed in October 1991; it is the tenth best-selling album in the UK, the seventh best-selling album in Germany, is certified Diamond in France where it is one of the best-selling albums, and has sold 16 million copies worldwide.
On 23 November 1991, in a prepared statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed that he had AIDS. Within 24 hours of the statement, he died of bronchial pneumonia, which was brought on as a complication of the disease. His funeral service on 27 November in Kensal Green, West London was private, and held in accordance with the Zoroastrian religious faith of his family.

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was re-released as a single shortly after Mercury&#x27;s death, with &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; as the double A-side. The music video for the latter contains Mercury&#x27;s final scenes in front of the camera. Ron Hart of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;the conga-driven synth ballad &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; is &quot;Innuendo&quot; most significant single, given that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive.&quot; The video was recorded on 30 May 1991 (which proved to be Mercury&#x27;s final work with Queen). The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks—the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992). Initial proceeds from the single—approximately £1,000,000—were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity.

Queen&#x27;s popularity was stimulated in North America when &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was featured in the 1992 comedy film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. Its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 (including its 1976 chart run, it remained in the Hot 100 for a combined 41 weeks), and won the band an MTV Award at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The compilation album &quot;Classic Queen&quot; also reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and is certified three times platinum in the US. &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; footage was used to make a new music video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, with which the band and management were delighted.

On 20 April 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert was held at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 72,000. Performers, including Def Leppard, Robert Plant, Tony Iommi, Roger Daltrey, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Elton John, David Bowie, George Michael, Annie Lennox, Seal, Extreme, and Metallica performed various Queen songs along with the three remaining Queen members (and Spike Edney.) The concert is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as &quot;The largest rock star benefit concert&quot;, as it was televised to over 1.2 billion viewers worldwide, and raised over £20,000,000 for AIDS charities.

===1995–2003: &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; to 46664 Concert===

Queen&#x27;s last album with Mercury, titled &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, was released in 1995, four years after his death. Featuring tracks such as &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; and &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;, it was constructed from Mercury&#x27;s final recordings in 1991, material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from May, Taylor, and Mercury&#x27;s solo albums. The album also featured the song &quot;Mother Love&quot;, the last vocal recording Mercury made, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he &quot;wasn&#x27;t feeling that great&quot; and stated, &quot;I will finish it when I come back, next time&quot;. Mercury never returned to the studio afterwards, leaving May to record the final verse of the song. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury&#x27;s death, were completed at the band&#x27;s studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album reached number one in the UK following its release, their ninth number one album, and sold 20 million copies worldwide. On 25 November 1996, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death.
In 1997, Queen returned to the studio to record &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;, a song dedicated to Mercury and all those who die too soon. It was released as a bonus track on the &quot;Queen Rocks&quot; compilation album later that year, and features in &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot;. In January 1997, Queen performed &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; live with Elton John and the Béjart Ballet in Paris on a night Mercury was remembered, and it marked the last performance and public appearance of John Deacon, who chose to retire. The Paris concert was only the second time Queen had played live since Mercury&#x27;s death, prompting Elton John to urge them to perform again. Brian May and Roger Taylor performed together at several award ceremonies and charity concerts, sharing vocals with various guest singers. During this time, they were billed as &quot;Queen +&quot; followed by the guest singer&#x27;s name. In 1998, the duo appeared at Luciano Pavarotti&#x27;s benefit concert with May performing &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; with Pavarotti, later playing &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; with Zucchero. They again attended and performed at Pavarotti&#x27;s benefit concert in Modena, Italy in May 2003. Several of the guest singers recorded new versions of Queen&#x27;s hits under the &quot;Queen +&quot; name, such as Robbie Williams providing vocals for &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001).

In November 1999, &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot; was released. This featured, among others, &quot;Queen + Wyclef Jean&quot; on a rap version of &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;. A live version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; by George Michael and a live version of &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; with Elton John were also featured in the album. By this point, Queen&#x27;s vast amount of record sales made them the second-bestselling artist in the UK of all time, behind the Beatles. In November 2000, the band released the box set, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot;. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. On 18 October 2002, Queen were awarded the 2,207th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for their work in the music industry, which is located at 6358 Hollywood Blvd. On 29 November 2003, May and Taylor performed at the 46664 Concert hosted by Nelson Mandela at Green Point Stadium, Cape Town, to raise awareness of the spread of HIV/AIDS in South Africa. A new song, &quot;Invincible Hope&quot;, featuring Mandela&#x27;s speech and credited to Queen + Nelson Mandela, was performed during the concert and later released on the &quot;46664: One Year On&quot; EP. During that period May and Taylor spent time at Mandela&#x27;s home, discussing how Africa&#x27;s problems might be approached, and two years later the band were made ambassadors for the 46664 cause.

===2004–2009: Queen + Paul Rodgers===
At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May&#x27;s website also stated that Rodgers would be &quot;featured with&quot; Queen as &quot;Queen + Paul Rodgers&quot;, not replacing Mercury. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.

Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. Taylor said: &quot;We never thought we would tour again, Paul came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He&#x27;s not trying to be Freddie.&quot; The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. Foo Fighters performed &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.

Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela&#x27;s ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled &quot;The Cosmos Rocks&quot;, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the US on 28 October 2008. The band again toured Europe, opening on Kharkiv&#x27;s Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans; the concert was released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of the European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was the O2 Arena on 13 October. The last leg of the tour was in South America, and included a sold-out concert at José Amalfitani Stadium, Buenos Aires.

Queen and Paul Rodgers split up on 12 May 2009. Rodgers stated: &quot;My arrangement with [Queen] was similar to my arrangement with Jimmy [Page] in The Firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement&quot;. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with Queen again.

===2009–2011: Departure from EMI, 40th anniversary===
On 20 May 2009, May and Taylor performed &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; live on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet. A new greatest hits compilation &quot;Absolute Greatest&quot; was released on 16 November and peaked at number 3 in the UK. It contains 20 of Queen&#x27;s hits spanning their career and was released in four different formats: single disc, double disc (with commentary), double disc with feature book, and a vinyl record. Before its release, Queen ran an online competition to guess the track listing as a promotion for the album. On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; live on the British TV show &quot;The X Factor&quot; alongside the finalists.

On 20 August 2010, Queen&#x27;s manager Jim Beach announced that the band had signed a new contract with Universal Music after almost 40 years with EMI. On 22 September, May confirmed that the band&#x27;s new deal was with Island Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Hollywood Records remained as the group&#x27;s label in the US and Canada. For the first time since the late 1980s, Queen&#x27;s catalogue now has the same distributor worldwide, as Universal distributes for both the Island and Hollywood labels (for a time in the late 1980s, Queen was on EMI-owned Capitol Records in the US).

On 14 March 2011, the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Queen&#x27;s first five albums were re-released in the UK and some other territories as remastered deluxe editions; the US versions were released on 17 May. The second five albums of Queen&#x27;s back catalogue were released worldwide on 27 June, and on 27 September in the US and Canada. The final five were released in the UK on 5 September.

In May 2011, Jane&#x27;s Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell said that Queen were scouting their live bassist Chris Chaney to join the band. In the same month, Paul Rodgers stated he might tour with Queen again in the future. At the 2011 Broadcast Music, Incorporated (BMI) Awards held in London on 4 October, Queen received the BMI Icon Award for their airplay success in the US. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May. Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Lambert singing &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. The collaboration received a positive response from fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together.

===2011–present: Queen + Adam Lambert, &quot;Queen Forever&quot;===
On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of &quot;American Idol&quot; at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; with the &#x27;Queen Extravaganza&#x27; band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen said that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kyiv, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.
On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London&#x27;s Olympic Stadium opened with a remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;.

On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August and September 2014. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him.

In November 2014 Queen released a new album &quot;Queen Forever&quot;. The album is largely a compilation of previously released material but features three new tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot;, is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson. Queen + Adam Lambert performed in Central Hall, Westminster, at the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2014 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2015.
In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017–2018, the band toured North America in mid-2017, Europe in late 2017, then played Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018. On 24 February 2019, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the 91st Academy Awards ceremony held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. In July 2019 they embarked on the North American leg of The Rhapsody Tour, with the dates sold out in April. They toured Japan and South Korea in January 2020 followed by Australia and New Zealand the following month. On 16 February the band reprised their Live Aid set for the first time in 35 years at the &quot;Fire Fight Australia&quot; concert at ANZ Stadium in Sydney to raise money for the 2019–20 Australian bushfire crisis.

Because Queen were not able to tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they released a live album with Adam Lambert on 2 October 2020. The song collection, titled &quot;Live Around the World&quot;, contains highlights selected by the band members from over 200 shows throughout their history. It marked their first live album with Lambert who, as of 2020, has played 218 shows with the band. On 31 December 2020, Queen performed on the Japanese New Year&#x27;s Eve television special &quot;Kōhaku&quot; with composer Yoshiki and vocalist Sarah Brightman. In 2021, Queen received the Japan Gold Disc Award for the fourth time (having previously won it in 2005, 2019 and 2020) as the most popular Western act in Japan.

On 4 June 2022, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the Platinum Party at the Palace outside Buckingham Palace to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. Performing a three-song set, they opened with &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; which had been introduced in a comedy segment where Queen Elizabeth II and Paddington Bear tapped their tea cups to the beat of the song.

A previously unheard Queen song with Mercury&#x27;s vocals, &quot;Face It Alone&quot;, recorded over thirty years previously and originally thought &quot;unsalvageable&quot; by May and Taylor, was released on 13 October 2022; five more songs — &quot;You Know You Belong to Me&quot;, &quot;When Love Breaks Up&quot;, &quot;Dog With a Bone&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, and &quot;I Guess We&#x27;re Falling Out&quot; — were released on 18 November 2022 as part of &quot;The Miracle Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; box set.

==Music style and influences==

Queen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis, and Yes, with Mercury also inspired by the rock and roll singers Little Richard, Elvis Presley and the gospel singer Aretha Franklin. On the Beatles, Brian May stated they &quot;built our bible as far as musical composition, arrangement and production went. &quot;The White Album&quot; is a complete catalogue of how you should use a studio to build songs.&quot; Mercury said, &quot;John Lennon was larger than life, and an absolute genius. Even at a very early stage when they were the Beatles, I always preferred John Lennon&#x27;s things. I don&#x27;t know why. He just had that magic.&quot; May and Mercury were influenced by Jimi Hendrix, with Mercury saying &quot;he really had everything any rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star should have&quot;, and May saying &quot;Jimi is, of course, my number one. And I&#x27;ve always said that [...] I never stop learning from Jimi.&quot; Mercury&#x27;s thesis for his Ealing College diploma was on Hendrix, and Mercury and Taylor closed their Kensington Market stall on 18 September 1970 to commemorate his death.

At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen&#x27;s music has been characterised as &quot;Led Zeppelin meets Yes&quot; due to its combination of &quot;acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics&quot;. Although Mercury stated Robert Plant as his favourite singer and Led Zeppelin as &quot;the greatest&quot; rock band, he also said Queen &quot;have more in common with Liza Minnelli than Led Zeppelin. We&#x27;re more in the showbiz tradition than the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll tradition&quot;. In his book on &quot;Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal&quot;, Eddie Trunk described Queen as &quot;a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone&quot;, as well as observing that the band &quot;sounded British&quot;. Rob Halford of Judas Priest commented, &quot;It&#x27;s rare that you struggle to label a band. If you&#x27;re a heavy metal band you&#x27;re meant to look and sound like a heavy metal band but you can&#x27;t really call Queen anything. They could be a pop band one day or the band that wrote &#x27;Bicycle Race&#x27; the next and a full-blown metal band the next. In terms of the depth of the musical landscape that they covered, it was very similar to some extent to the Beatles.&quot; While stating they were influenced by various artists and genres, Joe Bosso of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine writes, &quot;Queen seemed to occupy their own lane.&quot;

Queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. The music styles and genres they have been associated with include progressive rock (also known as symphonic rock), art rock, glam rock, arena rock, heavy metal, operatic pop, pop rock, psychedelic rock, baroque pop, and rockabilly. Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by musical styles not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera, music hall, folk music, gospel, ragtime, and dance/disco. Their 1980 single &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; became a major hit single in the funk rock genre. Known for their anthemic songs which are a staple of sports arenas and stadiums the world over, several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; became a live favourite for the band because it would have &quot;crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally&quot;.

In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. May has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s or early 1970s. He also uses a sixpence as a plectrum. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen&#x27;s songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen&#x27;s music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. Some of the development of this sound is attributed to the producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone. Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. The band&#x27;s vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys.

===Logo===

Having studied graphic design in art college, Mercury also designed Queen&#x27;s logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band&#x27;s first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse side of the cover of the band&#x27;s first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricately coloured versions of the logo.

===Music videos===
Directed by Bruce Gowers, the groundbreaking &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; promotional video sees the band adopt a &quot;decadent &#x27;glam&#x27; sensibility&quot;. Replicating Mick Rock&#x27;s photograph of the band from the cover of &quot;Queen II&quot;—which itself was inspired by a photo of actress Marlene Dietrich from &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932)—the video opens with &quot;Queen standing in diamond formation, heads tilted back like Easter Island statues&quot; in near darkness as they sing the &quot;a cappella&quot; part.

One of the industry&#x27;s leading music video directors, David Mallet, directed some of their subsequent videos. Some of their later videos use footage from classic films: &quot;Under Pressure&quot; incorporates 1920s silent films, Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; and F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot;; the 1984 video for &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; includes footage from Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927); &quot;Calling All Girls&quot; was a homage to George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;THX 1138&quot;; and the 1995 video &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot; shows footage from Georges Méliès&#x27; &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Impossible Voyage&quot; (1904). The first part of Mallet&#x27;s music video for &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; spoofed the popular long-running British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Innuendo&quot; combines stop motion animation with rotoscoping and band members appear as illustrations and images taken from earlier Queen music videos on a cinema screen akin to the dystopian film &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984). The music videos for &quot;Flash&quot; (from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;) and &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; (from &quot;Highlander&quot;) are themed on the films the band recorded soundtracks for, with the latter featuring Mercury briefly re-enact the sword-fighting scene with the titular character. Queen also appeared in conventional music videos. &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; was filmed outdoors in Roger Taylor&#x27;s back garden during a cold day in early January 1977. Filmed at the New London Theatre later that year, the music video for &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; features the band—with Mercury in a trademark Harlequin outfit—performing in front of an enthusiastic crowd who wave Queen scarves in a manner similar to English football fans. The last music video of the group while Mercury was alive, &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;, was filmed in black and white to hide the full extent of his illness.

===Musical theatre===

In May 2002, a musical or &quot;rock theatrical&quot; based on the songs of Queen, titled &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, opened at the Dominion Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The musical was written by British comedian and author Ben Elton in collaboration with Brian May and Roger Taylor, and produced by Robert De Niro. It has since been staged in many cities around the world. The launch of the musical coincided with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. As part of the Jubilee celebrations, Brian May performed a guitar solo of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, as featured on Queen&#x27;s &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, from the roof of Buckingham Palace. The recording of this performance was used as video for the song on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Following the Las Vegas premiere on 8 September 2004, Queen were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.
The original London production was scheduled to close on Saturday, 7 October 2006, at the Dominion Theatre, but due to public demand, the show ran until May 2014. &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; has become the longest-running musical ever to run at this prime London theatre, overtaking the previous record holder, the musical &quot;Grease&quot;. Brian May stated in 2008 that they were considering writing a sequel to &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. The musical toured around the UK in 2009, playing at Manchester Palace Theatre, Sunderland Empire, Birmingham Hippodrome, Bristol Hippodrome, and Edinburgh Playhouse. By December 2022 the musical had been seen by 20 million people across 28 countries. In the summer of 2023 it returned to London with a 12-week run at the London Coliseum.

Sean Bovim created &quot;Queen at the Ballet&quot;, a tribute to Mercury, which uses Queen&#x27;s music as a soundtrack for the show&#x27;s dancers, who interpret the stories behind tracks such as &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, and &quot;Killer Queen&quot;. Queen&#x27;s music also appears in the Off-Broadway production &quot;Power Balladz&quot;, most notably the song &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, with the show&#x27;s two performers believing the song was &quot;the apex of artistic achievement in its day&quot;.

===Software and digital releases===
In conjunction with Electronic Arts, Queen released the computer game &quot;&quot; in 1998. The game received mixed reviews. Several reviewers described the fight sequences as frustrating, due to unresponsive controls and confusing camera angles. &quot;PC Zone&quot; found the game&#x27;s graphics unimpressive, although &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; considered them &quot;absolutely stunning&quot;. The extremely long development time resulted in graphic elements that already seemed outdated by the time of release.

Under the supervision of May and Taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen&#x27;s lengthy audio and video catalogue. DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert (titled &quot;Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;), 1982 Milton Keynes concert (&quot;Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl&quot;), and two Greatest Video Hits (Volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band&#x27;s music remixed into 5.1 and DTS surround sound. So far, only two of the band&#x27;s albums, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;, have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on DVD-Audio. &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album&#x27;s original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen&#x27;s previously released concerts, &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot; &amp; Live Aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.

Queen have been featured multiple times in the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; franchise: a cover of &quot;Killer Queen&quot; in the original &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, and the Paul Rodgers collaboration &quot;C-lebrity&quot; in a track pack for &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with David Bowie in &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot; in &quot;Guitar Hero: Van Halen&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; in &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;, and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;. On 13 October 2009, Brian May revealed there was &quot;talk&quot; going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; about a dedicated Queen &quot;Rock Band&quot; game.

Queen have also been featured multiple times in the &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchise: a track pack of 10 songs which are compatible with &quot;Rock Band&quot;, &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, and &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; (three of those are also compatible with &quot;Lego Rock Band&quot;). Their hit &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was featured in &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; with full harmony and keys support.
The band also appeared in the video game &quot;Lego Rock Band&quot; as playable Lego avatars. In March 2009, Sony Computer Entertainment released a Queen branded version of the company&#x27;s karaoke franchise, &quot;SingStar&quot;. The game, which is available on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, is titled &quot;SingStar Queen&quot; and has 25 songs on the PS3 and 20 on the PS2. &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and other songs by Queen also appear in &quot;DJ Hero&quot;.

===&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;===

In a September 2010 BBC interview, Brian May announced that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury in a biographical film about the band. &quot;Time&quot; commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to &quot;creative differences&quot; between him and the surviving band members. In December 2013, it was announced that Ben Whishaw, known for playing Q in the James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;, was a possible replacement for Baron Cohen in the role of Mercury, but Whishaw pulled out a few months later amidst uncertainty about how the film was progressing.
The project regained momentum in 2016. It was announced on 4 November that the film had secured the backing of 20th Century Fox, New Regency and GK Films. By this time, the film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, after the band&#x27;s song of the same name. Freddie Mercury was to be played by Rami Malek, and shooting was scheduled to begin in early 2017. The motion picture was written by Anthony McCarten, with a story by McCarten and Peter Morgan, who received Oscar nominations for his screenplays &quot;The Queen&quot; and &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;.

Released in October 2018, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; focuses on Queen&#x27;s formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert. The film has grossed over $900 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. Malek received wide acclaim and numerous accolades for his portrayal of Mercury, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. The Live Aid segment was praised, but there was criticism from not exploring more complex themes involving Mercury, with the &quot;New York Post&quot;&#x27;s Johnny Oleksinski stating, &quot;What we ultimately wanted from Bohemian Rhapsody was not carbon-copied concerts, but behind-closed-doors insight into a deeply private, complicated, internationally beloved superstar.&quot; After the release of the film, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; re-entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the third time (having previously charted in 1976 and 1992), charting at number 33 on 12 November 2018. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody: The Original Soundtrack&quot; received an American Music Award for Top Soundtrack.

=== Other films ===
The soundtrack for the film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980) was by Queen. The band also contributed music to &quot;Highlander&quot; (the original 1986 film), with &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;One Year of Love&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;, and the theme &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;, which was also used as the theme of the (1992–1998). In choosing music for &quot;Highlander&quot;, director Russell Mulcahy stated, &quot;I thought about one band – Queen. They write strong, anthemic songs and this movie needs their energy&quot;. In the US, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was re-released as a single in 1992 after appearing in the comedy film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. The single subsequently reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (with &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; as the first track on the single) and helped rekindle the band&#x27;s popularity in North America.

Several films have featured their songs performed by other artists. A version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; by Anne Hathaway was in the 2004 film &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot;. In 2006, Brittany Murphy also recorded a cover of the same song for the 2006 film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. In 2001, a version of &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; was performed by Jim Broadbent and Nicole Kidman in the film musical &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. The 2001 film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; has a version of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; performed by Robbie Williams and Queen; the film also features &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; played by the medieval audience.

===Television===
&quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot; was used as the theme song of the Japanese television drama &quot;Pride&quot; on Fuji Television in 2004, starring Takuya Kimura and Yūko Takeuchi. The show&#x27;s soundtrack also contained other songs by Queen. A song that has grown in popularity four decades since its release, the initial rebirth of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; has been attributed to its appearance in the 2004 cult classic zombie apocalypse film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. The song has featured in the BBC television show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, and in 2005 it was voted as &quot;The Greatest Driving Song Ever&quot; by the series&#x27; viewers.

Keeping in a tradition of naming each season&#x27;s episodes after songs by 1970s rock bands, the eighth and final season of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; had episodes named after Queen songs. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; served as the season premiere. With an entry for the year 1977, Queen featured in the VH1 series &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot;, broadcast in the US. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has made storylines which have featured Queen songs such as &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; (both sung by Homer), and &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot;. The latter also appears in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, as does &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, and an episode of the show, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, is named after (and features) the song. Queen were profiled in season 1, episode 16 of &quot;VH1&#x27;s Legends&quot;, broadcast in 1998.

On 11 April 2006, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the American singing contest television show &quot;American Idol&quot;. Each contestant was required to sing a Queen song during that week of the competition. Songs which appeared on the show included &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, and &quot;Innuendo&quot;. Brian May later criticised the show for editing specific scenes, one of which made the group&#x27;s time with contestant Ace Young look negative, despite it being the opposite. Taylor and May again appeared on the &quot;American Idol&quot; season 8 finale in May 2009, performing &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. On 15 November 2009, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the singing contest television show &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the UK.

In 2007, Queen featured as one of the main artists in the fifth episode of the BBC/VH1 series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot;—focusing on stadium rock, the episode itself was named &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. In the autumn of 2009, &quot;Glee&quot; featured the fictional high school&#x27;s show choir singing &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; as their second act performance in the episode &quot;The Rhodes Not Taken&quot;. The performance was included on the show&#x27;s &quot;&quot; soundtrack CD. In June 2010, the choir performed &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; in the episode &quot;Funk&quot;. The following week&#x27;s episode, &quot;Journey to Regionals&quot;, features a rival choir performing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in its entirety. The song was featured on the . In May 2012, the choir performed &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; in the episode &quot;Nationals&quot;, and the song features in &quot;&quot;. In November 2014, &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Queen Song&quot;, a 90-minute television special counting down Britain&#x27;s 20 favourite Queen songs, aired on ITV in the UK. In November 2021, &quot;The Queen Family Singalong&quot;, featuring performances of songs by Queen accompanied with on-screen karaoke lyrics encouraging viewers to sing along, aired on ABC in the US.

==Legacy==
In 2002, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was voted &quot;the UK&#x27;s favourite hit of all time&quot; in a poll conducted by the &quot;Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book&quot;. In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Many scholars consider the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; music video groundbreaking, crediting it with popularising the medium. Rock historian Paul Fowles stated that the song is &quot;widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy&quot;. It has been hailed as paving the way for the MTV Generation. In December 2018, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, and the most-streamed classic rock song of all time. The song and original video were downloaded more than 1.6 billion times. In March 2021 it was certified Diamond in the US for combined digital sales and streams equal to 10 million units. Acclaimed for their stadium rock, in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen&#x27;s performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history. In 2007, they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners.

As of 2005, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, Queen albums have spent a total of 1,322 weeks (twenty-six years) on the UK Album Charts, more time than any other act. Also in 2005, with the release of their live album with Paul Rodgers, Queen moved into third place on the list of acts with the most aggregate time spent on the British record charts. In 2022, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was the best-selling album in UK chart history, and the only album to sell over seven million copies in the UK. As of August 2024, the album has spent over 600 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; album is the UK&#x27;s tenth best seller, with sales of 3,746,404 copies. Based on record sales, &quot;Billboard&quot; charts performance, online views and popularity on Spotify, in 2018 &quot;Business Insider&quot; in the US ranked Queen the third most popular rock band of all time, after the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.
The band have released a total of 18 number-one albums, 18 number-one singles, and 10 number-one DVDs worldwide, making them one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million worldwide. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single, and all four members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2009, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the latter was voted the world&#x27;s favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson global music poll. The band received Ivor Novello Awards for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, in 1987, and Outstanding Song Collection, in 2005, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In recognition of the vocal harmonies of Mercury, May and Taylor, in 2006 Queen were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the IFPI named Queen the sixth best-selling artist worldwide in 2018, and the fifth best-selling artist in 2019, in both cases the most popular act of their contemporaries. In January 2020, Queen became the first band to join Queen Elizabeth II on a British coin. Issued by the Royal Mint, the commemorative £5 coin features the instruments of all four members of the band. In July 2020, Queen became the third band (after the Beatles and Pink Floyd) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

Queen are one of the most bootlegged bands ever, according to Nick Weymouth, who manages the band&#x27;s official website. A 2001 survey discovered the existence of 12,225 websites dedicated to Queen bootlegs, the highest number for any band. Bootleg recordings have contributed to the band&#x27;s popularity in certain countries where Western music is censored, such as Iran. In a project called &quot;Queen: The Top 100 Bootlegs&quot;, many of these have been made officially available to download for a nominal fee from Queen&#x27;s website, with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust. In 2004, Queen became the first Western rock act to be officially accepted in Iran following the release of their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Queen at number 52 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, while ranking Mercury the 18th-greatest singer, and May the twenty-sixth-greatest guitarist. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted Mercury the second-greatest frontman. Queen were named 13th on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list, and in 2010 were ranked 17th on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. In 2012, &quot;Gigwise&quot; readers named Queen the best band of the past 60 years. Eddie Trunk argued that Queen&#x27;s importance, in common with Thin Lizzy and Deep Purple, was &quot;not as fully recognized&quot; in the US because elsewhere they &quot;often played to much bigger crowds in stadium venues&quot;. Queen had stopped touring the US in 1982 as their success there had started to wane, but they remained a touring &quot;juggernaut&quot;, filling stadiums and arenas internationally in the 1980s until their final tour (with Mercury) in 1986.

===Influence===

Queen have been credited with making a significant contribution to genres such as hard rock and heavy metal. The band have been cited as an influence by many other musicians. Moreover, like their music, the bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by Queen or have expressed admiration for them are diverse, spanning different generations, countries, and genres, including heavy metal: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Trivium, Megadeth, Anthrax, Melvins, Slipknot, Rob Zombie, and Rage Against the Machine; hard rock: Guns N&#x27; Roses, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Steve Vai, the Cult, the Darkness, and Foo Fighters; alternative rock: Nirvana, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, the Flaming Lips, Kid Rock, and Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins; shock rock: Marilyn Manson; pop rock: the Killers, My Chemical Romance, and Panic! at the Disco; country: Faith Hill, and Carrie Underwood; pop: George Michael, Robbie Williams, Adele, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry; and K-pop: Psy, and BTS.

In the early 1970s, Queen helped spur the heavy metal genre&#x27;s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence. Queen&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; has been cited as a precursor of speed metal. Metallica recorded a cover version of &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, which first appeared on the &quot;Rubáiyát: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot; album in 1990, and they still performed it live in the 2000s. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, a pioneer of &quot;neo-classical metal&quot;, listened to Queen as a kid, and spoke of Brian May being &quot;very inventive when it comes to tones and having all those pickup configurations. Brian tends not to stick to just pentatonics, either; he mixes it all up, which is how I like to think, too.&quot; Thom Yorke of Radiohead received his first guitar at 7 years old, encouraged after seeing May in a broadcast of a Queen concert. At 10 years old, Yorke made his own homemade guitar, trying to imitate what May had done with his Red Special, but he was not satisfied with the result. Subsequently, Queen was one of the first influences of his band.

<text>Macedonia ( ; , ), also called Macedon ( ), was an ancient kingdom on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece, which later became the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece. The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the southwest, Illyria to the northwest, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south.

Before the 4th century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta and Thebes, and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. During the reign of the Argead king PhilipII (359–336 BC), Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the &quot;sarissa&quot; pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC. PhilipII&#x27;s son Alexander the Great, leading a federation of Greek states, accomplished his father&#x27;s objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander&#x27;s subsequent campaign of conquest, he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period, his Macedonian Empire was the most powerful in the world – the definitive Hellenistic state, inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy, engineering, and science spread across the empire and beyond. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle, tutor to Alexander, whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323BC, the ensuing wars of the Diadochi, and the partitioning of Alexander&#x27;s short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Attalid kingdom. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles for control of the territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia&#x27;s decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.

The Macedonian kings, who wielded absolute power and commanded state resources such as gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other &quot;diadochi&quot; successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by the institution of the army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.

==Etymology==

The name Macedonia (, &quot;&quot;) comes from the ethnonym (), which itself is derived from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (), meaning &quot;tall, slim&quot;, also the name of a people related to the Dorians (Herodotus), and possibly descriptive of Ancient Macedonians. It is most likely cognate with the adjective (), meaning &quot;long&quot; or &quot;tall&quot; in Ancient Greek. The name is believed to have originally meant either &quot;highlanders&quot;, &quot;the tall ones&quot;, or &quot;high grown men&quot;. Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes claims that both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology, however Filip De Decker rejects Beekesʼ arguments as insufficient.

==History==
===Early history and legend===

The Classical Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides reported the legend that the Macedonian kings of the Argead dynasty were descendants of Temenus, king of Argos, and could therefore claim the mythical Heracles as one of their ancestors as well as a direct lineage from Zeus, chief god of the Greek pantheon. Contradictory legends state that either Perdiccas I of Macedon or Caranus of Macedon were the founders of the Argead dynasty, with either five or eight kings before AmyntasI. The assertion that the Argeads descended from Temenus was accepted by the &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; authorities of the Ancient Olympic Games, permitting Alexander I of Macedon () to enter the competitions owing to his perceived Greek heritage. Little is known about the kingdom before the reign of AlexanderI&#x27;s father Amyntas I of Macedon () during the Archaic period.

The kingdom of Macedonia was situated along the Haliacmon and Axius rivers in Lower Macedonia, north of Mount Olympus. Historian Robert Malcolm Errington suggests that one of the earliest Argead kings established Aigai (modern Vergina) as their capital in the mid-7th centuryBC. Before the 4th centuryBC, the kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to the western and central parts of the region of Macedonia in modern Greece. It gradually expanded into the region of Upper Macedonia, inhabited by the Greek Lyncestae and Elimiotae tribes, and into regions of Emathia, Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Almopia, which were inhabited by various peoples such as Thracians and Phrygians. Macedonia&#x27;s non-Greek neighbors included Thracians, inhabiting territories to the northeast, Illyrians to the northwest, and Paeonians to the north, while the lands of Thessaly to the south and Epirus to the west were inhabited by Greeks with similar cultures to that of the Macedonians.

A year after Darius I of Persia () launched an invasion into Europe against the Scythians, Paeonians, Thracians, and several Greek city-states of the Balkans, the Persian general Megabazus used diplomacy to convince AmyntasI to submit as a vassal of the Achaemenid Empire, ushering in the period of Achaemenid Macedonia. Achaemenid Persian hegemony over Macedonia was briefly interrupted by the Ionian Revolt (499–493BC), yet the Persian general Mardonius brought it back under Achaemenid suzerainty.

Although Macedonia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and was never made a satrapy (i.e. province) of the Achaemenid Empire, it was expected to provide troops for the Achaemenid army. AlexanderI provided Macedonian military support to Xerxes I () during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480–479 BC, and Macedonian soldiers fought on the side of the Persians at the 479BC Battle of Platea. Following the Greek victory at Salamis in 480BC, AlexanderI was employed as an Achaemenid diplomat to propose a peace treaty and alliance with Athens, an offer that was rejected. Soon afterwards, the Achaemenid forces were forced to withdraw from mainland Europe, marking the end of Persian control over Macedonia.

===Involvement in the Classical Greek world===
Although initially a Persian vassal, AlexanderI of Macedon fostered friendly diplomatic relations with his former Greek enemies, the Athenian and Spartan-led coalition of Greek city-states. His successor PerdiccasII () led the Macedonians to war in four separate conflicts against Athens, leader of the Delian League, while incursions by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom threatened Macedonia&#x27;s territorial integrity in the northeast. The Athenian statesman Pericles promoted colonization of the Strymon River near the Kingdom of Macedonia, where the colonial city of Amphipolis was founded in 437/436BC so that it could provide Athens with a steady supply of silver and gold as well as timber and pitch to support the Athenian navy. Initially Perdiccas II did not take any action and might have even welcomed the Athenians, as the Thracians were foes to both of them. This changed due to an Athenian alliance with a brother and cousin of PerdiccasII who had rebelled against him. Thus, two separate wars were fought against Athens between 433 and 431BC. The Macedonian king retaliated by promoting the rebellion of Athens&#x27; allies in Chalcidice and subsequently won over the strategic city of Potidaea. After capturing the Macedonian cities Therma and Beroea, Athens besieged Potidaea but failed to overcome it; Therma was returned to Macedonia and much of Chalcidice to Athens in a peace treaty brokered by Sitalces, who provided Athens with military aid in exchange for acquiring new Thracian allies.

PerdiccasII sided with Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, but he was forced to retreat owing to a shortage of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, and he was able to put down Arrhabaeus&#x27;s revolt.
Brasidas died in 422 BC, the year Athens and Sparta struck an accord, the Peace of Nicias, that freed Macedonia from its obligations as an Athenian ally. Following the 418BC Battle of Mantinea, the victorious Spartans formed an alliance with Argos, a military pact PerdiccasII was keen to join given the threat of Spartan allies remaining in Chalcidice. When Argos suddenly switched sides as a pro-Athenian democracy, the Athenian navy was able to form a blockade against Macedonian seaports and invade Chalcidice in 417BC. PerdiccasII sued for peace in 414BC, forming an alliance with Athens that was continued by his son and successor ArchelausI (). Athens then provided naval support to ArchelausI in the 410BC Macedonian siege of Pydna, in exchange for timber and naval equipment.

Although Archelaus I was faced with some internal revolts and had to fend off an invasion of Illyrians led by Sirras of Lynkestis, he was able to project Macedonian power into Thessaly where he sent military aid to his allies. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, ArchelausI moved the capital of the kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea. He improved Macedonia&#x27;s currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides. When ArchelausI was assassinated (perhaps following a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court), the kingdom was plunged into chaos, in an era lasting from 399 to 393BC that included the reign of four different monarchs: Orestes, son of ArchelausI; AeropusII, uncle, regent, and murderer of Orestes; Pausanias, son of AeropusII; and AmyntasII, who was married to the youngest daughter of ArchelausI. Very little is known about this turbulent period; it came to an end when AmyntasIII (), son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of AmyntasI, killed Pausanias and claimed the Macedonian throne.
Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrians led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet AmyntasIII eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379BC.

Alexander II (), son of EurydiceI and AmyntasIII, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the &quot;tagus&quot; (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both AlexanderII and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including AlexanderII&#x27;s brother and future king PhilipII (). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for PerdiccasIII (), younger brother of AlexanderII, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III&#x27;s reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery. However, an Athenian invasion led by Timotheus, son of Conon, managed to capture Methone and Pydna, and an Illyrian invasion led by Bardylis succeeded in killing PerdiccasIII and 4,000 Macedonian troops in battle.

===Rise of Macedon===

Philip II was twenty-four years old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to convince the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.

Philip II spent his initial years radically transforming the Macedonian army. A reform of its organization, equipment, and training, including the introduction of the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the &quot;sarissa&quot;), proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much PhilipII&#x27;s royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and the extent to which his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the Theban hegemony, especially after meeting with the general Epaminondas.

The Macedonians, like the other Greeks, traditionally practiced monogamy, but PhilipII practiced polygamy and married seven wives with perhaps only one that did not involve the loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or new allies. His first marriages were to Phila of Elimeia of the Upper Macedonian aristocracy as well as the Illyrian princess Audata to ensure a marriage alliance. To establish an alliance with Larissa in Thessaly, he married the Thessalian noblewoman Philinna in 358BC, who bore him a son who would later rule as Philip III Arrhidaeus (). In 357BC, he married Olympias to secure an alliance with Arybbas, the King of Epirus and the Molossians. This marriage would bear a son who would later rule as AlexanderIII (better known as Alexander the Great) and claim descent from the legendary Achilles by way of his dynastic heritage from Epirus. It is unclear whether or not the Achaemenid Persian kings influenced PhilipII&#x27;s practice of polygamy, although his predecessor AmyntasIII had three sons with a possible second wife Gygaea: Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus. PhilipII had Archelaus put to death in 359BC, while PhilipII&#x27;s other two half brothers fled to Olynthos, serving as a &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Olynthian War (349–348BC) against the Chalcidian League.

While Athens was preoccupied with the Social War (357–355 BC), PhilipII retook Amphipolis from them in 357BC and the following year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he handed over to the Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took Crenides, refounding it as Philippi, while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos II of the Grabaei. During the 355–354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.

Philip II then involved Macedonia in the Third Sacred War (356–346BC). It began when Phocis captured and plundered the temple of Apollo at Delphi instead of submitting unpaid fines, causing the Amphictyonic League to declare war on Phocis and a civil war among the members of the Thessalian League aligned with either Phocis or Thebes. PhilipII&#x27;s initial campaign against Pherae in Thessaly in 353BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general Onomarchus. PhilipII in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352BC at the Battle of Crocus Field, which led to PhilipII&#x27;s election as leader (&quot;archon&quot;) of the Thessalian League, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council, and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis, niece of the tyrant Jason of Pherae.

Philip II had some early involvement with the Achaemenid Empire, especially by supporting satraps and mercenaries who rebelled against the central authority of the Achaemenid king. The satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia Artabazos II, who was in rebellion against Artaxerxes III, was able to take refuge as an exile at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC. He was accompanied in exile by his family and by his mercenary general Memnon of Rhodes. Barsine, daughter of Artabazos, and future wife of Alexander the Great, grew up at the Macedonian court.

After campaigning against the Thracian ruler Cersobleptes, in 349BC, PhilipII began his war against the Chalcidian League, which had been reestablished in 375BC following a temporary disbandment. Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus, Olynthos was captured by PhilipII in 348BC, and its inhabitants were sold into slavery, including some Athenian citizens. The Athenians, especially in a series of speeches by Demosthenes known as the &quot;Olynthiacs&quot;, were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack and in 346BC concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates. The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that PhilipII would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese. Meanwhile, Phocis and Thermopylae were captured by Macedonian forces, the Delphic temple robbers were executed, and PhilipII was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council and the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games. Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they eventually accepted these conditions, perhaps after some persuasion by Demosthenes in his oration &quot;On the Peace&quot;.
Over the next few years, Philip II reformed local governments in Thessaly, campaigned against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I, deposed Arybbas in Epirus in favor of his brother-in-law AlexanderI (through PhilipII&#x27;s marriage to Olympias), and defeated Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Anatolia. In 342BC, PhilipII conquered a Thracian city in what is now Bulgaria and renamed it Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv). War broke out with Athens in 340BC while PhilipII was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonia&#x27;s involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339BC. Thebes ejected a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea (near Thermopylae), leading Thebes to join Athens, Megara, Corinth, Achaea, and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC. After the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea, PhilipII installed an oligarchy in Thebes, yet was lenient toward Athens, wishing to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek city-states except Sparta. Despite the Kingdom of Macedonia&#x27;s official exclusion from the league, in 337BC, PhilipII was elected as the leader (&quot;hegemon&quot;) of its council (&quot;synedrion&quot;) and the commander-in-chief (&quot;strategos autokrator&quot;) of a forthcoming campaign to invade the Achaemenid Empire. Philip&#x27;s plan to punish the Persians for the suffering of the Greeks and to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor as well as perhaps the panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece, contributed to his decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persians offered aid to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341–340BC, highlighting Macedonia&#x27;s strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as the Persian king Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential.

When Philip II married Cleopatra Eurydice, niece of general Attalus, talk of providing new potential heirs at the wedding feast infuriated PhilipII&#x27;s son Alexander, a veteran of the Battle of Chaeronea, and his mother Olympias. They fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella by PhilipII. When PhilipII arranged a marriage between his son Arrhidaeus and Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria, Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead. PhilipII then cancelled the wedding altogether and exiled Alexander&#x27;s advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, PhilipII had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias&#x27; brother (and Cleopatra&#x27;s uncle) AlexanderI of Epirus, but PhilipII was assassinated by his bodyguard, Pausanias of Orestis, during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander in 336BC.

===Empire===


Modern scholars have argued over the possible role of AlexanderIII &quot;the Great&quot; and his mother Olympias in the assassination of PhilipII, noting the latter&#x27;s choice to exclude Alexander from his planned invasion of Asia, choosing instead for him to act as regent of Greece and deputy &quot;hegemon&quot; of the League of Corinth, and the potential bearing of another male heir between PhilipII and his new wife, Cleopatra Eurydice. AlexanderIII () was immediately proclaimed king by an assembly of the army and leading aristocrats, chief among them being Antipater and Parmenion. By the end of his reign and military career in 323BC, Alexander would rule over an empire consisting of mainland Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and much of Central and South Asia (i.e. modern Pakistan). Among his first acts was the burial of his father at Aigai. The members of the League of Corinth revolted at the news of PhilipII&#x27;s death, but were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy, electing Alexander as &quot;hegemon&quot; of the league to carry out the planned invasion of Achaemenid Persia.

In 335 BC, Alexander fought against the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their surrender on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus, son of Bardylis, threatened to attack Macedonia with the aid of Glaucias, king of the Taulantii, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Illyrians at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander&#x27;s forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned the city to the ground as a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.

Throughout his military career, Alexander won every battle that he personally commanded. His first victory against the Persians in Asia Minor at the Battle of the Granicus in 334BC used a small cavalry contingent as a distraction to allow his infantry to cross the river followed by a cavalry charge from his companion cavalry. Alexander led the cavalry charge at the Battle of Issus in 333BC, forcing the Persian king Darius III and his army to flee. DariusIII, despite having superior numbers, was again forced to flee the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC. The Persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of Bactria and kinsman, Bessus, in 330BC. The Macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed Bessus in what is now Afghanistan, securing the region of Sogdia in the process. At the 326BC Battle of the Hydaspes (modern-day Punjab), when the war elephants of King Porus of the Pauravas threatened Alexander&#x27;s troops, he had them form open ranks to surround the elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their &quot;sarissa&quot; pikes. When his Macedonian troops threatened mutiny in 324BC at Opis, Babylonia (near modern Baghdad, Iraq), Alexander offered Macedonian military titles and greater responsibilities to Persian officers and units instead, forcing his troops to seek forgiveness at a staged banquet of reconciliation between Persians and Macedonians.
Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of . While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331BC. His attempt in 327BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of &quot;proskynesis&quot; borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330BC, this was &quot;symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king&#x27;s interests and those of his country and people&quot;, according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328BC is described as &quot;vengeful and reckless&quot; by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of DariusIII, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324BC.

Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy &quot;hegemon&quot; of the League of Corinth in Alexander&#x27;s stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater&#x27;s hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.

When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander&#x27;s half-brother PhilipIII Arrhidaeus () as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, AlexanderIV (). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the &quot;diadochi&quot;, the former generals of Alexander&#x27;s army.

A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander&#x27;s death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy&#x27;s seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the council of the army as well.

Forming an alliance with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens&#x27; port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon&#x27;s decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319–315BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317BC, PhilipIII, by way of his politically engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards, Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon&#x27;s troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of PhilipIII and Eurydice&#x27;s army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor and dozens of other Macedonian nobles killed, but by the spring of 316BC, Cassander had defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.

Cassander married Philip II&#x27;s daughter Thessalonike and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos (modern Durrës, Albania). By 313BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii. By 316BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his Babylonian satrapy, leading Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus to issue a joint ultimatum to Antigonus in 315BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, King AlexanderIV and the queen mother Roxana. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311BC, when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as &quot;first in Asia&quot;, Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace. Cassander had AlexanderIV and Roxana put to death in the winter of 311/310BC, and between 306 and 305BC the &quot;diadochi&quot; were declared kings of their respective territories.

===Hellenistic era===

The beginning of Hellenistic Greece was defined by the struggle between the Antipatrid dynasty, led first by Cassander (), son of Antipater, and the Antigonid dynasty, led by the Macedonian general Antigonus I Monophthalmus () and his son, the future king DemetriusI (). Cassander besieged Athens in 303BC, but was forced to retreat to Macedonia when Demetrius invaded Boeotia to his rear, attempting to sever his path of retreat. While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate PhilipII&#x27;s Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter () of Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemaic dynasty, Seleucus I Nicator () of the Seleucid Empire, and Lysimachus (), King of Thrace, defeated the Antigonids at the Battle of Ipsus in 301BC, killing Antigonus and forcing Demetrius into flight.

Cassander died in 297 BC, and his sickly son PhilipIV died the same year, succeeded by Cassander&#x27;s other sons Alexander V of Macedon () and Antipater II of Macedon (), with their mother Thessalonike of Macedon acting as regent. While Demetrius fought against the Antipatrid forces in Greece, AntipaterII killed his own mother to obtain power. His desperate brother AlexanderV then requested aid from Pyrrhus of Epirus (), who had fought alongside Demetrius at the Battle of Ipsus, but was sent to Egypt as a hostage as part of an agreement between Demetrius and PtolemyI. In exchange for defeating the forces of AntipaterII and forcing him to flee to the court of Lysimachus in Thrace, Pyrrhus was awarded the westernmost portions of the Macedonian kingdom. Demetrius had his nephew AlexanderV assassinated and was then proclaimed king of Macedonia, but his subjects protested against his aloof, Eastern-style autocracy.

War broke out between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290BC when Lanassa, wife of Pyrrhus, daughter of Agathocles of Syracuse, left him for Demetrius and offered him her dowry of Corcyra. The war dragged on until 288BC, when Demetrius lost the support of the Macedonians and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the former taking western Macedonia and the latter eastern Macedonia. By 286BC, Lysimachus had expelled Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia. In 282BC, a new war erupted between SeleucusI and Lysimachus; the latter was killed in the Battle of Corupedion, allowing SeleucusI to take control of Thrace and Macedonia. In two dramatic reversals of fortune, SeleucusI was assassinated in 281BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos, son of PtolemyI and grandson of Antipater, who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia before being killed in battle in 279BC by Celtic invaders in the Gallic invasion of Greece. The Macedonian army proclaimed the general Sosthenes of Macedon as king, although he apparently refused the title. After defeating the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the raiding party of Brennus, Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia. The Gallic invaders ravaged Macedonia until Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, defeated them in Thrace at the 277BC Battle of Lysimachia and was then proclaimed king Antigonus II of Macedon ().

In 280 BC, Pyrrhus embarked on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured his position on the Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.
Pyrrhus lost much of his support among the Macedonians in 273BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal cemetery of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued AntigonusII in the Peloponnese, yet AntigonusII was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia. Pyrrhus was killed while besieging Argos in 272BC, allowing AntigonusII to reclaim the rest of Greece. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the Kingdom of Paeonia.

The Aetolian League hampered AntigonusII&#x27;s control over central Greece, and the formation of the Achaean League in 251BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia against Ptolemaic Egypt during the Syrian Wars, the Ptolemaic navy heavily disrupted AntigonusII&#x27;s efforts to control mainland Greece. With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War (267–261BC). By 265BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by AntigonusII&#x27;s forces, and a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos. Athens finally surrendered in 261BC. After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II, a peace settlement between AntigonusII and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt was finally struck in 255BC.
In 251 BC, Aratus of Sicyon led a rebellion against AntigonusII, and in 250BC, PtolemyII declared his support for the self-proclaimed King Alexander of Corinth. Although Alexander died in 246BC and Antigonus was able to score a naval victory against the Ptolemies at Andros, the Macedonians lost the Acrocorinth to the forces of Aratus in 243BC, followed by the induction of Corinth into the Achaean League. AntigonusII made peace with the Achaean League in 240BC, ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece. AntigonusII died in 239BC and was succeeded by his son Demetrius II of Macedon (). Seeking an alliance with Macedonia to defend against the Aetolians, the queen mother and regent of Epirus, Olympias II, offered her daughter Phthia of Macedon to DemetriusII in marriage. Demetrius II accepted her proposal, but he damaged relations with the Seleucids by divorcing Stratonice of Macedon. Although the Aetolians formed an alliance with the Achaean League as a result, DemetriusII was able to invade Boeotia and capture it from the Aetolians by 236BC.

The Achaean League managed to capture Megalopolis in 235BC, and by the end of DemetriusII&#x27;s reign most of the Peloponnese except Argos was taken from the Macedonians. DemetriusII also lost an ally in Epirus when the monarchy was toppled in a republican revolution. DemetriusII enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron to defend Acarnania against Aetolia, and in 229BC, they managed to defeat the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos. Another Illyrian ruler, Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom, invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of DemetriusII shortly before his death in 229BC. Although his young son Philip immediately inherited the throne, his regent Antigonus III Doson (), nephew of AntigonusII, was proclaimed king by the army, with Philip as his heir, following a string of military victories against the Illyrians in the north and the Aetolians in Thessaly.
Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII&#x27;s forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league in the same vein as PhilipII&#x27;s League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power for the first time in its history, restoring Macedonia&#x27;s position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.

Philip V of Macedon () faced immediate challenges to his authority by the Illyrian Dardani and Aetolian League. PhilipV and his allies were successful against the Aetolians and their allies in the Social War (220–217 BC), yet he made peace with the Aetolians once he heard of incursions by the Dardani in the north and the Carthaginian victory over the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217BC. Demetrius of Pharos is alleged to have convinced PhilipV to first secure Illyria in advance of an invasion of the Italian peninsula. In 216BC, PhilipV sent a hundred light warships into the Adriatic Sea to attack Illyria, a move that prompted Scerdilaidas of the Ardiaean Kingdom to appeal to the Romans for aid. Rome responded by sending ten heavy quinqueremes from Roman Sicily to patrol the Illyrian coasts, causing PhilipV to reverse course and order his fleet to retreat, averting open conflict for the time being.

===Conflict with Rome===

In 215 BC, at the height of the Second Punic War with the Carthaginian Empire, Roman authorities intercepted a ship off the Calabrian coast holding a Macedonian envoy and a Carthaginian ambassador in possession of a treaty composed by Hannibal declaring an alliance with PhilipV. The treaty stipulated that Carthage had the sole right to negotiate the terms of Rome&#x27;s hypothetical surrender and promised mutual aid if a resurgent Rome should seek revenge against either Macedonia or Carthage. Although the Macedonians were perhaps only interested in safeguarding their newly conquered territories in Illyria, the Romans were nevertheless able to thwart whatever grand ambitions PhilipV had for the Adriatic region during the First Macedonian War (214–205BC). In 214BC, Rome positioned a naval fleet at Oricus, which was assaulted along with Apollonia by Macedonian forces. When the Macedonians captured Lissus in 212BC, the Roman Senate responded by inciting the Aetolian League, Sparta, Elis, Messenia, and Attalus I () of Pergamon to wage war against PhilipV, keeping him occupied and away from Italy.

The Aetolian League concluded a peace agreement with PhilipV in 206BC, and the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice in 205BC, ending the war and allowing the Macedonians to retain some captured settlements in Illyria. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201BC. These states were concerned about PhilipV&#x27;s alliance with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202–195BC) as PhilipV captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. Although Rome&#x27;s envoys played a critical role in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200BC, the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; (people&#x27;s assembly) rejected the Roman Senate&#x27;s proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia. Meanwhile, PhilipV conquered territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos, which led Rhodes to form an alliance with Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and Chios against Macedonia. Despite PhilipV&#x27;s nominal alliance with the Seleucid king, he lost the naval Battle of Chios in 201BC and was blockaded at Bargylia by the Rhodian and Pergamene navies.
While Philip V was busy fighting Rome&#x27;s Greek allies, Rome viewed this as an opportunity to punish this former ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require few resources. The Roman Senate demanded that PhilipV cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances. When the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate&#x27;s declaration of war in 200BC and handed their ultimatum to PhilipV, demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War (200–197BC), with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations in Apollonia.
The Macedonians successfully defended their territory for roughly two years, but the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus managed to expel PhilipV from Macedonia in 198BC, forcing his men to take refuge in Thessaly. When the Achaean League switched their loyalties from Macedonia to Rome, the Macedonian king sued for peace, but the terms offered were considered too stringent, and so the war continued. In June 197BC, the Macedonians were defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae. Rome then ratified a treaty that forced Macedonia to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions outside of Macedonia proper, if only to act as a buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece. Although some Greeks suspected Roman intentions of supplanting Macedonia as the new hegemonic power in Greece, Flaminius announced at the Isthmian Games of 196BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek liberty by leaving behind no garrisons and by not exacting tribute of any kind. His promise was delayed by negotiations with the Spartan king Nabis, who had meanwhile captured Argos, yet Roman forces evacuated Greece in 194BC.

Encouraged by the Aetolian League and their calls to liberate Greece from the Romans, the Seleucid king AntiochusIII landed with his army at Demetrias, Thessaly, in 192BC, and was elected &quot;strategos&quot; by the Aetolians. Macedonia, the Achaean League, and other Greek city-states maintained their alliance with Rome. The Romans defeated the Seleucids in the 191BC Battle of Thermopylae as well as the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC, forcing the Seleucids to pay a war indemnity, dismantle most of its navy, and abandon its claims to any territories north or west of the Taurus Mountains in the 188BC Treaty of Apamea. With Rome&#x27;s acceptance, PhilipV was able to capture some cities in central Greece in 191–189BC that had been allied to AntiochusIII, while Rhodes and Eumenes II () of Pergamon gained territories in Asia Minor.

Failing to please all sides in various territorial disputes, the Roman Senate decided in 184/183BC to force PhilipV to abandon Aenus and Maronea, since these had been declared free cities in the Treaty of Apamea. This assuaged the fear of EumenesII that Macedonia could pose a threat to his lands in the Hellespont. Perseus of Macedon () succeeded PhilipV and executed his brother Demetrius, who had been favored by the Romans but was charged by Perseus with high treason. Perseus then attempted to form marriage alliances with Prusias II of Bithynia and Seleucus IV Philopator of the Seleucid Empire, along with renewed relations with Rhodes that greatly unsettled EumenesII. Although EumenesII attempted to undermine these diplomatic relationships, Perseus fostered an alliance with the Boeotian League, extended his authority into Illyria and Thrace, and in 174BC, won the role of managing the Temple of Apollo at Delphi as a member of the Amphictyonic Council.
Eumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and delivered a speech to the Senate denouncing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Perseus. This convinced the Roman Senate to declare the Third Macedonian War (171–168BC). Although Perseus&#x27;s forces were victorious against the Romans at the Battle of Callinicus in 171BC, the Macedonian army was defeated at the Battle of Pydna in June 168BC. Perseus fled to Samothrace but surrendered shortly afterwards, was brought to Rome for the triumph of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, and was placed under house arrest at Alba Fucens, where he died in 166BC. The Romans abolished the Macedonian monarchy by installing four separate allied republics in its stead, their capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many social and economic interactions between the inhabitants of these republics, including the banning of marriages between them and the (temporary) prohibition on gold and silver mining. A certain Andriscus, claiming Antigonid descent, rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Juventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom. This was followed in 146BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.

==Institutions==
===Division of power===
At the head of Macedonia&#x27;s government was the king (&quot;basileus&quot;). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (&quot;basilikoi paides&quot;), bodyguards (&quot;somatophylakes&quot;), companions (&quot;hetairoi&quot;), friends (&quot;philoi&quot;), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding the extent to which each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.

===Kingship and the royal court===
The earliest known government of ancient Macedonia was that of its monarchy, lasting until 167BC when it was abolished by the Romans. The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed since at least the time of Archaic Greece, with Homeric aristocratic roots in Mycenaean Greece. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages, Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions, each having its own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding the issue of whether primogeniture was the established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king. It is unclear if the male offspring of Macedonian queens or consorts were always preferred over others given the accession of Archelaus I of Macedon, son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father&#x27;s designated heir apparent.
It is known that Macedonian kings before PhilipII upheld the privileges and carried out the responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, determining the kingdom&#x27;s foreign policies, and negotiating alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.

Little is known about the judicial system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military. PhilipII was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father&#x27;s reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers, but lost some core support among them for adopting some of the trappings of an Eastern, Persian monarch, a &quot;lord and master&quot; as Carol J. King suggests, instead of a &quot;comrade-in-arms&quot; as was the traditional relationship of Macedonian kings with their companions. Alexander&#x27;s father, PhilipII, was perhaps influenced by Persian traditions when he adopted institutions similar to those found in the Achaemenid realm, such as having a royal secretary, royal archive, royal pages, and a seated throne.

===Royal pages===

The royal pages were adolescent boys and young men conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king&#x27;s companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during &quot;symposia&quot; (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.

===Bodyguards===
Royal bodyguards served as the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the &quot;agema&quot; of the &quot;hypaspistai&quot;, a type of ancient special forces usually numbering in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king&#x27;s inner circle, were not always responsible for protecting the king&#x27;s life on and off the battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.

===Companions, friends, councils, and assemblies===

The companions, including the elite companion cavalry and &quot;pezhetairoi&quot; infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king&#x27;s bodyguards. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence suggests the existence of an assembly of the army during times of war and a people&#x27;s assembly during times of peace.

Members of the council had the right to speak freely, and although there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, it is clear that the king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father&#x27;s assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.

===Magistrates, the commonwealth, local government, and allied states===
Antigonid Macedonian kings relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, such as the military &quot;strategos&quot; and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (&quot;archon&quot;) of a large city (&quot;polis&quot;), as well as the politico-religious office of the &quot;epistates&quot;. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic &quot;philoi&quot; and &quot;hetairoi&quot; who filled vacancies for army officers.
In ancient Athens, the Athenian democracy was restored on three separate occasions following the initial conquest of the city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (&quot;boule&quot;), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (&quot;epistates&quot;) to monitor the city&#x27;s political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (&quot;ecclesia&quot;) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.

Within the Macedonian commonwealth, some evidence from the 3rd centuryBC indicates that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although individual Macedonian cities nominally participated in Panhellenic events as independent entities, in reality, the granting of &quot;asylia&quot; (inviolability, diplomatic immunity, and the right of asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities was handled directly by the king. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek &quot;koina&quot; (i.e., federations of city-states, the &quot;sympoliteia&quot;) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of &quot;proxenia&quot; (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. Abundant evidence exists for the granting of &quot;proxenia&quot; as being the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, and some evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. City-states that were allied with Macedonia issued their own decrees regarding &quot;proxenia&quot;. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (&quot;prostates&quot;) of the league.

===Military===


====Early Macedonian army====

The basic structure of the Ancient Macedonian army was the division between the companion cavalry (&quot;hetairoi&quot;) and the foot companions (&quot;pezhetairoi&quot;), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War, at times siding with either Athens or Sparta. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen. As evidenced by early 4th century BC artwork, there was a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before PhilipII. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of PhilipII&#x27;s reign in 359BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, yet Malcolm Errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism.

====Philip II and Alexander the Great====
After spending years as a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the &quot;embolon&quot; (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded &quot;peltai&quot; shields that replaced the earlier &quot;aspis&quot;-style shields, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirasses breastplates or &quot;kotthybos&quot; stomach bands, and armed with &quot;sarissa&quot; pikes and daggers as secondary weapons. The elite &quot;hypaspistai&quot; infantry, composed of handpicked men from the ranks of the &quot;pezhetairoi&quot;, were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (&quot;somatophylakes&quot;).
For his lighter missile troops, Philip II employed mercenary Cretan archers as well as Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian javelin throwers, slingers, and archers. He hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.

The only Macedonian cavalry units attested under Alexander were the companion cavalry, yet he formed a &quot;hipparchia&quot; (i.e. unit of a few hundred horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians while campaigning in Asia. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 &quot;prodromoi&quot; cavalry from Thrace. Antipater was able to quickly raise a force of 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323BC. The most elite members of Alexander&#x27;s &quot;hypaspistai&quot; were designated as the &quot;agema&quot;, and a new term for &quot;hypaspistai&quot; emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC: the &quot;argyraspides&quot; (silver shields). The latter continued to serve after the reign of Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his pike-wielding phalanx infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite &quot;hypaspistai&quot; and 9,000 of which were &quot;pezhetairoi&quot;. Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers and introduced native Macedonian archers into the army. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace.

====Antigonid period military====

The Macedonian army continued to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain how many men were appointed as &quot;somatophylakes&quot;, which numbered eight men at the end of Alexander the Great&#x27;s reign, while the &quot;hypaspistai&quot; seem to have morphed into assistants of the &quot;somatophylakes&quot;. At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great&#x27;s royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men, the same number of cavalrymen in the sacred squadron (Latin: &quot;sacra ala&quot;; Greek: &quot;hiera ile&quot;) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219BC. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the sacred squadron and royal cavalry. While Macedonian cavalry of the 4th century BC had fought without shields, the use of shields by cavalry was adopted from the Celtic invaders of the 270s BC who settled in Galatia, central Anatolia.

Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181BC, respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under PhilipV. From at least the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period infantry were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding &quot;peltai&quot; javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected to serve in the elite &quot;agema&quot; vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into &quot;chalkaspides&quot; (bronze shield) and &quot;leukaspides&quot; (white shield) regiments.

The Antigonid Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip the navy. Cassander maintained a small fleet at Pydna, Demetrius I of Macedon had one at Pella, and Antigonus II Gonatas, while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece, used the navy to secure the Macedonian holdings in Demetrias, Chalkis, Piraeus, and Corinth. The navy was considerably expanded during the Chremonidean War (267–261BC), allowing the Macedonian navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255BC Battle of Cos and 245BC Battle of Andros, and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the Cyclades. AntigonusIII Doson used the Macedonian navy to invade Caria, while PhilipV sent 200 ships to fight in the Battle of Chios in 201BC. The Macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197BC peace treaty that concluded the Second Macedonian War with the Roman Republic, although Perseus of Macedon quickly assembled some &quot;lemboi&quot; at the outbreak of the Third Macedonian War in 171BC.

==Society and culture==


===Language and dialects===

Following its adoption as the court language of Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine Greek, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of Greek similar to Thessalian Greek and Northwestern Greek, or a language closely related to Greek. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the preferred language of the Ancient Macedonian army, although it is known that Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during the drinking party where he killed Cleitus the Black. Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.

===Religious beliefs and funerary practices===

By the 5th century BC, the Macedonians and the southern Greeks worshiped more or less the same deities of the Greek pantheon. In Macedonia, political and religious offices were often intertwined. For instance, the head of state for the city of Amphipolis also served as the priest of Asklepios, Greek god of medicine; a similar arrangement existed at Cassandreia, where a cult priest honoring the city&#x27;s founder Cassander was the nominal head of the city. The main sanctuary of Zeus was maintained at Dion, while another at Veria was dedicated to Herakles and was patronized by Demetrius II Aetolicus (). Meanwhile, foreign cults from Egypt were fostered by the royal court, such as the temple of Sarapis at Thessaloniki. The Macedonians also had relations with &quot;international&quot; cults; for example, Macedonian kings Philip III of Macedon and Alexander IV of Macedon made votive offerings to the internationally esteemed Samothrace temple complex of the Cabeiri mystery cult.

In the three royal tombs at Vergina, professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one of the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a &quot;heroon&quot;, a shrine for cult worship of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).

===Economics and social class===

Young Macedonian men were typically expected to engage in hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle during the course of the 5thcenturyBC.

The Macedonian king was an autocratic figure at the head of both government and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his &quot;hetairoi&quot;, the core of the Macedonian aristocracy. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.

===Visual arts===


By the reign of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was importing customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.
Surviving Macedonian painted artwork includes frescoes and murals, but also decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still exist on the bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.

===Theatre, music and performing arts===
Philip II was assassinated in 336 BC at the theatre of Aigai, amid games and spectacles celebrating the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra. Alexander the Great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music. He was especially fond of the plays by Classical Athenian tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, whose works formed part of a proper Greek education for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in the Greek language, including the epics of Homer. While he and his army were stationed at Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon), Alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also for stage performances of Greek tragedies. The contemporaneous famous actors Thessalus and Athenodorus performed at the event.

Music was also appreciated in Macedonia. In addition to the agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, one of the main markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also for cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.

===Literature, education, philosophy, and patronage===
Perdiccas II of Macedon was able to host well-known Classical Greek intellectual visitors at his royal court, such as the lyric poet Melanippides and the renowned medical doctor Hippocrates, and Pindar&#x27;s &quot;enkomion&quot; written for Alexander I of Macedon may have been composed at his court. ArchelausI received many more Greek scholars, artists, and celebrities at his court than his predecessors. His honored guests included the painter Zeuxis, the architect Callimachus, the poets Choerilus of Samos, Timotheus of Miletus, and Agathon, as well as the famous Athenian playwright Euripides. The philosopher Aristotle, who studied at the Platonic Academy of Athens and established the Aristotelian school of thought, moved to Macedonia, and is said to have tutored the young Alexander the Great, as well as serving as an esteemed diplomat for PhilipII. Among Alexander&#x27;s retinue of artists, writers, and philosophers was Pyrrho of Elis, founder of Pyrrhonism, the school of philosophical skepticism. During the Antigonid period, Antigonos Gonatas fostered cordial relationships with Menedemos of Eretria, founder of the Eretrian school of philosophy, and Zenon, the founder of Stoicism.

In terms of early Greek historiography and later Roman historiography, Felix Jacoby identified thirteen possible ancient historians who wrote about Macedonia in his &quot;Fragmente der griechischen Historiker&quot;. Aside from accounts in Herodotus and Thucydides, the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary, whereas other works are completely lost, such as the history of an Illyrian war fought by Perdiccas III written by Antipater. The Macedonian historians Marsyas of Pella and Marsyas of Philippi wrote histories of Macedonia, the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy I Soter authored a history about Alexander, and Hieronymus of Cardia wrote a history about Alexander&#x27;s royal successors. Following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian military officer Nearchus wrote a work of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus river to the Persian Gulf. The Macedonian historian Craterus published a compilation of decrees made by the popular assembly of the Athenian democracy, ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle. Philip V of Macedon had manuscripts of the history of PhilipII written by Theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.

===Sports and leisure===
When Alexander I of Macedon petitioned to compete in the foot race of the ancient Olympic Games, the event organizers at first denied his request, explaining that only Greeks were allowed to compete. However, AlexanderI produced proof of an Argead royal genealogy showing ancient Argive Temenid lineage, a move that ultimately convinced the Olympic &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; authorities of his Greek descent and ability to compete. By the end of the 5thcenturyBC, the Macedonian king ArchelausI was crowned with the olive wreath at both Olympia and Delphi (in the Pythian Games) for winning chariot racing contests. PhilipII allegedly heard of the Olympic victory of his horse (in either an individual horse race or chariot race) on the same day his son Alexander the Great was born, on either 19 or 20July 356BC. Non-royal Macedonians also competed in and won various Olympic contests by the 4th century BC. In addition to literary contests, Alexander the Great staged competitions for music and athletics across his empire.

===Dining and cuisine===

Ancient Macedonia produced only a few fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, although there was no notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced &quot;mattye&quot; to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.

The &quot;symposium&quot; in the Macedonian and wider Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class, an occasion for feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The &quot;hetairoi&quot;, leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat as well as for sport.

===Ethnic identity===


Ancient authors and modern scholars alike disagree about the precise ethnic identity of the ancient Macedonians. The predominant viewpoint supports that the Macedonians were &quot;truly Greeks&quot; who had just retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern parts of Greece. Ernst Badian notes however that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived at the time of the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and the other Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league&#x27;s elected &quot;hegemon&quot; PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself); N. G. L. Hammond asserts that ancient views differentiating Macedonia&#x27;s ethnic identity from the rest of the Greek-speaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems: the democratic system of the city-states (e.g. Athens) versus the monarchy (Macedonia). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.

Anson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Simon Hornblower argues on the Greek identity of the Macedonians, taking into consideration their origin, language, cults and customs related to ancient Greek traditions. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).

==Technology and engineering==
===Architecture===

Macedonian architecture, although utilizing a mixture of different forms and styles from the rest of Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture. Among the classical orders, Macedonian architects favored the Ionic order, especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a palace at the site of the capital Pella, the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigai, and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos. At Vergina, the ruins of three large banquet halls with marble-tiled floors (covered in the debris of roof tiles) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6 m (54.8 x 57.7 ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental triangular roof trusses, if dated before the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults. The palaces of both Vergina and Demetrias had walls made of sundried bricks, while the latter palace had four corner towers around a central courtyard in the manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor.

Macedonian rulers also sponsored works of architecture outside of Macedonia proper. For instance, following his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), PhilipII raised a round memorial building at Olympia known as the Philippeion, decorated inside with statues depicting him, his parents Amyntas III of Macedon and Eurydice I of Macedon, his wife Olympias, and his son Alexander the Great.
The ruins of roughly twenty Greek theatres survive in the present-day regions of Macedonia and Thrace in Greece: sixteen open-air theatres, three odea, and a possible theatre in Veria undergoing excavation.

===Military technology and engineering===
By the Hellenistic period, it became common for Greek states to finance the development and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines, naval ships, and standardized designs for arms and armor. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to siege artillery such as bolt-shooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world at the end of the 4thcenturyBC. The siege of Salamis, Cyprus, in 306BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia. The siege tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC) and defended by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.

During the siege of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went back and forth from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.

===Other innovations===

Although perhaps not as prolific as other areas of Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mold-pressed glass first appeared in Macedonia in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and Rhodes and date to the second half of the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria, Rhodes, and Pergamon.

==Currency, finances, and resources==

The minting of silver coinage began during the reign of AlexanderI as a means to pay for royal expenditures. ArchelausI increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce. The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of PhilipII and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Attalid kingdom exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins. The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth. The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation.

State revenues were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on imports and exports at harbors. Some mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants to members of the nobility such as the &quot;hetairoi&quot; and &quot;philoi&quot;. Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports existed from at least the reign of AmyntasIII, and Callistratus of Aphidnae (d.c.350BC) aided PerdiccasIII in doubling the kingdom&#x27;s annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.

After the defeat of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate&#x27;s decree.

==Legacy==

The reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great witnessed the demise of Classical Greece and the birth of Hellenistic civilization, following the spread of Greek culture to the Near East during and after Alexander&#x27;s conquests. Macedonians then migrated to Egypt and parts of Asia, but the intensive colonization of foreign lands sapped the available manpower in Macedonia proper, weakening the kingdom in its fight with other Hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by the Romans. However, the diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander&#x27;s conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a &quot;precondition&quot; for the later Roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the Byzantine Empire, according to Errington.
The ethnic Macedonian rulers of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid successor states accepted men from all over the Greek world as their &quot;hetairoi&quot; companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship, the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.

The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a living god. Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon—the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra—at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander&#x27;s reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.

<text>Orientalium Ecclesiarum, subtitled the Decree on the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] is one of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s 16 magisterial documents. &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the Eastern Churches,&quot; and is taken from the first line of the decree. 

One of the shortest conciliar documents, it was approved on 20 November 1964 by a vote of 2,054 in favour and 64 opposed, and was confirmed by a vote of 2,110 to 39 on 21 November 1964, the day when it was promulgated by Pope Paul VI. 

The decree recognizes the right of Eastern Catholics to keep their own distinct liturgical practices while remaining in full communion with the Holy See. The decree exhorts Eastern Catholics to &quot;take steps to return to their ancestral traditions.&quot; This aspect of the decree was directed against Latinisation.

The document specifies some of the autonomous powers of the Eastern Churches. In particular, the Patriarch (or where applicable, major archbishop) and synod have the power to establish eparchies, to nominate bishops within their patriarchate, to legislate the rights and obligations of the minor orders (including subdiaconate), and to determine the date for celebrating Easter within their rite. It furthermore recognized the ancient practice in the East regarding the sacrament of confirmation (Chrismation), stating that all Eastern priests have the power to administer this sacrament using chrism blessed by a bishop. One of the implications of this is the further practice of infant communion was formally recognized.

==Contents==
There are 30 articles, divided into 6 chapters, plus a preamble and a conclusion.

The Preamble affirms the Church&#x27;s respect for Eastern Catholics (§1):

The Catholic Church holds in high esteem the institutions, liturgical rites, ecclesiastical traditions and the established standards of the Christian life of the Eastern Churches, for in them, distinguished as they are for their venerable antiquity, there remains conspicuous the tradition that has been handed down from the Apostles through the Fathers and that forms part of the divinely revealed and undivided heritage of the universal Church. 

The Individual Churches or Rites
- “Each individual Church or Rite should retain its traditions whole and entire” but “should adapt its way of life to the different needs of time and place” (§2)

- The individual Churches, whether Eastern or Western, are of equal dignity (§3)

- Every Catholic must retain his own rite, cherish and protect it (§4)

Preservation of the Spiritual Heritage of the Eastern Churches

- “The Churches of the East, as much as those of the West, have a full right and are in duty bound to rule themselves, each in accordance with its own established disciplines” (§5)

- All Eastern Churches may preserve their liturgical traditions and way of life, and if history has imposed changes on them, “they should take steps to return to their ancestral traditions” (§6)

Eastern Rite Patriarchs

- “The patriarchate, as an institution, has existed in the Church from the earliest times” (§7)

- All patriarchs are of equal dignity (§8)

- The rights and privileges of patriarchs “should be re-established in accordance with the ancient tradition of each of the Churches and the decrees of the ecumenical councils” (§9)

- “The patriarchs with their synods are the highest authority for all business of the patriarchate”, subject to the Pope&#x27;s right to intervene in individual cases (§9)

- New patriarchates should be established where there is a need (§11)

The discipline of the Sacraments (§12-18) is concerned with the regulation of the sacraments. An important issue is the right of priests of one rite to administer sacraments to faithful of another rite. It also recommends that the diaconate be restored as a permanent ministry.

Divine Worship (§19-23) deals with the regulation of such liturgical matters as feast days (including Easter), the Divine Office and the languages to be used in the liturgy. 

Relations with the Brethren of the Separated Churches

- Eastern Catholics have a special duty to promote Christian unity, especially with the Eastern Orthodox (§24)

- If a member of an Eastern Orthodox Church becomes Catholic, “no more should be required of him than what a bare profession of the Catholic faith demands”. An Orthodox priest or bishop is permitted to act as a priest or bishop upon joining the Catholic Church (§25)

- A member of an Eastern Orthodox Church, if he asks of his own accord, may receive the sacraments of Penance, Eucharist and Anointing of the sick from an Eastern Catholic priest. And an Eastern Catholic, if no Catholic priest is available, may receive these sacraments from an Eastern Orthodox priest. Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox may take part in each other&#x27;s liturgical services (§26-29)

The Conclusion (§30) asks all Christians, Eastern and Western, to pray for the reunion of Christians, and also to pray for those Christians suffering for their faith in Christ (a reference to Christians in communist countries).

<doc id="42020" wikidata="Q1194370" url="?curid=42020" title="Synthetic radioisotope">
<text>A synthetic radioisotope is a radionuclide that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie were the first to produce a synthetic radioisotope in the 20th century. Examples include technetium-99 and promethium-146. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Some must be manufactured in particle accelerators. 

==Production==
Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent nuclear reactor fuel rods, which contain various fission products. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 terabecquerels (78 metric tons) of technetium were produced in nuclear reactors; as such, anthropogenic technetium is far more abundant than technetium from natural radioactivity.

Some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed. Other isotopes are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, technetium-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.

Many isotopes, including radiopharmaceuticals, are produced in cyclotrons. For example, the synthetic fluorine-18 and oxygen-15 are widely used in positron emission tomography.

==Uses==
Most synthetic radioisotopes have a short half-life. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.

===Nuclear medicine===
The field of nuclear medicine covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.

====Diagnosis====
Radioactive tracer compounds, radiopharmaceuticals, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a gamma ray which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a gamma camera to map the concentrations. Gamma cameras and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.

The metastable nuclear isomer technetium-99m is a gamma-ray emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a technetium-99m generator. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope molybdenum-99 was in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of uranium-235.

====Treatment====
Several radioisotopes and compounds are used for medical treatment, usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, iodine-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the thyroid gland.

===Industrial radiation sources===

Alpha particle, beta particle, and gamma ray radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the petroleum industry, industrial radiography, homeland security, process control, food irradiation and underground detection.

<text>A trace radioisotope is a radioisotope that occurs naturally in trace amounts (i.e. extremely small). Generally speaking, trace radioisotopes have half-lives that are short in comparison with the age of the Earth, since primordial nuclides tend to occur in larger than trace amounts. Trace radioisotopes are therefore present only because they are continually produced on Earth by natural processes. Natural processes which produce trace radioisotopes include cosmic ray bombardment of stable nuclides, ordinary alpha and beta decay of the long-lived heavy nuclides, thorium-232, uranium-238, and uranium-235, spontaneous fission of uranium-238, and nuclear transmutation reactions induced by natural radioactivity, such as the production of plutonium-239 and uranium-236 from neutron capture by natural uranium.

<text>Ad gentes (&quot;To the Nations&quot;) is the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s decree on missionary activity that reaffirmed the need for missions and salvation in Christ. The document establishes evangelization as one of the fundamental missions of the Catholic Church and reaffirms the tie between evangelization and charity for the poor. &quot;Ad gentes&quot; also calls for the formation of strong Christian communities as well as strong relations with other Christians. Finally, it lays out guidelines for the training and actions of the missionaries.

<doc id="42029" wikidata="Q127318" url="?curid=42029" title="George III">
<text>George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 173829 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until his death in 1820. The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.

George was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King George II, as the first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1751, Prince George became heir apparent and Prince of Wales. He succeeded to the throne on George II&#x27;s death in 1760. The following year, he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with whom he had 15 children. George III&#x27;s life and reign were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, Britain lost 13 of its North American colonies in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In 1807, the transatlantic slave trade was banned from the British Empire.

In the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of the mental illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with either bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the and longest-reigning male monarch in British history.

==Early life==
George was born in Norfolk House in St James&#x27;s Square, London, on 4 June 1738. He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford. One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).

George grew into a healthy, reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Edward (later Duke of York and Albany) were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically.

Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At the age of 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison&#x27;s play &quot;Cato&quot; and said in the new prologue: &quot;What, tho&#x27; a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in &quot;England&quot; born, in England bred.&quot; Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear &quot;to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated&quot;.

King George II disliked Prince Frederick and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751, Frederick died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and his son George became heir apparent to the throne and inherited his father&#x27;s title of Duke of Edinburgh. The King now took more interest in his grandson and created him Prince of Wales three weeks later.
In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James&#x27;s Palace, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, Lord Bute, who later served as prime minister. George&#x27;s mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.

In 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. &quot;I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.&quot; Nevertheless, George and his mother resisted attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Sophie Caroline instead married Frederick, Margrave of Bayreuth.

The following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather George II died suddenly on 25 October 1760, at age 76. The search for a suitable wife intensified: after giving consideration to a number of Protestant German princesses, George&#x27;s mother sent Colonel David Graeme with, on her son&#x27;s behalf, an offer of marriage to Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Charlotte accepted. While a royal household and staff were assembled for Charlotte in London, Lord Harcourt, the royal Master of the Horse, escorted her from Strelitz to London. Charlotte arrived in the afternoon of 8 September 1761 and the marriage ceremony was conducted that same evening in the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace. George and Charlotte&#x27;s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey a fortnight later on 22 September. George never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a happy marriage until his mental illness struck.

The King and Queen had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat. His other residences were Kew Palace and Windsor Castle. St James&#x27;s Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset, which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.

==Early reign==
=== Early regnal years ===
George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: &quot;Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.&quot; He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain. During George III&#x27;s lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament. Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years&#x27; War. George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.

On his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims &quot;rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition&quot;. Debts amounting to over £3 million over the course of George&#x27;s reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Lady at the Virginals&quot; and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King&#x27;s Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.

=== Legislation and politics ===

In May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was replaced with one led by Lord Bute, a Scottish Tory. Bute&#x27;s opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King&#x27;s mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English. John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published &quot;The North Briton&quot;, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons and found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power. Britain received enormous concessions, including West Florida. Britain restored to France lucrative slave-sugar islands in the West Indies, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. The treaty also ended French control over nearly all of New France; Canada was ceded to Britain in its entirety, while Louisiana was divided in two, with the eastern half (from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi River) ceded to Britain and the western half, plus the city of New Orleans, ceded to Spain.

Later that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies and created an Indian reserve. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida), and protect the British fur trade with the Indians. The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority. This discontent ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions.

The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;. In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax.

Meanwhile, George had become exasperated at Grenville&#x27;s attempts to reduce the King&#x27;s prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of prime minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.
Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville&#x27;s unpopular Stamp Act. Rockingham&#x27;s government was weak, and he was replaced as prime minister in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, took over the government. Grafton did not formally become prime minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. He was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton&#x27;s government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.

=== Family issues and discontent in America ===

George was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer. The following year, Henry married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession.

George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the royal family from legally marrying without the consent of the sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George&#x27;s own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterwards, another of George&#x27;s brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George&#x27;s opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.

Lord North&#x27;s government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George&#x27;s words was &quot;one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]&quot;. In 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea was thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was &quot;certainly criminal&quot;.

With the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George&#x27;s &quot;hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet&#x27;s opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.&quot; Though both the Americans and older British historians characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.

==American War of Independence==

The American War of Independence was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution. In the 1760s, a series of acts by Parliament was met with resistance in Britain&#x27;s Thirteen Colonies in America. In particular they rejected new taxes levied by Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. The colonies had previously enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs and viewed Parliament&#x27;s acts as a denial of their rights as Englishmen. Armed conflict began between British regulars and colonial militiamen at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The Second Continental Congress sent petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament, but the King and Parliament ignored them. George declared the American leaders to be traitors and a year of fighting ensued. Thomas Paine&#x27;s book &quot;Common Sense&quot; referred to George III as &quot;the Royal Brute of Great Britain&quot;.

The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing twenty-seven grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George&#x27;s other offences, the declaration charged, &quot;He has abdicated Government here ... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.&quot; The gilded equestrian statue of the King in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776 but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne following the battles of Saratoga.

Prime Minister Lord North was not an ideal war leader, but George III managed to give Parliament a sense of purpose to fight, and North was able to keep his cabinet together. North&#x27;s cabinet ministers the Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, proved to lack leadership skills suited for their positions.

George III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the rebels, despite the opinions of his own ministers. In the words of British historian George Otto Trevelyan, the King was determined &quot;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.&quot; He wanted to &quot;keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse&quot;. Later historians defend George by saying that, in the context of the times, no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporaneous monarchs in Europe. After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and political opponents, though vocal, remained a small minority.

With the setbacks in America, Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in North&#x27;s administration, but Chatham refused; he died later in the same year. North was allied to the &quot;King&#x27;s Friends&quot; in Parliament and believed that George III had the right to exercise powers. In early 1778, Louis XVI of France (Britain&#x27;s chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States. The French fleet outran the British naval blockade of the Mediterranean and sailed to America. The conflict now affected America, Europe, and India. Charles III of Spain had misgivings because of his own colonies but decided to side with France in the war in limited fashion in 1779. One faction of the Dutch Republic aided the Americans, whereas another aided Britain, whose allies included Loyalists and German auxiliaries. Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III&#x27;s insistence.

During the summer of 1779, a combined French-Spanish naval fleet threatened to invade England and transport 31,000 French troops across the English Channel. George III said that Britain was confronted by the &quot;most serious crisis the nation ever knew&quot;. In August, 66 warships entered the English channel, but sickness, hunger, and adverse winds forced the French-Spanish armada to withdraw, ending the invasion threat.

In late 1779, George III advocated sending more British warships and troops across the Atlantic to the West Indies. He boldly said: &quot;We must risk something, otherwise we will only vegetate in this war. I own I wish either with spirit to get through it, or with a crash be ruined.&quot; In January 1780, 7,000 British troops under General Sir John Vaughan were transported to the West Indies. Nonetheless, opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon riots.

As late as the siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender at the siege of Yorktown reached London; North&#x27;s parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. George drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered. He finally accepted the defeat in America and authorized peace negotiations. Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaties of Paris signed in 1782 and 1783. In early 1783, George III privately conceded &quot;America is lost!&quot; He reflected that the Northern colonies had developed into Britain&#x27;s &quot;successful rivals&quot; in commercial trade and fishing. Up to 70,000 Loyalists fled to Canada (where they became known as the United Empire Loyalists), the Caribbean, or England.

John Adams was appointed American minister to London in 1785, by which time George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, &quot;I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.&quot;

== Mid reign ==
===Government ===

With the collapse of Lord North&#x27;s ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became prime minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively.

The King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character: he thought Fox unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales. George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners. Although George actually favoured greater control over the company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox. Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and William Pitt the Younger was appointed prime minister, with Temple as his secretary of state. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a &quot;high crime&quot; and Temple was forced to resign. Temple&#x27;s departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.
Pitt&#x27;s appointment was a great victory for George. It proved that the King could appoint prime ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt&#x27;s ministry, George supported many of Pitt&#x27;s political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt&#x27;s supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt&#x27;s ministry, George was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy, in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George&#x27;s principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.

===Illness===

By this time, George&#x27;s health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness characterised by acute mania. Until the mid-20th century, the King&#x27;s illness was generally considered to be psychological. In 1966, a study by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter suggested that the illness was physiological, caused by the liver disorder porphyria. Although meeting with some contemporary opposition, the view subsequently gained widespread scholarly acceptance. A study of samples of George&#x27;s hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a cause of metabolic blood disorders and thus a possible trigger for porphyria. The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The theory was also established in the public mind through influential dramatisations, such as Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot;, and in Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s subsequent film. From 2010, this view has been increasingly challenged, and Macalpine and Hunter&#x27;s study criticised. Recent scholarship discounts the porphyria theory and contends that George&#x27;s illness was psychiatric, most probably bipolar disorder.

George may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, and a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate and in August visited the Bishop of Worcester at Hartlebury Castle and Viscount Mount Edgcumbe at Cotehele, Cornwall, with the Queen, and their daughters the Princess Royal and Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth. It was the furthest he had ever been from London, but his condition worsened. In November of that year, he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and his voice to become hoarse. George would frequently repeat himself and write sentences with over 400 words at a time, and his vocabulary became &quot;more complex, creative and colourful&quot;, possible symptoms of bipolar disorder. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he had shaken hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards; George&#x27;s doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out &quot;evil humours&quot;.

In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King&#x27;s incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for the Prince of Wales to act as regent, Fox suggested, to Pitt&#x27;s consternation, that it was the Prince&#x27;s absolute right to act on his ill father&#x27;s behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent&#x27;s authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George recovered.

== Later reign ==
=== War in Europe ===
After George&#x27;s recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield&#x27;s failed attempt to shoot George in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.

The French Revolution of 1789, in which the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in response to the crisis, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Pitt prosecuted British radicals for treason in 1794, and in October 1795, crowds attacked George&#x27;s carriage on his way to opening Parliament, demanding an end to the war and lower bread prices. In response, Parliament passed the Treason and Seditious Meetings Acts a month later. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.

A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. George used the opportunity to abandon the title &quot;king of France&quot;, which English and British sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. It was suggested that George adopt the title &quot;Emperor of the British Isles&quot;, but he refused. As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, George had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.

George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an &quot;experiment&quot;. The war resumed in 1803, but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George&#x27;s review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. &quot;The Times&quot; said: &quot;The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression.&quot; A courtier wrote on 13 November that &quot;The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour&#x27;s warning.&quot; George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, &quot;We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion ... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them.&quot; After Admiral Lord Nelson&#x27;s famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.
In 1804, George&#x27;s recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry. Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt&#x27;s health, and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Grenville became prime minister, and his &quot;Ministry of All the Talents&quot; included Fox. Grenville pushed through the Slave Trade Act 1807, which passed both houses of Parliament with large majorities. George was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox&#x27;s death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the armed forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland, as the nominal prime minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little real significance.

===Final years===

In late 1810, at the height of his popularity, King George, already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism, suffered a relapse into his mental disorder and became dangerously ill. In his view, the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, Princess Amelia. The princess&#x27;s nurse reported that &quot;the scenes of distress and crying every day... were melancholy beyond description.&quot; George accepted the need for the Regency Act 1811, and the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as regent for the remainder of the King&#x27;s life. Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811, by the end of the year, George III had become permanently insane, and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.

Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in 1812 and was replaced by Lord Liverpool. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent Congress of Vienna led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was elevated from an electorate to a kingdom. Meanwhile, George&#x27;s health deteriorated. He developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk.

He died of pneumonia at Windsor Castle at 8:38 pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. His favourite son, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was with him. George III lay in state for two days, and his funeral and interment took place on 16 February in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

==Slavery==

Over the course of George&#x27;s reign, a coalition of abolitionists and Atlantic slave uprisings caused the British public to spurn slavery. According to the historian Andrew Roberts, &quot;George never bought or sold a slave in his life. He never invested in any of the companies that did such a thing. He signed legislation to abolish slavery.&quot; George wrote a document in the 1750s &quot;denouncing all of the arguments for slavery, and calling them an execration and ridiculous and &#x27;absurd, but the King and his son, the Duke of Clarence, supported the efforts of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants to delay the abolition of the British slave trade for almost 20 years. William Pitt the Younger conversely wished to see slavery abolished but, because the cabinet was divided and the King was in the pro-slavery camp, Pitt decided to refrain from making abolition official government policy. Instead, he worked toward abolition in an individual capacity.

On 7 November 1775, during the American War of Independence, John Murray, Lord Dunmore, issued a proclamation that offered freedom to the slaves of rebel masters if they enlisted to put down the colonial rebellion. Dunmore was the last Royal Governor of Virginia, appointed by King George III in July 1771. Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation inspired slaves to escape from captivity and fight for the British. On 30 June 1779, George III&#x27;s Commanding General Henry Clinton broadened Dunmore&#x27;s proclamation with his Philipsburg Proclamation. For all colonial slaves who fled their rebel masters, Clinton forbade their recapture and resale, giving them protection by the British military. Approximately 20,000 freed slaves joined the British, fighting for George III. In 1783, given British certificates of freedom, 3,000 former slaves, including their families, settled in Nova Scotia.

Between 1791 and 1800, almost 400,000 Africans were shipped to the Americas by 1,340 slaving voyages mounted from British ports. On 25 March 1807, George III signed into law &quot;An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade&quot;, under which the transatlantic slave trade was banned in the British Empire.

==Legacy==
George was succeeded by two of his sons, George IV and William IV in turn, who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to Victoria, the only legitimate child of his fourth son Prince Edward.

George III lived for 81 years and 239 days, and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors and reigned longer.
George III was dubbed &quot;Farmer George&quot; by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to portray him as a man of the people, contrasting his homely thrift with his son&#x27;s grandiosity. Under George III, the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution. George&#x27;s collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now owned by King&#x27;s College London but housed in the Science Museum, London, to which it has been on long-term loan since 1927. He had the King&#x27;s Observatory built in Richmond-upon-Thames for his own observations of the 1769 transit of Venus. When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, he at first named it &quot;Georgium Sidus&quot; (George&#x27;s Star) after the King, who later funded the construction and maintenance of Herschel&#x27;s 1785 40-foot telescope, which at the time was the biggest ever built.

George III hoped that &quot;the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve&quot; but, in the popular mind, George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. The grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as &quot;repeated injuries and usurpations&quot; that he had committed to establish an &quot;absolute Tyranny&quot; over the colonies. The declaration&#x27;s wording has contributed to the American public&#x27;s perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III&#x27;s life fall into two camps: one demonstrating &quot;attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power&quot;, while the other &quot;derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition&quot;.

Building on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III&#x27;s life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was &quot;much maligned&quot;, started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: &quot;Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.&quot; In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III, the monarchy continued to lose its political power and grew as the embodiment of national morality.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
* 4 June 1738 – 31 March 1751: &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; Prince George
* 31 March 1751 – 20 April 1751: &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; The Duke of Edinburgh
* 20 April 1751 – 25 October 1760: &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; The Prince of Wales
* 25 October 1760 – 29 January 1820: &quot;His Majesty&quot; The King

In Great Britain, George III used the official style &quot;George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and so forth&quot;. In 1801, when Great Britain united with Ireland, he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III&#x27;s claim to the French throne in the medieval period. His style became &quot;George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.&quot;

In Germany, he was &quot;Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; (&quot;Herzog von Braunschweig und Lüneburg, Erzschatzmeister und Kurfürst des Heiligen Römischen Reiches&quot;) until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him &quot;King of Hanover&quot; in 1814.

===Honours===
* : Royal Knight of the Garter, &quot;22 June 1749&quot;
* Ireland: Founder of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick, &quot;5 February 1783&quot;

===Arms===
Before his succession, George was granted the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father&#x27;s death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the arms of the heir, only on the Sovereign&#x27;s.

From his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Saxony), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).

Following the Acts of Union 1800, the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet. In 1816, after the Electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.

<doc id="42030" wikidata="Q898739" url="?curid=42030" title="Laudanum">
<text>Laudanum is a tincture of opium containing approximately 10% powdered opium by weight (the equivalent of 1% morphine). Laudanum is prepared by dissolving extracts from the opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;) in alcohol (ethanol).

Reddish-brown in color and extremely bitter, laudanum contains several opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of conditions, but its principal use was as a pain medication and cough suppressant. Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Laudanum has since been recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled as such throughout most of the world. The United States Controlled Substances Act, for example, lists it on Schedule II, the second strictest category.

Laudanum is known as a &quot;whole opium&quot; preparation since it historically contained all the alkaloids found in the opium poppy, which are extracted from the dried latex of ripe seed pods (&quot;Papaver somniferum L., succus siccus&quot;). However, the modern drug is often processed to remove all or most of the noscapine (also called &quot;narcotine&quot;) present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or antipropulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO).

Laudanum remains available by prescription in the United States (under the generic name &quot;opium tincture&quot;) and in the European Union and United Kingdom (under the trade name Dropizol), although the drug&#x27;s therapeutic indication is generally limited to controlling diarrhea when other medications have failed.

The terms &quot;laudanum&quot; and &quot;tincture of opium&quot; are generally interchangeable, but in contemporary medical practice, the latter is used almost exclusively.

== History ==
===Paracelsus&#x27;s laudanum===
Paracelsus, a 16th-century Swiss alchemist, experimented with various opium concoctions, and recommended opium for reducing pain. One of his preparations, a pill which he extolled as his &quot;archanum&quot; or &quot;laudanum&quot;, may have contained opium. Paracelsus&#x27;s laudanum was strikingly different from the standard laudanum of the 17th century and beyond, containing crushed pearls, musk, amber, and other substances.

=== British laudanum ===
One researcher has documented that &quot;Laudanum, as listed in the &quot;London Pharmacopoeia&quot; (1618), was a pill made from opium, saffron, castor, ambergris, musk and nutmeg&quot;.

=== Sydenham&#x27;s laudanum ===
In the 1660s English physician Thomas Sydenham (1624–1689) popularized a proprietary opium tincture that he also named laudanum, although it differed substantially from the laudanum of Paracelsus. In 1676 Sydenham published a seminal work, &quot;Medical Observations Concerning the History and Cure of Acute Diseases&quot;, in which he promoted his brand of opium tincture, and advocated its use for a range of medical conditions.

=== 18th century ===
By the 18th century, the medicinal properties of opium and laudanum were well known, and the term &quot;laudanum&quot; came to refer to any combination of opium and alcohol.

In the 18th century several physicians published works about it, including John Jones, who wrote &quot;The Mysteries of Opium Revealed&quot; (1700), which was described by one commentator as &quot;extraordinary and perfectly unintelligible&quot;. The Scottish physician John Brown, creator of the Brunonian system of medicine, recommended opium for what he termed asthenic conditions, but his system was discredited by the time of his death. The most influential work was by George Young, who published a comprehensive medical text entitled &quot;Treatise on Opium (1753).&quot; Young, an Edinburgh surgeon and physician, wrote this to counter an essay on opium by his contemporary Charles Alston, professor of botany and materia medica at Edinburgh who had recommended the use of opium for a wide variety of conditions. Young countered this by emphasising the risks &quot;&#x27;...that I may prevent such mischief as I can, I here give it as my sincere opinion... that opium is a poison by which great numbers are daily destroyed.&quot;&#x27; Young gives a comprehensive account of the indications for the drug including its complications. He is critical about writers whose knowledge of the drug is based on chemical or animal experiments rather than clinical practice. The treatise is a detailed, balanced and valuable guide to prevailing knowledge and practice. As it gained popularity, opium, and after 1820, morphine, was mixed with a wide variety of agents, drugs and chemicals including mercury, hashish, cayenne pepper, ether, chloroform, belladonna, whiskey, wine and brandy.&quot;

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, patients undergoing surgery were often administered laudanum and alcohol, and had their hands restrained and bodies held down while the operation was performed.

=== 19th century ===
By the 19th century, laudanum was used in many patent medicines to &quot;relieve pain ... to produce sleep ... to allay irritation ... to check excessive secretions ... to support the system ... [and] as a soporific&quot;. The limited pharmacopoeia of the day meant that opium derivatives were among the most effective of available treatments, so laudanum was widely prescribed for ailments from colds to meningitis to cardiac diseases, in both adults and children. Laudanum was used during the yellow fever epidemic.

Innumerable Victorian women were prescribed the drug for relief of menstrual cramps and vague aches. Nurses also spoon-fed laudanum to infants. The Romantic and Victorian eras were marked by the widespread use of laudanum in Europe and the United States. Mary Lincoln, for example, the wife of the US president Abraham Lincoln, was a laudanum addict, as was the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was famously interrupted in the middle of an opium-induced writing session of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by &quot;a person on business from Porlock&quot;. Initially a working-class drug, laudanum was cheaper than a bottle of gin or wine, because it was treated as a medication for legal purposes and not taxed as an alcoholic beverage.

As one researcher has noted: &quot;To understand the popularity of a medicine that easedeven if only temporarilycoughing, diarrhoea and pain, one only has to consider the living conditions at the time&quot;. In the 1850s, &quot;cholera and dysentery regularly ripped through communities, its victims often dying from debilitating diarrhoea&quot;, and dropsy, consumption, ague and rheumatism were all too common.

An 1869 article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; describes a farmer growing and harvesting poppy in Indian Springs, Georgia, and subsequently selling the raw material to a local pharmacist who prepared laudanum.

=== 20th century ===
Laudanum was used in home remedies and prescriptions, as well as a single medication. For example, a 1901 medical book published for home health use gave the following two &quot;Simple Remedy Formulas&quot; for &quot;dysenterry&quot;: (1) Thin boiled starch, 2 ounces; Laudanum, 20 drops; &quot;Use as an injection [meaning as an enema] every six to twelve hours&quot;; (2) Tincture rhubarb, 1 ounce; Laudanum 4 drachms; &quot;Dose: One teaspoonful every three hours.&quot; In a section entitled &quot;Professional Prescriptions&quot; is a formula for &quot;diarrhoea (acute)&quot;: Tincture opium, deodorized, 15 drops; Subnitrate of bismuth, 2 drachms; Simple syrup, ounce; Chalk mixture, 1 ounces, &quot;A teaspoonful every two or three hours to a child one year old.&quot; &quot;Diarrhoea (chronic)&quot;: Aqueous extract of ergot, 20 grains; Extract of nux vomica, 5 grains; Extract of Opium, 10 grains, &quot;Make 20 pills. Take one pill every three or four hours.&quot;

The early 20th century brought increased regulation of all manner of narcotics, including laudanum, as the addictive properties of opium became more widely understood, and &quot;patent medicines came under fire, largely because of their mysterious compositions&quot;. In the US, the Food and Drug Act of 1906 required that certain specified drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated. In 1906 in Britain and in 1908 in Canada &quot;laws requiring disclosure of ingredients and limitation of narcotic content were instituted&quot;.

The Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 restricted the manufacture and distribution of opiates, including laudanum, and coca derivatives in the US. This was followed by France&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 1916, and Britain&#x27;s Dangerous Drugs Act in 1920.

Laudanum was supplied to druggists and physicians in regular and concentrated versions. For example, in 1915, Frank S. Betz Co., a medical supply company in Hammond, Indiana, advertised Tincture of Opium, U.S.P., for $2.90 per lb., Tincture of Opium Camphorated, U.S.P, for 85 cents per lb., and Tincture of Opium Deodorized, for $2.85 per lb. Four versions of opium as a fluid extract were also offered: (1) Opium, Concentrated (assayed) &quot;For making Tincture Opii (Laudanum) U.S.P. Four times the strength of the regular U.S.P.&quot; tincture, for $9.35 per pint; (2) Opium, Camphorated Conc. &quot;1 oz. making 8 ozs. Tr. Opii Camphorated U.S.P (Paregoric)&quot; for $2.00 per pint; (3) Opium, Concentrated (Deodorized and Denarcotized) &quot;Four times the strength of tincture, Used when Tinct. Opii U.S.P. is contraindicated&quot; for $9.50 per pint, and (4) Opium (Aqueous), U.S.P., 1890, &quot;Tr. (assayed) Papaver Somniferum&quot; for $2.25 per pint.

In 1929–30, Parke, Davis &amp; Co., a major US drug manufacturer based in Detroit, Michigan, sold &quot;Opium, U.S.P. (Laudanum)&quot;, as Tincture No. 23, for $10.80 per pint (16 fluid ounces), and &quot;Opium Camphorated, U.S.P. (Paregoric)&quot;, as Tincture No. 20, for $2.20 per pint. Concentrated versions were available. &quot;Opium Camphorated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 338&quot; was &quot;exactly 8 &quot;times the strength of Tincture Opium Camphorated (Paregoric)&quot; [italics in original], U.S.P., &quot;designed for preparing the tincture by direct dilution,&quot; and cost $7 per pint. Similarly, at a cost of $36 per pint, &quot;Opium Concentrated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 336&quot;, was &quot;four times the strength of the official tincture&quot;, and &quot;designed for the extemporaneous preparation of the tincture&quot;. The catalog also noted: &quot;For quarter-pint bottles add 80c. per pint to the price given for pints.&quot;

Toward the middle 20th century, the use of opiates was generally limited to the treatment of pain, and opium was no longer a medically accepted &#x27;cure-all&#x27;. Further, the pharmaceutical industry began synthesizing various opioids, such as propoxyphene, oxymorphone and oxycodone. These synthetic opioids, along with codeine and morphine were preferable to laudanum since a single opioid could be prescribed for different types of pain rather than the &#x27;cocktail of laudanum, which contains nearly all of the opium alkaloids. Consequently, laudanum became mostly obsolete as an analgesic, since its principal ingredient is morphine, which can be prescribed by itself to treat pain. Until now, there has been no medical consensus on which of the two (laudanum or morphine alone) is the better choice for treating pain.

In 1970, the US adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which regulated opium tincture (Laudanum) as a Schedule II substance (currently DEA #9630), placing even tighter controls on the drug.

By the late 20th century, laudanum&#x27;s use was almost exclusively confined to treating severe diarrhea.

=== 21st century ===
The current prescribing information for laudanum in the US states that opium tincture&#x27;s sole indication is as an anti-diarrheal, although the drug is occasionally prescribed off-label for treating pain and neonatal withdrawal syndrome.

== Historical varieties ==

Several historical varieties of laudanum exist, including Paracelsus&#x27; laudanum, Sydenham&#x27;s Laudanum (also known as &quot;tinctura opii crocata&quot;), benzoic laudanum (&quot;tinctura opii benzoica&quot;), and deodorized tincture of opium (the most common contemporary formulation), among others. Depending on the version, additional amounts of the substances and additional active ingredients (e.g. saffron, sugar, eugenol) are added, modifying its effects (e.g., amount of sedation, or antitussive properties).

There is probably no single reference that lists all the pharmaceutical variations of laudanum that were created and used in different countries during centuries since it was initially formulated. The reasons are that in addition to official variations described in pharmacopeias, pharmacists and drug manufacturers were free to alter such formulas. The alcohol content of Laudanum probably varied substantially; on the labels of turn-of-the-century bottles of Laudanum, alcoholic content is stated as 48%. In contrast, the current version of Laudanum contains about 18% alcohol.

The four variations of laudanum listed here were used in the United States during the late 19th century. The first, from an 1870 publication, is &quot;Best Turkey opium 1 oz., slice, and pour upon it boiling water 1 gill, and work it in a bowl or mortar until it is dissolved; then pour it into the bottle, and with alcohol of 70 percent proof pt., rinse the dish, adding the alcohol to the preparation, shaking well, and in 24 hours it will be ready for use. Dose—From 10 to 30 drops for adults, according to the strength of the patient, or severity of the pain. Thirty drops of this laudanum will be equal to one grain of opium. And this is a much better way to prepare it than putting the opium into alcohol, or any other spirits alone, for in that case much of the opium does not dissolve.&quot; The remaining three formulas are copied from an 1890 publication of the day:
# Sydenham&#x27;s Laudanum: &quot;According to the &quot;Paris Codex&quot; this is prepared as follows: opium, 2 ounces; saffron, 1 ounce; bruised cinnamon and bruised cloves, each 1 drachm; sherry wine, 1 pint. Mix and macerate for 15 days and filter. Twenty drops are equal to one grain of opium.&quot;
#Rousseau&#x27;s Laudanum: &quot;Dissolve 12 ounces white honey in 3 pounds warm water, and set it aside in a warm place. When fermentation begins add to it a solution of 4 ounces selected opium in 12 ounces water. Let the mixture stand for a month at a temperature of 86° Fahr.; then strain, filter, and evaporate to 10 ounces; finally strain and add 4 ounces proof alcohol. Seven drops of this preparation contain about 1 grain of opium.&quot;
#Tincture of Opium (Laudanum), U.S.P., attributed to the &quot;United States Pharmacoepia of 1863&quot;: &quot;Macerate 2 ounces opium, in moderately fine powder in 1 pint water for 3 days, with frequent agitation. Add 1 pint alcohol, and macerate for 3 days longer. Percolate, and displace 2 pints tincture by adding dilute alcohol in the percolator.&quot;

== Modern status ==

===United Kingdom===
Opium tincture remains in the British Pharmacopoeia, where it is referred to as Tincture of Opium, B.P., Laudanum, Thebaic Tincture or Tinctura Thebaica, and &quot;adjusted to contain 1% w/v of anhydrous morphine.&quot; It is a Class A substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971. At least one manufacturer (Macfarlan Smith) still produces opium tincture in the UK .
&quot;Gee&#x27;s Linctus&quot; is also available from most UK pharmacies, especially independent stores. This contains &quot;Opium Tincture&quot;, at 0.083 mL, per 5 mL.

===United States===
Tincture of Opium is available by prescription in the United States. It is regulated as a Schedule II drug (No. 9639) under the Controlled Substances Act.

In the United States, opium tincture is marketed and distributed by several pharmaceutical firms, each producing a single formulation of the drug, which is deodorized. Each mL contains 10 mg of anhydrous morphine (the equivalent of 100 mg of powdered opium), other opium alkaloids (except noscapine), and ethanol, 19%. It is available packaged in bottles of and .

Tincture of Opium is known as one of many &quot;unapproved drugs&quot; regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the marketing and distribution of opium tincture prevails only because opium tincture was sold prior to the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act of 1938. Its &quot;grandfathered&quot; status protects opium tincture from being required to undergo strict FDA drug reviews and subsequent approval processes. However, the FDA closely monitors the labeling of opium tincture. Bottles of opium tincture are required by the FDA to bear a bright red &quot;POISON&quot; label given the potency of the drug and the potential for overdose (see discussion about confusion with Paregoric below). Additionally, in a warning letter to a manufacturer of opium tincture in late 2009, the FDA noted that &quot;we found that your firm is manufacturing and distributing the prescription drug Opium Tincture USP (Deodorized – 10 mg/mL). Based on our information, there are no FDA-approved applications on file for this drug product.&quot;

== Pharmacology ==
Opium tincture is useful as an analgesic and antidiarrheal. Opium enhances the tone in the long segments of the longitudinal muscle and inhibits propulsive contraction of circular and longitudinal muscles. The pharmacological effects of opium tincture are due principally to its morphine content. The quantity of the papaverine and codeine alkaloids in opium tincture is too small to have any demonstrable central nervous system effect.

Most modern formulations of opium tincture do not contain the alkaloid narcotine (also known as noscapine), which has antitussive properties. Even modest doses of narcotine can induce profound nausea and vomiting. Since opium tincture is usually prescribed for its antidiarrheal and analgesic properties (rather than as an antitussive), opium tincture without narcotine is generally preferred. This &quot;de-narcotized&quot; or &quot;deodorized&quot; opium tincture is formulated using a petroleum distillate to remove the narcotine.

Oral doses of opium tincture are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Peak plasma concentrations of the morphine content are reached in about one hour, and nearly 75% of the morphine content of the opium tincture is excreted in the urine within 48 hours after oral administration.

== Medical uses ==

===Diarrhea===
Opium tincture is indicated for the treatment of severe fulminant (intense, prolific) diarrhea that does not respond to standard therapy (e.g., Imodium or Lomotil).
The usual starting dose is 0.3 mL to 0.6 mL (about six to 12 drops) in a glass of water or juice four times a day. Refractory cases (such as diarrhea resulting from the complications of HIV/AIDS) may require higher than normal dosing, for example, 1 to 2 mL every 3 hours, for a total daily dose of up to 16 mL a day. In terminal diseases, there is no ceiling dose for opium tincture; the dose is increased slowly until diarrhea is controlled.

=== Neonatal abstinence syndrome ===
Opium tincture is used to treat neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) when diluted 1:25 (one part opium tincture to 25 parts water). The recommended dose is 0.2 mL of the diluted solution under the tongue every three hours, which may be increased by 0.05 mL every three hours until no objective signs of withdrawal are observed. In no event, however, should the dose exceed 0.7 mL every three hours. The opium tincture is gradually tapered over a 3- to 5-week period, at which point the newborn should be completely free of withdrawal symptoms.

== Hazards ==
===Potency of laudanum===
Opium tincture is one of the most potent oral formulations of morphine available by prescription. Accidental or deliberate overdose is common with opium tincture given the highly concentrated nature of the solution. Overdose and death may occur with a single oral dose of between 100 and 150 mg of morphine in a healthy adult who has no tolerance to opiates. This represents the equivalent of between two and three teaspoons () of opium tincture. Suicide by laudanum was common in the mid-19th century. Prudent medical judgment necessitates toward dispensing very small quantities of opium tincture in small dropper bottles or in pre-filled syringes to reduce the risk of intentional or accidental overdose.

===Danger of confusion with paregoric===
In the United States, opium tincture contains 10 mg per mL of anhydrous morphine. By contrast, opium tincture&#x27;s weaker cousin, paregoric, also confusingly known as &quot;camphorated tincture of opium&quot;, is 1/25th the strength of opium tincture, containing only 0.4 mg of morphine per mL. A 25-fold morphine overdose may occur if opium tincture is used where paregoric is indicated. Opium tincture is almost always dosed in drops, or fractions of a mL, or less commonly, in minims, while paregoric is dosed in teaspoons or tablespoons. Thus, an order for opium tincture containing directions in teaspoons is almost certainly in error. To avoid this potentially fatal outcome, the term &quot;camphorated tincture of opium&quot; is avoided in place of paregoric since the former can easily be mistaken for opium tincture.

In 2004, the FDA issued a &quot;Patient Safety&quot; news bulletin stating that &quot;To help resolve the confusion [between opium tincture and paregoric], FDA will be working with the manufacturers of these two drugs to clarify the labeling on the containers and in the package inserts.&quot; Indeed, in 2005, labels for opium tincture began to include the concentration of morphine (10 mg/mL) in large text beneath the words &quot;Opium Tincture&quot;. The FDA has also alerted pharmacists and other medical practitioners about the dangers of confusing these drugs, and has recommended that opium tincture not be stocked as a standard item (i.e., that it should not be &quot;on the shelf&quot;), that opium tincture be dispensed in oral syringes, and that pharmacy software alert the dispenser if unusually large doses of opium tincture appear to be indicated.

Despite the FDA&#x27;s efforts over the past few years, the confusion persists, sometimes with deadly results. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends that opium tincture not be stocked at all in a pharmacy&#x27;s inventory, and that &quot;It may be time to relegate opium tincture and paregoric to the museum of outmoded opioid therapy.&quot; Despite the risk of confusion, opium tincture, like many end-stage medications, is indispensable for intractable diarrhea for terminally ill patients, such as those with AIDS and cancer.

===Misinterpretation of &quot;DTO&quot;===
The abbreviation &quot;DTO,&quot; traditionally used to refer to Deodorized Tincture of Opium, is sometimes also erroneously employed to abbreviate &quot;&quot;diluted&quot; tincture of opium.&quot; Diluted tincture of opium, also known as Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) is a 1:25 mixture of opium tincture to water prescribed to treat withdrawal symptoms in newborns whose mothers were using opioids while pregnant. The United States Pharmacopeia and FDA recommend that practitioners refrain from using DTO in prescriptions, given this potential for confusion. In cases where pharmacists have misinterpreted DTO, and given &quot;deodorized tincture of opium&quot; when &quot;diluted tincture of opium&quot; was meant, infants have received a massive 25-fold overdose of morphine, sometimes resulting in fatalities.

===Side effects===
Side effects of laudanum are generally the same as with morphine, and include euphoria, dysphoria, pruritus, sedation, constipation, reduced tidal volume, respiratory depression, as well as psychological dependence, physical dependence, miosis, and xerostomia. Overdose can result in severe respiratory depression or collapse and death. The ethanol component can also induce adverse effects at higher doses; the side effects are the same as with alcohol.
Long-term use of laudanum in nonterminal diseases is discouraged due to the possibility of drug tolerance and addiction. Long-term use can also lead to abnormal liver function tests; specifically, prolonged morphine use can increase ALT and AST blood serum levels.

===Treatment for overdose===

Life-threatening overdose of opium tincture owes to the preparation&#x27;s morphine content. Morphine produces a dose-dependent depressive effect on the respiratory system, which can lead to profound respiratory depression, hypoxia, coma and finally respiratory arrest and death. If overdose of opium tincture is suspected, rapid professional intervention is required. The primary concern is re-establishing a viable airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if the patient is unable to breathe on their own. Other supportive measures such as the use of vasopressors and oxygen may be indicated to treat cardiac and/or pulmonary failure. Cardiac arrhythmias or arrest will require advanced life-saving measures.

Intravenous naloxone or nalmefene, quick-acting opioid antagonists, are the first-line treatment to reverse respiratory depression caused by an overdose of opium tincture. Gastric lavage may be of some use in certain cases.

<doc id="42031" wikidata="Q41532" url="?curid=42031" title="Carl Jung">
<text>Carl Gustav Jung ( ; ; 26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and psychologist who founded the school of analytical psychology. He was a prolific author, illustrator, and correspondent, and a complex and controversial character, in certain ways best known through his autobiography &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections.&quot;

Jung&#x27;s work has been influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology, and religious studies. He worked as a research scientist at the Burghölzli psychiatric hospital in Zurich, under Eugen Bleuler. Jung established himself as an influential mind, developing a friendship with Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, conducting a lengthy correspondence paramount to their joint vision of human psychology. Jung is widely regarded as one of the most influential psychologists in history.

Freud saw the younger Jung not only as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his &quot;new science&quot; of psychoanalysis but as a means to legitimize his own work: Freud and other contemporary psychoanalysts were Jews facing rising antisemitism in Europe, and Jung was Christian. Freud secured Jung&#x27;s appointment as president of Freud&#x27;s newly founded International Psychoanalytical Association. Jung&#x27;s research and personal vision, however, made it difficult to follow his older colleague&#x27;s doctrine, and they parted ways. This division was painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology, as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. Scholar Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi believed that what he claims to be Jung&#x27;s antisemitic remarks may be a clue to the schism.

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual&#x27;s conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best-known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion. His belief that some alcoholics may recover if they have a &#x27;spiritual or religious experience&#x27; indirectly influenced the later founding of Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung was an artist, craftsman, builder, and prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death, and some remain unpublished.

==Biography==
===Early life===
====Childhood====
Carl Gustav Jung was born 26 July 1875 in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, as the first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842–1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848–1923). His birth was preceded by two stillbirths and that of a son named Paul, born in 1873, who survived only a few days.

Paul Jung, Carl&#x27;s father, was the youngest son of a noted German-Swiss professor of medicine at Basel, Karl Gustav Jung (1794–1864). Paul&#x27;s hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, and he did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church. Emilie Preiswerk, Carl&#x27;s mother, had also grown up in a large family whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799–1871), and his second wife. Samuel Preiswerk was an &quot;Antistes&quot;, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author, and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University.

Jung&#x27;s father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen when Jung was six months old. Tensions between father and mother had developed. Jung&#x27;s mother was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom, where she said spirits visited her at night. Though she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He said that one night, he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room, with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.

Jung&#x27;s mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took Carl to be cared for by Emilie Jung&#x27;s unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father&#x27;s residence. Emilie Jung&#x27;s continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with &quot;innate unreliability&quot;, whereas &quot;father&quot; meant for him reliability, but also powerlessness. In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the &quot;handicap I started off with&quot;. Later, these early impressions were revised: &quot;I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed.&quot; After three years living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer. In 1879, he was called to Kleinhüningen, next to Basel, where his family lived in a church parsonage. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer to contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was 9, Jung&#x27;s sister Johanna Gertrud (1884–1935) was born. Known in the family as &quot;Trudi&quot;, she became a secretary to her brother.

====Memories of childhood====
Jung was a solitary and introverted child. From childhood, he believed that, like his mother, he had two personalities—a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more suited to the 18th century. &quot;Personality Number 1&quot;, as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time. &quot;Personality Number 2&quot; was a dignified, authoritative, and influential man from the past. Though Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father&#x27;s academic approach to faith.

Some childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside it. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language. He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in Indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the &quot;tjurungas&quot; of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about. His observations about symbols, archetypes, and the collective unconscious were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.

At the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the &quot;Humanistisches Gymnasium&quot; in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him—&quot;Now you won&#x27;t have to go to school anymore&quot;. From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained home for six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy&#x27;s future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with his family&#x27;s poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He entered his father&#x27;s study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, &quot;was when I learned what a neurosis is&quot;.

====University studies and early career====

Initially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a Christian minister. His household had a strong moral sense, and several of his family were clergy. Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach it. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided to pursue psychiatry and medicine. His interest was captured—it combined the biological and spiritual, exactly what he was searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later, his father, Paul, died and left the family nearly destitute. They were helped by relatives who also contributed to Jung&#x27;s studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe&#x27;s niece.

It was during this early period when Jung was an assistant at the Anatomical Institute at Basel University, that he took an interest in palaeoanthropology and the revolutionary discoveries of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and Neanderthal fossils. These formative experiences contributed to his fascination with the evolutionary past of humanity and his belief that an ancient evolutionary layer in the psyche, represented by early fossil hominins, is still evident in the psychology of modern humans.

In 1900, Jung moved to Zurich and began working at the Burghölzli psychiatric hospital under Eugen Bleuler. Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. Jung&#x27;s dissertation, published in 1903, was titled &quot;On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena&quot;. It was based on the analysis of the supposed mediumship of Jung&#x27;s cousin Hélène Preiswerk, under the influence of Freud&#x27;s contemporary Théodore Flournoy. Jung studied with Pierre Janet in Paris in 1902 and later equated his view of the complex with Janet&#x27;s . In 1905, Jung was appointed as a permanent &#x27;senior&#x27; doctor at the hospital and became a lecturer &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the medical faculty of Zurich University. In 1904, he published with Franz Riklin their &quot;Diagnostic Association Studies&quot;, of which Freud obtained a copy. In 1909, Jung left the psychiatric hospital and began a private practice in his home in Küsnacht.

Eventually, a close friendship and strong professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. In late summer 1909, the two sailed for the U.S., where Freud was the featured lecturer at the twentieth-anniversary celebration of the founding of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Vicennial Conference on Psychology and Pedagogy, September 7–11. Jung spoke as well and received an honorary degree.

It was during this trip that Jung first began separating psychologically from Freud, his mentor, which occurred after intense communications around their individual dreams. It was during this visit that Jung was introduced to the elder philosopher and psychologist William James, known as the &quot;Father of American psychology,&quot; whose ideas Jung would incorporate into his own work. Jung connected with James around their mutual interests in mysticism, spiritualism and psychical phenomena. James wrote to a friend after the conference stating Jung &quot;left a favorable impression,&quot; while &quot;his views of Freud were mixed.&quot; James died about eleven months later.

The ideas of both Jung and James, on topics including hopelessness, self-surrender, and spiritual experiences, were influential in the development and founding of the international altruistic, self-help movement Alcoholics Anonymous on June 10, 1935, in Akron, Ohio, a quarter of a century after James&#x27; death and in Jung&#x27;s sixtieth year.

For six years, Jung and Freud cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious&quot;, which manifested the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating the other could not admit he could be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung&#x27;s intense experience a &quot;creative illness&quot; and compared it favorably to Freud&#x27;s own period of what he called neurasthenia and hysteria.

===Marriage===

In 1903, Jung married Emma Rauschenbach (1882–1955), seven years his junior and the elder daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenck. Rauschenbach was the owner, among other concerns, of IWC Schaffhausen—the International Watch Company, manufacturer of luxury time-pieces. Upon his death in 1905, his two daughters and their husbands became owners of the business. Jung&#x27;s brother-in-law—Ernst Homberger—became the principal proprietor, but the Jungs remained shareholders in a thriving business that ensured the family&#x27;s financial security for decades. Emma Jung, whose education had been limited, showed considerable ability and interest in her husband&#x27;s research and threw herself into studies and acted as his assistant at Burghölzli. She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. The marriage lasted until Emma died in 1955. They had five children:

* Agathe Niehus, born on December 28, 1904
* Gret Baumann, born on February 8, 1906
* Franz Jung-Merker, born on November 28, 1908
* Marianne Niehus, born on September 20, 1910
* Helene Hoerni, born on March 18, 1914
None of the children continued their father&#x27;s career. The daughters, Agathe and Marianne, assisted in publishing work.

During his marriage, Jung engaged in at least one extramarital relationship: his affair with his patient and, later, fellow psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein. A continuing affair with Toni Wolff is also alleged.

===Relationship with Freud===
====Meeting and collaboration====
Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung&#x27;s life. Jung became interested in psychiatry as a student by reading &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; by Richard von Krafft-Ebing. In 1900, Jung completed his degree and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler at Burghölzli Hospital. It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899). In the early 1900s psychology as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud&#x27;s new &quot;psycho-analysis&quot;. Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burghölzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich, and Jung&#x27;s research had already gained him international recognition. Jung sent Freud a copy of his &quot;Studies in Word Association&quot; in 1906. The same year, he published &quot;Diagnostic Association Studies&quot;, a copy of which he later sent to Freudwho had already purchased a copy. Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time in Vienna on 3 March 1907. Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable and unceasing for 13 hours. Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This began an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years. In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded &quot;Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research&quot;.

In 1909, Jung traveled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi to the United States; in September, they took part in a conference at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. The conference at Clark University was planned by the psychologist G. Stanley Hall and included 27 distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans. Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit.

In 1910, Freud proposed Jung, &quot;his adopted eldest son, his crown prince, and successor,&quot; for the position of lifetime President of the newly formed International Psychoanalytical Association. However, after forceful objections from his Viennese colleagues, it was agreed Jung would be elected to serve a two-year term of office.

====Divergence and break====

While Jung worked on his &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido&quot;, tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of libido. Jung the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that the libido was an important source of personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not think that the libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.

In 1912, these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague Ludwig Binswanger in Kreuzlingen without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as &quot;the Kreuzlingen gesture&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the US and gave the Fordham University lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious&quot;, subsequently republished as &quot;Symbols of Transformation&quot;. While they contain remarks on Jung&#x27;s dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a &quot;psychoanalytical Jung&quot; and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless, it was their publication which, Jung declared, &quot;cost me my friendship with Freud&quot;.

Another disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious. Jung saw Freud&#x27;s theory of the unconscious as incomplete, unnecessarily negative, and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung&#x27;s observations overlap to an extent with Freud&#x27;s model of the unconscious, what Jung called the &quot;personal unconscious&quot;, but his hypothesis is more about a process than a static model, and he also proposed the existence of a second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid—a term borrowed from neo-vitalist philosopher and embryologist Hans Driesch (1867–1941)—but with a somewhat altered meaning. The collective unconscious is not so much a &#x27;geographical location&#x27;, but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of archetypes over space and time.

In November 1912, Jung and Freud met in Munich for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals. At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on Amenhotep IV, Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted, and Jung carried him to a couch.

Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 at the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the introvert and extraverted types, in analytical psychology.

===Midlife isolation===
It was the publication of Jung&#x27;s book &quot;The Psychology of the Unconscious&quot; in 1912 that led to the final break with Freud. The letters they exchanged show Freud&#x27;s refusal to consider Jung&#x27;s ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his posthumously published autobiography, &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot; (1962) as a &quot;resounding censure&quot;. Everyone he knew dropped away from him except two of his colleagues. After the Munich congress, he was on the verge of a suicidal psychosis that precipitated his writing of his &quot;Red Book,&quot; his seven-volume personal diaries that were only published partially and posthumously in 2009. Eleven years later, in 2020, they were published as his &quot;Black Books.&quot; Jung described his 1912 book as &quot;an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview&quot;. The book was later revised and retitled &quot;Symbols of Transformation&quot; in 1952.

====London 1913–1914====
Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of Constance Long, who translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.

====&quot;The Black Books and The Red Book&quot;====
In 1913, at the age of 38, Jung experienced a horrible &quot;confrontation with the unconscious&quot;. He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was &quot;menaced by a psychosis&quot; or was &quot;doing a schizophrenia&quot;. He decided that it was a valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, a process of &quot;active imagination&quot;. He recorded everything he experienced in small journals, which Jung referred to in the singular as his &quot;Black Book&quot;, considering it a &quot;single integral whole&quot;, even though some of these original journals have a brown cover. The material Jung wrote was subjected to several edits, hand-written and typed, including another, &quot;second layer&quot; of text, his continual psychological interpretations during the process of editing. Around 1915, Jung commissioned a large red leather-bound book, and began to transcribe his notes and paint, working intermittently for sixteen years.

Jung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the &quot;Liber Novus&quot; or &quot;Red Book&quot;. Sonu Shamdasani, a historian of psychology from London, tried for three years to persuade Jung&#x27;s resistant heirs to have it published. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung&#x27;s grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it when the necessary additional funds were raised through the Philemon Foundation. Up to September 2008, fewer than about two dozen people had ever seen it.

In 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with New York City publishers W. W. Norton &amp; Company, scanned the manuscript with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on 7 October 2009 in German, with a &quot;separate English translation along with Shamdasani&#x27;s introduction and footnotes&quot; at the back of the book. According to Sara Corbett, reviewing the text for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an antediluvian and mystical reality.&quot;

The Rubin Museum of Art in New York City displayed Jung&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot; leather folio, as well as some of his original &quot;Black Book&quot; journals, from 7 October 2009 to 15 February 2010. According to them, &quot;During the period in which he worked on this book Jung developed his principal theories of archetypes, collective unconscious, and the process of individuation.&quot; Two-thirds of the pages bear Jung&#x27;s illuminations and illustrations to the text.

===Wartime army service===
During World War I, Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers. The Swiss were neutral and obliged to intern personnel from either side of the conflict, who crossed their frontier to evade capture. Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers stranded in Switzerland and encouraged them to attend university courses.

===Travels===
Jung emerged from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-tens with the publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, one of his most influential books. There followed a decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels.

====England (1920, 1923, 1925, 1935, 1938, 1946)====
Constance Long arranged for Jung to deliver a seminar in Cornwall in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by Jung&#x27;s British protégé Helton Godwin Baynes (known as &quot;Peter&quot;) (1882–1943), and another in 1925.

In 1935, at the invitation of his close British friends and colleagues, H. G. Baynes, E. A. Bennet and Hugh Crichton-Miller, Jung gave a series of lectures at the Tavistock Clinic in London, later published as part of the &quot;Collected Works&quot;.

In 1938, Jung was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. At the tenth International Medical Congress for Psychotherapy held at Oxford from 29 July to 2 August 1938, Jung gave the presidential address, followed by a visit to Cheshire to stay with the Bailey family at Lawton Mere.

In 1946, Jung agreed to become the first Honorary President of the newly formed Society of Analytical Psychology in London, having previously approved its training programme devised by Michael Fordham.

====United States 1909–1912, 1924–1925, &amp; 1936–1937====
During the period of Jung&#x27;s collaboration with Freud, both visited the US in 1909 to lecture at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, where both were awarded honorary degrees. In 1912, Jung gave a series of lectures at Fordham University, New York, which were published later in the year as &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious&quot;. Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924–5, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter. Of particular value to Jung was a visit with Chief Mountain Lake of the Taos Pueblo near Taos, New Mexico. Jung made another trip to America in 1936, receiving an honorary degree at Harvard and giving lectures in New York and New England for his growing group of American followers. He returned in 1937 to deliver the Terry Lectures at Yale University, later published as &quot;Psychology and Religion&quot;.

====East Africa====
In October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the &quot;Bugishu Psychological Expedition&quot; to East Africa. He was accompanied by his English friend, &quot;Peter&quot; Baynes, and an American associate, George Beckwith. On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of Mount Elgon, where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of &quot;primitive psychology&quot; through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later, he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised. One of Jung&#x27;s most famous proposed constructs is kinship libido. Jung defined this as an instinctive feeling of belonging to a particular group or family and believed it was vital to the human experience and used this as an endogamous aspect of the libido and what lies amongst the family. This is similar to a Bantu term called Ubuntu that emphasizes humanity and almost the same meaning as kinship libido, which is, &quot;I am because you are.&quot;

====India====

In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself &quot;under the direct influence of a foreign culture&quot; for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but he could converse extensively in India. Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with Ramana Maharshi. He described Ramana as being absorbed in &quot;the self&quot;. During these travels, he visited the Vedagiriswarar Temple, where he had a conversation with a local expert about the symbols and sculptures on the gopuram of this temple. He later wrote about this conversation in his book Aion. Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of delirium in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.

===Later life and death===

Jung became a full professor of medical psychology at the University of Basel in 1943 but resigned after a heart attack the next year to lead a more private life. In 1945, he began corresponding with an English Roman Catholic priest, Father Victor White, who became a close friend, regularly visiting the Jungs at the Bollingen estate. Jung became ill again in 1952.

Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including &quot;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&quot; (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of UFOs. In 1961, he wrote his last work, a contribution to &quot;Man and His Symbols&quot; entitled &quot;Approaching the Unconscious&quot; (published posthumously in 1964). Jung died on 6 June 1961 at Küsnacht after a short illness. He had been beset by circulatory diseases.

==Thought==

Jung&#x27;s thought derived from the classical education he received at school and from early family influences, which on the maternal side were a combination of Reformed Protestant academic theology with an interest in occult phenomena. On his father&#x27;s side was a dedication to academic discipline emanating from his grandfather, the physician, scientist, and first Basel Professor of Medicine, Karl Gustav Jung, a one-time student activist and convert from Catholicism to Swiss Reformed Protestantism. Family lore suggested there was at least a social connection to the German polymath, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, through the latter&#x27;s niece, Lotte Kestner, known as &quot;Lottchen&quot; who was a frequent visitor in Jung senior&#x27;s household.

Carl Jung, the practicing clinician, writer, and founder of analytical psychology, had, through his marriage, the economic security to pursue interests in other intellectual topics of the moment. His early celebrity as a research scientist through the Word Association Test led to the start of prolific correspondence and worldwide travel. It opened academic as well as social avenues, supported by his explorations into anthropology, quantum physics, vitalism, Eastern and Western philosophy. He delved into epistemology, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. Jung&#x27;s interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to label him a mystic, although he preferred to be seen as a man of science. Jung, unlike Freud, was deeply knowledgeable about philosophical concepts and sought links between epistemology and emergent theories of psychology.

===Key concepts===

Within the field of analytical psychology, a brief survey of major concepts developed by Jung include (alphabetical):

* Anima and animus—(archetype) the contrasexual aspect of a person&#x27;s psyche. In a woman&#x27;s psyche, her inner personal masculine is conceived as a complex and an archetypal image; in a man&#x27;s psyche, his inner personal feminine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image.
* Archetype—a concept &quot;borrowed&quot; from anthropology to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes. Jung&#x27;s descriptions of archetypes varied over time.
* Archetypal images—universal symbols that mediate opposites in the psyche, often found in religious art, mythology, and fairy tales across cultures.
* Collective unconscious—aspects of unconsciousness experienced by all people in different cultures.
* Complex—the repressed organisation of images and experiences that governs perception and behaviour.
* Extraversion and introversion—personality traits of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to psychological type.
* Individuation—the process of fulfilment of each individual &quot;which negates neither the conscious or unconscious position but does justice to them both&quot;.
* Interpersonal relationship—the way people relate to others is a reflection of the way they relate to their own selves. This may also be extended to relations with the natural environment.
* Numinous—a healing, transformative or destructive spiritual power. Also, an invisible power inherent in an object. Jung develops the concept from the work of Rudolf Otto, who based it on the Latin &quot;numen.&quot;
* Persona—element of the personality that arises &quot;for reasons of adaptation or personal convenience&quot;—the &quot;masks&quot; one puts on in various situations.
* Psychological types—a framework for consciously orienting psychotherapists to patients by raising particular modes of personality to consciousness and differentiation between analyst and patient.
* Shadow—(archetype) the repressed, therefore unknown, aspects of the personality, including those often considered to be negative.
* Self—(archetype) the central overarching concept governing the individuation process, as symbolised by mandalas, the union of male and female, totality, and unity. Jung viewed it as the psyche&#x27;s central archetype.
* Synchronicity—an acausal principle as a basis for the apparently random concurrence of phenomena.

===Collective unconscious===

Since the establishment of psychoanalytic theory, the notion and meaning of individuals having a &quot;personal&quot; unconscious has gradually come to be commonly accepted. This was popularised by both Freud and Jung. Whereas an individual&#x27;s personal unconscious is made up of thoughts and emotions that have, at some time, been experienced or held in mind but which have been repressed or forgotten, in contrast, the &quot;collective&quot; unconscious is neither acquired by activities within an individual&#x27;s life nor a container of things that are thoughts, memories or ideas which are capable of being conscious during one&#x27;s life. The contents of it were never naturally &quot;known&quot; through physical or cognitive experience and then forgotten.

The collective unconscious consists of universal heritable elements common to all humans, distinct from other species. However, this does not necessarily imply a genetic cause. It encapsulates fields of evolutionary biology, history of civilization, ethnology, brain and nervous system development, and general psychological development. Considering its composition in practical physiological and psychological terms, &quot;it consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&quot; Jung writes about causal factors in personal psychology as stemming from, influenced by an abstraction of the impersonal physical layer, the common and universal physiology among all humans. Jung considers that science would hardly deny the existence and basic nature of &quot;instincts&quot;, existing as a whole set of motivating urges. The collective unconscious acts as the frame where science can distinguish individual motivating urges, thought to be universal across all individuals of the human species, while instincts are present in all species. Jung contends, &quot;The hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instincts.&quot;

====Archetype====
The archetype is a concept &quot;borrowed&quot; from anthropology to denote a process of nature. Jung&#x27;s definitions of archetypes varied over time and have been the subject of debate regarding their usefulness. Archetypal images, also referred to as motifs in mythology, are universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, are often found in religious art, mythology and fairy tales across cultures. Jung saw archetypes as pre-configurations in nature that give rise to repeating, understandable, describable experiences. In addition, the concept considers the passage of time and patterns resulting from transformation. Archetypes are said to exist independently of any current event or its effect. They are said to exert influence both across all domains of experience and throughout the stages of each individual&#x27;s unique development. Being in part based on heritable physiology, they are thought to have &quot;existed&quot; since humans became a differentiated species. They have been deduced through the development of storytelling over tens of thousands of years, indicating repeating patterns of individual and group experience, behaviors, and effects across the planet, apparently displaying common themes.

The concept did not originate with Jung but with Plato, who first conceived of primordial patterns. Later contributions came from Adolf Bastian and Hermann Usener, among others. In the first half of the twentieth century, it proved impossible to objectively isolate and categorize the notion of an archetype within a materialist frame. According to Jung, there are &quot;as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life&quot;, and he asserted that they have a dynamic mutual influence on one another. Their alleged presence could be extracted from thousand-year-old narratives, from comparative religion and mythology. Jung elaborated on many archetypes in &quot;&quot;The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious&quot; and in &quot;Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self&quot;&quot;. Examples of archetypes might be the shadow, the hero, the self, anima, animus, mother, father, child, and trickster.

==== Shadow ====
The &quot;shadow&quot; exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals instinctively or consciously resist identifying as their own and would rather ignore, typically repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. Much of the shadow comes as a result of an individual&#x27;s adaptation to cultural norms and expectations. Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society but also those that are not aligned with one&#x27;s own personal morals and values.

Jung argues that the &quot;shadow&quot; plays a distinctive role in balancing one&#x27;s overall psyche, the counter-balancing to consciousness—&quot;where there is light, there must also be shadow&quot;. Without a well-developed &quot;shadow&quot; (often &quot;shadow work&quot;, &quot;integrating one&#x27;s shadow&quot;), an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others; that is, a walking &quot;persona&quot;. Not wanting to look at their shadows directly, Jung argues, often results in psychological projection. Individuals project imagined attitudes onto others without awareness. The qualities an individual may hate (or love) in another may manifest in those who do not see the external, material truth. In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the &quot;persona&quot; and &quot;shadow&quot; should be balanced.

The shadow can often appear as a dark, wild, exotic figure in dreams or visions.

===Extraversion and introversion===
Jung was one of the first people to define introversion and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories: the introvert or the extravert. Jung compares these two psychological types to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened to Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming, and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception, and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extraversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, etc.), whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion are expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world &quot;subjectively&quot;, whereas extraverts interpret the world &quot;objectively&quot;.

===Persona===

In his psychological theory—which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of social structure—the &quot;persona&quot; appears as a consciously created personality or identity, fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through socialization, acculturation and experience. Jung applied the term &quot;persona&quot; explicitly because, in Latin, it means both &quot;personality&quot; and the &quot;masks&quot; worn by Roman actors of the classical period, expressive of the individual roles played.

The &quot;persona&quot;, he argues, is a mask for the &quot;collective psyche&quot;, a mask that &#x27;pretends&#x27; individuality so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played &quot;role&quot; through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the &quot;persona-mask&quot; as a complicated system that &quot;mediates&quot; between individual consciousness and the social community: it is &quot;a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be&quot;. But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a &quot;character mask&quot; in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual. The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re)gains their &quot;own self&quot;—by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the &quot;persona&quot; and from the power of unconscious impulses.

Jung has influenced management theory because managers and executives create an appropriate &quot;management persona&quot; (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity, and they have to evaluate &quot;what sort of people&quot; the workers are, to manage them (for example, using personality tests and peer reviews).

===Evolutionary Thought===

Of his early years, Jung would write that &quot;mentally my greatest adventure had been the study of Kant and Schopenhauer. The great news of the day was the work of
Charles Darwin.&quot; While Jung’s conception of human psychology is grounded in Darwinian evolutionary theory it is important to note that his evolutionary thought had a distinctively German quality to it. This is because the idiosyncratic reception of Darwin in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Germany resulted in the integration of Darwin&#x27;s ideas with German embryological and developmental traditions formulated by the Naturphilosophen and theorists such as Ernst Haeckel. It was these traditions that formed the intellectual background of Jung’s evolutionary thought.

The result was that Jung&#x27;s evolutionary conception of mind focused on embryology and development. From this perspective, the emergence of consciousness both in ontogeny (development) and phylogeny (evolution) was built upon much more archaic, affect-based subcortical brain systems. It was this developmental approach to evolution that underpinned his &quot;archaeological&quot; conception of the human psyche consisting of different evolutionary layers, from the deeply archaic to the more evolutionarily recent. Those more archaic structures in the brain Jung believed to be the basis of the “collective unconscious” - an aspect of human psychology shared by all members of the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

In commenting on humanity&#x27;s evolution from an ancient primate ancestor, Jung wrote: &#x27;We keep forgetting that we are primates and that we have to make allowances for these primitive layers in our psyche.&#x27; Jung also developed the notion of different evolutionary layers in the psyche in his discussion of fossil hominins such as &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; (&quot;Homo erectus&quot;). As he writes:

For just as a man has a body that is no different in principle from that of an animal, so also his psychology has a whole series of lower in which the spectres from humanity’s past epochs still dwell, then the animal souls from the age of Pithecanthropus and the hominids, then the “psyche” of the cold-blooded saurian.

Jung’s notion of different evolutionary layers in the human mind has been compared with the work of neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, particularly as outlined in his book &quot;The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotions&quot;. Of these affinities it has been suggested that ‘Jung and Panksepp have, independently it seems, developed similar metaphors of an archeologically layered psyche in which jewels and treasures are discoverable in the deepest phylogenetically ancient regions of the brain – for Jung they are archetypal structures for Panksepp cross-species homologies.&#x27; 

Significantly, in a 2017 article entitled &quot;The Affective Core of the Self: A Neuro-Archetypical Perspective
on the Foundations of Human (and Animal) Subjectivity&quot;,
when noting Jung’s belief that archetypes may be related to evolutionarily ancient subcortical brain systems, Panksepp and colleagues wrote that &quot;such assertions by Jung were not only quite farsighted, but they actually open ways to connect his theory of the psyche with the most advanced scientific theories and discoveries of our day.&quot; 
===Spirituality===
Jung&#x27;s work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. The main task for people, he believed, is to discover and fulfill their deep, innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed this journey of transformation, which he called individuation, is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self and at the same time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud&#x27;s atheistic worldview, Jung&#x27;s pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole.

In 1959, Jung was asked by the host, John Freeman, on the BBC interview program &quot;Face to Face&quot; whether he believed in God, to which Jung answered, &quot;I do not need to believe. I &quot;know&quot;.&quot; Jung&#x27;s ideas on religion counterbalance Freudian skepticism. Jung&#x27;s idea of religion as a practical road to individuation is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have been criticized.

Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism, and is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung treated an American patient named Rowland Hazard III who had chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed. Hazard took Jung&#x27;s advice seriously and sought a personal, spiritual experience. He returned to the United States and joined a Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group. He told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of William Griffith Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard&#x27;s experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program.

The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Wilson. Although some historians dispute the detail, Jung discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in his &quot;Collected Works&quot;, &quot;For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, &#x27;You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can&#x27;t do it better than Jesus. Jung goes on to state he has seen similar cures among Roman Catholics. The 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous has a psychological backdrop involving the human ego and the dichotomy between the conscious and unconscious mind.

=== Inquiries into the paranormal ===

Jung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades he attended seances and claimed to have witnessed &quot;parapsychic phenomena&quot;. Initially, he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on &quot;The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits&quot;. However, he began to &quot;doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question&quot; and stated that &quot;the spirit hypothesis yields better results&quot;. But he retained some skepticism toward his own postulation, as he could not find material evidence of the existence of spirits.

Jung&#x27;s ideas about the paranormal culminated in &quot;synchronicity&quot;. This is the idea that certain coincidences manifest in the world, have exceptionally intense meaning to observers. Such coincidences have a great effect on the observer from multiple cumulative aspects: from the immediate personal relevance of the coincidence to the observer, from the peculiarities of (the nature of, the character, novelty, curiosity of) any such coincidence; from the sheer improbability of the coincidence, having no apparent causal link (hence Jung&#x27;s essay subtitle &quot;An Acausal Connecting Principle&quot;). Despite his own experiments failing to confirm the phenomenon he held on to the idea as an explanation for apparent ESP. In addition, he proposed it as a functional explanation for how the I-Ching worked. However, he was never clear about how synchronicity worked.

===Interpretation of quantum mechanics===
Jung influenced one philosophical interpretation (not the science) of quantum physics with the concept of synchronicity regarding some events as non-causal. That idea influenced the physicist Wolfgang Pauli (with whom, via a letter correspondence, Jung developed the notion of &quot;unus mundus&quot; in connection with the idea of nonlocality) and some other physicists.

===Alchemy===

Jung&#x27;s acquaintance with alchemy came between 1928 and 1930 when he was introduced to a manuscript of &quot;The Secret of the Golden Flower&quot;, translated by Richard Wilhelm. The work and writings of Jung from the 1930s onwards shifted to a focus on the psychological significance of alchemy.

In 1944, Jung published &quot;Psychology and Alchemy&quot;, in which he analyzed the alchemical symbols and came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process. He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the individuation process.

In 1963, &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot; first appeared in English as part of &quot;The Collected Works of C. G. Jung&quot;. &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot; was Jung&#x27;s last major book and focused on the &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot; archetype, known as the sacred marriage between the sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening, and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation—his chosen term for personal growth (75).

===Art therapy===

Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore, and heal. In his work with patients and his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could help recover from trauma and emotional distress. At times of emotional distress, he often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions, which he recognized as more than recreational.

=== Dance/movement therapy ===
Dance and movement therapy, as a form of active imagination, was developed by Jung and Toni Wolff in 1916 and practiced by Tina Keller-Jenny and other analysts. It remained largely unknown until the 1950s when it was rediscovered by Marian Chace and therapist Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse, after studying with Martha Graham and Mary Wigman, became a dancer and teacher of modern dance, and, along with Swiss dancer Trudi Schoop, is considered one of the founders of dance/movement therapy in the U.S.

===Political views===

====The state====
Jung stressed the importance of individual rights in a person&#x27;s relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as &quot;a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected&quot; but that this personality was &quot;only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it&quot;. He referred to the state as a form of slavery. He also thought that the state &quot;swallowed up [people&#x27;s] religious forces&quot;, and therefore that the state had &quot;taken the place of God&quot;—making it comparable to a religion in which &quot;state slavery is a form of worship&quot;. Jung observed that &quot;stage acts of [the] state&quot; are comparable to religious displays:

From Jung&#x27;s perspective, this replacement of God with the state in a mass society leads to the dislocation of the religious drive and results in the same fanaticism of the church-states of the Dark Ages—wherein the more the state is &#x27;worshipped&#x27;, the more freedom and morality are suppressed; this ultimately leaves the individual psychically undeveloped with extreme feelings of marginalization.

====Service to the Allies during World War II====
Jung was in contact with Allen Dulles of the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) and provided valuable intelligence on the psychological condition of Hitler. Dulles referred to Jung as &quot;Agent 488&quot; and offered the following description of his service: &quot;Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side&quot;. Jung&#x27;s service to the Allied cause through the OSS remained classified after the war.

===Relationship to Nazism and antisemitism===
In &quot;The State of Psychotherapy Today&quot;, published in 1934 in the &quot;Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie&quot;, Jung wrote: &quot;The Aryan unconscious has a greater potential than the Jewish unconscious&quot; and &quot;The Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will&quot;. Andrew Samuels argues that his remarks on the &quot;Aryan unconscious&quot; and the &quot;corrosive character&quot; of Freud&#x27;s &quot;Jewish gospel&quot; demonstrate a form of antisemitism &quot;fundamental to the structure of Jung&#x27;s thought&quot; but also argues that there is a &quot;pioneering nature of Jung&#x27;s contributions&quot; and that &quot;his intuition of the importance of exploring difference remains intact.&quot;

In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung became the president of the new International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy (&quot;Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie&quot;), a professional body which aimed to have affiliated organizations in different countries. The German affiliated organization, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by Matthias Göring, an Adlerian psychotherapist and a cousin of the prominent Nazi Hermann Göring, excluded Jews. In 1933, the society&#x27;s &quot;Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie&quot; journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions and Hitler&#x27;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, that he experienced &quot;great surprise and disappointment&quot; when the &quot;Zentralblatt&quot; associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement. He did not end his relationship with the &quot;Zentralblatt&quot; at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, Carl Alfred Meier of Switzerland. For the next few years, the &quot;Zentralblatt&quot; under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis in that it continued to acknowledge the contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy. In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939, the year the Second World War started.

The International Society&#x27;s constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934. This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.
Jung went on to say, &quot;The main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake.&quot;

Scholar Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi believed that Jung&#x27;s antisemitism may have contributed to the schism between Freud and his circle of psychoanalysts, who were predominantly Jews.

Jung&#x27;s interest in European mythology and folk psychology was shared by the Nazis. Richard Noll describes Jung&#x27;s own reaction to this connection:

Various statements made by Jung in the 1930s have been cited as evidence of both contempt for Nazism and sympathy for Nazism. In the 1936 essay &quot;Wotan&quot;, Jung described the influence of Adolf Hitler on Germany as &quot;one man who is obviously &#x27;possessed&#x27; has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition.&quot; He would later say, during a lengthy interview with H. R. Knickerbocker in October 1938:
In an interview in 1949, Carl Jung said, 
Jung is also known to have possessed an interest in the Jewish mystic tradition of Kabbalah.

===Views on homosexuality===
Jung addressed homosexuality in his published writings, in one comment specifying that homosexuality should not be a concern of legal authorities nor be considered a crime. He also stated that homosexuality does not reduce the value of a person as a member of society. Jung also said that homosexuality is a result of psychological immaturity (&quot;nurture&quot;), but only if one&#x27;s sexuality is not an aspect of their constitutional characteristics (&quot;nature&quot;).

===Psychedelics===

Jung&#x27;s theories are considered to be a useful therapeutic framework for the analysis of unconscious phenomena that become manifest in the acute psychedelic state. This view is based on correspondence Jung had with researchers involved in psychedelic research in the 1950s, as well as more recent neuroimaging research where subjects who are administered psychedelic compounds seem to have archetypal religious experiences of &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;ego dissolution&quot; associated with reduced activity in the default mode network.

This research has led to a re-evaluation of Jung&#x27;s work, particularly the visions detailed in &quot;The Red Book&quot;, in the context of contemporary psychedelic, evolutionary, and developmental neuroscience. For example, in a chapter entitled &quot;Integrating the Archaic and the Modern: The Red Book, Visual Cognitive Modalities and the Neuroscience of Altered States of Consciousness&quot;, in the 2020 volume &quot;Jung&#x27;s Red Book for Our Time: Searching for Soul Under Postmodern Conditions, Volume 4&quot;, it is argued Jung was a pioneer who explored uncharted &quot;cognitive domains&quot; that are alien to Western modes of thought. While such domains of experience are not part of mainstream Western culture and thought, they are central to various Indigenous cultures that use psychedelics such as Iboga and Ayahuasca during rituals to alter consciousness. The author writes: &quot;Jung seems to have been dealing with modes of consciousness alien to mainstream Western thought, exploring the terrain of uncharted cognitive domains. I argue that science is beginning to catch up with Jung who was a pioneer whose insights contribute a great deal to our emerging understanding of human consciousness.&quot; In this analysis, Jung&#x27;s paintings of his visions in &quot;The Red Book&quot; were compared to the paintings of Ayahuasca visions by the Peruvian shaman Pablo Amaringo.

Commenting on research that was being undertaken during the 1950s, Jung wrote the following in a letter to Betty Eisner, a psychologist who was involved in LSD research at the University of California: &quot;Experiments along the line of mescaline and related drugs are certainly most interesting since such drugs lay bare a level of the unconscious that is otherwise accessible only under peculiar psychic conditions. It is a fact that you get certain perceptions and experiences of things appearing either in mystical states or in the analysis of unconscious phenomena.&quot;

An account of Jung and psychedelics, as well as the importance of Jungian psychology to psychedelic-assisted therapies, is outlined in Scott Hill&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Confrontation with the Unconscious: Jungian Depth Psychology and Psychedelic Experience&quot;. A 2021 article discusses Jung&#x27;s attitude towards psychedelics, as well as the applicability of his ideas to current research. As the author writes, Jung&#x27;s &quot;...legitimate reservations about the clinical use of psychedelics are no longer relevant as the field has progressed significantly, devising robust clinical and experimental protocols for psychedelic-assisted therapies. That said Jung&#x27;s concept of individuation—that is the integration of the archaic unconscious with consciousness—seems extremely pertinent to modern psychedelic research.&quot; The author also uses work in evolutionary and psychedelic neuroscience, and specifically the latter&#x27;s ability to make manifest ancient subcortical brain systems, to illuminate Jung&#x27;s concept of an archaic collective unconscious that evolved before the ego complex and the uniquely human default mode network.

==Legacy==
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a psychometric instrument mostly popular with non-psychologists, as well as the concepts of socionics, were developed from Jung&#x27;s model of psychological types. The MBTI is considered pseudoscience and is not widely accepted by researchers in the field of psychology.

Jung is considered a &quot;godparent&quot; of the altruistic, mutual self-help movement, Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung told Rhode Island businessman and politician Rowland Hazard III, who had come under his care for the first time in 1926, that the only chance he might have to recover was through a &quot;spiritual or religious experience&quot; or &quot;genuine conversion,&quot; which Hazard later had, through the Oxford Group and the Emmanuel Movement, and, according to some sources, never drank again.

Hazard, in turn, helped Ebby Thatcher, another alcoholic, get sober, with help from the Oxford Group. Thatcher brought Jung&#x27;s ideas to a third alcoholic, Bill W., who consequently co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous with Dr. Bob. Years later, Bill W. corresponded with Jung, in 1961, thanking him for helping to inspire the organization. Of Hazard, the alcoholic who came under his care, Jung wrote: &quot;His craving for alcohol was the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness, expressed in medieval language: the union with God.&quot;

Jung concludes his letter to Bill W.:

&quot;You see, &quot;alcohol&quot; in Latin is &quot;spiritus&quot;, and you use the same word for the highest religious experience as well as for the most depraving poison. The helpful formula therefore is: &quot;spiritus contra spiritum&quot;.&quot;

Jung saw the human psyche as &quot;by nature religious&quot; and made this idea a principal focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best-known contemporary contributors to dream analysis and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the &quot;psychologization of religion&quot;, spirituality, and the New Age movement has been immense. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Jung as the 23rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. The list however focused on U.S. journals and was made by the psychology department of Arkansas State University.

Although psychoanalysis is still studied in the humanities, a 2008 study in &quot;The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association&quot; found that psychology departments and textbooks treat it as &quot;desiccated and dead&quot;. Similarly, Alan Stone noted, &quot;As academic psychology becomes more &#x27;scientific&#x27; and psychiatry more biological, psychoanalysis is being brushed aside.&quot;

In a 2024 book-length reappraisal of Jung’s theories entitled &quot;Carl Jung and the Evolutionary Sciences: A New Vision for Analytical Psychology&quot;, it has been suggested that Jung was far ahead of his time in his evolutionary conception of the human mind. This thesis asserts that recent work in developmental biology, as well as experimental and psychedelic neuroscience, have provided empirical evidence that supports some of Jung’s central claims about the nature and evolution of consciousness. More specifically, trance states or altered states of consciousness (what Jung often referred to as the &quot;numinous&quot;) have become a central concern in contemporary neuroscientific investigation of the nature and origins of consciousness. In this sense, as an evolutionary theorist of the mind, Jung was far ahead of his own time. It was only during the first decades of the 21st Century, as scientists began investigating altered, trance, and psychedelic states, that Jung’s far-seeing and wide-ranging theories found increasing support from the empirically based mind sciences. In this sense, we can now appreciate how revolutionary and prescient Jung’s evolutionary conception of human psychology really was.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
====Books in which Jung is a character in the narrative====
* Laurens van der Post was an Afrikaner author who claimed to have had a 16-year friendship with Jung, from which a number of books and a film were created about Jung. The accuracy of van der Post&#x27;s claims about his relationship to Jung has been questioned.
* In his novel &quot;The World is Made of Glass&quot; (1983), Morris West gives a fictional account of one of Jung&#x27;s cases, placing the events in 1913. According to the author&#x27;s note, the novel is &quot;based upon a case recorded, very briefly, by Carl Gustav Jung in his autobiographical work &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, a supernatural novel in which Jung is a character.
* &quot;Possessing the Secret of Joy&quot;, a novel in which Jung is a therapist character.
* &quot;The Interpretation of Murder&quot;, a novel focused on Sigmund Freud in which he solves a murder in New York City.

====Fiction which references Jung&#x27;s theories====
* Hermann Hesse, author of works such as &quot;Siddhartha&quot; and &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;, was treated by Joseph Lang, a student of Jung. For Hesse this began a long preoccupation with psychoanalysis, through which he came to know Jung personally.
* The Canadian novelist Robertson Davies made Jungian analysis a central part of his 1970 novel &quot;The Manticore&quot;. He stated in a letter, &quot;There have been other books which describe Freudian analyses, but I know of no other that describes a Jungian analysis&quot; adding &quot;I was deeply afraid that I would put my foot in it, for I have never undergone one of those barnacle-scraping experiences, and knew of it only through reading. So, I was greatly pleased when some of my Jungian friends in Zurich liked it very much.&quot;
* The psychological novel &quot;E.E.&quot; written by Olga Tokarczuk draws from Jung&#x27;s doctoral dissertation &quot;On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena&quot;. Jung is not a character in this story, but Jung&#x27;s views on the occult are extensively cited.

===Art===

* The visionary Swiss painter Peter Birkhäuser was treated by a student of Jung, Marie-Louise von Franz, and corresponded with Jung about the translation of dream symbolism into works of art.
* American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock underwent Jungian psychotherapy in 1939 with Joseph Henderson. Henderson engaged Pollock through his art, having him make drawings, which led to the appearance of many Jungian concepts in his paintings.
* Contrary to some sources, Jung did not visit Liverpool but recorded a dream in which he did, and of which he wrote, &quot;Liverpool is the pool of life, it makes to live.&quot; A plaster statue of Jung was erected in Mathew Street in 1987 that was vandalised and replaced by a more durable version in 1993.

===Music===
* Musician David Bowie described himself as Jungian in his relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Bowie sang of Jung on his album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (a pun on &quot;a lad insane&quot;) and attended the exhibition of &quot;The Red Book&quot; in New York with artist Tony Oursler, who described Bowie as &quot;reading and speaking of the psychoanalyst with passion&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s 1967 song &quot;Shadow Man&quot; encapsulates a key Jungian concept, while in 1987 Bowie described the Glass Spiders of &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; as Jungian mother figures around which he not only anchored a worldwide tour but also created an enormous onstage effigy.
*British rock band the Police released an album titled &quot;Synchronicity&quot; in 1983. 
*The American rock band Tool was influenced by Jungian concepts in its album &quot;Ænima&quot;, the title a play on the concepts of anima and animus. In the song &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot;, the singer seeks to become a more evolved self by exploring and overcoming his Shadow.
* Argentinian musician Luis Alberto Spinetta was influenced by Jung&#x27;s texts in his 1975 conceptual album &quot;Durazno sangrando&quot;, specifically the songs &quot;Encadenado al ánima&quot; and &quot;En una lejana playa del ánimus&quot;, which deal with anima and animus.
* Jung appeared on the front cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.
* The South Korean band BTS&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Map of the Soul: Persona&quot; is based on Jung&#x27;s &quot;Map of the Soul&quot;, which gives the basic principles of Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology. It includes an intro song titled &quot;&quot; rapped by group leader RM, who asks, &quot;who am I?&quot;, and is confronted with various versions of himself with the words &quot;persona&quot;, &quot;shadow&quot;, and &quot;ego&quot;, referring to Jung&#x27;s theories. On 21 February 2020, the band released &quot;Map of the Soul: 7&quot;, which specifically focuses on Jung&#x27;s &quot;shadow&quot; and &quot;ego&quot; theories. As part of the first phase of the band&#x27;s comeback, &quot;Interlude: Shadow&quot;, rapped by Suga and released on 10 January, addresses the shadows and the darkness that go hand-in-hand with the light and attention shone on celebrities. The next comeback trailer, &quot;Outro: Ego&quot;, performed by J-Hope, ends with his declaration of self and ego as he appears within a colourful city &quot;in which the artist&#x27;s current image is projected&quot;.
* In 2019, Italian rapper Marracash released the album &quot;Persona&quot;, which features many Jungian themes.
* Jung appeared on the cover art of the 2008 single &quot;Metanoia&quot; by American psychedelic rock band MGMT.

===Theatre, film, television and radio===
====Films in which Jung is a character in the narrative====
* 2002 saw the release of an Italian film about Jung and Spielrein &quot;The Soul Keeper&quot; (&quot;Prendimi l&#x27;Anima&quot;) directed by Roberto Faenza. It used English dialogue and English actors, but was never formally released in the United States. Emilia Fox played Sabina Spielrein and Iain Glen was Carl Gustav Jung.
* &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;, a 2011 film directed by David Cronenberg, is a fictional dramatisation of the lives of Freud, Jung, and Sabina Spielrein between 1904 and 1913. Spielrein is the Russian woman who became Jung&#x27;s lover and student and, later, an analyst herself. Michael Fassbender plays Carl Jung. The film is based on the stage play &quot;The Talking Cure&quot; by Christopher Hampton which was in turn based on the 1993 non-fiction book by John Kerr, &quot;A Most Dangerous Method: The Story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein&quot;.
* In the online animated series, &quot;Super Science Friends&quot;, Jung, voiced by Tom Park, is featured as one of the recurrent antagonists against Sigmund Freud.
* &quot;Soul&quot;, a 2020 Pixar film written by Pete Docter, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers, includes brief appearances of Jung as an ethereal cartoon character, &quot;Soul Carl Jung&quot;.

====Documentaries====
* The BBC interviewed Jung for &quot;Face to Face&quot; with John Freeman at Jung&#x27;s home in Zurich in 1959.
* Stephen Segaller produced a documentary on Jung as part of his &quot;World of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Wisdom of the Dream&quot; in 1985. It was re-issued in 2018. It was followed by a book of the same title.
* &quot;Matter of Heart&quot; (1986) is a documentary about Jung featuring interviews with those who knew him and archival footage.
*On 2 December 2004, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;In Our Time&quot; broadcast a program on &quot;the mind and theories&quot; of Jung.

====Film, stage, and television influenced by Jung&#x27;s ideas====
* Federico Fellini brought to the screen exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with Jung&#x27;s ideas, especially Jungian dream interpretation. Fellini preferred Jung to Freud because Jungian analysis defined the dream not as a symptom of a disease that required a cure but rather as a link to archetypal images shared by all of humanity.
* Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; has an underlying theme about the duality of man. In one scene, a colonel asks a soldier, &quot;You write &#x27;Born to Kill&#x27; on your helmet and you wear a peace button. What&#x27;s that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?&quot; The soldier replies, &quot;I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir...the Jungian thing, sir.&quot;
* In the 1994 &quot;Frasier&quot; episode, &quot;Frasier Crane&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, Niles fills in for his brother, declaring: &quot;Although I feel perfectly qualified to fill Frasier&#x27;s radio shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, I am a Jungian. So there&#x27;ll be no blaming Mother today.&quot; 
* Robert Eggers&#x27;s 2019 psychological thriller &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; has elements strongly influenced by Jung&#x27;s work, with Eggers hoping that &quot;it&#x27;s a movie where both Jung and Freud would be furiously eating their popcorn&quot;.

===Video games===
* The &quot;Persona&quot; series of games is heavily based on Jung&#x27;s theories, representing the shadow, the persona, and archetype.
* The &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; series of games is heavily based on Jung&#x27;s theories. 
* Jungian concepts are present in the &quot;Xeno&quot; series, including &quot;Xenogears&quot;; its reimagination as the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; trilogy; and a graphic novel, &quot;Perfect Works&quot;, published by the game&#x27;s creator.
*The game &quot;Control&quot; is heavily influenced by Carl Jung&#x27;s ideas, particularly synchronicity and shadow selves.
*&quot;Alan Wake&quot; takes inspiration from Carl Jung&#x27;s ideas of archetype and individuation.

<text>In psychoanalysis and other psychological theories, the unconscious mind (or the unconscious) is the part of the psyche that is not available to introspection. Although these processes exist beneath the surface of conscious awareness, they are thought to exert an effect on conscious thought processes and behavior. Empirical evidence suggests that unconscious phenomena include repressed feelings and desires, memories, automatic skills, subliminal perceptions, and automatic reactions. The term was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The emergence of the concept of the unconscious in psychology and general culture was mainly due to the work of Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. In psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious mind consists of ideas and drives that have been subject to the mechanism of repression: anxiety-producing impulses in childhood are barred from consciousness, but do not cease to exist, and exert a constant pressure in the direction of consciousness. However, the content of the unconscious is only knowable to consciousness through its representation in a disguised or distorted form, by way of dreams and neurotic symptoms, as well as in slips of the tongue and jokes. The psychoanalyst seeks to interpret these conscious manifestations in order to understand the nature of the repressed.

The unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking). Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include awakening, implicit memory, subliminal messages, trances, hypnagogia and hypnosis. While sleep, sleepwalking, dreaming, delirium and comas may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.

Some critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious altogether.

== Historical overview ==
=== German ===
The term &quot;unconscious&quot; () was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his &quot;System of Transcendental Idealism&quot;, ch. 6, § 3) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;). Some rare earlier instances of the term &quot;unconsciousness&quot; (&quot;&quot;) can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher Ernst Platner.

=== Vedas ===
Influences on thinking that originate from outside an individual&#x27;s consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was present in antiquity, and has been explored across a wide variety of cultures. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2,500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the Vedas, found today in Ayurvedic medicine.

=== Paracelsus ===
Paracelsus is credited as the first to make mention of an unconscious aspect of cognition in his work &quot;Von den Krankheiten&quot; (translates as &quot;About illnesses&quot;, 1567), and his clinical methodology created a cogent system that is regarded by some as the beginning of modern scientific psychology. 

=== Shakespeare ===
William Shakespeare explored the role of the unconscious in many of his plays, without naming it as such. 

=== Philosophy ===
In his work &quot;Anthropology&quot;, philosopher Immanuel Kant was one of the first to discuss the subject of unconscious ideas.

Western philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, Carl Gustav Carus, Søren Aabye Kierkegaard, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and Thomas Carlyle used the word unconscious.

In 1880 at the Sorbonne, Edmond Colsenet defended a philosophy thesis (PhD) on the unconscious. Elie Rabier and Alfred Fouillee performed syntheses of the unconscious &quot;at a time when Freud was not interested in the concept&quot;.

==Psychology==

===Nineteenth century===

According to historian of psychology Mark Altschule, &quot;It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance.&quot; In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, William James, in his monumental treatise on psychology (&quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;), examined the way Schopenhauer, von Hartmann, Janet, Binet and others had used the term &#x27;unconscious&#x27; and &#x27;subconscious.&#x27;&quot; German psychologists, Gustav Fechner and Wilhelm Wundt, had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an &quot;unconscious&quot; level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form.&quot; Eduard von Hartmann published a book dedicated to the topic, &quot;Philosophy of the Unconscious,&quot; in 1869.

===Freud===

Sigmund Freud and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. He worked with the unconscious mind to develop an explanation for mental illness. It plays an important role in psychoanalysis.

Freud divided the mind into the conscious mind (or the ego) and the unconscious mind. The latter was then further divided into the id (or instincts and drive) and the superego (or conscience). In this theory, the unconscious refers to the mental processes of which individuals are unaware. Freud proposed a vertical and hierarchical architecture of human consciousness: the conscious mind, the preconscious, and the unconscious mind—each lying beneath the other. He believed that significant psychic events take place &quot;below the surface&quot; in the unconscious mind. Contents of the unconscious mind go through the preconscious mind before coming to conscious awareness. He interpreted such events as having both symbolic and actual significance.

In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather that which is actively repressed from conscious thought. In the psychoanalytic view, unconscious mental processes can only be recognized through analysis of their effects in consciousness. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary introspection, but they are capable of partially evading the censorship mechanism of repression in a disguised form, manifesting, for example, as dream elements or neurotic symptoms. Such symptoms are supposed to be capable of being &quot;interpreted&quot; during psychoanalysis, with the help of methods such as free association, dream analysis, and analysis of verbal slips and other unintentional manifestations in conscious life.

===Jung===

Carl Gustav Jung agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud&#x27;s notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and archetypal experiences. Archetypes are not memories but energy centers or psychological functions that are apparent in the culture&#x27;s use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual. The collective unconscious is, according to Jung, &quot;[the] whole spiritual heritage of mankind&#x27;s evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual&quot;.

In addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.

==Dreams==

===Freud===
The purpose of dreams, according to Freud, is to fulfill repressed wishes while simultaneously allowing the dreamer to remain asleep. The dream is a &quot;disguised&quot; fulfillment of the wish because the unconscious desire in its raw form would disturb the sleeper and can only avoid censorship by associating itself with elements that are not subject to repression. Thus Freud distinguished between the manifest content and latent content of the dream. The manifest content consists of the plot and elements of a dream as they appear to consciousness, particularly upon waking, as the dream is recalled. The latent content refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events and elements of the dream. It represents the unconscious psychic realities of the dreamer&#x27;s current issues and childhood conflicts, the nature of which the analyst is seeking to understand through interpretation of the manifest content. In Freud&#x27;s theory, dreams are instigated by the events and thoughts of everyday life. In what he called the &quot;dream-work&quot;, these events and thoughts, governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the &quot;primary process&quot; of unconscious thought, which is governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. The dream-work involves a process of disguising these unconscious desires in order to preserve sleep. This process occurs primarily by means of what Freud called condensation and displacement. Condensation is the focusing of the energy of several ideas into one, and displacement is the surrender of one idea&#x27;s energy to another more trivial representative. The manifest content is thus thought to be a highly significant simplification of the latent content, capable of being deciphered in the analytic process, potentially allowing conscious insight into unconscious mental activity.

=== Neurobiological theory of dreams ===
Allan Hobson and colleagues developed what they called the activation-synthesis hypothesis which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces beta brain waves during REM sleep that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the cortex. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.

==Contemporary cognitive psychology==

===Research===
There is an extensive body of research in contemporary cognitive psychology devoted to mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness. Most of this research on unconscious processes has been done in the academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. The cognitive tradition of research into unconscious processes does not rely on the clinical observations and theoretical bases of the psychoanalytic tradition; instead it is mostly data driven. Cognitive research reveals that individuals automatically register and acquire more information than they are consciously aware of or can consciously remember and report.

Much research has focused on the differences between conscious and unconscious perception. There is evidence that whether something is consciously perceived depends both on the incoming stimulus (bottom up strength) and on top-down mechanisms like attention. Recent research indicates that some unconsciously perceived information can become consciously accessible if there is cumulative evidence. Similarly, content that would normally be conscious can become unconscious through inattention (e.g. in the attentional blink) or through distracting stimuli like visual masking.

===Unconscious processing of information about frequency===
An extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (outside conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly &quot;automatically&quot;, regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual&#x27;s age, education, intelligence, or personality. Thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of procedural knowledge and experience, in general.

==Criticism of the Freudian concept==
The notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.

Franz Brentano rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book &quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot;, although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.

Jean-Paul Sartre offers a critique of Freud&#x27;s theory of the unconscious in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud&#x27;s theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher Thomas Baldwin argues that Sartre&#x27;s argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.

Erich Fromm contends that &quot;The term &#x27;the unconscious&#x27; is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as &quot;the&quot; unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, &quot;of which we are unconscious&quot;. If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: &#x27;the&#x27; unconscious.&quot;

John Searle has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as &#x27;repressed consciousness,&#x27; while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of &quot;thoughts&quot; that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are &quot;in principle never accessible&quot; to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not &quot;nonconscious&quot; processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a &quot;thought&quot; in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, &quot;think&quot; it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of &quot;something&quot; as a &quot;thought&quot; either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.

Other critics of the Freudian unconscious include David Stannard, Richard Webster, Ethan Watters, Richard Ofshe, and Eric Thomas Weber.

Some scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones. They speak of a &quot;cognitive unconscious&quot; (John Kihlstrom), an &quot;adaptive unconscious&quot; (Timothy Wilson), or a &quot;dumb unconscious&quot; (Loftus and Klinger), which executes automatic processes but lacks the complex mechanisms of repression and symbolic return of the repressed, and the &quot;deep unconscious system&quot; of Robert Langs.

In modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as &quot;implicit&quot; or &quot;automatic&quot; have been used. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior. Active research traditions related to the unconscious include implicit memory (for example, priming), and Pawel Lewicki&#x27;s nonconscious acquisition of knowledge.

<text>The American Psychological Association (APA) is the main professional organization of psychologists in the United States, and the largest psychological association in the world. It has over 157,000 members, including scientists, educators, clinicians, consultants, and students. It has 54 divisions, which function as interest groups for different subspecialties of psychology or topical areas. The APA has an annual budget of around $125 million.

==Profile==
The APA has task forces that issue policy statements on various matters of social importance, including abortion, human rights, the welfare of detainees, human trafficking, the rights of the mentally ill, IQ testing, sexual orientation change efforts, and gender equality.

===Governance===
APA is a corporation chartered in Washington, D.C. APA&#x27;s bylaws describe structural components that serve as a system of checks and balances to ensure democratic process. The organizational entities include:
* APA President. The APA president is elected by the membership. The president chairs the Council of Representatives and the Board of Directors. During their term of office, the president performs such duties as are prescribed in the bylaws.
* Board of Directors. The Board is composed of six members-at-large, president-elect, president, past-president, treasurer, recording secretary, the Chair and Chair-Elect of the Council Leadership Team, CEO, and the past chair of the American Psychological Association of Graduate Students (APAGS). The board oversees the association&#x27;s administrative affairs and determines the annual budget and makes decisions regarding APA&#x27;s roughly $125 million annual income.
* APA Council of Representatives. The Council has sole authority to set APA policy. It is composed of elected members from state/provincial/territorial psychological associations, APA divisions, and the APA Board of Directors. The Council Leadership Team (CLT) is elected from within by the members of Council and facilitates Council&#x27;s workload on an annual basis. The Chair and Chair-Elect of the CLT are voting members of the Board of Directors.
* APA Board/Committee Structure: Members of boards and committees conduct much of APA&#x27;s work on a volunteer basis. They carry out a wide variety of tasks suggested by their names. Some have responsibility for monitoring major programs, such as the directorates, the journals, and international affairs.

===Good Governance Project===
The Good Governance Project (GGP) was initiated in January 2011 as part of the strategic plan to &quot;[assure] APA&#x27;s governance practices, processes, and structures are optimized and aligned with what is needed to thrive in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex environment.&quot; The charge included soliciting feedback and input stakeholders, learning about governance best practices, recommending whether the change was required, recommending needed changes based on data, and creating implementation plans. The June 2013 GGP update on the recommended changes can be found in the document &quot;Good Governance Project Recommended Changes to Maximize Organizational Effectiveness of APA Governance&quot;. The suggested changes would change APA from a membership-based, representational structure to a corporate structure. These motions were discussed and voted upon by the council on July 31, 2013, and August 2, 2013.

===Organizational structure===
APA comprises an executive office, a publishing operation, offices that address administrative, business, information technology, and operational needs, and five substantive directorates:
*the Education Directorate accredits doctoral psychology programs and addresses issues related to psychology education in secondary through graduate education;
*the Practice Directorate engages on behalf of practicing psychologists and health care consumers;
*the Public Interest Directorate advances psychology as a means of addressing the fundamental problems of human welfare and promoting the equitable and just treatment of all segments of society;
*the Public and Member Communications Directorate is responsible for APA&#x27;s outreach to its members and affiliates and to the general public;
*the Science Directorate provides support and voice for psychological scientists.

===Membership and title of &quot;psychologist&quot;===

APA policy on the use of the title psychologist is contained in the Model Act for State Licensure of Psychologists: psychologists have earned a doctoral degree in psychology and may not use the title &quot;psychologist&quot; and/or deliver psychological services to the public, unless the psychologist is licensed or specifically exempted from licensure under the law. State licensing laws specify state specific requirements for the education and training of psychologists leading to licensure. Psychologists who are exempted from licensure could include researchers, educators, or general applied psychologists who provide services outside the health and mental health field.

Full membership with the APA in United States and Canada requires doctoral training whereas associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or approved related discipline. The minimal requirement of a doctoral dissertation related to psychology for full membership can be waived in certain circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made.

===Affiliate organizations===
American Psychological Association Services, Inc. (APASI) was formed in 2018 and is a 501(c)(6) entity, which engages in advocacy on behalf of psychologists from all areas of psychology. Its predecessor was the American Psychological Association Practice Organization (APAPO). APASI contains the Psychology Political Action Committee (PAC), which engages in lobbying on behalf of psychologists at the federal level.

===The Psychologically Healthy Workplace program===
The Psychologically Healthy Workplace Program (PHWP) is a collaborative effort between the American Psychological Association and the APA Practice Organization designed to help employers optimize employee well-being and organizational performance. The PHWP includes APA&#x27;s Psychologically Healthy Workplace Awards, a variety of APA Practice Organization resources, including PHWP Web content, e-newsletter, podcast and blog, and support of local programs currently implemented by 52 state, provincial and territorial psychological associations as a mechanism for driving grassroots change in local business communities. The awards are designed to recognize organizations for their efforts to foster employee health and well-being while enhancing organizational performance. The award program highlights a variety of workplaces, large and small, profit and non-profit, in diverse geographical settings. Applicants are evaluated on their efforts in the following five areas: employee involvement, work-life balance, employee growth and development, health and safety, and employee recognition. Awards are given at the local and national level.

===APA style===

American Psychological Association (APA) style is a set of rules developed to assist reading comprehension in the social and behavioral sciences. Used to ensure clarity of communication, the layout is designed to &quot;move the idea forward with a minimum of distraction and a maximum of precision.&quot; The &quot;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association&quot; contains the rules for every aspect of writing, especially in the social sciences from determining authorship to constructing a table to avoiding plagiarism and constructing accurate reference citations. &quot;The General Format of APA is most commonly used to cite sources within the social sciences. General guidelines for a paper in APA style includes: typed, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) with 1&quot; margins on all sides. The font should be clear and highly readable. APA recommends using 12 pt. Times New Roman font.&quot; The seventh edition of the &quot;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association&quot; was published in October 2019.

===Databases===
APA maintains a number of databases, including PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycBOOKS, PsycEXTRA, PsycCRITIQUES, PsycTESTS, and PsycTHERAPY. APA also operates a comprehensive search platform, PsycNET, covering multiple databases.

PsycINFO is a bibliographic database that contains citations and summaries dating from the 19th century, including journal articles, book chapters, books, technical reports, and dissertations within the field of psychology. , PsycINFO has collected information from 2,457 journals.

==History==

===Founding===
The APA was founded in July 1892 at Clark University by a small group of around 30 men; by 1916 there were over 300 members. The first president was G. Stanley Hall. During World War II, the APA merged with other psychological organizations, resulting in a new divisional structure. Nineteen divisions were approved in 1944; the divisions with the most members were the clinical and personnel (now counseling) divisions. From 1960 to 2007, the number of divisions expanded to 54. Today the APA is affiliated with 60 state, territorial, and Canadian provincial associations.

===Dominance of clinical psychology===
Due to the dominance of clinical psychology in APA, several research-focused groups have broken away from the organization. These include the Psychonomic Society in 1959 (with a primarily cognitive orientation), and the Association for Psychological Science (which changed its name from the American Psychological Society in early 2006) in 1988 (with a broad focus on the science and research of psychology). Theodore H. Blau was the first clinician in independent practice to be elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1977.

== Sexual orientation and gender identity ==

===Cause of sexual orientation===

The APA states the following:

In 1975, APA issued a supporting statement that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.

===Conversion therapy===

Conversion therapy, also called reparative therapy, is the practice of attempting to change the patient&#x27;s sexual orientation to heterosexual. The American Psychological Association (APA) task force report on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation concluded that conversion therapy was &quot;unlikely to be successful&quot; and involved &quot;some risk of harm&quot;. In the task force&#x27;s report, the APA recommends that therapists adopt an affirmative, supportive approach for clients who present for therapy to change their sexual orientation rather than attempting to convert their sexual orientation.

The APA adopted a resolution in August 2009 stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments. The approval, by APA&#x27;s governing Council of Representatives, came at APA&#x27;s annual convention, during which a task force presented a report that in part examined the efficacy of so-called &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, or sexual orientation change efforts.

The &quot;Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts&quot; also advises that parents, guardians, young people, and their families avoid sexual orientation treatments that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and instead seek psychotherapy, social support, and educational services &quot;that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth.&quot;

=== Same-sex marriage ===

The APA adopted a resolution stating that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant rights, benefits, and privileges. It also filed an amicus brief in the federal court case in which Judge Vaughn Walker struck down California&#x27;s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The APA later praised the decision and denied the existence of any &quot;scientific justification&quot; for a ban on same-sex marriage.

In August 2011, the APA clarified their support of same-sex marriage in light of continued research suggesting that the same community benefits accepted as result of heterosexual marriage apply to same-sex couples as well. Clinton Anderson, then associate executive director of the APA and director of the Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns, said that, prior to this research, &quot;We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways, but we didn&#x27;t know if that would be true for same-sex couples.&quot; Anderson also put forward the APA&#x27;s view that merely allowing same-sex civil unions is an inadequate option: &quot;Anything other than marriage is, in essence, a stigmatization of same-sex couples. Stigma does have negative impacts on people.&quot;

=== Sex assignment ===

In 2024, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and physicist Alan Sokal co-authored an op-ed in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; criticizing the use of the terminology &quot;sex assigned at birth&quot; instead of &quot;sex&quot; by the APA, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dawkins and Sokal argued that sex is an &quot;objective biological reality&quot; that &quot;is determined at conception and is then &quot;observed&quot; at birth,&quot; rather than assigned by a medical professional. Calling this &quot;social constructionism gone amok,&quot; Dawkins and Sokal argued that &quot;distort[ing] the scientific facts in the service of a social cause&quot; risks undermining trust in medical institutions.

==APA internship crisis for graduate students==
The APA is the main accrediting body for U.S. clinical and counseling psychology doctoral training programs and internship sites. APA-accredited clinical psychology PhD and PsyD programs typically require students to complete a one-year, full-time clinical internship in order to graduate (or a two-year, part-time internship). However, there is currently an &quot;internship crisis&quot; as defined by the American Psychological Association, in that approximately 25% of clinical psychology doctoral students do not match for internship each year. This crisis has led many students (approximately 1,000 each year) to re-apply for internship, thus delaying graduation, or to complete an unaccredited internship, and often has many emotional and financial consequences. Students who do not complete an APA-accredited internship in the U.S. are barred from certain employment settings, including VA hospitals, the military, and cannot get licensed in some states, such as Utah and Mississippi. Additionally, some postdoctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer an APA-accredited internship. The APA has been criticized for not addressing this crisis adequately and many psychologists and graduate students have petitioned for the APA to take action by regulating graduate training programs.

== Warfare and the use of torture ==
A year after the establishment of the Human Resources Research Organization by the U.S. military in 1951, the CIA began funding numerous psychologists (and other scientists) in the development of psychological warfare methods under the supervision of APA treasurer Meredith Crawford. Donald O. Hebb, the APA president in 1960 who was awarded the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, defended the torture of research subjects, arguing that what was being studied was other nations&#x27; methods of brainwashing. Former APA president Martin Seligman spoke upon the invitation of the CIA on his animal experimentation where he shocked a dog unpredictably and repeatedly into total, helpless passivity. Former APA president Ronald F. Levant, upon visiting Guantanamo Bay, affirmed that psychologists were present during the torture of prisoners, arguing that their presence was to &quot;add value and safeguards&quot; to interrogations. Former APA president Gerald Koocher argued, referring to allegations of continuing systemic abuse by psychologists, that such allegations were originating from &quot;opportunistic commentators masquerading as scholars.&quot;

During the Iraq War, Amnesty International released a series of reports, calling attention to violations of the human rights of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison and American detention camps, and the role of the United States and the United Kingdom in enacting these abuses. The reports called on the occupying powers to protect the human rights of any detained civilians by giving them a fair and timely trial, not detaining civilians arbitrarily, and treating all people ethically while in detention. Amnesty International also called for justice, by trying individual perpetrators of abuse for their crimes.

Despite these reports, the Bush administration instituted &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques, stating publicly that reported abuses were isolated incidents, and not standard practice. Internal memos from the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed that an executive order by George W. Bush had sanctioned certain interrogation techniques, such as playing loud music, depriving prisoners of sleep, and stripping prisoners of their clothing.

The CIA reportedly required involvement from health professionals to continue its practice of &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogations on detainees, to maintain the lawfulness of their practices. Psychiatrists and medical doctors were reluctant to participate in interrogations, however some psychologists participated. A report by a group of psychologists alleges the same, implicating a number of APA officials as well.

When it emerged that psychologists, as part of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, were advising interrogators in Guantánamo and other U.S. facilities on improving the effectiveness of the &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, the APA called on the U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques and labeled specific techniques as torture. Critics pointed out that the APA declined to advise its members not to participate in such interrogations. In September 2008, the APA&#x27;s members passed a resolution stating that psychologists may not work in settings where &quot;persons are held outside, or in violation of, either international law (e.g., the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions) or the U.S. Constitution (where appropriate), unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights.&quot; The resolution became official APA policy in February 2009. However, the APA has refused to sanction those members known to have participated in and, in some cases, designed abusive interrogation techniques used in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan interrogation centers.

The APA directive was in contrast to the American Psychiatric Association ban in May 2006 of all direct participation in interrogations by psychiatrists, and the American Medical Association ban in June 2006 of the direct participation in interrogations by physicians. An independent panel of medical, military, ethics, education, public health, and legal professionals issued a comprehensive report in November 2013 that &quot;charged that U.S. military and intelligence agencies directed doctors and psychologists working in U.S. military detention centers to violate standard ethical principles and medical standards to avoid infliction of harm.&quot; One group of psychologists in particular, the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, has been very harsh in its criticism of the APA stance on its refusal to categorically prohibit members from participating in any phase of military interrogations. They stated their continuing disagreement with APA leadership in an open letter posted on their website on October 31, 2012, in which they reiterated their condemnation of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques, and called for the APA to require its members to refuse participation in military conducted interrogations of any kind.

After the abuses were made public, the APA created a task force called Psychological Ethics and National Security (PENS) and released a report stating that the APA Code of Ethics applies to psychologists working in any setting, and that psychologists do not facilitate or participate in any degrading or cruel behavior, referring back to the APA&#x27;s 1986 Resolution Against Torture. The report also called on psychologists to report any suspected or observed inhumane treatment to the appropriate authorities and obey federal law.

===Amending the Ethics Code===
In February 2010, the APA&#x27;s Council of Representatives voted to amend the association&#x27;s Ethics Code to make clear that its standards can never be interpreted to justify or defend violating human rights. There is a history of similar issues with the Canadian Psychological Association. Following are the two relevant ethical standards from the APA Ethics Code, with the amended language shown in bold:

In its 2013 &quot;&quot;Policy Related to Psychologists&#x27; Work in National Security Settings and Reaffirmation of the APA Position Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,&quot; the APA condemns the use of any of the following practices by military interrogators trying to elicit anti-terrorism information from detainees, on the ground that &quot;there are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether induced by a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, that may be invoked as a justification.&quot;

=== Hoffman report ===
In November 2014, the APA ordered an independent review into whether it cooperated with the government&#x27;s use of torture of prisoners during the George W. Bush administration, naming Chicago attorney David H. Hoffman to conduct the review. On July 2, 2015, a 542-page report was issued to the special committee of the board of directors of the APA relating to ethics guidelines, national security interrogations, and torture. The report concluded that the APA secretly collaborated with the Bush administration to bolster a legal and ethical justification for the torture of prisoners. Furthermore, the report stated that the association&#x27;s ethics director Stephen Behnke and others had &quot;colluded with important Department of Defense officials to have the APA issue loose, high-level ethical guidelines that did not constrain&quot; the interrogation of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The association&#x27;s &quot;principal motive in doing so was to align APA and curry favor with DOD.&quot; An APA official said that ethics director Stephen Behnke had been &quot;removed from his position as a result of the report&quot; and indicated that other firings or sanctions might follow.

Ultimately, the findings of the Hoffman Report revealed that the APA had an unfair bias towards prisoners due to the organization&#x27;s relationship with the federal government. This resulted in a tidal wave of consequences for the APA. On July 14, 2015, the APA announced the retirement of its CEO, Norman B. Anderson, effective the end of 2015, and of Deputy Chief Executive Officer Michael Honaker, effective August 15, 2015, and the resignation of Rhea K. Farberman, APA&#x27;s executive director for public and member communication. Anderson had been CEO since 2003.

===Ban on involvement===
For at least a decade, dissident psychologists within and outside the APA, including the group WithholdAPAdues, had protested the involvement of psychologists &quot;in interrogations at CIA black sites and Guantánamo.&quot; Prior to the release of the Hoffman report, which undermined the APA&#x27;s repeated denials and showed that some APA leaders were complicit in torture, the dissidents were ignored or ridiculed.

On August 7, 2015, just weeks following the release of the Hoffman report, the APA council of representatives met at the association&#x27;s 123rd annual convention in Toronto, Ontario. At that meeting, the APA council passed Resolution 23B, which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside international law, and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations. With 156 votes in favor and only one vote against, the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members. The adoption of Resolution 23B aligned the APA&#x27;s policy with that of the American Psychiatric Association and that of the American Medical Association by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The ban will not &quot;prohibit psychologists from working with the police or prisons in criminal law enforcement interrogations&quot;.

==Class action lawsuit by members claiming deceptive dues assessments==
In 2013 a class action lawsuit was brought against APA on behalf of approximately 60,000 of its 122,000 members who were licensed clinicians. Those members paid an additional $140 practice assessment fee as part of their membership dues every year beginning in 2001 to fund the lobbying arm of APA, the APA Practice Organization (APAPO). The lawsuit accused APA of using deceptive means by representing that the assessment was mandatory for APA membership even though payment of the assessment was only required for membership in the APAPO. In 2015 APA settled the case by establishing a $9.02 million settlement fund to be used to pay claims made by members of APA who paid the practice assessment, as well as attorneys&#x27; fees and certain other costs. APA agreed to change its policies to make clear that the APAPO membership dues are not required for membership in APA.

==Animal research==

Currently, the APA enforces ethical standards to protect nonhuman animal subjects from unnecessary harm during the research process. Some of the requirements for using nonhuman animals in research include: proper justification of the research, maintenance and inspection of appropriate housing for the animals, minimizing discomfort and stress whenever possible, and preference of noninvasive measures.

Despite these guidelines, however, many advocacy groups exist to either reduce or eliminate animal research, arguing that it is unethical to capture animals and subject them to research procedures.

==Evidence-based practice==
A current controversy among mental health professionals involves the use of the terms evidence based practice or evidence based treatment. Proponents of the evidence-based treatments movement argue that it is unethical to administer a therapeutic intervention with questionable research support when another treatment&#x27;s effectiveness has been demonstrated for the client&#x27;s condition, particularly when the intervention in question is potentially harmful (such as conversion therapy). Proponents argue that administration of an empirically questionable treatment violates the general Principle A of the ethical principles of psychologist: Beneficence and nonmaleficence (or &quot;do no harm&quot;).

Critics of the evidence-based practice movement note ethical concerns regarding the research and practice of evidenced-based treatments themselves. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of a range of treatments, including psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies, evidence-based practice is a term now associated only with short-term, manualized treatments which have been evaluated in randomized control trials. However, focusing only on randomized control trials is problematic when determining treatment efficacy. Among problems associated with this approach, one issue is that such trials are conducted on highly select patient populations. Thus, the relevance of these trials is unclear because real-world patients might differ from patients in such trials.. Furthermore, while the public may assume evidence-based is synonymous for &quot;likely to help&quot;, research studies indicate that most patients do not show meaningful improvement in so-called evidence-based treatments.

<text>Project MKUltra was a human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture. The term MKUltra is a CIA cryptonym: &quot;MK&quot; is an arbitrary prefix standing for the Office of Technical Service and &quot;Ultra&quot; is an arbitrary word out of a dictionary used to name this project. The program has been widely condemned as a violation of individual rights and an example of the CIA’s abuse of power, with critics highlighting its disregard for consent and its corrosive impact on democratic principles.

Project MKUltra began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects&#x27; mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals without the subjects&#x27; consent. Additionally, other methods beyond chemical compounds were used, including electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and other forms of torture.

Project MKUltra was preceded by Project Artichoke. It was organized through the CIA&#x27;s Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. The program engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects. MKUltra&#x27;s scope was broad, with activities carried out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions aside from the military, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA&#x27;s involvement.

Project MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee (named after Senator Frank Church) of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford&#x27;s United States President&#x27;s Commission on CIA Activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms&#x27;s order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms&#x27;s order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings. Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in 2001.

==Background==
===Origin of the project===
During the early 1940s, Nazi scientists working in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau during World War II conducted interrogation experiments on human subjects. Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, and other nationalities&#x27; prisoners of war. The aim of these experiments was to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, &quot;eliminate the will of the person examined&quot;. American historian Stephen Kinzer said that the CIA project was a continuation of these earlier Nazi experiments, as evidenced by MKUltra&#x27;s use of mescaline on unwitting subjects, which had previously been done by Nazi scientists in Dachau.

American interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a &quot;truth drug&quot; that would produce &quot;uninhibited truthfulness&quot; in an interrogated person. In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of LSD on human subjects.

In 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of general Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving human subjects, beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird, officially renamed Project Artichoke on August 20, 1951. Directed and overseen by Brigadier General Paul F. Gaynor, the objective of Artichoke was to determine whether an individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination. Morphine, mescaline and LSD were all administered on unknowing CIA agents in an attempt to produce amnesia in the subjects. In addition, Project Artichoke aimed to employ certain viruses such as dengue fever as potential incapacitating agents.

===Aims and leadership===
The project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953. Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with such techniques, devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects&#x27; knowledge or consent. In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.

The project attempted to produce a perfect truth serum for interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War and to explore other possibilities of mind control. Subproject 54 was the Navy&#x27;s top-secret &quot;Perfect Concussion&quot; program, which was supposed to use sub-aural frequency blasts to erase memory; the program was never carried out.

Most MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director Richard Helms, so it has been difficult for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 funded research subprojects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.

The project began during a period of what English journalist Rupert Cornwell described as &quot;paranoia&quot; at the CIA, when the U.S. had lost its nuclear monopoly and fear of communism was at its height. CIA counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels. The agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control the mind and enhance its ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation. Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot;-style subject. American historian Alfred W. McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of &quot;ridiculous&quot; programs so that the public would not look at the research&#x27;s primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation.

===Applications===
The 1976 Church Committee report found that, in the MKDELTA program, &quot;Drugs were used primarily as an aid to interrogations, but MKULTRA/MKDELTA materials were also used for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.&quot;

===Other related projects===
In 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971. The project was a joint project between the U.S. Army Chemical Corps and the CIA&#x27;s Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents. Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.

By March 1971, over 26,000 potential agents had been acquired for future screening. The CIA was interested in bird migration patterns for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) research; subproject 139 designated &quot;Bird Disease Studies&quot; at Pennsylvania State University. MKOFTEN was to deal with testing and toxicological transmissivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. MKCHICKWIT was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in Europe and Asia, and with acquiring samples.

In January 1957, the CIA started a subproject of MKUltra in effort to broaden their scientific research. &quot;Subproject 68&quot;, conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal under the direction of psychiatrist Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, represents one of the most infamous and ethically controversial endeavors within the MKUltra program. This subproject aimed to explore innovative techniques for manipulating and controlling human behavior, particularly through the methods of &quot;psychic driving&quot; and &quot;depatterning&quot;. Psychic driving involved subjecting patients to continuous playback of recorded messages, often with themes of self-improvement or identity reinforcement, while they were under the influence of powerful psychoactive substances such as LSD or barbiturates.

==Experiments on Americans==
CIA documents suggest that they investigated &quot;chemical, biological, and radiological&quot; methods of mind control as part of MKUltra. They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation.

During a hearing by the Senate Health Subcommittee, a testimony by the Deputy Director of the CIA stated that over 30 institutions and universities were involved in the experimentation program of testing drugs on unknowing citizens &quot;at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign.&quot; Several of these tests involved the issuing of LSD to unaware subjects in social situations.

The Army was subject to the testing of LSD which occurred in three phases. The first phase included over 1,000 American soldiers who willingly volunteered for testing of chemical warfare experiments. Phase two had 96 volunteers who were induced with LSD in evaluation of the possibility of intelligence uses of the drug. The third phase included Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT which conducted experiments on 16 unwitting nonvolunteer subjects that after receiving LSD were interrogated as a part of operation field tests.

After retiring in 1972, Gottlieb dismissed his entire effort for the CIA&#x27;s MKUltra program as useless. Files discovered in 1977 containing 700 pages of new information showed that experiments had continued until Gottlieb ordered the program halted on July 10, 1972.

===LSD===
In 1938, LSD was created by Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. The early directors of MKUltra became aware of the existence of LSD and sought to use it for &quot;mind-control&quot;. In the early 1950s, MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb arranged for the CIA to buy the entire supply of LSD for $240,000, which in 2024, would be $4,227,079. This LSD supply gave Gottlieb the ability to fulfill his experiment by spreading LSD to prisons, hospitals, institutions, clinics, and foundations in order to see how citizens would react to the drug without knowing exactly what was happening to them.

Early CIA efforts focused on LSD-25, which later came to dominate many of MKUltra&#x27;s programs. The CIA wanted to know if they could make Soviet spies defect against their will and whether the Soviets could do the same to the CIA&#x27;s own operatives.

Documents obtained from the CIA by John D. Marks under Freedom of Information in 1976 showed that, in 1953, the CIA considered purchasing 10 kilograms of LSD, enough for 100 million doses. The proposed purchase aimed to stop other countries from controlling the supply. The documents showed that the CIA purchased some quantities of LSD from Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland.

Once Project MKUltra started, in April 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and prostitutes – &quot;people who could not fight back&quot;, as one agency officer put it. In one case, they administered LSD to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days. They also administered LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public to study their reactions. The aim was to find drugs that would bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject&#x27;s mind clean and program them as &quot;a robot agent&quot;. Military personnel who received the mind-altering drugs were also threatened with courts-martial if they told anyone about the experiments. LSD and other drugs were often administered &quot;without&quot; the subject&#x27;s knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code the U.S. had agreed to follow after World War II. Many veterans who were subjected to experimentation are now seeking legal and monetary reparations.

In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels within agency safehouses in San Francisco to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study. In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects they would extend their &quot;trips&quot; if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this. Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.

At the invitation of Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey volunteered to take part in what turned out to be a CIA-financed study under the aegis of MKUltra, at the Menlo Park Veterans&#x27; Hospital where he worked as a night aide. The project studied the effects of psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, AMT and DMT on people.

The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations, but Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas: he thought it could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in &quot;normal&quot; settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, such as an operative who received the drug in his morning coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, D.C., seeing a monster in every car passing him. The experiments continued even after Frank Olson, an army chemist who had never taken LSD, was covertly dosed by his CIA supervisor and nine days later plunged to his death from the window of a 13th-story New York City hotel room, supposedly as a result of deep depression induced by the drug. According to Stephen Kinzer, Olson had approached his superiors some time earlier, doubting the morality of the project, and asked to resign from the CIA.

Some subjects&#x27; participation was consensual, and in these cases they appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, seven drug-addicted African-American participants at the National Institute of Mental Health Addiction Research Center in Kentucky were given LSD for 77 consecutive days.

MKUltra&#x27;s researchers later dismissed LSD as too unpredictable in its results. They gave up on the notion that LSD was &quot;the secret that was going to unlock the universe&quot;, but it still had a place in the cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962, the CIA and the army developed a series of super-hallucinogens such as the highly touted BZ, which was thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and LSD research became less of a priority altogether.

===Other drugs===
Another technique investigated was the intravenous administration of a barbiturate into one arm and an amphetamine into the other. The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released.
Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, alcohol and sodium pentothal.

===Hypnosis===
Declassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied hypnosis in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included creating &quot;hypnotically induced anxieties&quot;, &quot;hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter&quot;, studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, &quot;hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects&quot;, and studying &quot;relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis&quot;. They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.

==Experiments on Chinese==
The CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the &quot;psychic driving&quot; concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (US$766,936 in 2024, adjusted for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there. The Montreal experiments research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA.

In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His &quot;driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute for common problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions. His treatments resulted in victims&#x27; urinary incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators were their parents.

During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of both the American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Association. Cameron was also a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946–1947.

===Motivation and assessments===
His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who was also allegedly working with MI5 and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.

In the 1980s, several of Cameron&#x27;s former patients sued the CIA for damages, which the Canadian news program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; documented. Their experiences and lawsuit were adapted in the 1998 television miniseries &quot;The Sleep Room&quot;.

Naomi Klein argues in her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; that Cameron&#x27;s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing &quot;a scientifically based system for extracting information from &#x27;resistant sources&#x27;. In other words, torture.&quot;

Alfred W. McCoy writes, &quot;Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron&#x27;s experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb&#x27;s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA&#x27;s two-stage psychological torture method&quot;, referring to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then creating a situation of &quot;self-inflicted&quot; discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate pain by capitulating.

==Secret detention camps==
In areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, West Germany and the Philippines, the CIA created secret detention centers (black sites) so that the U.S. could avoid criminal prosecution. The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed &quot;expendable&quot; to undertake various types of torture and human experimentation on them. The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds.

==Revelation==
In 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by the Watergate scandal, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms&#x27;s purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.

In December 1974, &quot;The New York Times&quot; alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. That report prompted investigations by the United States Congress, in the form of the Church Committee, and by a commission known as the Rockefeller Commission that looked into the illegal domestic activities of the CIA, the FBI and intelligence-related agencies of the military.

In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson, had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General&#x27;s office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973. However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously and had headed MKUltra, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.

The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator Frank Church, concluded that &quot;prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects.&quot; The committee noted that the &quot;experiments sponsored by these researchers[...] call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.&quot;

Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited &quot;experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject&quot; and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.
In 1977, during a hearing held by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to look further into MKUltra, Admiral Stansfield Turner, then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages, that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been incorrectly stored at a records center not usually used for such documents. These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, but much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General&#x27;s 1963 report.

On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said:

At least one death, the result of the alleged defenestration of Frank Olson, was attributed to Olson&#x27;s being subjected, without his knowledge, to such experimentation nine days before his death. The CIA itself subsequently acknowledged that these tests had little scientific rationale. The officers conducting the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.

In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a CBC news show, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded Cameron&#x27;s efforts, but also that the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. Cameron died on September 8, 1967, after suffering a heart attack while he and his son were mountain climbing. None of Cameron&#x27;s personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survived because his family destroyed them after his death.

===1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report===
The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, the Department of Defense and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

The quote from the study:

== Death of Frank Olson ==
Several known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. By 1951, Frank Olson was a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher. In 1951 academic sources attributed the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning
incident to ergot poisoning through a local bakery (which appeared to be plausible because ergot naturally contains lysergic acid, the chemical precursor to LSD).

In 1953, a few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research.&lt;br&gt;
Among Olson&#x27;s concerns were:
* the development of assassination materials used by the CIA,
* the CIA&#x27;s use of biological warfare materials in covert operations,
* experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas,
* collaboration with former Nazi scientists under Operation Paperclip,
* LSD mind control research, and
* the use of psychoactive drugs during &quot;terminal&quot; interrogations under a program code-named Project Artichoke.

In November of 1953, Olson was given LSD without his knowledge or consent as part of a CIA experiment, and died after falling from a 13th-story window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson fell to his death. In 1953, Olson&#x27;s death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA&#x27;s own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment &quot;with&quot; Olson&#x27;s prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson&#x27;s already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.

In 1975, Olson&#x27;s family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby, though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson&#x27;s ingestion of LSD.

In 1977, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Committee on Human Resources wrote:
:&quot;Given the CIA&#x27;s purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.&quot;

In 1994, Olson&#x27;s body was exhumed and cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window.&lt;br&gt;
This means the forensic evidence conflicted with the former official version of events by the CIA.&lt;br&gt;
The medical examiner termed Olson&#x27;s death a &quot;homicide&quot;.

Since 2001 (or earlier), the Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.

A 2010 book alleged:
* that the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning was part of MKDELTA,
* that Olson was involved in that event, and
* that he was eventually murdered by the CIA.

In 2012 (November 28) the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson. In 2013 (July) the case was dismissed, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.&lt;br&gt;
In the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote,
:&quot;While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family&#x27;s suit], farfetched as they may sound.&quot;

==Legal issues involving informed consent==
The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson&#x27;s family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson&#x27;s family to apologize publicly.

Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under the Feres doctrine.

In 1987, the Supreme Court affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley&#x27;s case: &quot;United States v. Stanley&quot;. The majority argued that &quot;a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.&quot; In dissent, Justice William Brennan argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of constitutional rights:

Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, writing a separate dissent, stated:

In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project&#x27;s existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent and that Ritchie&#x27;s behavior was typical of someone on LSD, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of MKUltra&#x27;s victims or that LSD caused his robbery attempt, and dismissed the case in 2005.

==Notable people==
===Documented experimenters===
Confirmed experimenters:
* Harold Alexander Abramson
* Donald Ewen Cameron
* Sidney Gottlieb
* Harris Isbell
* Martin Theodore Orne
* Louis Jolyon West
* George Hunter White
Alleged experimenters:
* Jim Jones
* Charlie Siragusa

===Documented subjects===
Confirmed subjects:

* Allen Ginsberg first took LSD in an experiment on Stanford University&#x27;s campus where he could listen to records of his choice (he chose a Gertrude Stein reading, a Tibetan mandala, and Richard Wagner). He said the experience resulted in &quot;a slight paranoia that hung on all my acid experiences through the mid-1960s until I learned from meditation how to disperse that.&quot; He became an outspoken advocate for psychedelics in the 1960s and, after hearing suspicions that the experiment was CIA-funded, wrote, &quot;Am I, Allen Ginsberg, the product of one of the CIA&#x27;s lamentable, ill-advised, or triumphantly successful experiments in mind control?&quot;
* Ken Kesey, author of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, is said to have volunteered for MKUltra experiments involving LSD and other psychedelic drugs at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park while he was a student at nearby Stanford University. Kesey&#x27;s experiences while under the influence of LSD inspired him to promote the drug outside the context of the MKUltra experiments, which influenced the early development of hippie culture.
* Harold Blauer was an American tennis player who died from injections of 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine in the New York State Psychiatric Institute, which he had voluntarily checked into due to his depression following a divorce.
* Robert Hunter was an American lyricist, singer-songwriter, translator, and poet, best known for his association with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. Along with Ken Kesey, Hunter was said to be an early volunteer MKUltra test subject at Stanford University. Stanford test subjects were paid to take LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, then report on their experiences. These experiences were creatively formative for Hunter:

Alleged subjects:

* James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger alleged he had been subjected to weekly injections of LSD and subsequent testing while in prison in Atlanta in 1957.
* Ted Kaczynski, an American domestic terrorist known as the Unabomber, was said to be a subject of a voluntary psychological study alleged by some sources to have been a part of MKUltra. As a sophomore at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a &quot;purposely brutalizing psychological experiment&quot;, led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. In total, Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.
* Sirhan Sirhan&#x27;s attorney, Lawrence Teeter, believed that Sirhan was &quot;operating under MKUltra mind control techniques&quot; when he assassinated Robert F. Kennedy.
* Charles Manson has been tied to MKULTRA by author Tom O&#x27;Neil, beginning with his time in prison, when Manson took part in drug-induced psychological experiments run by the federal government. This continued through his ongoing connection to the CIA&#x27;s Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco once out of prison in 1967.

==In popular culture==
MKUltra plays a part in many conspiracy theories due to its nature and the destruction of most records. This has also led to the urban legends that the human experiments performed by the CIA are ongoing into the present.

===Television===
* The 1998 CBC miniseries &quot;The Sleep Room&quot; dramatizes brainwashing experiments funded by MKUltra that were performed on Canadian mental patients in the 1950s and 60s, and their subsequent efforts to sue the CIA.
* In season 2, episode 5 of &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Dream Logic&quot;, Walter Bishop mentions his participation in MKUltra experiments, using LSD and suggestion.
* In season 2, episode 19 of &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Spaceman in a Crater&quot;, Jack Hodgins mentions that Frank Olson was an unwitting participant and committed suicide, but that an exhumation 45 years later proved he was murdered.
* &quot;Wormwood&quot; is a 2017 American six-part docudrama miniseries directed by Errol Morris and released on Netflix. The series is based on the life of the scientist Frank Olson and his involvement in Project MKUltra.
* The Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; is largely based on the MKUltra experiments and the subsequent US government cover-ups. The main character, Eleven, is a child of an MKUltra test subject and is the last child to survive the massacre of the facility in 1979. Contrary to popular belief from urban legends, while MKUltra did in fact experiment on children, the project was halted in 1973.

===Film===
* The 2009 film &quot;The Killing Room&quot; is a thriller based on the real life MKUltra top secret government psychological program in which various volunteer test subjects are put in a tense situation.

===Music===
* English band Muse&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;The Resistance&quot; features a song titled &quot;MK Ultra&quot;, which references brainwashing techniques utilised by the CIA in the eponymous project.
* Will Wood&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;The Normal Album&quot; features a song titled &quot;BlackBoxWarrior - OKULTRA&quot;, which describes the experience of an MKUltra victim.
* The Glasgow-based band Mickey 9s have a song called &quot;MK Ultra&quot; in their 2021 album &quot;Modern Kunst&quot;.
* Periphery&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;&quot; has a song titled &quot;MK Ultra&quot;.
* The title of Machine Girl&#x27;s 2024 album, &quot;MG Ultra&quot;, is a reference to MKUltra. Along with this, the album has themes of conspiracy theory and government masking issues throughout.
* Punk band Negative XP has four albums inspired by MK Ultra, titled &quot;Mkultra Support Group, Vol. 1-4,&quot; and the song &quot;MKULTRA Victim&quot; is directly inspired by the project.

===Literature===

* The sixth and final volume of John Burdett&#x27;s Bangkok detective novel series, &quot;The Bangkok Asset&quot;, features MKUltra as a major theme. The novel expands the impacts of the program to ultimately include the creation of super soldier-spies with &quot;transhuman abilities&quot;.

===Games===

* The 2013 video game Outlast makes explicit references to MK-Ultra, with the games antagonists being mental patients driven insane by mind control experiments.
* The main protagonist of the 2020 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot;, &quot;Bell&quot;, is a victim of MKUltra and has been brainwashed into believing they served in the Vietnam War.
* The video game Visage from 2020 is heavily inspired by the project MKUltra, as it&#x27;s main character Dwayne Anderson is a scientist who worked on spiking the drinking water with psychedelic drugs. The game also features the views of the projects victims, displaying hallucinations through paranormal events.

<text>Margaret Thaler Singer (July 29, 1921 – November 23, 2003) was an American clinical psychologist and researcher with her colleague Lyman Wynne on family communication. She was a prominent figure in the study of undue influence in social and religious contexts, and a proponent of the brainwashing theory of cults.

Singer&#x27;s main areas of research included schizophrenia, family therapy, brainwashing and coercive persuasion. In the 1960s, she began to study the nature of social and religious group influence and brainwashing, and sat as a board member of the American Family Foundation and as an advisory board member of the Cult Awareness Network. She was the co-author of the book &quot;Cults in Our Midst&quot;.

== Education ==
Singer was born in Denver, Colorado, to Margaret McDonough Thaler and Raymond Willard Thaler. Her mother was a secretary to a federal judge and her father was chief operating engineer at the US Mint. While attending the University of Denver, she played cello in the Denver Civic Symphony. She received her Bachelor of Arts in speech and a Master of Science in speech pathology and special education from the University of Denver. Singer received her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in clinical psychology from the University of Denver in 1943.

== Career ==
After obtaining her PhD in clinical psychology, Singer worked at the University of Colorado&#x27;s School of Medicine&#x27;s department of psychiatry for eight years. In 1953, she started working at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she specialized in studying the returned prisoners of war who had been brainwashed by their captors into denouncing the United States and supporting North Korea and China.

In the scientific community, Singer was best known and respected for her studies in schizophrenia and family therapy. She conducted research with the National Institute of Mental Health, the United States Air Force, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Singer was a guest lecturer of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, from 1964 to 1991, and she served as a faculty member and lecturer at other University of California campuses as well as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of Rochester, and other institutions.

Singer&#x27;s work on family communication won her a place as one of the pioneers in the developing field of family therapy. As noted in one obituary, her collaboration with Lyman Wynne was particularly important. 

Singer began to study brainwashing in the 1950s at Walter Reed in Washington, DC, where she interviewed United States soldiers who had been taken prisoner during the Korean War. Beginning in the late 1960s, she expanded her studies in the field of cults and published a number of articles on mind control (&quot;psychological coercion&quot;) and similar areas. She developed theories about how cults recruit and retain members (such as her Theory of Systematic Manipulation of Social and Psychological Influence) and was on the board of many of the major anti-cult groups and organizations in the United States. At one point, Singer interviewed Charles Manson.

By the 1970s, Singer was a leading researcher in the field of psychosomatic medicine, and became the first female and first psychologist President of the American Psychosomatic Society in 1974. She also served as a member of the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute review board and the American Family Foundation board.

Singer testified as a brainwashing expert at the trial of Patty Hearst, presenting her conclusions that Hearst had been brainwashed, but outside the jury&#x27;s presence. Singer described Hearst as &quot;a low-IQ, low-affect zombie&quot; and testified that by using speech patterns, she determined that Hearst was reading statements prepared by her captors. Prosecutors argued that Singer&#x27;s testimony should not be presented to the jury because brainwashing had never before been accepted as a field of expertise upon which expert testimony could be presented. The judge decided in favor of the prosecution, and Hearst was convicted. Singer&#x27;s testimony was widely reported, which increased her reputation as a brainwashing expert.

Singer played a role in the &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot; trial of Kenneth Bianchi. Singer concluded that Bianchi had faked symptoms of multiple personality disorder, in order to escape responsibility for the murders of several women in Los Angeles. Later, she spoke about the trial on &quot;PBS Frontline&quot; in a special show entitled: &quot;The Mind of a Murderer.&quot; Singer asserted that Bianchi was a psychopath, and stated: &quot;He may simply be evil.&quot;

Her expert testimony was no longer accepted after the report of the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control, of which she was chair, was rejected by the Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) of the American Psychological Association. Melton has written that afterward, courts began to shift toward accepting the position held by the great majority of scholars studying new religious movements, moving away from the minority perspective of Singer and others sympathetic to her brainwashing claims. According to Melton, this had significant consequences later on, since it meant that brainwashing could no longer be used as a defense for the practice of deprogramming.

== DIMPAC task force controversy and aftermath ==
In the early 1980s, some American mental health professionals became well-known figures due to their involvement as expert witnesses in court cases against groups they considered to be cults. In their testimonies they presented theories of brainwashing, mind control, or coercive persuasion to support the legal positions of former group members against their former groups.

The American Psychological Association (APA) in 1983 asked Singer, who was one of the leading proponents of coercive persuasion theories, to chair a taskforce to investigate whether brainwashing or &quot;coercive persuasion&quot; did indeed play a role in recruitment by such groups. The task force was called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC). The task force completed its final report in November 1986. In May 1987 the APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC final report, stating that the report &quot;lack[ed] the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur,&quot; and also stating that the BSERP did &quot;not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.&quot;

Singer and her associate, sociologist Richard Ofshe, subsequently sued the APA, and a group of scholars and lawyers, in 1992 for &quot;defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy,&quot; and lost in 1994. In a further ruling, James R. Lambden ordered Ofshe and Singer to pay 80,000 USD in attorneys&#x27; fees under California&#x27;s SLAPP-suit law. At that time, Singer and Ofshe declared their intention to sue Michael Flomenhaft, the lawyer that represented them in the case, for malpractice.

Singer was subsequently not accepted by judges as an expert witness in four cases alleging brainwashing and mind control. After the report was rejected, Singer reworked much of the rejected material into the book &quot;Cults in Our Midst: The Hidden Menace in Our Everyday Lives&quot;, which she co-authored with Janja Lalich.

==Landmark Education legal dispute (1996)==
In 1996, Landmark Education sued Singer for defamation. Singer mentioned Landmark Education in &quot;Cults in our Midst&quot;; it was unclear whether she labeled Landmark Education as a cult or not. Singer issued a statement stating that she did not intend to call Landmark a cult, nor did she consider it a cult.

Amanda Scioscia reported in the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; that Singer never called Landmark a cult, but that she described it as a &quot;controversial new age training course&quot;. She also stated that she would not recommend the group to anyone, and would not comment on whether Landmark used coercive persuasion for fear of legal recrimination from Landmark.

== Harassment and death threat complaints ==
Singer faced harassment, including death threats and dead animals placed on her doorstep, from groups that disagreed with her views on cults. According to Richard Behar&#x27;s article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Singer was an outspoken critic of Scientology and was known to travel under an assumed name to avoid harassment.

Her criticism of cults and their brainwashing tactics resulted in harassment of Singer&#x27;s family and students as well, including breaking into Singer&#x27;s office, stealing students&#x27; term papers and sending notes to Singer&#x27;s students. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, other examples included cult operatives going through Singer&#x27;s trash and mail, picketing her lectures, hacking into her computer, and releasing live rats in her house.

<text>Mastectomy is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts, partially or completely. A mastectomy is usually carried out to treat breast cancer. In some cases, women believed to be at high risk of breast cancer choose to have the operation as a preventive measure. Alternatively, some women can choose to have a wide local excision, also known as a lumpectomy, an operation in which a small volume of breast tissue containing the tumor and a surrounding margin of healthy tissue is removed to conserve the breast. Both mastectomy and lumpectomy are referred to as &quot;local therapies&quot; for breast cancer, targeting the area of the tumor, as opposed to systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy.

The decision to perform a mastectomy to treat cancer is based on various factors, including breast size, the number of lesions, biologic aggressiveness of a breast cancer, the availability of adjuvant radiation, and the willingness of the patient to accept higher rates of tumor recurrences after lumpectomy and/or radiation. Outcome studies comparing mastectomy to lumpectomy with radiation have suggested that routine radical mastectomy surgeries will not always prevent later distant secondary tumors arising from micro-metastases prior to discovery, diagnosis, and operation. In most circumstances, there is no difference in both overall survival and breast cancer recurrence rate. While there are both medical and non-medical indications for mastectomy, the clinical guidelines and patient expectations for before and after surgery remain the same.

Mastectomies may also be carried out to transgender and non-binary people who were assigned female at birth to help lessen symptoms of gender dysphoria.

==Mastectomy indications==
===Breast cancer===
Despite the increased ability to offer breast conservation techniques to those with breast cancer, certain groups may be better served by traditional mastectomy procedures including:
* women who have already undergone radiation therapy to the affected breast
* women with 2 or more areas of cancer in the same breast that are too far apart to be removed through 1 surgical incision
* women whose initial lumpectomy along with (one or more) re-excisions has not completely removed the cancer
* women with certain serious connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma, which make them especially sensitive to the side effects of radiation therapy
* pregnant women who would require radiation while still pregnant (risking harm to the child)
* women with a tumor larger than that doesn&#x27;t shrink very much with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
* women with cancer that is large relative to their breast size
* women who have tested positive for a deleterious mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and opt for a preventive mastectomy since they are at high risk for the development of breast cancer.

===Other uses===
Mastectomy has non-cancer medical uses as well, including cosmetic or reconstructive surgery. Men with gynecomastia may be eligible for mastectomy, but minimally invasive surgical techniques also exist. Transgender men and non-binary people assigned female at birth may undergo a mastectomy as a gender-affirming surgery.

==Side effects==
Aside from the post-surgical pain and the obvious change in the shape of the chest and/or breast(s), possible side effects of a mastectomy include soreness, scar tissue at the site of the incision, short-term swelling, phantom breast pain (pain in the breast or tissue that has been removed), wound infection or bleeding, hematoma (buildup of blood in the wound), and seroma (buildup of clear fluid in the wound). If the lymph nodes are also removed, additional side effects such as lymphedema (swelling of the lymph nodes) may occur.

Upper limb problems such as shoulder and arm pain, weakness, and restricted movement are a common side effect after breast cancer surgery. According to research in the UK, an exercise programme started 7–10 days after surgery can reduce upper limb problems.

==Types==
Currently, there are several surgical approaches to mastectomy, and the type that a person decides to undergo (or whether they will decide instead to have a lumpectomy) depends on factors such as the size, location, and behavior of the tumor (if one is present), whether or not the surgery is prophylactic or preventative, and whether the person intends to undergo reconstructive surgery after the mastectomy. For trans people undergoing a gender-affirming mastectomy, the type of procedure chosen can also vary depending on the desired results, the scarring (or lack thereof), the recovery process, the person&#x27;s desire for nipple sensation, and other different factors based both on personal preference and input from medical experts.

* Simple mastectomy (or &quot;total mastectomy&quot;): In this procedure, the entire breast tissue is removed, but axillary contents are undisturbed. Sometimes the &quot;sentinel lymph node&quot;—that is, the first axillary lymph node that the metastasizing cancer cells would be expected to drain into—is removed. People who undergo a simple mastectomy can usually leave the hospital after a brief stay. Frequently, a drainage tube is inserted during surgery in their chest and attached to a small suction device to remove subcutaneous fluid. These are usually removed several days after surgery as drainage decrease to less than 20-30 ml per day. People that are more likely to have the procedure of a simple or total mastectomy are those who have large areas of ductal carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;, who are removing the breast because of the possibility of breast cancer occurring in the future (prophylactic mastectomies), or who have a mastectomy as a gender-affirming surgery. When this procedure is done on a cancerous breast, it is sometimes also done on the healthy breast to forestall the appearance of cancer there, or as a &#x27;balancing&#x27; or &#x27;symmetrizing&#x27; surgery resulting in a flat chest. The choice of this &quot;contra-lateral prophylactic&quot; option has become more typical in recent years in California, most notable in people younger than 40, climbing from just 4 percent to 33 percent from 1998 to 2011. However, the possible benefits appear to be marginal at best in the absence of genetic indicators, according to a large-scale study published in 2014. For healthy people known to be at high risk for breast cancer, this surgery is sometimes done bilaterally (on both breasts) as a cancer-preventive measure. A systematic review found that women who had both breasts removed in this circumstance were, overall, satisfied with their decision. They had fewer complications than women who had breast reconstruction but had slightly more complications than women who had one breast removed.
* Modified radical mastectomy: The entire breast tissue is removed along with the axillary contents (fatty tissue and lymph nodes). In contrast to a radical mastectomy, the pectoral muscles are spared. This type of mastectomy is used for cancer patients to examine the lymph nodes because this helps to identify whether the cancer cells have spread beyond the breasts.
* Radical mastectomy (or &quot;Halsted mastectomy&quot;): First performed in 1882, this procedure involves removing the entire breast, the axillary lymph nodes, and the pectoralis major and minor muscles behind the breast. This procedure is more disfiguring than a modified radical mastectomy and provides no survival benefit for most tumors. This operation is now reserved for tumors involving the pectoralis major muscle or recurrent breast cancer involving the chest wall. It is only recommended for breast cancer that has spread to the chest muscles. Radical mastectomies have been reserved for only those cases because they can be disfiguring and modified radical mastectomies have been proven to be just as effective.
* Skin-sparing mastectomy: In this surgery, the breast tissue is removed through a conservative incision made around the areola (the dark part surrounding the nipple). The increased amount of skin preserved as compared to traditional mastectomy resections serves to facilitate breast reconstruction procedures. People with cancers that involve the skin, such as inflammatory cancer, are not candidates for skin-sparing mastectomy. The effectiveness and safety profile of skin-sparing mastectomy procedures have also not been well studied. In a skin-sparing mastectomy, the skin flap may be perfused with fluids and indocyanine green angiography is sometimes suggested to help prevent the skin that has been saved from dying to improve reconstruction if the person wishes to do so. There is no clear evidence on the effectiveness of this approach.
*Nipple-sparing mastectomy (or &quot;subcutaneous mastectomy&quot;): Breast tissue is removed, but the nipple-areola complex is preserved. This procedure was historically done only prophylactically or with mastectomy for the benign disease over the fear of increased cancer development in retained areolar ductal tissue. Recent series suggest that it may be an oncologically sound procedure for tumors not in the subareolar position.
* Extended Radical Mastectomy: Radical mastectomy with intrapleural en bloc resection of internal mammary lymph node by sternal splitting.
* Prophylactic mastectomy: This procedure is used as a preventive measure against breast cancer. The surgery is aimed to remove all breast tissue that could potentially develop into breast cancer. The surgery is generally considered when a woman has &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; genetic mutations. The tissue from just beneath the skin to the chest wall and around the borders of the breast needs to be removed from both breasts during this procedure. Because breast cancer develops in the glandular tissue, the milk ducts and milk lobules must be removed also. Because the region is so large-ranging, from the collarbone to the lower rib margin and from the middle of the chest around the side and under the arm, it is very difficult to remove all of the tissue. This genetic mutation is a high-risk factor for the development of breast cancer, family history, or atypical lobular hyperplasia (when irregular cells line the milk lobes.) This type of procedure is said to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 100%. However, other circumstances may affect the outcome. Studies have shown that pre-menopausal women have had a higher survival rate after this procedure had been done.
===Before surgery===
Prior to undergoing the mastectomy, it is important to meet with the surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of receiving the surgery. Depending on the indication for mastectomy, there may be other options to address the clinical condition. One important consideration to discuss with the surgeon is whether breast reconstruction will occur and when this procedure will take place. One option is to have the reconstruction immediately after the mastectomy in the same surgery, whereas other patients opt for a subsequent surgery for reconstruction. This breast reconstruction surgery will be conducted by a plastic surgeon. In addition to the surgeon, a meeting with an anesthesiologist is pertinent in order to review the patient&#x27;s medical history and determine the plan of anesthesia.

Leading up to the day of the surgery, there are various considerations that patients can be cognizant of to facilitate their recovery following surgery. As with other surgeries that may lead to appreciable blood loss, it is advised not to take aspirin or aspirin-containing products for 10 days before the surgery. The reason for this is to prevent the anti-coagulative function of aspirin and other blood thinners that would make it difficult to achieve coagulation during the surgery. In addition, it is important for patients to tell the doctor about any medications, vitamins, or supplements that they are taking because some substances could interfere with the surgery. It is also pertinent for patients to not eat or drink 8 to 12 hours before surgery, however, there may be specific pre-operative instructions given by each patient&#x27;s care team.

Maintaining fitness and proper nutrition is also an important measure to consider prior to receiving a surgery because it has been shown that postoperative outcomes are improved in patients that exercise and maintain a healthy diet prior to surgery. In addition to nutrition and exercise, it is advised to reduce alcohol consumption and smoking. This concept of pre-rehabilitation is beneficial in mitigating post-operative complications and decreasing length of stay in the hospital. The rationale is that increasing a patient&#x27;s functional status prior to surgery will allow for a smoother and faster recovery in the postoperative setting.

Recent research has indicated that mammograms should not be done with any increased frequency than the normal procedure in women undergoing breast surgery, including breast augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reduction.

===After surgery===
Prior to leaving the hospital, people who have had a mastectomy will typically be given a prescription for pain medication to ameliorate any pain or discomfort at the surgery site. Recognizing signs of a surgical site infection including fever, redness, swelling, or pus is important. Any signs of infection should be reported to and assessed by a medical professional. In addition, signs of lymphedema due if lymph node removal is performed during mastectomy may be detected by the presence of heaviness, tightness, or fullness in the hand, arm, or axillary area region.

Regarding return to activity, it is advised not to engage in strenuous activity or lift objects above 5 pounds for up to six weeks after a mastectomy at the discretion of the physician. However, it is common for a member of the medical team to provide home exercises designed to maintain arm and shoulder movement and flexibility. Walking is also highly encouraged and allowed immediately after surgery. Most people who undergo a mastectomy can return to work and other regular physical activities in approximately 4 weeks after surgery.

People who have had a mastectomy will usually have a post-operative follow-up visit with their provider 1–2 weeks after surgery. The time at which a person can start to wear a bra or reconstructive breast varies and is often at the discretion of the physician.

Some people with breast cancer may require additional radiotherapy after their mastectomy procedure with the goal of reducing the risk of the cancer returning to the lymph nodes and the tissue remaining in the wall of the person&#x27;s chest. The decision by the medical team for suggesting radiotherapy may differ between individual professionals. Most teams recommend radiotherapy after a masectomy for people who are at a higher risk of cancer recurrence including those with large breast tumours (5 cm and larger) and people with cancer that has spread to multiple axillary lymph nodes (4 or more). The necessity and usefulness of radiotherapy on people at slightly lower risk, for example, the cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, is not as clear.

==Trends==
Between 2005 and 2013, the overall rate of mastectomy increased 36 percent, from 66 to 90 per 100,000 adult women. The rate of hospital-based bilateral mastectomies (inpatient and outpatient combined) more than tripled, from 9.1 to 29.7 per 100,000 adult women, whereas the rate of unilateral mastectomies remained relatively stable at around 60 per 100,000 women. From 2005 to 2013, the rate of bilateral outpatient mastectomies increased more than fivefold and the inpatient rate nearly tripled. The rate of unilateral mastectomies nearly doubled in the outpatient setting but decreased 28 percent in the inpatient setting. By 2013, nearly half of all mastectomies were performed outpatient. However, there are concerns that these rising rates of mastectomies are most greatly seen in women with node-negative and noninvasive lesions, which are subsets of patients that do not require mastectomy.

==Frequency==
Mastectomy rates vary tremendously worldwide, as was documented by the 2004 &#x27;Intergroup Exemestane Study&#x27;, an analysis of surgical techniques used in an international trial of adjuvant treatment among 4,700 females with early breast cancer in 37 countries. The mastectomy rate was highest in central and eastern Europe at 77%. The USA had the second highest rate of mastectomy with 56%, western and northern Europe averaged 46%, southern Europe 42% and Australia and New Zealand 34%.

==History==
Breast surgery was first described 3000 years ago. In the earliest stages, breast tumors were treated with simple cauterization. Later, alternating incision and cauterization with complete removal of tumors was suggested by Leonides, one of the first breast oncologic surgeons recorded in history. Other surgeons recommended excision and cauterization only if the tumor could be removed completely; otherwise, avoiding surgery was recommended. Ambrose Pare (b. 1510), a well-known surgeon from Paris who was well known for his experience treating soldiers who were injured, proposed a multi-tiered approach to breast surgery. While superficial cancers could be excised, more advanced cancers were managed through compression by lead plates to reduce blood supply to the tumor.

In the 1500s, William Fabry (b.1560), a German surgeon known as the father of German surgery, created a device that compressed and fixed the base of the breast during mastectomy, which subsequently allowed for faster excision of the breast. Another technique developed during this time to improve efficiency of breast dissection was using ligatures to achieve anterior traction. Despite the development of these techniques, there were few mastectomies actually performed at the time due to lack of qualified surgeons and the high morbidity, mortality and disfigurement associated with the surgery.

During the 1700s, large contributions in mapping lymph nodes for surgery were made by Pieter Camper (b. 1722) and Paolo Mascagni (b. 1752). Lymph node removal was advocated for in managing breast cancer. At this time, surgeries were still performed without proper aseptics and without anesthesia.

In the 19th century, Seishu Hanaoka, a Japanese surgeon, performed the first surgery in the world under general anesthesia. Many more advancements in anesthesia and aseptic technique were made during this century. William Roentgen discovered x-rays in 1895, which radically shifted breast cancer treatment from a solely surgical approach to the multi-pronged approach employed today, including imaging, hormonal therapy, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

During the 20th century, progress was made towards skin-sparing mastectomies for treatment of breast cancer. Recent literature suggests that these procedures allow for improved aesthetic outcomes while also not increasing risk for local recurrence compared to conventional mastectomies.

For example, in 1937, the Tauton State Hospital in Massachusetts reported 1 mastectomy in its operating rooms that year, listed alongside other operations including colostomy (1), enterostomy (1), herniorrhaphy (4), laparotomy (1), and circumcision (2).

<text>Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery covers a wide range of specialties, including craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. This category of surgery focuses on restoring a body part or improving its function. In contrast, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery focuses solely on improving the physical appearance of the body. A comprehensive definition of plastic surgery has never been established, because it has no distinct anatomical object and thus overlaps with practically all other surgical specialties. An essential feature of plastic surgery is that it involves the treatment of conditions that require or may require tissue relocation skills.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;plastic&quot; in &quot;plastic surgery&quot; is in reference to the concept of &quot;reshaping&quot; and comes from the Greek πλαστική (τέχνη), &quot;plastikē&quot; (&quot;tekhnē&quot;), &quot;the art of modelling&quot; of malleable flesh. This meaning in English is seen as early as 1598. In the surgical context, the word &quot;plastic&quot; first appeared in 1816 and was established in 1838 by Eduard Zeis, preceding the modern technical usage of the word as &quot;engineering material made from petroleum&quot; by 70 years.

==History==
Treatments for the plastic repair of a broken nose are first mentioned in the Egyptian medical text called the Edwin Smith papyrus. The early trauma surgery textbook was named after the American Egyptologist, Edwin Smith. Reconstructive surgery techniques were being carried out in India by 800 BC. Sushruta was a physician who made contributions to the field of plastic and cataract surgery in the 6th century BC.
The Romans also performed plastic cosmetic surgery, using simple techniques, such as repairing damaged ears, from around the 1st century BC. For religious reasons, they did not dissect either human beings or animals, thus, their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their Greek predecessors. Notwithstanding, Aulus Cornelius Celsus left some accurate anatomical descriptions, some of which—for instance, his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton—are of special interest to plastic surgery.

Arabs practiced the plastic surgery, during the Abbasid Caliphate in 750 AD. The Arabic translations made their way into Europe via intermediaries. In Italy, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi (Bologna) became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta.
All fields of surgery, the Arab physician, surgeon, and chemist Al-Zahrawi talks of the use of silk thread suture to achieve good cosmesis. He describes what is thought to be the first attempt at reduction mammaplasty for the management of gynaecomastia. He gives detailed descriptions of other basic surgical techniques such as cautery and wound management.

British physicians travelled to India to see rhinoplasties being performed by Indian methods. Reports on Indian rhinoplasty performed by a Kumhar (potter) vaidya were published in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; by 1794. Joseph Constantine Carpue spent 20 years in India studying local plastic surgery methods. Carpue was able to perform the first major surgery in the Western world in the year 1815. Instruments described in the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; were further modified in the Western world.

In 1465, Sabuncu&#x27;s book, description, and classification of hypospadias were more informative and up to date. Localization of the urethral meatus was described in detail. Sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia. In mid-15th-century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process &quot;to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it&quot; by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that such surgery became common.

In 1814, Joseph Carpue successfully performed an operative procedure on a British military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of mercury treatments. In 1818, German surgeon Carl Ferdinand von Graefe published his major work entitled &quot;Rhinoplastik&quot;. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap.

The first American plastic surgeon was John Peter Mettauer, who, in 1827, performed the first cleft palate operation with instruments that he designed himself.
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach specialized in skin transplantation and early plastic surgery. His work in rhinoplastic and maxillofacial surgery established many modern techniques of reconstructive surgery. In 1845, Dieffenbach wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty, titled &quot;Operative Chirurgie&quot;, and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose. Dieffenbach has been called the &quot;father of plastic surgery&quot;.

Another case of plastic surgery for nose reconstruction from 1884 at Bellevue Hospital was described in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

In 1891, American otorhinolaryngologist John Roe presented an example of his work: a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. In 1892, Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. In 1896, James Israel, a urological surgeon from Germany, and in 1889 George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. In 1898, Jacques Joseph, the German orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty. In 1910, Alexander Ostroumov, the Russian pharmacist, and perfume and cosmetics manufacturer, founded a unique plastic surgery department in his Moscow Institute of Medical Cosmetics. In 1928, Jacques Joseph published .

==Nascency of maxillofacial surgery==

The development of weapons such as machine guns and explosive shells during World War I created trench warfare, which led to a rapid increase in the number of mutilations to the faces and the heads of soldiers because the trenches mainly offered protection to the body. The surgeons, who were not prepared for these injuries, were even less prepared for a large number of injuries and had to react quickly and intelligently to treat the greatest number. Facial injuries were hard to treat on the front line and, because of the sanitary conditions, many infections could occur. Sometimes, some stitches were made on a jagged wound without considering the amount of flesh that had been lost, so the resulting scars were hideous and disfigured soldiers. Some of the wounded had severe injuries and the stitches were not sufficient so some became blind, or were left with gaping holes instead of their nose. Harold Gillies, scared by the number of new facial injuries and the lack of good surgical techniques, decided to dedicate an entire hospital to the reconstruction of facial injuries as fully as possible. He took into account the psychological dimension. Gillies introduced skin grafts to the treatments of soldiers, so they would be less horrified by looking at themselves in the mirror.

It is the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of facial lesions, bringing together plastic surgeons, dental surgeons, technicians, and specialized nurses, which has made it possible to develop techniques leading to the reconstruction of injured faces. Before the dentist Auguste Charles Valadier and then Gillies identified the need to advance the specialty of maxillofacial surgery which would be directly dedicated to the management of war wounds at this time. Gillies developed a new technique using rotational and transposition flaps but also bone grafts from the ribs and tibia to reconstruct facial defects caused by the weapons during the war. He experimented with this technique so he knew that he had to start by moving back healthy tissue to its normal position and then he would be able to fill with tissue from another place on the body of the soldier. One of the most successful techniques in skin grafting had the aim of not completely severing the connection to the body. It was possible by releasing and lifting a flap of skin from the wound. The flap of skin, still connected to the donor site, would then be swung over the site of the wound, allowing the maintenance of physical connection and ensuring that blood is supplied to the skin, increasing the chances of the skin graft being accepted by the body. At this time, we assisted also to improving in treating infections also meant that important injuries had become survivable mostly thanks to the new technique of Gillies. Some soldiers arrived at the hospital of Gillies without noses, chins, cheekbones, or even eyes. But for them, the most important trauma was psychological.

==Development of modern techniques==

The father of modern plastic surgery is generally considered to have been Sir Harold Gillies. A New Zealand otolaryngologist working in London, he developed many of the techniques of modern facial surgery in caring for soldiers with disfiguring facial injuries during the First World War.

During World War I, he worked as a medical minder with the Royal Army Medical Corps. After working with the French oral and maxillofacial surgeon Hippolyte Morestin on skin grafts, he persuaded the army&#x27;s chief surgeon, Arbuthnot-Lane, to establish a facial injury ward at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot, later upgraded to a new hospital for facial repairs at Sidcup in 1917. There Gillies and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery; more than 11,000 operations were performed on more than 5,000 men (mostly soldiers with facial injuries, usually from gunshot wounds). After the war, Gillies developed a private practice with Rainsford Mowlem, including many famous patients, and travelled extensively to promote his advanced techniques worldwide.

In 1930, Gillies&#x27; cousin, Archibald McIndoe, joined the practice and became committed to plastic surgery. When World War II broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the armed forces, and Gillies and his team were split up. Gillies himself was sent to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke, which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and who now has a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek retractor) went to Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Roehampton; and Mowlem went to St Albans. McIndoe, consultant to the RAF, moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burns, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel.

McIndoe is often recognized for not only developing new techniques for treating badly burned faces and hands but also for recognising the importance of the rehabilitation of the casualties and particularly of social reintegration back into normal life. He disposed of the &quot;convalescent uniforms&quot; and let the patients use their service uniforms instead. With the help of two friends, Neville and Elaine Blond, he also convinced the locals to support the patients and invite them to their homes. McIndoe kept referring to them as &quot;his boys&quot; and the staff called him &quot;The Boss&quot; or &quot;The Maestro&quot;.

His other important work included the development of the walking-stalk skin graft, and the discovery that immersion in saline promoted healing as well as improving survival rates for patients with extensive burns—this was a serendipitous discovery drawn from observation of differential healing rates in pilots who had come down on land and in the sea. His radical, experimental treatments led to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital, Sussex. Among the better-known members of his &quot;club&quot; were Richard Hillary, Bill Foxley and Jimmy Edwards.

==Sub-specialties==
Plastic surgery is a broad field, and may be subdivided further. In the United States, plastic surgeons are board certified by American Board of Plastic Surgery. Subdisciplines of plastic surgery may include:

===Aesthetic surgery===
Aesthetic surgery is a central component of plastic surgery and includes facial and body aesthetic surgery. Plastic surgeons use cosmetic surgical principles in all reconstructive surgical procedures as well as isolated operations to improve overall appearance.

===Burn surgery===
Burn surgery generally takes place in two phases. Acute burn surgery is the treatment immediately after a burn. Reconstructive burn surgery takes place after the burn wounds have healed.

===Craniofacial surgery===

Craniofacial surgery is divided into pediatric and adult craniofacial surgery. Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, microtia, craniosynostosis, and pediatric fractures. Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with reconstructive surgeries after trauma or cancer and revision surgeries along with orthognathic surgery and facial feminization surgery. Craniofacial surgery is an important part of all plastic surgery training programs. Further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship. Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by maxillofacial surgeons.

===Ethnic plastic surgery===

Ethnic plastic surgery is plastic surgery performed to change ethnic attributes, often considered used as a way of &quot;passing&quot;.

===Hand surgery===

Hand surgery is concerned with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). Hand surgery is an important part of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery on women&#x27;s hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.

===Microsurgery===

Microsurgery is generally concerned with the reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels. Popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction, head and neck reconstruction, hand surgery/replantation, and brachial plexus surgery.

===Pediatric plastic surgery===

Children often face medical issues very different from the experiences of an adult patient. Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies, Syndactyly (webbing of the fingers and toes), Polydactyly (excess fingers and toes at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.

===Prison plastic surgery===
 Plastic surgery performed on an incarcerated population in order to affect their recidivism rate, a practice instituted in the early 20th century that lasted until the mid-1990s. Separate from surgery performed for medical need.

==Techniques and procedures==
In plastic surgery, the transfer of skin tissue (skin grafting) is a very common procedure. Skin grafts can be derived from the recipient or donors:
* Autografts are taken from the recipient. If absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be cultured sheets of epithelial cells &quot;in vitro&quot; or synthetic compounds, such as integra, which consists of silicone and bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans.
* Allografts are taken from a donor of the same species. Kidney transplants are an example of allograft transfer. Joseph Murray is credited for completing the first successful kidney transplantation in 1954.
* Xenografts are taken from a donor of a different species.

Usually, good results would be expected from plastic surgery that emphasize careful planning of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of wound closure, use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.

==Cosmetic surgery procedures==


Cosmetic surgery is a voluntary or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person&#x27;s appearance or removing signs of aging. Some cosmetic surgeries such as breast reduction are also functional and can help to relieve symptoms of discomfort such as back ache or neck ache. Cosmetic surgeries are also undertaken following breast cancer and mastectomy to recreate the natural breast shape which has been lost during the process of removing the cancer. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. 15.6 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2020, with the five most common surgeries being rhinoplasties, blepharoplasties, rhytidectomies, liposuctions, and breast augmentation. Breast augmentation continues to be one of the top 5 cosmetic surgical procedures and has been since 2006. Silicone implants were used in 84% and saline implants in 16% of all breast augmentations in 2020. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looked at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures were surgical, such as rhinoplasties or rhytidectomies. The nonsurgical procedures included botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical (p. 5). They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people (p. 12).

In 1949, 15,000 Americans underwent cosmetic surgery procedures and by 1969 this number rose to almost half a million people. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that more than 333,000 cosmetic procedures were performed on patients 18 years of age or younger in the US in 2005 compared to approx. 14,000 in 1996. In 2018, more than 226,994 patients between the ages of 13 and 19 underwent plastic surgery compared to just over 218,900 patients in the same age group in 2010. Concerns about young people undergoing plastic surgery include the financial burden of additional surgical procedures needed to correct problems after the initial cosmetic surgery, long-term health complications from plastic surgery, and unaddressed mental health issues that may have led to surgery. The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses racial and ethnic lines in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. In Asia, cosmetic surgery has become more popular, and countries such as China and India have become Asia&#x27;s biggest cosmetic surgery markets. South Korea is also rising in popularity in Asian and Western countries due to their expertise in facial bone surgeries (see cosmetic surgery in South Korea).

Plastic surgery is increasing slowly, rising 115% from 2000 to 2015. &quot;According to the annual plastic surgery procedural statistics, there were 15.9 million surgical and minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the United States in 2015, a 2 percent increase over 2014.&quot; A study from 2021 found that requests for cosmetic procedures had increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly due to the increase in videoconferencing; cited estimates include a 10% increase in the United States and a 20% increase in France.

The most popular aesthetic/cosmetic procedures include:
* Abdominoplasty (&quot;tummy tuck&quot;): reshaping and firming of the abdomen
* Blepharoplasty (&quot;eyelid surgery&quot;): reshaping of upper/lower eyelids including Asian blepharoplasty
** While blepharoplasty remains the most common procedure for modifying eyelid shape, non-surgical alternatives are increasingly sought after, especially in East Asia. 
** Methods such as double eyelid tape, eyelid glue, and structured eyelid training systems allow individuals to temporarily or semi-permanently create a double eyelid crease without surgery. Some of these products, such as D-UP Eyelid Tape, AB Mezical, and Optifold, use mechanical reinforcement to encourage crease retention over time. 
** Unlike traditional adhesive-based tapes, structured eyelid training tapes aim to replicate mechanotransduction—a biological process where skin tension encourages crease formation. Studies on long-term non-surgical crease retention remain limited, but anecdotal evidence suggests some users achieve lasting results after sustained use.

* Phalloplasty (&quot;penile surgery&quot;): construction (or reconstruction) of a penis or, sometimes, artificial modification of the penis by surgery, often for cosmetic purposes
* Mammoplasty:
** Breast augmentations (&quot;breast implant&quot; or &quot;boob job&quot;): augmentation of the breasts by means of fat grafting, saline, or silicone gel prosthetics, which was initially performed for women with micromastia
** Reduction mammoplasty (&quot;breast reduction&quot;): removal of skin and glandular tissue, which is done to reduce back and shoulder pain in women with gigantomastia and for men with gynecomastia
** Mastopexy (&quot;breast lift&quot;): Lifting or reshaping of breasts to make them less saggy, often after weight loss (after a pregnancy, for example). It involves removal of breast skin as opposed to glandular tissue
*** Augmentation mastopexy (&quot;breast lift with breast implants&quot;): Lifting breasts to make them less saggy, repositioning the nipple to a higher location, and increasing breast size with saline or silicone gel implants. Recent studies of a newer technique for simultaneous augmentation mastopexy (SAM) indicate that it is a safe surgical procedure with minimal medical complications. The SAM technique involves invaginating and tacking the tissues first, in order to previsualize the result, before making any surgical incisions to the breast.
* Buttock augmentation (&quot;butt implant&quot;): enhancement of the buttocks using silicone implants or fat grafting (&quot;Brazilian butt lift&quot;) where fat is transferred from other areas of the body
* Cryolipolysis: refers to a medical device used to destroy fat cells. Its principle relies on controlled cooling for non-invasive local reduction of fat deposits to reshape body contours.
* Cryoneuromodulation: Treatment of superficial and subcutaneous tissue structures using gaseous nitrous oxide, including temporary wrinkle reduction, temporary pain reduction, treatment of dermatologic conditions, and focal cryo-treatment of tissue
* Calf augmentation: done by silicone implants or fat transfer to add bulk to calf muscles
* Labiaplasty: surgical reduction and reshaping of the labia
* Lip augmentation: alter the appearance of the lips by increasing their fullness through surgical enlargement with lip implants or nonsurgical enhancement with injectable fillers
* Cheiloplasty: surgical reconstruction of the lip
* Rhinoplasty (&quot;nose job&quot;): reshaping of the nose sometimes used to correct breathing impaired by structural defects.
* Otoplasty (&quot;ear surgery&quot;/&quot;ear pinning&quot;): reshaping of the ear, most often done by pinning the protruding ear closer to the head.
* Rhytidectomy (&quot;face lift&quot;): removal of wrinkles and signs of aging from the face
** Neck lift: tightening of lax tissues in the neck. This procedure is often combined with a facelift for lower face rejuvenation.
** Browplasty (&quot;brow lift&quot; or &quot;forehead lift&quot;): elevates eyebrows, smooths forehead skin
** Midface lift (&quot;cheek lift&quot;): tightening of the cheeks
* Genioplasty: augmentation of the chin with an individual&#x27;s bones or with the use of an implant, usually silicone, by suture of the soft tissue 
** Mentoplasty: surgery to the chin. This can involve either enhancing or reducing the size of the chin. Enhancements are achieved with the use of facial implants. Reduction of the chin involved reducing the size of the chin bone.
* Cheek augmentation (&quot;cheek implant&quot;): implants to the cheek
* Orthognathic surgery: altering the upper and lower jaw bones (through osteotomy) to correct jaw alignment issues and correct the teeth alignment
* Fillers injections: collagen, fat, and other tissue filler injections, such as hyaluronic acid
* Brachioplasty (&quot;Arm lift&quot;): reducing excess skin and fat between the underarm and the elbow
* Laser skin rejuvenation or laser resurfacing: the lessening of depth of facial pores and exfoliation of dead or damaged skin cells
* Liposuction (&quot;suction lipectomy&quot;): removal of fat deposits by traditional suction technique or ultrasonic energy to aid fat removal
* Zygoma reduction plasty: reducing the facial width by performing osteotomy and resecting part of the zygomatic bone and arch
* Jaw reduction: reduction of the mandible angle to smooth out an angular jaw and creating a slim jaw
* Buccal fat extraction: extraction of the buccal pads
* Body contouring: the removal of this excess skin and fat from numerous areas of the body, restoring the appearance of skin elasticity of the remaining skin. The surgery is prominent in those who have undergone significant weight loss resulting in excess sagging skin being present around areas of the body. The skin loses elasticity (a condition called elastosis) once it has been stretched past capacity and is unable to recoil back to its standard position against the body and also with age.
* Sclerotherapy: removing visible &#x27;spider veins&#x27; (Telangiectasia), which appear on the surface of the skin.
* Dermal fillers: Dermal fillers are injected below the skin to give a more fuller, youthful appearance of a feature or section of the face. One type of dermal filler is Hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found throughout the human body. It plays a vital role in moving nutrients to the cells of the skin from the blood. It is also commonly used in patients with arthritis as it acts like a cushion to the bones which have depleted the articular cartilage casing. Development within this field has occurred over time with synthetic forms of hyaluronic acid is being created, playing roles in other forms of cosmetic surgery such as facial augmentation.
* Micropigmentation: is the creation of permanent makeup using natural pigments to places such as the eyes to create the effect of eye shadow, lips creating lipstick and cheek bones to create a blush like look. The pigment is inserted beneath the skin using a machine which injects a small needle at a very fast rate carrying pigment into the skin, creating a lasting colouration of the desired area.

In 2015, the most popular surgeries were botox, liposuction, blepharoplasties, breast implants, rhynoplasties, and rhytidectomies. According to the 2020 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, which is published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the most surgical procedure performed in the U.S. was rhinoplasty (nose reshaping) accounting for 15.2% of all cosmetic surgical procedures that year, followed by blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), which accounted for 14% of all procedures. The third most populous procedure was rhytidectomy (facelift) (10% of all procedures), then liposuction (9.1% of all procedures).

==Complications, risks, and reversals==
All surgery has risks. Common complications of cosmetic surgery includes hematoma, nerve injury, infection, scarring, implant failure and end organ damage. Breast implants can have many complications, including rupture. In a study of his 4761 augmentation mammaplasty patients, Eisenberg reported that overfilling saline breast implants 10–13% significantly reduced the rupture-deflation rate to 1.83% at 8-years post-implantation. In 2011 FDA stated that one in five patients who received implants for breast augmentation will need them removed within 10 years of implantation.

==Psychological disorders==
Although media and advertising do play a large role in influencing many people&#x27;s lives, such as by making people believe plastic surgery to be an acceptable course to change one&#x27;s identity to their liking, researchers believe that plastic surgery obsession is linked to psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder. There exists a correlation between those with BDD and the predilection toward cosmetic plastic surgery in order to correct a perceived defect in their appearance.

BDD is a disorder resulting in the individual becoming &quot;preoccupied with what they regard as defects in their bodies or faces&quot;. Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person&#x27;s concern is markedly excessive. While 2% of people have body dysmorphic disorder in the United States, 15% of patients seeing a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeons have the disorder. Half of the patients with the disorder who have cosmetic surgery performed are not pleased with the aesthetic outcome. BDD can lead to suicide in some people with the condition. While many with BDD seek cosmetic surgery, the procedures do not treat BDD, and can ultimately worsen the problem. The psychological root of the problem is usually unidentified; therefore causing the treatment to be even more difficult. Some say that the fixation or obsession with correction of the area could be a sub-disorder such as anorexia or muscle dysmorphia. The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and Facetune have been identified as potential triggers of BDD. Recently, a phenomenon referred to as &#x27;Snapchat dysmorphia&#x27; has appeared to describe people who request surgery to resemble the edited version of themselves as they appear through Snapchat filters. In response to the detrimental trend, Instagram banned all augmented reality (AR) filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery.

In some cases, people whose physicians refuse to perform any further surgeries, have turned to &quot;do it yourself&quot; plastic surgery, injecting themselves and facing extreme safety risks.

<doc id="42051" wikidata="Q1893973" url="?curid=42051" title="The IPCRESS File">
<text>The IPCRESS File is Len Deighton&#x27;s first spy novel, published in 1962. The story involves Cold War brainwashing and includes scenes in Lebanon and on an atoll for a United States atomic weapon test, as well as information about Joe One, the Soviet Union&#x27;s first atomic bomb. The story was made into a film in 1965 produced by Harry Saltzman, directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Michael Caine; and a 2022 TV series, starring Joe Cole, Lucy Boynton and Tom Hollander.

==Plot==
The novel takes the form of the unnamed protagonist&#x27;s personal report to the Minister of Defence, thus becoming the &#x27;IPCRESS File&#x27; of the title. Events begin soon after the protagonist&#x27;s transfer from military intelligence to WOOC(P), a small civilian intelligence agency reporting directly to the British Cabinet, where he works under the command of a man named Dalby. An intelligence broker code-named &quot;Jay&quot; is suspected to be behind a series of kidnappings of British VIPs with the intention of selling them to the Soviets, and the protagonist is assigned to meet Jay to secure the release of &quot;Raven&quot;, a high-ranking scientist. While trying to meet Jay at a Soho strip club to negotiate Raven&#x27;s release, the protagonist discovers Raven&#x27;s unconscious body in a back room but is unsuccessful in trying to rescue him. 

WOOC(P) learns that Raven is to be transferred to the Soviets in Beirut, and a rescue mission is organised. The protagonist is assigned as a lookout and kills the occupants of a car which suddenly arrives on the scene, believing them to be operatives working for Jay; they instead turn out to be members of the US Office of Naval Intelligence. The operation is otherwise a success and Raven is recovered, but investigation into Jay continues. A break appears when Housemartin, one of Jay&#x27;s high-ranking operatives, is arrested in Shoreditch, but the protagonist and another operative arrive at the police station only to discover that Housemartin has been murdered in his cell. Information from the arrest enables WOOC(P) and the police to storm one of Jay&#x27;s safe-houses, but it has been abandoned. 

A military statistician, Carswell, and his assistant Murray, are assigned to WOOC(P) to attempt to find a statistical link between the disappearances of the scientists and to help with the administration of the department, while the protagonist is assigned an assistant, Jean Tonnesen, a beautiful young woman towards whom he begins to develop romantic feelings. 

Dalby reveals intelligence suggesting that Jay&#x27;s operations will interfere with an American neutron bomb test in the Pacific. He, Jean and the protagonist are sent to the test site as British observers and while there the protagonist learns from an old friend in the CIA that the Americans suspect him of being a double-agent due to the deaths of the US operatives. Jean reveals that Dalby has been visiting an abandoned Japanese bunker on the island and while following Dalby to the scene the protagonist is present when the site is sabotaged, setting back the bomb test and killing a military police officer. The protagonist is arrested by the Americans and interrogated, before apparently being transferred to Hungary on suspicion of being a Soviet agent. There he is drugged and subjected to psychological and physical torture, and nearly cracks before eventually managing to escape—only to discover that he is in fact in London. The protagonist takes refuge with Charlie Cavendish, the father of a friend killed during the Second World War, and attempts to re-establish contact with WOOC(P) without being arrested. Charlie is killed by Jay&#x27;s operatives, forcing the protagonist on the run; he approaches Dalby at his home, but discovers Dalby with Jay, Murray and another of Jay&#x27;s operatives—confirming the protagonist&#x27;s suspicions that Dalby is in fact the traitor.

The protagonist is discovered by Murray, who turns out to be an undercover operative from military intelligence also investigating Dalby. The protagonist escapes, but is captured and taken to meet Jay—he has, however, allowed military intelligence to follow them, and Jay and Dalby are arrested by Colonel Ross. The protagonist reveals to Jean that Jay and Dalby were using a process called &quot;Induction of Psycho-neuroses by Conditioned REflex with StresS&quot; (IPCRESS) to brainwash the VIPs into loyalty to the Soviet Union. The links that Carswell had discovered were in fact indicators of the personality traits that Jay had used to determine which VIPs would easily succumb to the process. Colonel Ross’ earlier attempt to sell information to the protagonist had been a test of his loyalty. The novel ends with the protagonist concluding his report to the Minister, revealing that Jay has turned and begun working for the British, while Dalby has ostensibly died in a car accident.

==Background==
Deighton wrote in 1966, &quot;I was earning enough money as an artist to write anything I chose. I chose a spy novel&quot;:

&quot;It owed a debt to Chandler, but was inspired by &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;, an old Bogart-Lorre film&quot;, Deighton added. In 1992 he said that the inspiration to write the novel came from his real-life neighbour Anna Wolkoff, a White Russian émigrée who collaborated with a cipher clerk from the American embassy to spy for Germany in World War II. Deighton&#x27;s mother cooked for Wolkoff&#x27;s dinner parties and he said that he &quot;vividly&quot; remembered when MI5 officers came to arrest her: &quot;The experience was a major factor in my decision to write a spy story at my first attempt at fiction.&quot; The plot involves mind control, the acronym IPCRESS of the title standing for &quot;Induction of Psycho-neuroses by Conditioned Reflex under Stress&quot;. The brainwashing is similar to a shock technique called psychic driving pioneered by Donald Ewen Cameron in the 1950s, originally on unwitting mental hospital patients, which was used and funded by the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s secret MKULTRA program in Canada.

==Novel==
Deighton&#x27;s protagonist is unnamed, and this is maintained through all the sequels. Early in the novel we learn that he worked for Military Intelligence for three years before joining his present agency – WOOC(P) – as a civilian employee. WOOC(P) is described as &quot;one of the smallest and most important of the Intelligence Units&quot;. It is never stated exactly what the initials stand for, although his previous boss refers to it as &quot;Provisional&quot;.

We also learn in passing that he is from Burnley, Lancashire, and that he was born in 1922 or 1923.

WOOC(P) is a small department and the unnamed protagonist has a great deal of autonomy. He is resourceful and prepared for any eventuality, keeping an &quot;escape package&quot; containing money, a false passport and other documents circulating in the mail; he picks up the package from an accommodation address at a seedy London shop, and re-mails it to that address in a fresh envelope. He is also a gourmet who enjoys good food. Cooking features frequently in both the film and the novel; Deighton himself is an accomplished cook.

In common with several of his other early novels, the chapter headings have a &quot;feature&quot;. In &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; these take the form of each chapter being headed with a quote from a horoscope, which relates to the action in the chapter, though vaguely, as in most horoscopes.

The front cover, by Deighton&#x27;s friend Raymond Hawkey, has been described as &quot;the template for the covers of all subsequent airport novels&quot;.

==Film==

A film adaptation starring Michael Caine was released in 1965 and produced by the James Bond co-producer Harry Saltzman, assisted by several prominent members of the Bond production family. The film medium made it difficult to maintain the anonymity of Deighton&#x27;s hero, who acquired the name Harry Palmer.

The character&#x27;s name was chosen by Caine, who was having lunch with Harry Saltzman. They were trying to think of a name for the protagonist, and agreed that a boring name would best suit the protagonist&#x27;s persona. Saltzman asked what would be the most boring name they could think of and Caine suggested the name Harry, then immediately apologised to Saltzman. However, Saltzman saw the funny side and pointed out that his real first name was actually Herschel, not Harry, so Saltzman was satisfied with it. The inspiration for the surname came from a boy called Palmer whom Caine knew at school. Caine described Palmer as: &quot;the most boring boy I&#x27;d ever met&quot;.

The given name &quot;Harry&quot; actually occurs in a short sequence in the book where the unnamed protagonist is greeted by someone saying &quot;Hello, Harry.&quot; This causes him to think, &quot;Now my name isn&#x27;t Harry, but in this business it&#x27;s hard to remember whether it ever had been.&quot;

==TV series==
In December 2020, it was announced ITV would adapt &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; as a six-part TV serial.

<doc id="42052" wikidata="Q193140" url="?curid=42052" title="Mescaline">
<text>Mescaline, also known as mescalin or mezcalin, and in chemical terms 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine, is a naturally occurring psychedelic protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class, known for its hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of LSD and psilocybin. It binds to and activates certain serotonin receptors in the brain, producing hallucinogenic effects.

==Biological sources==
It occurs naturally in several species of cacti. It is also reported to be found in small amounts in certain members of the bean family, Fabaceae, including &quot;Senegalia berlandieri&quot; (syn. &quot;Acacia berlandieri&quot;), although these reports have been challenged and have been unsupported in any additional analyses.

As shown in the accompanying table, the concentration of mescaline in different specimens can vary largely within a single species. Moreover, the concentration of mescaline within a single specimen varies as well.

== History and use==
Peyote has been used for at least 5,700 years by Indigenous peoples of the Americas in Mexico. Europeans recorded use of peyote in Native American religious ceremonies upon early contact with the Huichol people in Mexico. Other mescaline-containing cacti such as the San Pedro have a long history of use in South America, from Peru to Ecuador. While religious and ceremonial peyote use was widespread in the Aztec Empire and northern Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, religious persecution confined it to areas near the Pacific coast and up to southwest Texas. However, by 1880, peyote use began to spread north of South-Central America with &quot;a new kind of peyote ceremony&quot; inaugurated by the Kiowa and Comanche people. These religious practices, incorporated legally in the United States in 1920 as the Native American Church, have since spread as far as Saskatchewan, Canada.

In traditional peyote preparations, the top of the cactus is cut off, leaving the large tap root along with a ring of green photosynthesizing area to grow new heads. These heads are then dried to make disc-shaped buttons. Buttons are chewed to produce the effects or soaked in water to drink. However, the taste of the cactus is bitter, so modern users will often grind it into a powder and pour it into capsules to avoid having to taste it. The typical dosage is 200–400 milligrams of mescaline sulfate or 178–356 milligrams of mescaline hydrochloride. The average peyote button contains about 25 mg mescaline. Some analyses of traditional preparations of San Pedro cactus have found doses ranging from 34 mg to 159 mg of total alkaloids, a relatively low and barely psychoactive amount. It appears that patients who receive traditional treatments with San Pedro ingest sub-psychoactive doses and do not experience psychedelic effects.

Botanical studies of peyote began in the 1840s and the drug was listed in the Mexican pharmacopeia. The first of mescal buttons was published by John Raleigh Briggs in 1887. Mescaline was first isolated and identified in 1896 or 1897 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter and his colleagues. He showed that mescaline was exclusively responsible for the psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects of peyote. However, other components of peyote, such as hordenine, pellotine, and anhalinine, are also active. Mescaline was first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Späth.

In 1955, English politician Christopher Mayhew took part in an experiment for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot;, in which he ingested 400 mg of mescaline under the supervision of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Though the recording was deemed too controversial and ultimately omitted from the show, Mayhew praised the experience, calling it &quot;the most interesting thing I ever did&quot;.

Studies of the potential therapeutic effects of mescaline started in the 1950s.

The mechanism of action of mescaline, activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, became known in the 1990s.

=== Potential medical usage ===
Mescaline has a wide array of suggested medical usage, including treatment of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and alcoholism. However, its status as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances limits availability of the drug to researchers. Because of this, very few studies concerning mescaline&#x27;s activity and potential therapeutic effects in people have been conducted since the early 1970s.

== Behavioral and non-behavioral effects ==
Mescaline induces a psychedelic state comparable to those produced by LSD and psilocybin, but with unique characteristics. Subjective effects may include altered thinking processes, an altered sense of time and self-awareness, and closed- and open-eye visual phenomena.

Prominence of color is distinctive, appearing brilliant and intense. Recurring visual patterns observed during the mescaline experience include stripes, checkerboards, angular spikes, multicolor dots, and very simple fractals that turn very complex. The English writer Aldous Huxley described these self-transforming amorphous shapes as like animated stained glass illuminated from light coming through the eyelids in his autobiographical book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; (1954). Like LSD, mescaline induces distortions of form and kaleidoscopic experiences but they manifest more clearly with eyes closed and under low lighting conditions.

Heinrich Klüver coined the term &quot;cobweb figure&quot; in the 1920s to describe one of the four form constant geometric visual hallucinations experienced in the early stage of a mescaline trip: &quot;Colored threads running together in a revolving center, the whole similar to a cobweb&quot;. The other three are the chessboard design, tunnel, and spiral. Klüver wrote that &quot;many &#x27;atypical&#x27; visions are upon close inspection nothing but variations of these form-constants.&quot;
As with LSD, synesthesia can occur especially with the help of music. An unusual but unique characteristic of mescaline use is the &quot;geometrization&quot; of three-dimensional objects. The object can appear flattened and distorted, similar to the presentation of a Cubist painting.

Mescaline elicits a pattern of sympathetic arousal, with the peripheral nervous system being a major target for this substance.

According to a research project in the Netherlands, ceremonial San Pedro use seems to be characterized by relatively strong spiritual experiences, and low incidence of challenging experiences.

== Chemistry ==
Mescaline, also known as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine (3,4,5-TMPEA), is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is closely structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.

The drug is relatively hydrophilic with low fat solubility. Its predicted log P (XLogP3) is 0.7.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Mescaline is biosynthesized from tyrosine, which, in turn, is derived from phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. In &quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot; (Peyote), dopamine converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving &quot;m&quot;-&quot;O&quot;-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.

Tyrosine and phenylalanine serve as metabolic precursors towards the synthesis of mescaline. Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via tyrosine decarboxylase to generate tyramine and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a monophenol hydroxylase or first be hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase to form L-DOPA and decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) by an &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and methylated by COMT. The product, methylated at the two meta positions with respect to the alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of mescaline.

Phenylalanine serves as a precursor by first being converted to -tyrosine by L-amino acid hydroxylase. Once converted, it follows the same pathway as described above.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.10.013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory synthesis===

Mescaline was first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Späth from 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride. Several approaches using different starting materials have been developed since, including the following:

* Hofmann rearrangement of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropionamide.
* Cyanohydrin reaction between potassium cyanide and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde followed by acetylation and reduction.
* Henry reaction of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde with nitromethane followed by nitro compound reduction of ω-nitrotrimethoxystyrene.
* Ozonolysis of elemicin followed by reductive amination.
* Ester reduction of Eudesmic acid&#x27;s methyl ester followed by halogenation, Kolbe nitrile synthesis, and nitrile reduction.
* Amide reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetamide.
*Reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxy(2-nitrovinyl)benzene with lithium aluminum hydride.
* Treatment of tricarbonyl-(η6-1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene) chromium complex with acetonitrile carbanion in THF and iodine, followed by reduction of the nitrile with lithium aluminum hydride.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
In plants, mescaline may be the end-product of a pathway utilizing catecholamines as a method of stress response, similar to how animals may release such compounds and others such as cortisol when stressed. The &quot;in vivo&quot; function of catecholamines in plants has not been investigated, but they may function as antioxidants, as developmental signals, and as integral cell wall components that resist degradation from pathogens. The deactivation of catecholamines via methylation produces alkaloids such as mescaline.

In humans, mescaline acts similarly to other psychedelic agents. It acts as an agonist, binding to and activating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Its at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is approximately 10,000nM and at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor is greater than 20,000nM. How activating the 5-HT2A receptor leads to psychedelic effects is still unknown, but it is likely that somehow it involves excitation of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, mescaline is also known to bind to the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor and a number of other targets.

Mescaline lacks affinity for the monoamine transporters, including the serotonin transporter (SERT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and dopamine transporter (DAT) (Ki &gt; 30,000nM). However, it has been found to increase levels of the major serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) at high doses in rodents. This finding suggests that mescaline might inhibit the reuptake and/or induce the release of serotonin at such doses. However, this possibility has not yet been further assessed or demonstrated. Besides serotonin, mescaline might also weakly induce the release of dopamine, but this is probably of modest significance, if it occurs. In accordance, there is no evidence of the drug showing addiction or dependence. Other psychedelic phenethylamines, including the closely related 2C, DOx, and TMA drugs, are inactive as monoamine releasing agents and reuptake inhibitors. However, an exception is trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA), the amphetamine analogue of mescaline, which is a very low-potency serotonin releasing agent ( = 16,000nM). The possible monoamine-releasing effects of mescaline would likely be related to its structural similarity to substituted amphetamines and related compounds.

Tolerance to mescaline builds with repeated usage, lasting for a few days. The drug causes cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin.

The LD50 of mescaline has been measured in various animals: 212–315 mg/kg i.p. (mice), 132–410 mg/kg i.p. (rats), 328 mg/kg i.p. (guinea pigs), 54mg/kg in dogs, and 130mg/kg i.v. in rhesus macaques. For humans, the LD50 of mescaline has been reported to be approximately 880 mg/kg. It has been said that it would be very difficult to consume enough mescaline to cause death in humans.

Mescaline is a relatively low-potency psychedelic, with active doses in the hundreds of milligrams and micromolar affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. For comparison, psilocybin is approximately 20-fold more potent (doses in the tens of milligrams) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is approximately 2,000-fold more potent (doses in the tens to hundreds of micrograms). There have been efforts to develop more potent analogues of mescaline. Difluoromescaline and trifluoromescaline are more potent than mescaline, as is its amphetamine homologue TMA. Escaline and proscaline are also both more potent than mescaline, showing the importance of the 4-position substituent with regard to receptor binding.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
About half the initial dosage is excreted after 6hours, but some studies suggest that it is not metabolized at all before excretion. Mescaline appears not to be subject to metabolism by CYP2D6 and between 20% and 50% of mescaline is excreted in the urine unchanged, with the rest being excreted as the deaminated-oxidised-carboxylic acid form of mescaline, a likely result of monoamine oxidase (MAO) degradation. However, the enzymes mediating the oxidative deamination of mescaine are controversial. MAO, diamine oxidase (DAO), and/or other enzymes may be involved or responsible.

The previously reported elimination half-life of mescaline was originally reported to be 6hours, but a new study published in 2023 reported a half-life of 3.6hours. The higher estimate is believed to be due to small sample numbers and collective measurement of mescaline metabolites.

Mescaline appears to have relatively poor blood–brain barrier permeability due to its low lipophilicity. However, it is still able to cross into the central nervous system and produce psychoactive effects at sufficienty high doses.

Active metabolites of mescaline may contribute to its psychoactive effects.

== Legal status ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, mescaline was made illegal in 1970 by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, categorized as a Schedule I hallucinogen. The drug is prohibited internationally by the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Mescaline is legal only for certain religious groups (such as the Native American Church by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978) and in scientific and medical research. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Oregon could ban the use of mescaline in Native American religious ceremonies. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in 1993 allowed the use of peyote in religious ceremony, but in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that the RFRA is unconstitutional when applied against states. Many states, including the state of Utah, have legalized peyote usage with &quot;sincere religious intent&quot;, or within a religious organization, regardless of race. Synthetic mescaline, but not mescaline derived from cacti, was officially decriminalized in the state of Colorado by ballot measure Proposition 122 in November 2022.

While mescaline-containing cacti of the genus &quot;Echinopsis&quot; are technically controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, they are commonly sold publicly as ornamental plants.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, mescaline in purified powder form is a Class A drug. However, dried cactus can be bought and sold legally.

=== Australia ===
Mescaline is considered a schedule 9 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 9 substance is classified as &quot;Substances with a high potential for causing harm at low exposure and which require special precautions during manufacture, handling or use. These poisons should be available only to specialised or authorised users who have the skills necessary to handle them safely. Special regulations restricting their availability, possession, storage or use may apply.&quot;

=== Other countries ===
In Canada, France, The Netherlands and Germany, mescaline in raw form and dried mescaline-containing cacti are considered illegal drugs. However, anyone may grow and use peyote, or &quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot;, as well as &quot;Echinopsis pachanoi&quot; and &quot;Echinopsis peruviana&quot; without restriction, as it is specifically exempt from legislation. In Canada, mescaline is classified as a schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, whereas peyote is exempt.

In Russia mescaline, its derivatives and mescaline-containing plants are banned as narcotic drugs (Schedule I).

== Notable users ==
* Salvador Dalí experimented with mescaline believing it would enable him to use his subconscious to further his art potential
* Antonin Artaud wrote 1947&#x27;s &quot;The Peyote Dance&quot;, where he describes his peyote experiences in Mexico a decade earlier.
* Jerry Garcia took peyote prior to forming The Grateful Dead but later switched to LSD and DMT since they were easier on the stomach.
* Allen Ginsberg took peyote. Part II of his poem &quot;Howl&quot; was inspired by a peyote vision that he had in San Francisco.
* Ken Kesey took peyote prior to writing &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.
* Jean-Paul Sartre took mescaline shortly before the publication of his first book, &quot;L&#x27;Imaginaire&quot;; he had a bad trip during which he imagined that he was menaced by sea creatures.
