<text>Latvian (, ), also known as Lettish, is an East Baltic language belonging 
to the Indo-European language family. It is spoken in the Baltic region, and is the language of Latvians. It is the official language of Latvia as well as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 1.5 million native Latvian speakers in Latvia and 100,000 abroad. Altogether, 2 million, or 80% of the population of Latvia, spoke Latvian in the 2000s, before the total number of inhabitants of Latvia slipped to 1.8 million in 2022. Of those, around 1.16 million or 62% of Latvia&#x27;s population used it as their primary language at home, though excluding the Latgale and Riga regions it is spoken as a native language in villages and towns by over 90% of the population.

As a Baltic language, Latvian is most closely related to neighboring Lithuanian (as well as Old Prussian, an extinct Baltic language); however, Latvian has developed in different directions. In addition, there is some disagreement whether Standard Latgalian and Kursenieki, which are mutually intelligible with Latvian, should be considered varieties or separate languages. However, in Latvian linguistics, such hypotheses have been rejected as non-scientific.

Latvian first appeared in print in the mid-16th century with the reproduction of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Latvian in Sebastian Münster&#x27;s (1544), in Latin script.

== Classification ==
Latvian belongs to the Indo-European language family. It is classified as a part of the Baltic branch of the family. It is one of two living Baltic languages with an official status, the other being Lithuanian. The Latvian and Lithuanian languages have retained many features of the nominal morphology of Proto-Indo-European, though their phonology and verbal morphology show many innovations (in other words, forms that did not exist in Proto-Indo-European), with Latvian being considerably more innovative than Lithuanian. However, Latvian has mutual influences with the Livonian language. 

== History ==


=== Origins ===

According to some glottochronological speculations, the East Baltic languages split from West Baltic (or, perhaps, from the hypothetical proto-Baltic language) between 400 and 600 CE. The differentiation between Lithuanian and Latvian started after 800 CE. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th century or 15th century, and perhaps as late as the 17th century.

Latvian as a distinct language emerged over several centuries from the language spoken by the ancient Latgalians assimilating the languages of other neighboring Baltic tribes—Curonian, Semigallian, and Selonian—which resulted in these languages gradually losing their most distinct characteristics. This process of consolidation started in the 13th century after the Livonian Crusade and forced christianization, which formed a unified political, economic, and religious space in Medieval Livonia.

=== 16th–18th century ===

The oldest known examples of written Latvian are from a 1530 translation of a hymn made by , a German pastor in Riga. The oldest preserved book in Latvian is a 1585 Catholic catechism of Petrus Canisius currently located at the Uppsala University Library.

The first person to translate the Bible into Latvian was the German Lutheran pastor Johann Ernst Glück (The New Testament in 1685 and The Old Testament in 1691). The Lutheran pastor Gotthard Friedrich Stender was a founder of Latvian secular literature. He wrote the first illustrated Latvian alphabet book (1787), the first encyclopedia &quot;&quot; (; 1774), grammar books and Latvian–German and German–Latvian dictionaries.

=== 19th century ===
Until the 19th century, the Latvian written language was influenced by German Lutheran pastors and the German language, because Baltic Germans formed the upper class of local society. In the middle of the 19th century the First Latvian National Awakening was started, led by &quot;Young Latvians&quot; who popularized the use of Latvian language. Participants in this movement laid the foundations for standard Latvian and also popularized the Latvianization of loan words. However, in the 1880s, when Czar Alexander III came into power, Russification started.

According to the 1897 Imperial Russian Census, there were 505,994 (75.1%) speakers of Latvian in the Governorate of Courland and 563,829 (43.4%) speakers of Latvian in the Governorate of Livonia, making Latvian-speakers the largest linguistic group in each of the governorates.

=== 20th century ===
After the death of Alexander III at the end of the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements re-emerged. In 1908, Latvian linguists Kārlis Mīlenbahs and Jānis Endzelīns elaborated the modern Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another feature of the language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian, even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet. Moreover, the names are modified to ensure that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija.

After the Soviet occupation of Latvia, the policy of Russification greatly affected the Latvian language. At the same time, the use of Latvian among the Latvians in Russia had already dwindled after the so-called 1937–1938 Latvian Operation of the NKVD, during which at least 16,573 ethnic Latvians and Latvian nationals were executed. In the 1941 June deportation and the 1949 Operation Priboi, tens of thousands of Latvians and other ethnicities were deported from Latvia. Massive immigration from the Russian SFSR, Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR, and other republics of the Soviet Union followed, primarily as a result of Stalin&#x27;s plan to integrate Latvia and the other Baltic republics into the Soviet Union through colonization. As a result, the proportion of the ethnic Latvian population within the total population was reduced from 80% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. In Soviet Latvia, most of the immigrants who settled in the country did not learn Latvian. According to the 2011 census Latvian was the language spoken at home by 62% of the country&#x27;s population.

After the re-establishment of independence in 1991, a new policy of language education was introduced. The primary declared goal was the integration of all inhabitants into the environment of the official state language while protecting the languages of Latvia&#x27;s ethnic minorities.

Government-funded bilingual education was available in primary schools for ethnic minorities until 2019 when Parliament decided on educating only in Latvian. Minority schools are available for Russian, Yiddish, Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Estonian and Roma languages. Latvian is taught as a second language in the initial stages too, as is officially declared, to encourage proficiency in that language, aiming at avoiding alienation from the Latvian-speaking linguistic majority and for the sake of facilitating academic and professional achievements. Since the mid-1990s, the government may pay a student&#x27;s tuition in public universities only provided that the instruction is in Latvian. Since 2004, the state mandates Latvian as the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Form 10–12) for at least 60% of class work (previously, a broad system of education in Russian existed).

The Official Language Law was adopted on 9 December 1999. Several regulatory acts associated with this law have been adopted. Observance of the law is monitored by the Latvian State Language Center run by the Ministry of Justice.

=== 21st century ===
To counter the influence of English, government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) popularize the use of Latvian terms. A debate arose over the Latvian term for euro. The Terminology Commission suggested or , with their Latvianized and declinable ending, would be a better term for euro than the widely used , while European Central Bank insisted that the original name &quot;euro&quot; be used in all languages. New terms are Latvian derivatives, calques or new loanwords. For example, Latvian has two words for &quot;telephone&quot;— and , the former being a direct translation into Latvian of the latter international term. Still, others are older or more euphonic loanwords rather than Latvian words. For example, &quot;computer&quot; can be either or . Both are loanwords; the native Latvian word for &quot;computer&quot; is , which is also an official term. However, now has been considered an appropriate translation, is also used.

There are several contests held annually to promote the correct use of Latvian. One of them is &quot;Word of the year&quot; () organized by the Riga Latvian Society since 2003. It features categories such as the &quot;Best word&quot;, &quot;Worst word&quot;, &quot;Best saying&quot; and &quot;Word salad&quot;. In 2018 the word (instant payment) won the category of &quot;Best word&quot; and (influencer) won the category of &quot;Worst word&quot;. The word pair of (stream) and (streaming) were named the best words of 2017, while as an unnecessary plural of the name for transport was chosen as the worst word of 2017.

== Dialects ==

There are three dialects in Latvian: the Livonic dialect, High Latvian and the Central dialect. Latvian dialects and their varieties should not be confused with the Livonian, Curonian, Semigallian and Selonian languages.

=== Livonic dialect ===

The Livonic dialect (also called &quot;Tamian&quot; or &quot;tāmnieku&quot;) of Latvian was more affected by the Livonian language substratum than Latvian in other parts of Latvia. It is divided into the Vidzeme variety and the Courland variety (also called &quot;tāmnieku&quot;). There are two syllable intonations in the Livonic dialect, extended and broken. In the Livonic dialect, short vowels at the end of words are discarded, while long vowels are shortened. In all numbers, only one form of the verb is used. Due to migration and the introduction of a standardised language, this dialect has declined. It arose from assimilated Livonians, who started to speak in Latvian.

=== Central dialect ===
The Central dialect spoken in central and Southwestern Latvia is the basis of standard Latvian. The dialect is divided into the Vidzeme variety, the Curonic variety and the Semigallic variety. The Vidzeme variety and the Semigallic variety are closer to each other than to the Curonic variety, which is more archaic than the other two. There are three syllable intonations in some parts of Vidzeme variety of the Central dialect, extended, broken and falling. The Curonic and Semigallic varieties have two syllable intonations, extended and broken, but some parts of the Vidzeme variety have extended and falling intonations. In the Curonic variety, &quot;ŗ&quot; is still used. The Kursenieki language, a historic variety of Latvian, which used to be spoken along Curonian Spit, is closely related to the varieties of the Central dialect spoken in Courland.

=== High Latvian dialect ===
High Latvian dialect is spoken in Eastern Latvia. It is set apart from the rest of the Latvian by a number of phonological differences. The dialect has two main varieties – Selonic (two syllable intonations, falling and rising) and Non-Selonic (falling and broken syllable intonations). There is a standard language, i.e., the Standard Latgalian, another historic variety of Latvian, which is based on deep non-Selonic varieties spoken in the south of Latgale. The term &quot;Latgalic&quot; is sometimes also applied to all non-Selonic varieties or even the whole dialect. However, it is unclear if using the term for any varieties besides the standard language is accurate. While the term may refer to varieties spoken in Latgale or by Latgalians, not all speakers identify as speaking Latgalic; for example, speakers of deep Non-Selonic varieties in Vidzeme explicitly deny speaking Latgalic. It is spoken by approximately 15% of Latvia&#x27;s population, but almost all of its speakers are also fluent in the standard Latvian language and they promote the dialect in popular culture in order to preserve their distinct culture. The Latvian Government since 1990 has also taken measures to protect the dialect from extinction.

== Non-native speakers ==
The history of the Latvian language (see below) has placed it in a peculiar position for a language of its size, whereby many non-native speakers speak it compared to native speakers. The immigrant and minority population in Latvia is 700,000 people: Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, and others. The majority of immigrants settled in Latvia between 1940 and 1991; supplementing pre-existing ethnic minority communities (Latvian Germans, Latvian Jews, Latvian Russians). The trends show that the proficiency of Latvian among its non-native speakers is gradually increasing. In a 2009 survey by the Latvian Language Agency 56% percent of respondents with Russian as their native language described having a good knowledge of Latvian, whereas for the younger generation (from 17 to 25 years) the number was 64%.

The increased adoption of Latvian by minorities was brought about by its status as the country&#x27;s only official language and other changes in the society after the fall of the Soviet Union that mostly shifted linguistic focus away from Russian. As an example, in 2007, universities and colleges for the first time received applications from prospective students who had a bilingual secondary education in schools for minorities. Fluency in Latvian is expected in a variety of professions and careers.

== Grammar ==

Latvian grammar represents a classic Indo-European (Baltic) system with well developed inflection and derivation. Word stress, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, more often is on the first syllable. There are no articles in Latvian; definiteness is expressed by an inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is subject–verb–object; however, word order is relatively free.

=== Nouns ===

There are two grammatical genders in Latvian (masculine and feminine) and two numbers, singular and plural. Nouns, adjectives, and declinable participles decline into seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. There are six declensions for nouns.

=== Verbs ===

There are three conjugation classes in Latvian. Verbs are conjugated for person, tense, mood and voice.

== Orthography ==
Latvian in Latin script was first based upon the German orthography, while the alphabet of the Standard Latgalian variety was based on the Polish orthography. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was replaced by a more phonologically consistent orthography.

=== Standard orthography ===
Today, the Latvian standard orthography employs 33 characters:

The modern standard Latvian alphabet uses 22 unmodified letters of the Latin alphabet (all except , which are usually replaced by , , , and respectively in loanwords and even in foreign names, though they may appear in certain specialized terms such as &quot;status quo&quot;; &quot;W&quot; can be found in older texts, &quot;Y&quot; can be found in the Latgalian language/dialect). It adds a further eleven characters by modification. The vowel letters , , and can take a macron to show length, unmodified letters being short; these letters are not differentiated while sorting (e.g. in dictionaries). The letters , and are pronounced , and respectively, while when marked with a caron, , they are pronounced , and respectively. The letters , written with a comma placed underneath (or above them for lowercase &quot;g&quot;), which indicate palatalized versions of representing the sounds , , and . Latvian orthography also contains nine digraphs, which are written . Non-standard varieties of Latvian add extra letters to this standard set.

Latvian spelling has almost one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. Every phoneme corresponds to a letter so that the reader can almost always pronounce words by putting the letters together. There are only two exceptions to this consistency in the orthography: the letters represent two different sounds: and . The second mismatch is that letter indicates both the short and long , and the diphthong . These three sounds are written as , and in Standard Latgalian, and some Latvians campaign for the adoption of this system in standard Latvian. However, Latvian grammarians argue that and are found only in loanwords, with the sound being the only native Latvian phoneme. The digraph was discarded in 1914, and the letters and have not been used in the official Latvian language since 1946. Likewise, the digraph was discarded in 1957, although , , and are still used in some varieties and by many Latvians living beyond the borders of Latvia. The letter is used only in Standard Latgalian, where it represents , a sound not present in other dialects.

=== Old orthography ===

The old orthography was based on German and did not represent the Latvian language phonemically. Initially, it was used to write religious texts for German priests to help them in their work with Latvians. The first writings in Latvian were chaotic: twelve variations for writing &quot;Š&quot; existed, for example. In 1631 the German priest Georg Mancelius tried to systematize the writing. He wrote long vowels according to their position in the word – a short vowel followed by &quot;h&quot; for a radical vowel, a short vowel in the suffix, and vowel with a diacritic mark in the ending indicating two accents. Consonants were written using multiple letters following the example of German. The old orthography was used until the 20th century when modern orthography slowly replaced it.

=== Latvian on computers ===
In late 1992, the official Latvian computing standard LVS 8-92 took effect. It was followed by LVS 24-93 (Latvian language support for computers) that also specified the way Latvian language (alphabet, numbers, currency, punctuation marks, date and time) should be represented on computers. A Latvian ergonomic keyboard standard LVS 23-93 was also announced several months later, but it did not gain popularity due to its need for a custom-built keyboard.

Nowadays standard QWERTY or the US keyboards are used for writing in Latvian; diacritics are entered by using a dead key (usually &#x27;, occasionally ~). Some keyboard layouts use the modifier key AltGr (most notably the Windows 2000 and XP built-in layout (Latvian QWERTY), it is also default modifier in X11R6, thus a default in most Linux distributions).

In the 1990s, lack of software support of diacritics caused an unofficial style of orthography, often called &quot;translits&quot;, to emerge for use in situations when the user is unable to access Latvian diacritic marks (e-mail, newsgroups, web user forums, chat, SMS etc.). It uses the basic Modern Latin alphabet only, and letters that are not used in standard orthography are usually omitted. In this style, diacritics are replaced by digraphs – a doubled letter indicates a long vowel (as in Finnish and Estonian); a following &quot;j&quot; indicates palatalisation of consonants, i.e., a cedilla; and the postalveolars &quot;Š&quot;, &quot;Č&quot; and &quot;Ž&quot; are written with &quot;h&quot; replacing the háček, as in English. Sometimes the second letter, the one used instead of a diacritic, is changed to one of two other diacritic letters (e.g. š is written as ss or sj, not sh), and since many people may find it difficult to use these unusual methods, they write without any indication of missing diacritic marks, or they use digraphing only if the diacritic mark in question would make a semantic difference. Sometimes an apostrophe is used before or after the character that would properly need to be diacriticised. Also, digraph diacritics are often used and sometimes even mixed with diacritical letters of standard orthography. Although today there is software support available, diacritic-less writing is still sometimes used for financial and social reasons. As &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; are part of the Windows-1252 coding, it is possible to input those two letters using a numerical keypad.

=== Comparative orthography ===
For example, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Latvian written in different styles:

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
Consonants in consonant sequences assimilate to the voicing of the subsequent consonant, e.g. apgabals or labs . Latvian does not feature final-obstruent devoicing.

Consonants can be long (written as double consonants) , or short. Plosives and fricatives occurring between two short vowels are lengthened: . Same with &#x27;zs&#x27; that is pronounced as , šs and žs as .

=== Vowels ===
Latvian has six vowels, with length as distinctive feature:

, and the diphthongs involving it other than , are confined to loanwords.

Latvian also has 10 diphthongs, four of which are only found in loanwords (), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections.

=== Syllable accent ===
Standard Latvian and, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, all of the Latvian dialects have fixed initial stress. Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called &quot;mixed diphthongs&quot; composed of a short vowel followed by a sonorant.

== Loanwords ==

During the period of Livonia, many Middle Low German words such as &quot;amats&quot; (profession), &quot;dambis&quot; (dam), &quot;būvēt&quot; (to build) and &quot;bikses&quot; (trousers) were borrowed into Latvian, while the period of Swedish Livonia brought loanwords like &quot;skurstenis&quot; (chimney) from Swedish. It also has loanwords from the Finnic languages, mainly from Livonian and Estonian. There are about 500 to 600 borrowings from Finnic languages in Latvian, for example: &quot;māja&quot; ‘house’ (Liv. &quot;mōj&quot;), &quot;puika&quot; ‘boy’ (Liv. &quot;pūoga&quot;), &quot;pīlādzis&quot; ‘mountain ash’ (Liv. &quot;pī’lõg&quot;), &quot;sēne&quot; ‘mushroom’ (Liv. &quot;sēņ&quot;).

Loanwords from other Baltic language include &quot;ķermenis&quot; (body) from Old Prussian, as well as &quot;veikals&quot; (store) and &quot;paģiras&quot; (hangover) from Lithuanian.

== History of the study ==
The first Latvian dictionary &quot;Lettus&quot; compiled by Georg Mancelius was published in 1638.

The first grammar of the Latvian language is a short “Manual on the Latvian language” () by , published in 1644 in Riga.

<text>A business school is a higher education institution or professional school that teaches courses leading to degrees in business administration or management. A business school may also be referred to as school of management, management school, school of business administration, college of business, or colloquially b-school or biz school. A business school offers comprehensive education in various disciplines related to the world of business and management.

==Types==
There are several forms of business schools, including a school of business, business administration, and management.
* Most of the university business schools consist of faculties, colleges, or departments within the university, and predominantly teach business courses.
* In North America, a business school is often understood to be a university program that offers a graduate Master of Business Administration degrees and/or undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees.
* In Europe and Asia, some universities teach predominantly business courses.
* Privately owned business school which is not affiliated with any university.
* Highly specialized business schools focussing on a specific sector or domain.
* In France, many business schools are public-private partnerships (École consulaire or EESC) largely financed by the public Chambers of Commerce. These schools offer accredited undergraduate and graduate degrees in business from the elite &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and have only loose ties, or no ties at all, to any university.

Andreas Kaplan classifies business schools along four corners:
# Culture (Europe - US): Independent of their actual (physical) location, business schools can be classified according to whether they follow the European or the US model.
# Compass (international/global – regional/local): Business schools can be classified along a continuum, with international/global schools on one end and regional/local schools on the other.
# Capital (public – private): Business schools can either be publicly (state) funded or privately funded, for example through endowments or tuition fees.
# Content (teaching – research): Business school can be classified according to whether a school considers teaching or research to be its primary focus.

===Europe===
In Europe, higher education degrees are organized into three cycles under the Bologna Process in order to facilitate international mobility: bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctorates. The details of how degrees are organized vary between countries and institutions, but in terms of ECTS credits, where 60 credits represents a full academic year&#x27;s work, a bachelor&#x27;s degree typically requires 180–240 credits and a master&#x27;s degree 90–120 credits.

====France====
In France, those levels of study include various &quot;parcours&quot; or paths based on UE (&quot;unités d&#x27;enseignement&quot; or modules), each worth a defined number of ECTS credits. &quot;Grande école&quot; business schools are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and the PGE (&quot;Programme Grande École&quot;) ends with the degree of Master in Management (MiM).

==Case studies==
Some business schools structure their teaching around the use of case studies (i.e. the case method). Case studies have been used in graduate and undergraduate business education for nearly one hundred years. Business cases are historical descriptions of actual business situations. Typically, information is presented about a business firm&#x27;s products, markets, competition, financial structure, sales volumes, management, employees and other factors influencing the firm&#x27;s success. The length of a business case study may range from two or three pages to 30 pages, or more.

Students are expected to scrutinize the case study and prepare to discuss strategies and tactics that the firm should employ in the future. Three different methods have been used in business case teaching:
# Preparing case-specific questions to be answered by the student. This is used with short cases intended for Undergraduate students. The underlying concept is that such students need specific guidance to be able to analyze case studies.
# Problem-solving analysis is the second method initiated by the Harvard Business School which is by far the most widely used method in MBA and executive development programs. The underlying concept is that with enough practice (hundreds of case analyses) students develop intuitive skills for analyzing and resolving complex business situations. Successful implementation of this method depends heavily on the skills of the discussion leader.
# A generally applicable strategic planning approach. This third method does not require students to analyze hundreds of cases. A strategic planning model is provided and students are instructed to apply the steps of the model to six – and up to a dozen cases – during a semester. This is sufficient to develop their ability to analyze a complex situation, generate a variety of possible strategies and to select the best ones. In effect, students learn a generally applicable approach to analyze cases studies and real situations. This approach does not make any extraordinary demands on the artistic and dramatic talents of the teacher. As a result, most professors are capable of supervising the application of this method.

===History of business cases===
When Harvard Business School started operating in 1908, the faculty realized that there were no textbooks suitable for a graduate program in business. Their first solution to this problem involved interviewing leading practitioners of business and writing detailed accounts of what these managers were doing, based partly on the case method already in use at Harvard Law School. Of course, the professors could not present these cases as practices to be emulated, because there were no criteria available for determining what would succeed and what would not succeed. So the professors instructed their students to read the cases and to come to class prepared to discuss the cases and to offer recommendations for appropriate courses of action. The basic outlines of this method still operate in business-school curricula .

==Other approaches==
In contrast to the case method some schools use a skills-based approach in teaching business. This approach emphasizes quantitative methods, in particular operations research, management information systems, statistics, organizational behavior, modeling and simulation, and decision science. The leading institution in this method is the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. The goal is to provide students a set of tools that will prepare them to tackle and solve problems.

Another important approach used in business school is the use of business games that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curricula despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.

There are also several business schools which still rely on the lecture method to give students a basic business education. Lectures are generally given from the professor&#x27;s point of view, and rarely require interaction from the students unless notetaking is required. Lecture as a method of teaching in business schools has been criticized by experts for reducing the incentive and individualism in the learning experience.

==Executive education==
In addition to teaching students, many business schools run Executive Education programs. These may be either open programs or company-specific programs. Executives may also acquire an MBA title in an Executive MBA program within university of business or from top ranked business schools. Many business schools seek close co-operation with business.

==Accreditation==
There are three main accreditation agencies for business schools in the United States: ACBSP, AACSB, and the IACBE. In Europe, the EQUIS business school accreditation system is run by the EFMD, which sometimes applies the more narrow EPAS label to specific courses. The AMBA accredits MBA programmes and other post-graduate business programmes in 75 countries; its sister organisation the Business Graduates Association (BGA), accredits business schools, based on the impact they make on students, employers and the wider community and society, in terms of ethics and responsible management practices. Triple accreditation is used to indicate that a school has been accredited by these three bodies: AACSB, AMBA, and EQUIS. About 1% of business schools are triple-accredited.

==Global business school and MBA rankings==
Each year, organizations and publications such as &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; (US), &quot;Corporate Knights&quot; (Canada), Eduniversal (France), &quot;Financial Times&quot; (UK) and Quacquarelli Symonds (UK) publish rankings of business schools and MBA programs that, while sometimes controversial in their methodologies, nevertheless can directly influence the prestige of schools that achieve high scores. Academic research is also considered to be an important feature and popular way to gauge the prestige of business schools. Business schools share the common purpose of developing global managerial talent and to this end, business schools are encouraged to accelerate global engagement strategies on the foundations of collaboration and innovation.

== Tuition ==
In Europe, a bachelor&#x27;s degree is tuition-free at public intuitions in several countries: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey. In the German education system, most universities do not charge tuition, except for some executive MBA programs. French tuition fees are capped based on the level of education pursued, from €183 (US $) per year for undergraduate and up to €388 (US$) for doctorates. Tuition fees in the United Kingdom were introduced in 1998 and are £9,250 annually for undergraduate courses for home students in England, with higher fees for students who are not domiciled in the UK. Postgraduate courses in the UK often have higher fees, and many universities charge a premium rate for MBAs. All private and autonomous institutions in Europe charge tuition.

In the United States, most public college and universities charge tuition. According to the CollegeBoard, the average cost for an out-of-state, or international student, to attend a public four year university in 2020 was $38,330 (€), while the average in-state cost was $21,950 (€). Two year public universities, such as a community colleges, charge $3,730 (€) on average for in-state students, but these institutions usually do not offer Bachelors or MBA degrees. Private institutions in the United States all charge tuition, often considerably more than their public counterparts.

<doc id="43356" wikidata="Q10993" url="?curid=43356" title="Tiger Woods">
<text>Eldrick Tont &quot;Tiger&quot; Woods (born December 30, 1975) is an American professional golfer. He is tied for first in PGA Tour wins, ranks second in men&#x27;s major championships, and holds numerous golf records. Woods is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time and is one of the most famous athletes in modern history. He is an inductee of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached number one in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 consecutive weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 consecutive weeks). During this time, he won 13 of golf&#x27;s major championships.

The next decade of Woods&#x27;s career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an attempt to resolve marital issues with his wife at the time, Elin. Woods admitted to multiple marital infidelities, and the couple eventually divorced. He fell to number 58 in the world rankings in November 2011 before ascending again to the number-one ranking between March 2013 and May 2014. However, injuries led him to undergo four back surgeries between 2014 and 2017. Woods competed in only one tournament between August 2015 and January 2018, and he dropped off the list of the world&#x27;s top 1,000 golfers. On his return to regular competition, Woods made steady progress to the top of the game, winning his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship in September 2018 and his first major in 11 years at the 2019 Masters.

Woods has held numerous golf records. He has been the number one player in the world for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer in history. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record 11 times and has won the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times. Woods has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons. He has won 15 professional major golf championships (trailing only Jack Nicklaus, who leads with 18) and 82 PGA Tour events (tied for first all time with Sam Snead). Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins.
Woods is the fifth (after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus) player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest to do so. He is also the second golfer out of two (after Nicklaus) to achieve a career Grand Slam three times.

Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships. He was also part of the American winning team for the 1999 Ryder Cup. In May 2019, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Trump, the fourth golfer to receive the honor.

On February 23, 2021, Woods was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after a single-car collision and underwent emergency surgery to repair compound fractures sustained in his right leg in addition to a shattered ankle. In an interview with &quot;Golf Digest&quot; in November 2021, Woods indicated that his full-time career as a professional golfer was over, although he would continue to play &quot;a few events per year&quot;. For the first time since the car crash, he returned to the PGA Tour at the 2022 Masters.

==Background and family==
Woods was born on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, to Earl and Kultida &quot;Tida&quot; Woods. He is their only child, though he has two half-brothers and a half-sister from his father&#x27;s first marriage. Earl was a retired U.S. Army officer and Vietnam War veteran. Earl was born to African-American parents and was also said to have had European and Native American descent. Kultida (née Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl met her when he was on a tour of duty there in 1968. She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry. In 2002, ESPN claimed: &quot;For the record, he is one-quarter Thai, one-quarter Chinese, one-quarter African American, one-eighth Caucasian and one-eighth Native American.&quot; Tiger has described his ethnic make-up as &quot;&quot;Cablinasian&quot; (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).

Woods&#x27;s first name, Eldrick, was chosen by his mother because it began with &quot;E&quot; (for Earl) and ended with &quot;K&quot; (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father&#x27;s friend, South Vietnamese Colonel Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger. Woods has a niece, Cheyenne Woods, who played for the Wake Forest University golf team and turned professional in 2012 when she made her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.

Kultida Woods died on February 4, 2025. Woods credited his mother for his success, saying &quot;without her none of my personal achievements would have been possible.&quot;

==Early life and amateur golf career==
Woods grew up in Orange County, California. He was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf before the age of two by his athletic father Earl Woods. Earl was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University. Woods told reporters he had wanted to be a baseball player like his father but abandoned that goal after tearing his rotator cuff. His father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course beside the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, which allowed Tiger to play there. Tiger also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in Long Beach, as well as some of the municipals in Long Beach.

In 1978, Woods putted against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course. At age five, he appeared in &quot;Golf Digest&quot; and on ABC&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; Before turning seven, Woods won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress. In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9–10 boys&#x27; event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships. He first broke 80 at age eight. He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991. Woods&#x27;s father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years, with Earl trying his best. He lost to Woods every time from then on. Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.

When Woods was 13 years old, he played in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major national junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event&#x27;s format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat him by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club&#x27;s members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.

Woods was 15 years old and a student at Western High School in Anaheim when he became the youngest U.S. Junior Amateur champion; this was a record that stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010. He was named 1991&#x27;s Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the tournament&#x27;s first two-time winner. He also competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan Los Angeles Open (he missed the 36-hole cut), and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.

The following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur; he remains the event&#x27;s only three-time winner. In 1994, at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida, he became the youngest winner of the U.S. Amateur, a record he held until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee. He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships (winning), and the 1995 Walker Cup (losing).

Woods graduated from Western High School at age 18 in 1994 and was voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; among the graduating class. He starred for the high school&#x27;s golf team under coach Don Crosby. Woods learned to manage his stuttering as a boy. This was not widely known until he wrote a letter to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop.&quot;

==College golf career==
Woods was heavily recruited by college golf powers and chose Stanford University, the reigning NCAA champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September. He selected a major in economics and was nicknamed &quot;Urkel&quot; by college teammate Notah Begay III. In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford&#x27;s Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).

At age 19, Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles and won the NCAA individual golf championship. In winning the silver medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281. He left college after two years in order to turn professional in the golf industry. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that it was due to the state&#x27;s high tax rate.

==Professional career==
Woods turned professional at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time. Woods was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament&#x27;s youngest winner at age 21. Two months later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking. After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since Johnny Miller did it in 1974.

Woods was severely myopic; his eyesight had a rating of 11 diopters. In order to correct this problem, he underwent successful laser eye surgery in 1999, and he immediately resumed winning tour events. In 2007, his vision again began to deteriorate, and he underwent laser eye surgery a second time. In 2000, Woods won six consecutive events on the PGA Tour, which was the longest winning streak since Ben Hogan did it in 1948. One of these was the U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called &quot;the greatest performance in golf history&quot;, in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000. At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam. At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.
When Woods won the 2001 Masters, he became the only player to win four consecutive major professional golf titles, although not in the same calendar year. This achievement came to be known as the &quot;Tiger Slam&quot;. Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which he continued to dominate the tour, Woods&#x27;s career hit a slump. He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004. In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, ending Woods&#x27;s record streak of 264 weeks at No. 1.

Woods rebounded in 2005, winning six PGA Tour events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.

Woods began dominantly in 2006, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April. Following the death of his father in May, Woods took some time off from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club, where he missed the cut. However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events. At the season&#x27;s close, Woods had 54 total wins that included 12 majors; he broke the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons.
Woods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour. Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18-hole playoff, after which Mediate said, &quot;This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination,&quot; and Kenny Perry added, &quot;He beat everybody on one leg.&quot; Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it &quot;my greatest ever championship.&quot; In Woods&#x27;s absence, television ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.
Woods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he did not do so. After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying &quot;I was wrong and I was foolish.&quot; During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.

Woods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters, where he finished tied for fourth place. He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round, citing injury. Shortly afterward, Hank Haney, Woods&#x27;s coach since 2003, resigned the position. In August, Woods hired Sean Foley as Haney&#x27;s replacement. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.
In 2011, Woods&#x27;s performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddie Steve Williams (who was shocked by the dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell until he hired Joe LaCava. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December&#x27;s Chevron World Challenge.

Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well but struggled on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at The Honda Classic, with the lowest final-round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT&amp;T National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.

The year 2013 brought a return of Woods&#x27;s dominating play. In January, he won the Farmers Insurance Open by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he won the event. In March, he won the WGC-Cadillac Championship, also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009. Two weeks later, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings. To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline &quot;winning takes care of everything&quot;.

During the 2013 Masters, Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with ESPN that he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot bounced off the pin and into the water. After further review of television footage, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he got to four wins in any season of his professional career.
Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S. Open as a result of an elbow injury that he sustained at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT&amp;T National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second-round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. But at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, Woods never was in contention, making 2013 his fifth full season where he did not win a major; he was in contention in only two of the four majors in 2013.

After a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of The Honda Classic and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain. He subsequently competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014, and after undergoing back surgery, he announced on April 1 that he would miss the Masters for the first time since 1994. Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in June, however he said that his expectations for the week were low. He struggled with nearly every aspect of his game and missed the cut. He next played at The Open Championship, contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and eventually finished 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there was currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.

On February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury. Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed. He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round. Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard both times. He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2. In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place. Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was &quot;just my hip&quot; but offering no specifics.
Woods had back surgery on September 16, 2015. In late March 2016, he announced that he would miss the Masters while he recovered from the surgery; he had also missed the 2014 Masters due to a back problem. &quot;I&#x27;m absolutely making progress, and I&#x27;m really happy with how far I&#x27;ve come,&quot; he explained in a statement. &quot;But I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf.&quot; However, he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5, 2016. For the first time in his career, he missed all four majors in one year due to problems with his back. In October 2016, he told Charlie Rose on PBS that he still wanted to break Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s record of 18 major titles. Woods underwent back surgery in December 2016 and spent the next 15 months off the Tour. He made his return to competitive golf in the Hero World Challenge.

Woods&#x27;s back problems continued to hinder him in 2017. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January and pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai on February 3. On March 31, Woods announced on his website that he would not be playing in the 2017 Masters Tournament despite being cleared to play by his doctors. Woods said that although he was happy with his rehabilitation, he did not feel &quot;tournament ready.&quot; Woods subsequently told friends, &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot;. On April 20, Woods announced that he had undergone his fourth back surgery since 2014 to alleviate back and leg pain. Recovery time required up to six months, meaning that Woods would spend the rest of the year without playing any professional golf. Woods returned to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He shot rounds of 69–68–75–68 and finished tied for 9th place. His world ranking went from 1,199th to 668th, which was the biggest jump in the world rankings in his career.

On March 11, 2018, he finished one-shot back and tied for second at the Valspar Championship in Florida, his first top-five finish on the PGA Tour since 2013. He then tied for sixth with a score of five under par at the 2018 Open Championship. At the last major of the year, the 2018 PGA Championship, Woods finished second, two shots behind the winner Brooks Koepka. It was his best result in a major since 2009 (second at the 2009 PGA Championship) and moved him up to 26th in the world rankings. His final round of 64 was his best-ever final round in a major.

Woods returned to the winner&#x27;s circle for the 80th time in his PGA Tour career on September 23, 2018, when he won the season-ending Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club for the second time and that tournament for the third time. He shot rounds of 65–68–65–71 to win by two strokes over Billy Horschel.

On April 14, 2019, Woods won the Masters, which was his first major championship win in eleven years and his 15th major overall. He finished 13 under par to win by one stroke over Dustin Johnson, Xander Schauffele and Brooks Koepka. At age 43, he became the second oldest golfer ever to win the Masters, after Jack Nicklaus who was 46 when he triumphed in 1986. In August 2019, Woods announced via social media that he underwent knee surgery to repair minor cartilage damage and that he had an arthroscopic procedure during the Tour Championship. In his statement, Woods also confirmed that he was walking and intends on traveling and playing in Japan in October.

Woods played in his first 2020 PGA Tour event at the Zozo Championship in October 2019, which was the first-ever PGA Tour event played in Japan. Woods, who played a highly publicized skins game earlier in the week at the same course as the Championship, held at least a share of the lead after every round of the rain-delayed tournament, giving him a three stroke victory over Hideki Matsuyama. The win was Woods&#x27;s 82nd on Tour, tying him with Sam Snead for the most victories all time on the PGA Tour.

In December 2020, Woods had microdiscectomy surgery on his back for the fifth time. The operation was to remove a pressurized disc fragment that was pinching his nerve and causing him pain during the PNC Championship. Woods returned to play in his first professional tournament since his 2021 motor vehicle crash at the 2022 Masters Tournament. He made the cut and finished in 47th place at 13-over par, 23 shots behind the winner Scottie Scheffler.

In August 2022, Woods, Rory McIlroy, Mike McCarley, and the PGA Tour announced the formation of TGL, a six-team virtual golfing league. In November 2023, Woods revealed himself as an co-owner and player for Jupiter Links Golf Club, founded with investments by David Blitzer.

===Honors===

On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento. In May 2019, following his 2019 Masters Tournament win, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump.
In 2000 and 2001, Woods was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, becoming the inaugural recipient of the award. In 2000 he received the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, an award given to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport. Domestically, Woods has also been recognized by U.S. publications. He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year a record-tying four times, was named &quot;Athlete of the Decade&quot; by the Associated Press in 2009, and is one of only two people to be named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Sportsman of the Year more than once.

Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, Woods has been the biggest name in golf and his presence in tournaments has drawn a huge fan following. Some sources have credited him for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history. His recognition as one of the most famous athletes in modern history includes being depicted in a wax sculpture at Madame Tussauds.

===Endorsements===
During the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world&#x27;s most marketable athlete. Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time. Woods&#x27;s endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a &quot;start-up&quot; golf company earlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market. Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales. Woods has been described as the &quot;ultimate endorser&quot; for Nike Golf, frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products. Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls, and has a building named after him at Nike&#x27;s headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.
In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick&#x27;s Rendezvous SUV. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods&#x27;s endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. &quot;That exceeded our forecasts,&quot; he was quoted as saying, &quot;It has to be in recognition of Tiger.&quot; In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods&#x27;s endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40 million.

Woods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world&#x27;s first professional golf watch, which was released in April 2005. The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, incorporates features to facilitate wearing the watch while playing the game. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing. In 2006, the TAG Heuer &quot;Professional Golf Watch&quot; won the prestigious &quot;iF product design award&quot; in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.
Woods also endorsed the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games; he has done so since 1999. In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series&#x27; publisher.

In February 2007, Woods, Roger Federer, and Thierry Henry became ambassadors for the &quot;Gillette Champions&quot; marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10 million and $20 million.

In October 2007, Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. &quot;Gatorade Tiger&quot; was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, &quot;Golfweek&quot; magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100 million. The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.

In October 2012, it was announced that Woods signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.

In 1997, Woods and fellow golfer Arnold Palmer initiated a civil case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida&#x27;s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer also was named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.

On March 12, 2014, a Florida jury found in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims, rejected ETW&#x27;s counterclaims, and awarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages. The award may end up exceeding $1 million once interest has been factored in, though the ruling may be appealed.

In August 2016, Woods announced that he would be seeking a new golf equipment partner after the news of Nike&#x27;s exit from the equipment industry. It was announced on January 25, 2017, that he would be signing a new club deal with TaylorMade. He added the 2016 M2 driver along with the 2017 M1 fairway woods, with irons to be custom made at a later date. He also added his Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS, a club he used to win 13 of his 15 majors. Also, in late 2016, he would add Monster Energy as his primary bag sponsor, replacing MusclePharm.

On January 8, 2024, Woods announced that he would be parting ways with Nike after 27 years, ending one of the most lucrative endorsements any athlete has had.

===Accumulated wealth===
Woods has appeared on Forbes list of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes. According to &quot;Golf Digest&quot;, Woods earned $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the magazine predicted that Woods would pass a billion dollars in earnings by 2010. In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; confirmed that Woods was indeed the world&#x27;s first professional athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career, after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second richest person of color in the United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes list of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans. As of 2017, Woods was considered to be the highest-paid golfer in the world. In 2022, Woods was the first golfer to have a net worth over one billion dollars, making him one of the richest celebrities.

===Tiger-proofing===
Early in Woods&#x27;s career, a small number of golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, &quot;Isn&#x27;t Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?&quot; (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.

A related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a &quot;superstar&quot; competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one&#x27;s level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort. Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as &quot;Tiger-proofing&quot;. Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.

==Career achievements==
Woods has won 82 official PGA Tour events, including 15 majors. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as &quot;the greatest closer in history&quot;. He has the lowest career scoring average and the largest career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.

Woods&#x27;s victory at the 2013 Players Championship also marked a win in his 300th PGA Tour start. He also won golf tournaments in his 100th (in 2000) and 200th (in 2006) tour starts.

Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. Woods is the only player to have consecutively won all four major championships open to professionals, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.

===PGA Tour career summary===

*As of 2024 season

==Playing style==
When Woods first joined the PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf, but he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years. He insisted upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance. Many opponents caught up to him, and Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using &quot;inferior equipment&quot;, which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist, or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, again made him one of the tour&#x27;s longest players off the tee.

Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.

From mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods&#x27;s full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999. Woods and Harmon eventually parted ways. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned under questionable circumstances in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley.

Fluff Cowan served as Woods&#x27;s caddie from the start of his professional career until Woods dismissed him in March 1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods dismissed Williams after he caddied for Adam Scott in the U.S. Open and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods&#x27;s caddie since then.

==Other ventures==

===TGR Foundation===
The TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children. The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships. As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.

The foundation operates the Tiger Woods Learning Center, a $50-million, facility in Anaheim, California, providing college-access programs for underserved youth. The TWLC opened in 2006 and features seven classrooms, extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area. The center has since expanded to four additional campuses: two in Washington, D.C.; one in Philadelphia; and one in Stuart, Florida.
The foundation benefits from the annual Chevron World Challenge and AT&amp;T National golf tournaments hosted by Woods. In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach. Other annual fundraisers have included the concert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last held in 2011 in Las Vegas after a one-year hiatus.

===Tiger Woods Design===
In November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, Tiger Woods Design. A month later, he announced that the company&#x27;s first course would be in Dubai as part of a 25.3-million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the project had been shelved permanently. In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.

Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction. In 2019 the 800-acre site was sold for $19.3 million and in 2024 550 acres of that were listed for about the same price. While no evidence of Woods&#x27; involvement has been found, the listing shows that development plans are still on file. A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study. Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.

These projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the U.S. crash in home prices), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.

===Writings===
Woods wrote a golf instruction column for &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine from 1997 to February 2011. In 2001, he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, &quot;How I Play Golf&quot;, which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5 million copies. In March 2017, he published a memoir, &quot;The 1997 Masters: My Story&quot;, co-authored by Lorne Rubenstein, which focuses on his first Masters win. In October 2019, Woods announced he would be writing a memoir book titled &quot;Back&quot;.

===NFT===
Tiger Woods&#x27; &quot;Iconic Fist Pumps Collection&quot; is his first digital Non-fungible token (NFT) collection that launched on the DraftKings Marketplace in collaboration with Autograph.io on September 28, 2021. Autograph is an NFT platform that was co-founded by Tom Brady that helped launch NFT projects with some of the biggest names in sports, including Usain Bolt, Rafael Nadal, Wayne Gretzky, and Tony Hawk. Woods&#x27; first collection offered 10,000 digital pictures of Tiger Woods&#x27; iconic moments ranging from $12 to $1,500, and 300 of those NFTs were also accompanied by his official digital signature. The NFTs launched on the Autograph platform grants fans unique access to exclusive content, first dibs on digital collectibles, custom-made merchandise, and access to private in-person events depending on the varying utility of each NFT.

===Sun Day Red===
Woods partnered with TaylorMade to launch his golf apparel line, dubbed &quot;Sun Day Red&quot;. The line was announced on February 12, 2024, and featured Woods&#x27; signature red shirt.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships and children ===
In November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren. They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as an au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, a community in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. In 2006, they purchased a $39-million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple&#x27;s divorce.

Woods and Nordegren&#x27;s first child was a daughter born in 2007, whom they named Sam Alexis Woods. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam. Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.

=== Infidelity scandal and fallout ===
In November 2009, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; published a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, who denied the claim. Two days later, around 2:30 a.m. on November 27, Woods was driving from his Florida mansion in his Cadillac Escalade SUV when he collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home. He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving. Following intense media speculation about the cause of the crash, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the crash, calling it a &quot;private matter&quot; and crediting his wife for helping him from the car. On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament (the Chevron World Challenge) or any other tournaments in 2009 because of his injuries.

On December 2, following &quot;Us Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s previous day reporting of a purported mistress and subsequent release of a voicemail message allegedly left by Woods for the woman, Woods released a further statement. He admitted transgressions and apologized to &quot;all of those who have supported [him] over the years&quot;, while reiterating his and his family&#x27;s right to privacy. Over the next few days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods. On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and he apologized again. He also announced that he would be taking &quot;an indefinite break from professional golf.&quot;

In the days and months following Woods&#x27;s admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&amp;T, Gatorade, and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine suspended Woods&#x27;s monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online&quot;. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods&#x27;s affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.

On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he went through a 45-day therapy program that began at the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. &quot;I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to&quot;, he said. &quot;I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn&#x27;t have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish.&quot; He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf. On March 16, he announced that he would play in the 2010 Masters.

After six years of marriage, Woods and Nordegren divorced on August 23, 2010.

===Subsequent relationships===
On March 18, 2013, Woods announced that he and Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn were dating. They split up in May 2015. From November 2016 to August 2017, Woods was rumored to be in a relationship with stylist Kristin Smith. Between late 2017 and late 2022, Woods was in a relationship with restaurant manager Erica Herman. However, in early 2023, Herman filed suit against Woods in relation to a non-disclosure agreement, alleging that it violates the Speak Out Act. Herman claimed that she was owed $30 million after an oral agreement was breached when Woods&#x27; trust&#x27;s employees &quot;locked her out of the Residence, removed her personal belongings, and informed her she could not return.&quot;

===2017 DUI arrest===

On May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near his home in Jupiter Island, Florida, by the Jupiter Police Department at about 3:00 am. EDT for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which was stationary in a traffic lane with its engine running. He later stated that he took prescription drugs and did not realize how they might interact together. On July 3, 2017, Woods tweeted that he completed an out-of-state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue. At his arraignment on August 9, 2017, Woods had his attorney Douglas Duncan submit a not guilty plea for him and agreed to take part in a first-time driving under the influence offender program and attend another arraignment on October 25.

At a hearing on October 27, 2017, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests. He was not allowed to drink alcohol during the probation, and if he violated the probation he would be sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.

=== 2021 car crash ===
On February 23, 2021, Woods survived a serious rollover car crash in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The wreck was a single-vehicle collision and Woods was the sole occupant of the vehicle, which was traveling north along Hawthorne Boulevard.

He was taken to the Harbor–UCLA Medical Center by ambulance. The incident was under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which said the car &quot;sustained major damage,&quot; and that Woods was driving over , nearly twice the speed limit, before he crashed. No charges were filed. Woods&#x27;s agent later said that he sustained multiple leg injuries and had surgery for non-life-threatening injuries.

=== Other pursuits ===

Woods was raised as a Buddhist. He actively practiced his faith from childhood until well into his adult professional golf career. In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying that he &quot;believes in Buddhism ... not every aspect, but most of it.&quot; He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, &quot;Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught.&quot;

Woods is registered as an independent voter. In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. In April 2009, Woods visited the White House while promoting the golf tournament he hosts, the AT&amp;T National. In December 2016 and again in November 2017, Woods played golf with President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.

<doc id="43357" wikidata="Q5586" url="?curid=43357" title="Hokusai">
<text>, known mononymously as Hokusai, was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period, active as a painter and printmaker. His woodblock print series &quot;Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji&quot; includes the iconic print &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. Hokusai was instrumental in developing &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; from a style of portraiture largely focused on courtesans and actors into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and animals. His works had a significant influence on Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet during the wave of Japonisme that spread across Europe in the late 19th century.

Hokusai created the monumental &quot;Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji&quot; as a response to a domestic travel boom in Japan and as part of a personal interest in Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically, &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot; and &quot;Fine Wind, Clear Morning&quot;, that secured his fame both in Japan and overseas.

Hokusai was best known for his woodblock ukiyo-e prints, but he worked in a variety of mediums including painting and book illustration. Starting as a young child, he continued working and improving his style until his death, aged 88. In a long and successful career, Hokusai produced over 30,000 paintings, sketches, woodblock prints, and images for picture books in total. Innovative in his compositions and exceptional in his drawing technique, Hokusai is considered one of the greatest masters in the history of art.

==Early life==
Hokusai&#x27;s date of birth is unclear, but is often stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the Hōreki era (in the old calendar, or 31 October 1760) to an artisan family, in the Katsushika[ja] district of Edo, the capital of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate (currently Katsushika-ku, Tokyo). His childhood name was Tokitarō. It is believed his father was Nakajima Ise, a mirror-maker for the shōgun. His father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother was a concubine. Hokusai began painting around the age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work included the painting of designs around mirrors.

Hokusai was known by at least thirty names during his lifetime. While the use of multiple names was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, his number of pseudonyms exceeds that of any other major Japanese artist. His name changes are so frequent, and so often related to changes in his artistic production and style, that they are used for breaking his life up into periods.

At the age of 12, his father sent him to work in a bookshop and lending library, a popular institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from woodcut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes. At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a woodcarver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of Katsukawa Shunshō. Shunshō was an artist of &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, a style of woodblock prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school. &quot;Ukiyo-e&quot;, as practised by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans (&quot;bijin-ga&quot;) and kabuki actors (&quot;yakusha-e&quot;) who were popular in Japan&#x27;s cities at the time.

After a year, Hokusai&#x27;s name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed Shunrō by his master. It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in Shunshō&#x27;s studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in the early 1790s. He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as Ōi, eventually became an artist and his assistant. &quot;Fireworks in the Cool of Evening at Ryogoku Bridge in Edo&quot; () dates from this period of Hokusai&#x27;s life.

Upon the death of Shunshō in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire. He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunkō, the chief disciple of Shunshō, possibly due to his studies at the rival Kanō school. This event was, in his own words, inspirational: &quot;What really motivated the development of my artistic style was the embarrassment I suffered at Shunkō&#x27;s hands&quot;.

Hokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and actors that were the traditional subjects of &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;. Instead, his work became focused on landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels. This change of subject was a breakthrough in &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; and in Hokusai&#x27;s career.

==Middle period==


The next period saw Hokusai&#x27;s association with the Tawaraya School and the adoption of the name &quot;Tawaraya Sōri&quot;. He produced many privately commissioned prints for special occasions (&quot;surimono&quot;), and illustrations for books of humorous poems (&quot;kyōka ehon&quot;) during this time. In 1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa.

By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born, the latter meaning &#x27;north studio&#x27;, in honour of the North Star, symbol of a deity important in his religion of Nichiren Buddhism. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, &quot;Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital&quot; and &quot;Eight Views of Edo&quot; (modern Tokyo). He also began to attract students of his own, eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life.

He became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for self-promotion. During an Edo festival in 1804, he created an enormous portrait of the Buddhist prelate Daruma, said to be 200 square meters, using a broom and buckets full of ink. Another story places him in the court of the shōgun Tokugawa Ienari, invited there to compete with another artist who practised more traditional brushstroke painting. Hokusai painted a blue curve on paper, then chased a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint across the image. He described the painting to the shōgun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition.

Between 1804 and 1815, Hokusai collaborated with the popular novelist Takizawa Bakin on a series of illustrated books. Especially popular was the fantasy novel &quot;Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki&quot; (&quot;Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon&quot;, 1807–1811) with Minamoto no Tametomo as the main character, and Hokusai gained fame with his creative and powerful illustrations, but the collaboration ended after thirteen works. There are various theories as to why they dissolved their cooperation, such as discordant personalities and conflicting opinions on how to draw illustrations. Hokusai also created several albums of erotic art (&quot;shunga&quot;). His most famous image in this genre is &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which depicts a young woman entwined sexually with a pair of octopuses, from &quot;Kinoe no Komatsu&quot;, a three-volume book of shunga from 1814.

Hokusai paid close attention to the production of his work. In letters during his involvement with &quot;Toshisen Ehon&quot;, a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry, Hokusai wrote to the publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai&#x27;s style in the cutting of certain heads. He also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure&#x27;s eyes and noses and that amendments were needed for the final prints to be true to his style. In his letter, Hokusai included examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses and the Utagawa school style.

In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to &quot;Taito&quot; and entered the period in which he created the &quot;Hokusai Manga&quot; and various &quot;etehon&quot;, or art manuals. These manuals beginning in 1812 with &quot;Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing&quot;, were intended as a convenient way to make money and attract more students. The first volume of &quot;Manga&quot; (meaning random drawings) was published in 1814 and was an immediate success. By 1820, he had produced twelve volumes (with three more published posthumously) which include thousands of drawings of objects, plants, animals, religious figures, and everyday people, often with humorous overtones.

On 5 October 1817, he painted the &quot;Great Daruma&quot; outside the Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin in Nagoya. This portrait in ink on paper measured 18 × 10.8 metres, and the event drew huge crowds. The feat was recounted in a popular song and he received the name &quot;&quot;Darusen&quot; or &quot;Daruma Master&quot; Although the original was destroyed in 1945, Hokusai&#x27;s promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the Nagoya City Museum.

In 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to &quot;Iitsu&quot;, a change which marked the start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan. His most celebrated work, &quot;Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji&quot;, including the famous &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot; and &quot;Red Fuji&quot; was produced in the early 1830s. The results of Hokusai&#x27;s perspectival studies in &quot;Manga&quot; can be seen here in &quot;The Great Wave&quot; where he uses what would have been seen as a western perspective to represent depth and volume. It proved so popular that ten more prints were later added to the series. Among the other popular series of prints he made during this time are &quot;A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces&quot;, &quot;Oceans of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces&quot;. He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds (&quot;kachō-e&quot;), including the extraordinarily detailed &quot;Poppies&quot; and &quot;Flock of Chickens&quot;.

==Later life==

The next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name &quot;Gakyō Rōjin Manji&quot; (; &quot;The Old Man Mad About Art&quot;). It was at this time that he produced &quot;One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji&quot;, another significant series, generally considered &quot;the masterpiece among his landscape picture books&quot;.

In the colophon to this work, Hokusai writes:

&quot;A True Mirror of Chinese and Japanese Poetry&quot; (&quot;Shika shashin kyo&quot;), produced in about 1833 to 1834, was printed in extra-long vertical formats resembling the form of Chinese hand scrolls. Prints in this series include poems by Chinese and Japanese poets combined with scenes in those countries, and scenes from Noh plays (a form of dance theater predating kabuki). Ten designs in this series survive.

Hokusai&#x27;s final print series, produced around 1835 to 1836, was called &quot;One Hundred Poems Explained by a Nurse (Hyakunin isshu tuba ga etoki).&quot; The series was never published in full, perhaps due to financial hardships faced by Hokusai&#x27;s publishers during Japan&#x27;s economic downturn in the mid-1830&#x27;s. These prints featured scenes with the poems inscribed in a square. Each print also contains the series title listed in its own vertical rectangle.

In 1839, a fire destroyed Hokusai&#x27;s studio and much of his work. By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as Andō Hiroshige became increasingly popular. At the age of 83, Hokusai traveled to Obuse in Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture) at the invitation of a wealthy farmer, Takai Kozan, where he stayed for several years. During his time in Obuse, he created several masterpieces, including the &quot;Masculine Wave&quot; and the &quot;Feminine Wave&quot;. Between 1842 and 1843, in what he described as &quot;daily exorcisms&quot; (&quot;nisshin joma&quot;), Hokusai painted Chinese lions (&quot;shishi&quot;) every morning in ink on paper as a talisman against misfortune. Hokusai continued working almost until the end, painting &quot;The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji&quot; and &quot;Tiger in the Snow&quot; in early 1849.

Constantly seeking to produce better work, he apparently exclaimed on his deathbed, &quot;If only Heaven will give me just another ten years ... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter&quot;. He died on 10 May 1849 and was buried at the Seikyō-ji in Tokyo (Taito Ward). A haiku he composed shortly before his death reads: &quot;Though as a ghost, I shall lightly tread, the summer fields&quot;.

==Selected works==
==Influence on art and culture==
Hokusai had achievements in various fields as an artist. He made designs for book illustrations and woodblock prints, sketches, and painting for over 70 years. Hokusai was an early experimenter with western linear perspective among Japanese artists. Hokusai himself was influenced by Sesshū Tōyō and other styles of Chinese painting. His influence stretches across the globe to his western contemporaries in nineteenth-century Europe with Japonism, which started with a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e. Some of the first samples were to be seen in Paris, when in about 1856, the French printmaker, designer and colleague of many Impressionsist artists such as Édouard Manet, Félix Bracquemond first came across a copy of a Hokusai sketchbook at the workshop of August Dalatre, his printer.

With the sketchbook as his influence Bracquemond designed the &quot;Rousseau Service&quot;, an elegant set of dinnerware, on behalf of Francois-Eugene Rousseau, the owner of a glass and ceramics shop. Exhibited at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1867, the Rousseau Service was a success both critically and commercially and was reissued in several editions over the years. The Rousseau Service featured images of birds and fish copied from the Japanese book illustrations and placed asymmetrically against a white background for a look that would have been very modern at that time.

Hokusai also influenced the Impressionism movement, with themes echoing his work appearing in the work of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as Art Nouveau, or Jugendstil in Germany. His woodcuts were collected by many European artists, including Degas, Gauguin, Klimt, Franz Marc, August Macke, Édouard Manet, and van Gogh. Degas said of him, &quot;Hokusai is not just one artist among others in the Floating World. He is an island, a continent, a whole world in himself&quot;. Hermann Obrist&#x27;s whiplash motif, or &quot;Peitschenhieb&quot;, which came to exemplify the new movement, is visibly influenced by Hokusai&#x27;s work.

The French composer Claude Debussy&#x27;s tone poem La Mer, which debuted in 1905, is believed to have been inspired by Hokusai&#x27;s print &quot;The Great Wave.&quot; The composer had an impression of it hanging in his living room and specifically requested that it be used on the cover of the published score, which was widely distributed, and the music itself incorporated Japanese-inflected harmonies.

Even after his death, exhibitions of his artworks continue to grow. In 2005, Tokyo National Museum held a Hokusai exhibition which had the largest number of visitors of any exhibit there that year. Several paintings from the Tokyo exhibition were also exhibited in the United Kingdom. The British Museum held the first exhibition of Hokusai&#x27;s later year artworks including &quot;&#x27;The Great Wave&quot;&#x27; in 2017.

Hokusai inspired the Hugo Award–winning short story by science fiction author Roger Zelazny, &quot;24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai&quot;, in which the protagonist tours the area surrounding Mount Fuji, stopping at locations painted by Hokusai. A 2011 book on mindfulness closes with the poem &quot;Hokusai Says&quot; by Roger Keyes, preceded with the explanation that &quot;[s]ometimes poetry captures the soul of an idea better than anything else&quot;.

In the 1985 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Richard Lane characterizes Hokusai as &quot;since the later 19th century [having] impressed Western artists, critics and art lovers alike, more, possibly, than any other single Asian artist&quot;.

&quot;&#x27;Store Selling Picture Books and Ukiyo-e&quot;&#x27; by Hokusai shows how ukiyo-e during the time was actually sold; it shows how these prints were sold at local shops, and ordinary people could buy ukiyo-e. Unusually in this image, Hokusai used a hand-colored approach instead of using several separated woodblocks.

His youngest daughter Ei has her own manga and film called &quot;Miss Hokusai&quot;.

A biographical film about the painter was released in Japan on May 28, 2021. It was premiered at the 33rd Tokyo International Film Festival.

<text>This is a list of business schools in Europe. This list should &quot;not&quot; include schools that teach business alongside other subjects, i.e., a university that has a business curriculum should not be listed here as a business school. Those schools that have articles (i.e., are notable) are accepted for inclusion without a supporting citation; those schools that do not have articles (i.e., red links) must have associated citations that reliably support the existence and focus of the school.
Triple accreditation in management education is the combined accreditation of the three major accreditation bodies: the &quot;Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business&quot; (AACSB) based in the United States, the &quot;Association of MBAs&quot; (AMBA) based in the United Kingdom, and the &quot;EFMD Quality Improvement System&quot; (EQUIS) by the European Foundation for Management Development based in Belgium. More than 120 business schools worldwide, or about 1% of all business schools, are triple-accredited.

<text>George Wellington &quot;Cap&quot; Streeter (c. 1837 – January 22, 1921) was an American who became infamous in Chicago for his real estate schemes and oftentimes bizarre eccentricity. From 1886 to 1921, Streeter, often through forgery and other manipulative means, attempted to lay claim to of Lake Michigan shoreline from various owners. Failing in his efforts to defraud wealthy landowners, he turned to selling the disputed land to uninformed buyers. A portion of the real estate near downtown Chicago, known as Streeterville, is named for him.

== Streeter in legend ==
During a storm on July 10, 1886, the former Mississippi River boat captain and circus owner ran his steamboat, the 35-ton &quot;Reutan&quot;, onto a sandbar off Chicago&#x27;s north shore near the foot of Superior Street.

Unable to move the vessel, which slowly silted into place, Streeter claimed it made up the independent &quot;United States District of Lake Michigan&quot; and thereby was not subject to the laws of Illinois or Chicago.

Ever since the downtown cleanup after the Great Fire in 1871, Lake Michigan had been used as a dump by building contractors looking to get rid of backfill and general rubble. Streeter invited such contractors to dump their rubble on the sandbar where the &quot;Reutan&quot; sat, extending the size of his land considerably. Over time, this landfill connected the &quot;Reutan&quot; to the city. As the landmass grew, collecting more dumped rubble as well as silt from the lake, Streeter began to issue deeds to the land to others who saw themselves as &quot;homesteaders&quot; in the growing city of Chicago. City planners and founders saw otherwise.

That summer, industrialist N.K. Fairbank, who claimed rights to the area, arrived to inform Streeter he was an illegal squatter and would have to leave. Streeter chased Fairbank off with a shotgun. Shortly thereafter, Streeter also chased away the constables who had come to evict him. Further attempts to remove them were met with gunfire and pots of scalding water. After one such raid resulted in his arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, Streeter was acquitted on the grounds that birdshot was not considered deadly.

Although Fairbank sued Streeter in 1890 and won, Streeter maintained his hold on the District, which was now home to prostitutes, the homeless and other &quot;undesirables.&quot; In 1892, it was estimated that the land was worth around $300,000, a substantial sum in that era.

During the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Streeter refloated the &quot;Reutan&quot; and used it to ferry passengers between Streeterville and the exposition grounds at Jackson Park.

From 1894 on, there were many attempts to forcibly remove Streeter from the district, often for violating laws that prohibited the sale of liquor on Sunday. In cases in which police were injured by axes and gunfire, Streeter and his men were invariably found not guilty due to acting in self-defense. Streeter&#x27;s fight for what he considered his land continued until his death on January 22, 1921, although he and his second wife had left Streeterville to move to East Chicago, Indiana, in 1918. The Streeters&#x27; heirs continued to lay claim on the land until April 1928, when the courts ruled in favor of Chicago Title and Trust. Despite all the bad blood, the mayor of Chicago attended Streeter&#x27;s funeral.

== Reality ==
Streeter was born in Flint, Michigan, in 1837. He served in the Civil War, but was not a captain. He was a salesman, the owner of a traveling circus, a logger, and a miner. After his first wife left him to join a vaudeville troupe, he moved to Chicago and acquired the steamship Reutan. He and his common-law wife planned to use the &quot;Reutan&quot; to run guns to Latin America. But fuel was expensive, and the distances great, and he saw an opportunity close by, in Chicago.

Streeter clearly lied about his discovery of the &quot;District of Lake Michigan&quot;. In 1886, he referenced a map published in 1821 to determine that his &quot;District&quot; was outside the city limits. A storm did not smash Streeter&#x27;s ship into a sandbar on the night of July 10, 1886. Weather reports for that night make no mention of a storm. Streeter did not really believe that he could fill in the shoreline and legally claim the new land. A witness in Streeter&#x27;s 1902 land fraud trial testified that Streeter had purposely set out to contest the claims of the wealthy shoreline owners. Contractor Hank Brusser told the court that Streeter asked him to fill in portions of the shoreline in order to create confusion over land titles. According to Brusser, Streeter said that: &quot;They (the owners of the shoreline) will have to buy us off&quot; and that &quot;We&#x27;ll get a million out of it&quot;. The recorder of the general land office, Chester H. Brush, testified that Streeter&#x27;s title was &quot;a clumsy forgery&quot; with signatures mismatched with offices. Silas Lamoreaux was commissioner and not recorder; Hoke Smith was Secretary of the Interior, not secretary to sign patents.

In reality, Streeter orchestrated an elaborate scheme to steal valuable shoreline property. He did not crash his ship on a sandbar, he piloted it to the foot of Superior Street and then obtained permission from the shoreline owner, Fairbank, to leave his ship there temporarily. He left it there for years. Streeter refused to move his ship insisting that he had title to the shoreline, producing a forged land title, concocted his story of crashing on a sandbar, and then proceeded to sell lots that he did not legally own. He even began collecting property taxes for the lots he sold and kept detailed tax records.

In 1893 police removed Streeter and his boat from Fairbank&#x27;s land. Streeter then moved to the posh Tremont Hotel from where he proceeded to expand his operations. He sold shoreline belonging to Fairbank, the William Ogden estate, the Farwell family, Potter Palmer, the Pine Street Land Association and the Chicago Title and Trust Company. In all, Streeter claimed to own of land between the mouth of the Chicago River and Oak Street. The reality was that the Lincoln Park Board had worked to fill in the shoreline in that area, so that they could build Lake Shore Drive on the infill.

Streeter continued to sell lots to people who either believed his story or believed his forged federal land grant. To bolster his claims, to pressure owners to pay him off, and to assuage those who had bought lots from him in earnest, Streeter staged a series of &quot;invasions&quot;, when he would lead a small group of squatters carrying shacks to the lake shore to quickly set up settlements. The shoreline owners would respond by sending thugs and/or police to evict them. Streeter would then vociferously complain that he was a victim of a capitalistic conspiracy to rob him of his land. This repeated itself again and again until Streeter was convicted of manslaughter, in 1902, and sent to prison. Streeter died at the age of 84, in 1921, of pneumonia.

The site of Streeter&#x27;s shanty is currently occupied by the John Hancock Center, and the surrounding Chicago neighborhood is known as Streeterville.

<text>Nikephoros I (; – 5 April 828) was a Byzantine writer and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 12 April 806 to 13 March 815.

== Life ==
He was born in Constantinople as the son of Theodore and Eudokia, of a strictly Orthodox family, which had suffered from the earlier Iconoclasm. His father Theodore, one of the secretaries of Emperor Constantine V, had been scourged and banished to Nicaea for his zealous support of Iconodules, and the son inherited the religious convictions of the father.

While still young Nicephorus was brought to the court, where he became an imperial secretary and entered the service of the Empire. Under Empress Irene of Athens he took part in the synod of 787 of Nicaea as imperial commissioner. He then withdrew to one of the cloisters that he had founded on the Thracian Bosporus. There he devoted himself to ascetic practices and to the study both of secular learning, as grammar, mathematics, and philosophy, and the Scriptures. Around 802 he was recalled and appointed director of the largest hospital for the destitute in Constantinople.

After the death of the Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, there was great division among the clergy and higher court officials as to the choice of his successor. Although still a layman, Nicephorus was chosen patriarch by the wish of the emperor (Easter, 12 April 806). The uncanonical choice met with opposition from the strictly clerical party of the Stoudites, and this opposition intensified into an open break when Nicephorus I, in other respects a very rigid moralist, showed himself compliant to the will of the emperor by reinstating the excommunicated priest Joseph.

After vain theological disputes, in December 814, there followed personal insults. Nicephorus I at first replied to his removal from his office by excommunication, but at last, under Emperor Leo V the Armenian was obliged to yield to force, and was taken to one of the cloisters he had founded, &quot;Tou Agathou&quot;, and later to that called &quot;Tou Hagiou Theodorou&quot;. From there he carried on a literary polemic for the cause of the iconodules against the synod of 815. On the occasion of the change of emperors, in 820, he was put forward as a candidate for the patriarchate and at least obtained the promise of toleration.

He died at the monastery of Saint Theodore (&quot;Hagiou Theodorou&quot;), revered as a confessor. His remains were solemnly brought back to Constantinople by Methodios I of Constantinople on 13 March 847 and interred in the Church of the Holy Apostles, where they were annually the object of imperial devotion. His feast is celebrated on this day both in the Greek and Roman Churches; the Greeks also observe 2 June as the day of his death.

== Works ==
Compared with Theodore the Studite, Nicephorus I appears as a friend of conciliation, learned in patristics, more inclined to take the defensive than the offensive, and possessed of a comparatively chaste, simple style. He was mild in his ecclesiastical and monastical rules and non-partisan in his historical treatment of the period from 602 to 769 (&quot;Historia syntomos, breviarium&quot;). He used the chronicle of Trajan the Patrician but deliberately chose not to name the source so as to connect himself to the historical tradition of Theophylact Simocatta. The &quot;Short History&quot; is thematically focused around the matter of the offices of emperor and patriarch. Nicephorus I attempted to salvage the reputation of the patriarchate by criticising iconoclast patriarchs for submitting to the emperor, not for being iconoclasts. Emperor Heraclius was the ideal emperor in Nicephorus I&#x27;s scheme because of how he worked alongside patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople, but also how Sergius I helped to defend Constantinople from the Avars in 626 as well as the patriarch&#x27;s ability to discipline the emperor for his marriage to his niece Martina. Heraclius failure to heed the Egyptian patriarch&#x27;s advice is what ultimately brought about the Arab conquest of Egypt.

His tables of universal history, &quot;Chronography&quot; or &quot;Chronographikon Syntomon&quot;, in passages extended and continued, were in great favor with the Byzantines, and were also circulated outside the Empire in the Latin version of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, and also in Slavonic translation. The &quot;Chronography&quot; offered a universal history from the time of Adam and Eve to his own time. To it he appended a canon catalog (which does not include the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; of John of Patmos). The catalog of the accepted books of the Old and New Testaments is followed by the &quot;antilegomena&quot; (including &quot;Revelation&quot;) and the apocrypha. Next to each book is the count of its lines, his Stichometry of Nicephorus, to which we can compare our accepted texts and judge how much has been added or omitted. This is especially useful for apocrypha for which only fragmentary texts have survived.

The principal works of Nicephorus I are three writings referring to iconoclasm:
* &quot;Apologeticus minor&quot;, probably composed before 814, an explanatory work for laymen concerning the tradition and the first phase of the iconoclastic movement;
* &quot;Apologeticus major&quot; with the three &quot;Antirrhetici&quot; against Mamonas-Constantine Kopronymos, a complete dogmatics of the belief in images, with an exhaustive discussion and refutation of all objections made in opposing writings, as well as those drawn from the works of the Church Fathers;
* The third of these larger works is a refutation of the iconoclastic synod of 815 (ed. Serruys, Paris, 1904).

Nicephorus I follows in the path of John of Damascus. His merit is the thoroughness with which he traced the literary and traditional proofs, and his detailed refutations are serviceable for the knowledge they afford of important texts adduced by his opponents and in part drawn from the older church literature.

<text>Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor and film director. After achieving success in the Western TV series &quot;Rawhide&quot;, Eastwood rose to international fame with his role as the &quot;Man with No Name&quot; in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; of spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

Eastwood&#x27;s greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (1978) and its action comedy sequel &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980). Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968), &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976) and &quot;Pale Rider&quot; (1985), the action-war film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), the prison film &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979), the war film &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; (1986), the action film &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993), and the romantic drama &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995). More recent works include &quot;Gran Torino&quot; (2008), &quot;The Mule&quot; (2018), and &quot;Cry Macho&quot; (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood&#x27;s company Malpaso Productions has produced all but four of his American films.

An Academy Award nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western film &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992) and his sports drama &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (2004). In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003) and the war film &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, as well as the legal thriller &quot;Juror #2&quot; (2024). He also directed the biographical films &quot;Changeling&quot; (2008), &quot;Invictus&quot; (2009), &quot;American Sniper&quot; (2014), &quot;Sully&quot; (2016), and &quot;Richard Jewell&quot; (2019).

Eastwood&#x27;s accolades include four Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, three César Awards, and an AFI Life Achievement Award. In 2000, he received the Italian Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Lion award, honoring his lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France&#x27;s highest civilian honors, he received the Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994, and the Legion of Honour in 2007.

== Early life ==

Eastwood was born on May 31, 1930, at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, to Ruth (née Margret Runner; 1909–2006) and Clinton Eastwood (1906–1970), who then lived in Oakland&#x27;s Lake Merritt neighborhood. During her son&#x27;s fame, Ruth was known by the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr. Eastwood was nicknamed &quot;Samson&quot; by hospital nurses because he weighed at birth. He has a younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (b. 1934). He is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry. Eastwood is descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger William Bradford, and through this line is the 12th generation born in North America. His family relocated three times during the 1930s as his father changed occupations. Contrary to what Eastwood has indicated in media interviews, they did not move between 1940 and 1949. Settling in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in an affluent area of the town, had a swimming pool, belonged to a country club, and each parent drove their own car. Eastwood&#x27;s father was a manufacturing executive at Georgia-Pacific for most of his working life. As Clint and Jeanne grew older, Ruth took a clerical job at IBM.

Eastwood attended Piedmont Middle School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores, and records indicate he also had to attend summer school. From January 1945 until at least January 1946, he attended Piedmont High School, but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard and burning an effigy on the school lawn, on top of other school infractions. He transferred to Oakland Technical High School and graduated on February 2, 1949.

Eastwood held a number of odd jobs, including lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University in 1951, but instead was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings. While returning from a prearranged tryst in Seattle, he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam to safety. Eastwood was discharged in February 1953.

== Career ==
=== 1954–1962: acting debut and &quot;Rawhide&quot; ===

According to a CBS press release for &quot;Rawhide&quot;, Universal-International&#x27;s camera crew was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director, although this is disputed by Eastwood&#x27;s unauthorized biographer, Patrick McGilligan. According to Eastwood&#x27;s official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Eastwood&#x27;s appearance and stature (then ), disapproved of his acting, remarking, &quot;He was quite amateurish. He didn&#x27;t know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything.&quot; Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood&#x27;s initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot;, but was rejected by Joseph Pevney. After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot; (1955), a sequel to the recently released &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin&#x27;s &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot;, won a role in February 1955, playing &quot;Jonesy&quot;, a sailor in &quot;Francis in the Navy&quot; and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, &quot;Tarantula&quot;, where he played a squadron pilot. In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours&#x27; work into the film &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with &quot;Law Man&quot;, also known as &quot;Star in the Dust&quot;, starring John Agar and Mamie Van Doren. Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Allen in Movieland&quot;, which starred comedian Steve Allen, actor Tony Curtis, and swing musician Benny Goodman. Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.

Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in &quot;The First Traveling Saleslady&quot; (1956) and later hired him for &quot;Escapade in Japan&quot; (1957), without a formal contract, Eastwood was struggling. On his financial advisor Irving Leonard&#x27;s advice, he switched to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in &quot;West Point&quot; series and a suicidal gold prospector on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of &quot;Navy Log&quot; and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as Red Hardigan on &quot;Maverick&quot; opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot; (1958) and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in &quot;Ambush at Cimarron Pass&quot; (also 1958): a film that Eastwood considers the low point of his career.

In 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates in the CBS hour-long western series &quot;Rawhide&quot;, the career breakthrough he had long sought. Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and cloddish for his comfort. Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958. It took just three weeks for &quot;Rawhide&quot; to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and, although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and peaked at number six in the ratings from October 1960 to April 1961. The &quot;Rawhide&quot; years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood&#x27;s career, often filming six days a week for an average of 12 hours a day, but some directors still criticized him for not working hard enough. By late 1963, &quot;Rawhide&quot; was beginning to decline in the ratings and lacked freshness in the scripts; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965–66 season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, but was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show&#x27;s first season, Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of &quot;Rawhide&quot;″s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.

=== 1963–1969: spaghetti Westerns and stardom ===
In late 1963, Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Rawhide&quot; co-star Eric Fleming rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964), filmed in a remote region of Spain by a then relatively unknown director, Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew that Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his &quot;Rawhide&quot; image. He signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks&#x27; work, with a bonus of a Mercedes-Benz automobile upon completion. Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;: &quot;In &quot;Rawhide&quot; I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero.&quot; Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character&#x27;s distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the &quot;mask&quot; he was attempting to create for the character.

&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film&#x27;s success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was rehired to star in &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; and the trilogy&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966), were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production, &quot;The Witches&quot; (&quot;Le Streghe&quot;, 1967), opposite De Laurentiis&#x27;s wife, Silvana Mangano. Eastwood&#x27;s 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please critics; one wrote, &quot;no other performance of his is quite so &#x27;un-Clintlike&#x27;&quot;.

Two months later Eastwood began work on &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. &quot;I know about these things&quot;, he said. &quot;Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can.&quot; Minutes later, confusion among the crew over the word &quot;Vaya!&quot; resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.

The &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; opened on January 18, followed by &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; on May 10, and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; on December 29. All three were commercially successful, particularly &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, which eventually earned $8 million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star being ranked for the first time on Quigley&#x27;s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1968 in fifth place. All three received poor reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics&#x27; respect. Judith Crist described &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; as &quot;cheapjack&quot;, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; called &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; &quot;excruciatingly dopey&quot;. Renata Adler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was &quot;the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine drew attention to the film&#x27;s wooden acting, especially Eastwood&#x27;s, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his coolness. Leone&#x27;s cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting.

Stardom brought Eastwood more roles. He signed to star in the American revisionist western &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968) alongside Inger Stevens, Pat Hingle, Ed Begley, playing a man who takes up a marshal&#x27;s badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead. The film earned Eastwood $400,000 and 25% of its net box office. Using money earned from the &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy, Eastwood&#x27;s advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood&#x27;s own production company, Malpaso Productions, named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwood&#x27;s property in Monterey County, California. The 38-year-old actor was still relatively unknown as late as a month prior to the film&#x27;s release, as evidenced by a July 1968 news item by syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners: &quot;The proverbial man in the street is still asking, &#x27;Who&#x27;s Clint Eastwood? Leonard arranged for &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; to be a joint production with United Artists; when it opened in August, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists&#x27; history. &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, who called it &quot;a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement&quot;.

Before &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;″s release, Eastwood had already begun working on &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; (1968), about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) through New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1 millionmore than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood&#x27;s close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who scored several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films.

Eastwood was paid $750,000 for the war epic &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), about a World War II squad parachuting into a Gestapo stronghold in the Alps. Richard Burton played the squad&#x27;s commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as Two-Face in the &quot;Batman&quot; television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.

Eastwood then branched out to star in the only musical of his career, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler&#x27;s less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film&#x27;s budget eventually exceeded $20 million, which was high for the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, but was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

=== 1970–1989: directorial debut and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; ===
Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; (1970), directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who becomes mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Eastwood again played a mysterious strangerunshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar. Although it received moderate reviews, the film is listed in &quot;The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. Around the same time, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steals a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (also 1970), with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas. &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions. Shot on location in Yugoslavia and London, the film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. Siegel directed Eastwood&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (1971), a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by Geraldine Page) of a Southern girls&#x27; school. Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood&#x27;s finest works by French critics. However, it grossed less than $1 million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the &quot;emasculated&quot; role of Eastwood.
Eastwood&#x27;s career reached a turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner&#x27;s &quot;Misty&quot;. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year&#x27;s Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Andrew Sarris in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, and Archer Winsten in the &quot;New York Post&quot; all praising the film, as well as Eastwood&#x27;s directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.

&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), written by Harry and Rita Fink, centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) police inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; has been described as being arguably Eastwood&#x27;s most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the &quot;loose-cannon cop&quot; genre. Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood&#x27;s role as Dirty Harry established the &quot;first true archetype&quot; of the action film genre. His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of .44 Magnum revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 carried by Harry Callahan. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, released in December 1971, earned $22 million in the United States and Canada. It was Siegel&#x27;s highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan. Although a number of critics praised Eastwood&#x27;s performance as Dirty Harry, such as Jay Cocks who described him as &quot;giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character&quot;, the film was also widely criticized as being fascistic. After having been second for the past two years, Eastwood was voted first in Quigley&#x27;s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1972 and again in 1973.

Following Sean Connery&#x27;s announcement that he would not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down, saying, &quot;that was someone else&#x27;s gig. That&#x27;s Sean&#x27;s deal. It didn&#x27;t feel right for me to be doing it.&quot; He next starred in the loner Western &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood&#x27;s performance.

Eastwood&#x27;s first western as director was &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; (1973), in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in &quot;Pale Rider&quot;. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory, influenced by Leone. The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box-office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood&#x27;s directing was &quot;as derivative as it was expressive&quot;, with Arthur Knight of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; remarking that Eastwood had &quot;absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society&quot;. John Wayne, who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film&#x27;s release in which he complained that, &quot;The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great.&quot;
Eastwood next turned his attention towards &quot;Breezy&quot; (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at 29, was nearly twice the character&#x27;s age. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1 million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. &quot;Breezy&quot; was not a major critical or commercial success.

Once filming of &quot;Breezy&quot; had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in &quot;Magnum Force&quot; (1973), a sequel to &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, about a group of rogue young officers (among them David Soul, Robert Urich, and Tim Matheson) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city&#x27;s worst criminals. Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1 million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper&#x27;s Frank Rich called it &quot;the same old stuff&quot;.

Eastwood teamed up with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974), a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4 million. Eastwood&#x27;s acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.
Eastwood&#x27;s next film &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975) was based on Trevanian&#x27;s critically acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman, an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last &quot;sanction&quot; in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald, Switzerland on August 12. Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. The film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality. Upon release in May 1975, &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2 million at the box-office, and gained mixed reviews. Joy Gould Boyum of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;brutal fantasy&quot;. Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film&#x27;s poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Brothers, through Frank Wells, that has lasted to the present day.

&quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976), a western inspired by Asa Carter&#x27;s 1972 novel of the same name, has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerrilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the American Civil War and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and Chief Dan George as an elderly Cherokee who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director Philip Kaufman was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood&#x27;s command in October 1975, three weeks into the shoot, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the Directors Guild of Americawho subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director. The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho during a six-day conference entitled &quot;Western Movies: Myths and Images&quot;. Invited to the screening were a number of well-known film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as King Vidor, William Wyler, and Howard Hawks; and a number of academics. Upon release in the summer of 1976 &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood&#x27;s role as an iconic one that related to America&#x27;s ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood&#x27;s portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the &quot;Dollars&quot; westerns and praised the film&#x27;s atmosphere. The film would later appear in &quot;Time&quot; &quot;Top 10 Films of the Year&quot;.

Eastwood was then offered the role of Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines. He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post&#x27;s Vietnam War film, &quot;Go Tell the Spartans&quot; and instead decided to make a third &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film, &quot;The Enforcer&quot; (1976). The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer (Tyne Daly) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film, culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island, was considerably shorter than the previous &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films at 95minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100 million worldwide to become Eastwood&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date.
Eastwood directed and starred in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977) opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. In this film, he portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it &quot;classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny&quot;. In &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (1978), he had an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. His character, Philo Beddoe, is a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his best friend, Orville Boggs (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood&#x27;s most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box-office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.

Eastwood starred in &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979), the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of Frank Lee Morris who, along with John and Clarence Anglin, escaped from the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1962. The film was a major success; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; praised it as &quot;crystalline cinema&quot; and Frank Rich of &quot;Time&quot; described it as &quot;cool, cinematic grace&quot;.

Eastwood directed and played the title role in &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; (1980), alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Filming commenced on October 1, 1979, in the Boise metropolitan area and was shot in five and a half weeks on a budget of $5 million. Eastwood has cited &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood&#x27;s most self-referential character. The film was a commercial disappointment, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that film was &quot;the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while&quot;, and praised Eastwood&#x27;s directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Released later in 1980, &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; was the sequel to &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; and also starring Eastwood. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as &quot;funnier and even better than its predecessor&quot;. In theaters over the Christmas season, &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.

Eastwood directed and starred in &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot; (1982), based on the eponymous Clancy Carlile&#x27;s depression-era novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis, but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son Kyle) to Nashville, Tennessee, where he is supposed to record a song. Only &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy. Nevertheless, the film received a more positive reception in France, where it was compared to John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Around the same time, Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the Cold War-themed &quot;Firefox&quot; (also 1982). Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas, the film was shot before but released after &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot;. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20 million, it was Eastwood&#x27;s highest budget film to that time. &quot;People&quot; magazine likened Eastwood&#x27;s performance to &quot;Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harry&#x27;s Soul&quot;.

Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film, &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983), which is considered the darkest and most violent of the series. By this time, Eastwood received 60 percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio. &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays a middle-aged painter who, along with her sister, was gang-raped years before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister&#x27;s now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot; (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema&#x27;s immortal lines. It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress, and used during the 1984 presidential elections. The film was the second most commercially successful of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, after &quot;The Enforcer&quot;, earning $70 million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.

&quot;Tightrope&quot; (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite Geneviève Bujold in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target&#x27;s tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. &quot;Tightrope&quot; was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy &quot;City Heat&quot; (also 1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about an ex-cop turned private eye and his former police lieutenant partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the Prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50 million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;.

Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; episode &quot;Vanessa in the Garden&quot; (1985), which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke as a married couple. This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg, who later co-produced &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;. He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in &quot;Pale Rider&quot; (1985), a film based on the classic western &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood&#x27;s western &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; (1973) in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; remarking, &quot;This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist.&quot;

Eastwood co-starred with Marsha Mason in the military drama &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; (1986), about the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada. He portrayed a United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant veteran of the Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense, which had expressed contempt for the film. At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times. The film grossed $70 million domestically.

Eastwood starred in &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; (1988), the fifth and final film in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series. It co-starred Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson, and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called &quot;Dead Pool&quot;. The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; grossed nearly $38 million, relatively low receipts for a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed &quot;Bird&quot; (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award. However, &quot;Bird&quot; was a commercial failure, earning just $11 million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; (1989). The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman (Bernadette Peters) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband&#x27;s prized pink Cadillac. The film failed both critically and commercially, earning barely more than &quot;Bird&quot; and marking a low point in Eastwood&#x27;s career.

=== 1990–2009: critical acclaim and awards success ===
Eastwood directed and starred in &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel&#x27;s &quot;roman à clef&quot;, about John Huston and the making of the classic film &quot;The African Queen&quot;. Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4 million. Eastwood directed and co-starred with Charlie Sheen in &quot;The Rookie&quot;, a buddy cop action film released in December 1990. Critics found the film&#x27;s plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman&#x27;s car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant&#x27;s legal fees if she did not appeal.

Eastwood revisited the western genre in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), a film which he directed and starred in as an aging ex-gunfighter long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as &quot;The Cut-Whore Killings&quot; and &quot;The William Munny Killings&quot;, but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films. &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford&#x27;s 1956 &quot;The Searchers&quot;&quot;. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards (including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples), and won four, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. In June 2008 &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was ranked as the fourth-best American western, behind &quot;Shane&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, and &quot;The Searchers&quot; in the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10&quot; list.

Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993), directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy&#x27;s life. The film was among the top 10 box office performers in that year, earning $102 million in the United States alone, and 25 years after he was first listed on Quigley&#x27;s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, Eastwood was voted number one again. A few months after film wrapped, Eastwood directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in &quot;A Perfect World&quot; (also 1993). Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits the road with a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood&#x27;s directing career, and the film has since been cited as one of his most underrated directorial achievements.

At the May1994 Cannes Film Festival Eastwood received France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal, and on March 27, 1995, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the 67th Academy Awards. His next film appearance was in a cameo role as himself in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Casper&quot; (1995). He expanded his repertoire by playing opposite Meryl Streep in &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (also 1995). Based on the novel by Robert James Waller, the film relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for &quot;National Geographic&quot; who, while photographing historic covered bridges in Iowa, meets and has an affair with an Italian-born farm wife, Francesca (Streep). Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; film was a commercial and critical success. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Streep and Eastwood weave a spell, and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age.&quot; The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture and won a César Award in France for Best Foreign Film. Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.

Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997), alongside Gene Hackman (with whom he had appeared in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;). Eastwood played the role of a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret Service cover-up of a murder. The film received a mixed reception from critics. Later in 1997, Eastwood directed &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, based on the novel by John Berendt and starring John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Jude Law. The film met with a mixed critical response.

Eastwood directed and starred in &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by Isaiah Washington). &quot;True Crime&quot; received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though.&quot; The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55 million budget and was Eastwood&#x27;s worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot;, which had a limited release.

Eastwood directed and starred in &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000) alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Eastwood played one of a group of veteran ex-test pilots sent into space to repair an old Soviet satellite. The original music score was composed by Eastwood and Lennie Niehaus. &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; was critically well-received and holds a 79 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes, although Roger Ebert wrote that the film was, &quot;too secure within its traditional story structure to make much seem at risk&quot;. The film grossed more than $90 million in its United States release, more than Eastwood&#x27;s two previous films combined. Eastwood played an ex-FBI agent chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thriller &quot;Blood Work&quot; (2002), loosely based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly. The film was a commercial failure, grossing just $26.2 million on an estimated budget of $50 million and received mixed reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes describing it as, &quot;well-made but marred by lethargic pacing&quot;.

Eastwood directed and scored the crime drama &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003), a film dealing with themes of murder, vigilantism and sexual abuse and starring Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. The film was praised by critics and won two Academy Awards – Best Actor for Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Robbins – with Eastwood garnering nominations for Best Director and Best Picture. The film grossed $90million domestically on a budget of $30million. In 2003, Eastwood was named Best Director of the Year by the National Society of Film Critics.

The following year, Eastwood found further critical acclaim with &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;. The boxing drama won four Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Hilary Swank) and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). At age 74, Eastwood became the oldest of eighteen directors to have directed two or more Best Picture winners. He also received a nomination for Best Actor, as well as a Grammy nomination for his score, and won a Golden Globe for Best Director, which was presented to him by daughter Kathryn, who was Miss Golden Globe at the 2005 ceremony. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and the best film of the year.

Eastwood directed two films about World War II&#x27;s Battle of Iwo Jima released in 2006. The first, &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood&#x27;s son Scott. This was followed by &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;, which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers on the island and the letters they wrote home to family members. &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.
Eastwood next directed &quot;Changeling&quot; (2008), based on a true story set in the late 1920s. Angelina Jolie stars as a woman reunited with her missing son only to realize he is an impostor. After its release at several film festivals the film grossed over $110 million, the majority of which came from foreign markets. The film was highly acclaimed, with Damon Wise of &quot;Empire&quot; describing &quot;Changeling&quot; as &quot;flawless&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine described it as &quot;emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed&quot; and that the film&#x27;s characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an &quot;almost breathtaking deliberation&quot;. For the film, Eastwood received nominations for Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, Best Direction at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and director of the year from the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle.

Eastwood ended a four-year &quot;self-imposed acting hiatus&quot; by appearing in &quot;Gran Torino&quot; (also 2008), which he also directed, produced and partly scored with his son Kyle and Jamie Cullum. Biographer Marc Eliot called Eastwood&#x27;s role &quot;an amalgam of the Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, and William Munny, here aged and cynical but willing and able to fight on whenever the need arose&quot;. &quot;Gran Torino&quot; grossed almost $30 million during its opening weekend release in January 2009, the highest of his career as an actor or director. &quot;Gran Torino&quot; eventually grossed over $268 million in theaters worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of Eastwood&#x27;s career so far (without adjustment for inflation).

Eastwood&#x27;s 30th directorial outing came with &quot;Invictus&quot; (2009), a film based on the story of the South African team at the 1995 Rugby World Cup with Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, Matt Damon as rugby team captain François Pienaar, and Grant L. Roberts as Ruben Kruger. The film was met with generally positive reviews; Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars and described it as a &quot;very good film... with moments evoking great emotion&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; Todd McCarthy wrote, &quot;Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood&#x27;s film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.&quot; For the film, Eastwood was nominated for Best Director at the 67th Golden Globe Awards.

=== 2010–present: directorial focus and later roles ===
In the Eastwood-directed &quot;Hereafter&quot; (2010), he again worked with Matt Damon, who portrayed a psychic. The film had its world premiere on September 12, 2010, at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited release later in October. &quot;Hereafter&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with the consensus at Rotten Tomatoes being, &quot;Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood&#x27;s typical flair as director, &quot;Hereafter&quot; fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.&quot; Around the same time, Eastwood served as executive producer for a TCM documentary about jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, &quot;Dave Brubeck: In His Own Sweet Way&quot; (also 2010), to commemorate Brubeck&#x27;s 90th birthday.

Eastwood directed &quot;J. Edgar&quot; (2011), a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. The film received mixed reviews, although DiCaprio&#x27;s performance as Hoover was widely praised. Roger Ebert wrote that the film is &quot;fascinating&quot;, &quot;masterful&quot;, and praised DiCaprio&#x27;s performance. David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, while also praising DiCaprio, wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s too bad &quot;J. Edgar&quot; is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings.&quot; Eastwood starred in the baseball drama &quot;Trouble with the Curve&quot; (2012), as a veteran baseball scout who travels with his daughter for a final scouting trip. Robert Lorenz, who worked with Eastwood as an assistant director on several films, directed the film.

During Super Bowl XLVI, Eastwood narrated a halftime advertisement for Chrysler titled &quot;Halftime in America&quot; (2012). The advertisement was criticized by several U.S. Republicans, who claimed it implied that President Barack Obama deserved a second term. In response to the criticism, Eastwood stated, &quot;I am certainly not politically affiliated with Mr. Obama. It was meant to be a message about job growth and the spirit of America.&quot;

Eastwood next directed &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; (2014), a musical biography based on the Tony Award-winning musical. The film told the story of the musical group The Four Seasons. Eastwood directed &quot;American Sniper&quot; (also 2014), a film adaptation of Chris Kyle&#x27;s eponymous memoir, following Steven Spielberg&#x27;s departure from the project. The film was released on December 25, 2014. &quot;American Sniper&quot; grossed more than $350 million domestically and over $547 million globally, making it one of Eastwood&#x27;s biggest movies commercially. His next film, &quot;Sully&quot;, starred Tom Hanks as Chesley Sullenberger, who successfully landed the US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in an emergency landing, keeping all passengers on board alive. Released in the United States in September 2016, it became another commercial success for Eastwood, grossing over $238 million worldwide. He directed the biographical thriller &quot;The 15:17 to Paris&quot; (2018), which saw previously non-professional actors Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos playing themselves as they stop the 2015 Thalys train attack. The film received a generally negative reception from critics, who were largely critical of the acting by the three leads. Eastwood next starred in and directed &quot;The Mule&quot;, which was released in December 2018. He played Earl Stone, an elderly drug smuggler based on Leo Sharp, Eastwood&#x27;s first acting role since &quot;Trouble with the Curve&quot; in 2012.

In May 2019, it was announced that Eastwood would direct &quot;The Ballad of Richard Jewell&quot;, based on the life of heroic security guard Richard Jewell, who was wrongly suspected in the 1996 Olympic bombing. Later retitled simply &quot;Richard Jewell&quot;, Eastwood directed and produced the film, through Warner Bros., his tenth straight film with the company. Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio were originally set to star in the film in 2014, when it was to be directed by Paul Greengrass, but DiCaprio and Hill would ultimately serve only as producers on Eastwood&#x27;s film. The film stars Paul Walter Hauser in the titular role, along with Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, and Olivia Wilde in supporting roles. Filming began on June 24, 2019, and &quot;Richard Jewell&quot; was released on December 13, 2019.

In October 2020, it was announced that Eastwood would direct, produce, and star in &quot;Cry Macho&quot;, an adaptation of the 1975 novel of the same name, for Warner Bros. Pictures. Production of the film took place in New Mexico between November and December 2020. It was released on September 17, 2021, to mixed reviews and commercial failure.

In April 2023, reports emerged that Eastwood would direct and produce &quot;Juror #2&quot;, from a screenplay by Jonathan Abrams. The film stars Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Zoey Deutch, Kiefer Sutherland, and J.K. Simmons. Production began in June 2023, but was temporarily suspended due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, resuming in November 2023. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and released in November 2024, to generally favorable reviews. It has been rumored that &quot;Juror #2&quot; may be Eastwood&#x27;s final directorial role.

== Directorial style ==
Beginning with the thriller &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, musicals and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s David Denby wrote that, unlike Eastwood,

From the very early days of his career, Eastwood was frustrated by directors&#x27; insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors&#x27; rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take. Eastwood&#x27;s rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, and Jean-Luc Godard. When acting in others&#x27; films, he sometimes takes over directing, such as for &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, if he believes production is too slow. In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses storyboards for developing the layout of a shooting schedule. He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film, considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers. Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film&#x27;s plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not &quot;so much that it insults their intelligence&quot;.

According to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;Eastwood&#x27;s style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic.&quot; Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter commented that Eastwood&#x27;s films are &quot;superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative&quot;, while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood&#x27;s pacing &quot;unrushed and relaxed&quot;. Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his films a &quot;noir-ish&quot; feel.

Eastwood&#x27;s frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood&#x27;s work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.

== Politics ==
Eastwood is a former Republican who has sometimes supported Democrats, and has long shown an interest in California politics; he is currently a registered Libertarian.

He won election as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, in April 1986. He earned $200 per month in that position which he donated to the Carmel Youth Center. While in office, he helped to make ice cream legal to consume on city streets, added public restrooms to the public beach, and a city library annex building was built. He served for two years and declined to run for a second term. In 2001, Governor Gray Davis appointed him to the California State Park and Recreation Commission, where he led opposition to an extension of the toll six-lane extension of the California State Route 241 toll road through San Onofre State Beach.

Eastwood endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He delivered a primetime address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, where he drew attention for a speech he delivered to an empty chair representing President Barack Obama, which he later regretted. On February 22, 2020, Eastwood announced that he would be endorsing Democrat Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 presidential election. Eastwood stated that he wishes that Trump would act &quot;in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level.&quot;

== Musical interests ==

Eastwood is an aficionado of jazz—particularly bebop, and blues, country and western and classical music. He dabbled in music early on by developing as a boogie-woogie pianist and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959, Eastwood produced the album &quot;Cowboy Favorites&quot;, released on the Cameo label, which included some classics such as Bob Wills&#x27;s &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;. Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1963, Cameo producer Kal Mann told him that &quot;he would never make it big as a singer&quot;. Nevertheless, during the off season of filming &quot;Rawhide&quot;, Eastwood and Paul Brinegarsometimes joined by Sheb Wooleytoured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs, earned them as much as $15,000 a performance. Although he never made it as a major performing artist, he has passed on the influence to his son, Kyle, who is a professional jazz bassist and composer. An audiophile, Eastwood owns an extensive collection of LPs which he plays on a Rockport turntable. His favorite musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson.

Eastwood has his own Warner Bros. Records-distributed imprint, Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers. This deal was unchanged when Warner Music Group was sold by Time Warner to private investors. Malpaso Records, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood&#x27;s films from &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; onward, has also released the album of a 1996 jazz concert he hosted, titled &quot;Eastwood after Hours – Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;. He composed the film scores of &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;Grace Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Changeling&quot;, &quot;Hereafter&quot;, &quot;J. Edgar&quot;, and the original piano compositions for &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;. He wrote and performed the song heard over the credits of &quot;Gran Torino&quot; and also co-wrote &quot;Why Should I Care&quot; with Linda Thompson and Carole Bayer Sager, a song recorded in 1999 by Diana Krall.

The music in &quot;Grace Is Gone&quot; received two Golden Globe nominations by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the 65th Golden Globe Awards. Eastwood was nominated for Best Original Score, while the song &quot;Grace is Gone&quot; with music by Eastwood and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager was nominated for Best Original Song. It won the Satellite Award for Best Song at the 12th Satellite Awards. &quot;Changeling&quot; was nominated for Best Score at the 14th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards, Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, and Best Music at the 35th Saturn Awards. On September 22, 2007, Eastwood was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music at the Monterey Jazz Festival, on which he serves as an active board member. Upon receiving the award he gave a speech claiming, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the great honors I&#x27;ll cherish in this lifetime.&quot;

The scoring stage at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank was renamed the Eastwood Scoring Stage in the 1990s.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and children ===

Twice divorced, Eastwood has had numerous casual and serious relationships of varying length and intensity over his life, many of which overlapped. He has eight known children by six women, only half of whom were contemporaneously acknowledged. Eastwood refuses to confirm his exact number of offspring, and there have been wide discrepancies in the media regarding the number. He is closed to discussing his families with the media, stating, &quot;they&#x27;re vulnerable people. I can protect myself, but they can&#x27;t.&quot; His biographer, Patrick McGilligan, has stated on camera that Eastwood&#x27;s total number of children is indeterminate and that &quot;one was when he was still in high school&quot;.

Eastwood&#x27;s first marriage was to manufacturing secretary-turned-fitness instructor Margaret Neville Johnson in December 1953, having met her on a blind date the previous May. During the courtship, he had an affair that resulted in his daughter Laurie (born 1954), who was adopted by Clyde and Helen Warren of Seattle. While the identity of Laurie&#x27;s biological mother is not public record, McGilligan said the mother belonged to a theatre group Eastwood participated in. Eastwood continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 1959 to 1973 liaison with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter, Kimber (born 1964). Tunis and Eastwood would keep up a &quot;healthy relationship&quot; until her death in 2023.

Johnson tolerated the open marriage with Eastwood, and eventually they had two children, Kyle (born 1968) and Alison (born 1972). In 1975, Eastwood and married actress-director Sondra Locke began living together; she had been in a marriage of convenience since 1967 with Gordon Leigh Anderson, an unemployed homosexual. Locke claimed that Eastwood sang &quot;She Made Me Monogamous&quot; to her and confided he had &quot;never been in love before&quot;. Eastwood finally divorced Johnson in 1984; Locke, however, would remain married to Anderson until her death in 2018. According to Bill Brown, publisher of the &quot;Carmel Pine Cone&quot;, Eastwood considered Locke the love of his life, yet he has never addressed her death.

In an unpublicized affair, Eastwood sired two legally fatherless children, Scott (born 1986) and Kathryn (born 1988) with Jacelyn Reeves, a flight attendant. When Locke and Eastwood separated in 1989, Locke filed a palimony lawsuit and later sued for fraud, reaching a settlement in both cases. During the early-to-mid-1990s, Eastwood had a relationship with actress Frances Fisher that produced a daughter, Francesca (born 1993). Eastwood was married for the second time in 1996 to news anchor Dina Ruiz, who gave birth to their daughter Morgan that same year. Ruiz and Eastwood&#x27;s marriage lasted until 2014.

Beginning 2014, Eastwood was seen in company with restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, though neither publicly confirmed a romance. Eastwood&#x27;s spokespeople, managers, and press agents have long denied any knowledge of his life. Sandera died of a heart attack in July 2024, aged 61. By the fall of that year, Eastwood was in a new relationship, though his partner has not been identified.

=== Health and leisure activities ===
Eastwood has been a health and fitness fanatic since he was a teenager. During the production of &quot;Rawhide&quot;, Eastwood featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In an August 1959 edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, take vitamins, and avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.

Eastwood&#x27;s father&#x27;s death from a heart attack at the age of 64 in 1970, described by Fritz Manes as &quot;the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life&quot;, came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on his life; from then on he became more productive, working with greater speed and efficiency on set, and adopted an even more rigorous health regimen. Despite abstaining from hard liquor, he opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog&#x27;s Breath Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1971. Eastwood eventually sold the pub in 1999 and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.

Eastwood is an avid golfer and owns the Tehàma Golf Club. He is an investor in the world-renowned Pebble Beach Golf Links west of Carmel and donates his time to charitable causes at major tournaments. Eastwood is an FAA licensed fixed wing and rotary craft private pilot and often flies his helicopter to the studios to avoid traffic.

=== Spiritual beliefs and meditation===
In 1973, Eastwood told the film critic Gene Siskel, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t believe in God&quot;. In 2023, his daughter Kathryn stated, &quot;Most of my earthly family do not believe in or worship God. They either have a lack of faith or reject the god in the Bible in favor of other idols or ideas.&quot; Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature (as suggested by his Western, &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, 1985), stating that &quot;I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were Protestant, but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, &#x27;I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that&#x27;s something you like&#x27;. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.&quot; He has also said: &quot;It would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to do the best you can by the gift you&#x27;re given of life and that alone.&quot;

In 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in Transcendental Meditation when he appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation. He has meditated every morning for years.

=== Real estate interests ===
While serving in the US Army at nearby Fort Ord, Eastwood developed an interest in Carmel area real estate. With income from his acting career, on December 24, 1967, he bought five parcels totaling of land from Charles Sawyer along Highway 1 near Malpaso Creek, south of the Carmel Highlands.

In May 1968, Eastwood and actor James Garner bought of wooded land in Carmel Valley from the Howard Hattan estate for $640,000. The property was across the Carmel Valley Road from the Rancho Cañada Country Club and golf course. Eastwood and Garner donated the undeveloped property to the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey in November 1983 with the stipulation that some of the land be used for senior housing.

He named his production company Malpaso Productions. Eastwood later bought another parcel in the Highlands, together totaling (6 parcels). In 1995, Monterey County bought the Malpaso land from him for $3.08 million and placed a permanent conservation easement on the property. Using the proceeds from the sale, Eastwood bought the Odello Ranch at the mouth of the Carmel River during the same year. He paid to lower the levees along the southern side of the Carmel River to protect the Mission Ranch resort he owned, along with the neighboring Mission Fields residential neighborhood on the north side of the river, both of which were flooded in 1994. In 1997, Eastwood and his former wife Maggie Johnson (acting as the Eastwood Trust) donated of the Odello Ranch property east of Highway 1 to the Big Sur Land Trust along with the associated water rights. On June 28, 2016, Eastwood finally donated the remaining Odello East land.
Eastwood purchased , known as the Cañada Woods development, immediately east of the Odello Ranch.

In 2010, at age 80, Eastwood spent approximately $20 million to build himself a compound in Carmel-by-the-Sea. His California real estate portfolio also includes a Spanish-style mansion in Bel-Air, the Rising River Ranch near Cassel, an apartment in Burbank, a Desert modern home in La Quinta (sometimes misidentified as Palm Springs), as well as a large but understated house located next door to his longtime primary Bel-Air residence. Eastwood is known to have purchased property in two other states. He owns a house in Sun Valley, Idaho, and a 1.13-acre, oceanfront manor in Kihei, Hawaii. The latter was featured in an episode of the 2012 reality show &quot;Mrs. Eastwood &amp; Company&quot;.

Eastwood previously occupied homes in Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Tiburon, and Pebble Beach.

<doc id="43375" wikidata="Q324530" url="?curid=43375" title="Communitarianism">
<text>Communitarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the connection between the individual and the community. Its overriding philosophy is based on the belief that a person&#x27;s social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a family, communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history. Communitarianism is often contrasted with individualism, and opposes &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies that deprioritize the stability of the overall community.

== Terminology ==
The philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term &quot;communitarian&quot; was coined in 1841, by John Goodwyn Barmby, a leader of the British Chartist movement, who used it in referring to utopian socialists and other idealists who experimented with communal styles of life. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term &quot;communitarianism&quot; gained currency through association with the work of a small group of political philosophers. Their application of the label &quot;communitarian&quot; was controversial, even among communitarians, because, in the West, the term evokes associations with the ideologies of socialism and collectivism; so, public leaders—and some of the academics who champion this school of thought—usually avoid the term &quot;communitarian&quot;, while still advocating and advancing the ideas of communitarianism.

The term is primarily used in two senses:
* Philosophical communitarianism considers classical liberalism to be ontologically and epistemologically incoherent, and opposes it on those grounds. Unlike classical liberalism, which construes communities as originating from the voluntary acts of pre-community individuals, it emphasizes the role of the community in defining and shaping individuals. Communitarians believe that the value of community is not sufficiently recognized in liberal theories of justice.
* Ideological communitarianism is characterized as a radical centrist ideology that is sometimes marked by socially conservative and economically interventionist policies. This usage was coined recently. When the term is capitalized, it usually refers to the Responsive Communitarian movement of Amitai Etzioni and other philosophers.
Czech and Slovak philosophers like Marek Hrubec, Lukáš Perný and Luboš Blaha extend communitarianism to social projects tied to the values and significance of community or collectivism and to various types of communism and socialism (Christian, scientific, or utopian), including:
* Historical roots of collectivist projects from Plato, through François-Noël Babeuf, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Charles Fourier, Robert Owen to Karl Marx
* Contemporary theoretical communitarianism (Michael J. Sandel, Michael Walzer, Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor), originating in the 1980s
** Pro-liberal, pro-multicultural (Walzer, Taylor)
** Anti-liberal, pro-national (Sandel, MacIntyre)
* The vision of practical, self-sustaining communities as described by Thomas More (&quot;Utopia&quot;), Tommaso Campanella () and practised by Christian Utopians (Jesuit Reduction) or utopian socialists like Charles Fourier (List of Fourierist Associations in the United States), Robert Owen (List of Owenite communities in the United States). This line includes various forms of cooperatives, self-help institutions, or communities (Hussite communities, The Diggers, Habans, Hutterites, Amish, Israeli kibbutz, Slavic community; examples include the Twelve Tribes communities, Tamera (Portugal), Marinaleda (Spain), the monastic state of Mount Athos and the Catholic Worker Movement).

== Origins ==
While the term communitarian was coined only in the mid-nineteenth century, ideas that are communitarian in nature appeared much earlier. They are found in some classical socialist doctrines (e.g. writings about the early commune and about workers&#x27; solidarity), and further back in the New Testament. Communitarianism has been traced back to early monasticism.

A number of early sociologists had strongly communitarian elements in their work, such as Ferdinand Tönnies in his comparison of Gemeinschaft (oppressive but nurturing communities) and Gesellschaft (liberating but impersonal societies), and Emile Durkheim&#x27;s concerns about the integrating role of social values and the relations between the individual and society. Both authors warned of the dangers of anomie (normlessness) and alienation in modern societies composed of atomized individuals who had gained their liberty but lost their social moorings. Modern sociologists saw the rise of mass society and the decline of communal bonds and respect for traditional values and authority in the United States as of the 1960s. Among those who raised these issues were Robert Nisbet (Twilight of Authority), Robert N. Bellah &quot;Habits of the Heart&quot;, and Alan Ehrenhalt (The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America). In his book Bowling Alone (2000), Robert Putnam documented the decline of &quot;social capital&quot; and stressed the importance of &quot;bridging social capital,&quot; in which bonds of connectedness are formed across diverse social groups.

In the twentieth century communitarianism also began to be formulated as a philosophy by Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker movement. In an early article the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; clarified the dogma of the Mystical Body of Christ as the basis for the movement&#x27;s communitarianism. Along similar lines, communitarianism is also related to the personalist philosophy of Emmanuel Mounier.

Responding to criticism that the term &#x27;community&#x27; is too vague or cannot be defined, Amitai Etzioni, one of the leaders of the American communitarian movement, pointed out that communities can be defined with reasonable precision as having two characteristics: first, a web of affect-laden relationships among a group of individuals, relationships that often crisscross and reinforce one another (as opposed to one-on-one or chain-like individual relationships); and second, a measure of commitment to a set of shared values, norms, and meanings, and a shared history and identity – in short, a particular culture. Further, author David E. Pearson argued that &quot;[t]o earn the appellation &#x27;community,&#x27; it seems to me, groups must be able to exert moral suasion and extract a measure of compliance from their members. That is, communities are necessarily, indeed, by definition, coercive as well as moral, threatening their members with the stick of sanctions if they stray, offering them the carrot of certainty and stability if they don&#x27;t.&quot;

What is specifically meant by &quot;community&quot; in the context of communitarianism can vary greatly between authors and periods. Historically, communities have been small and localized. However, as the reach of economic and technological forces extended, more expansive communities became necessary to provide effective normative and political guidance to these forces, prompting the rise of national communities in Europe in the 17th century. Since the late 20th century there has been some growing recognition that the scope of even these communities is too limited, as many challenges that people now face, such as the threat of nuclear war and that of global environmental degradation and economic crises, cannot be handled on a national basis. This has led to the quest for more encompassing communities, such as the European Union. Whether truly supra-national communities can be developed is far from clear.

More modern communities can take many different forms, but are often limited in scope and reach. For example, members of one residential community are often also members of other communities – such as work, ethnic, or religious ones. As a result, modern community members have multiple sources of attachments, and if one threatens to become overwhelming, individuals will often pull back and turn to another community for their attachments. Thus, communitarianism is the reaction of some intellectuals to the problems of Western society, an attempt to find flexible forms of balance between the individual and society, the autonomy of the individual and the interests of the community, between the common good and freedom, rights, and duties.

== Academic communitarianism ==
Whereas the classical liberalism of the Enlightenment can be viewed as a reaction to centuries of authoritarianism, oppressive government, overbearing communities, and rigid dogma, modern communitarianism can be considered a reaction to excessive individualism, understood as an undue emphasis on individual rights, leading people to become selfish or egocentric.

The close relation between the individual and the community was discussed on a theoretical level by Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor, among other academic communitarians, in their criticisms of philosophical liberalism, especially the work of the American liberal theorist John Rawls and that of the German Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. They argued that contemporary liberalism failed to account for the complex set of social relations that all individuals in the modern world are a part of. Liberalism is rooted in an untenable ontology that posits the existence of generic individuals and fails to account for social embeddedness. To the contrary, they argued, there are no generic individuals but rather only Germans or Russians, Berliners or Muscovites, or members of some other particularistic community. Because individual identity is partly constructed by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. Thus, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles decided behind Rawls&#x27; veil of ignorance, because individuals cannot exist in such an abstracted state, even in principle.

Academic communitarians also contend that the nature of the political community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively dangerous. Good societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures—they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.

In addition to Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, other thinkers sometimes associated with academic communitarianism include Michael Walzer, Alasdair MacIntyre, Seyla Benhabib, Shlomo Avineri, and Patrick J. Deneen.

=== Social capital ===
Beginning in the late 20th century, many authors began to observe a deterioration in the social networks of the United States. In the book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, Robert Putnam observed that nearly every form of civic organization has undergone drops in membership exemplified by the fact that, while more people are bowling than in the 1950s, there are fewer bowling leagues.

This results in a decline in &quot;social capital&quot;, described by Putnam as &quot;the collective value of all &#x27;social networks&#x27; and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other&quot;. According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy.

Communitarians seek to bolster social capital and the institutions of civil society. The Responsive Communitarian Platform described it thus:

Many social goals require partnerships between public and private groups. Though the government should not seek to replace local communities, it may need to empower them by strategies of support, including revenue-sharing and technical assistance. There is a great need for study and experimentation with creative use of the structures of civil society, and public-private cooperation, especially where the delivery of health, educational and social services are concerned.

=== Positive rights ===
Important to some supporters of communitarian philosophy is the concept of positive rights, which are rights or guarantees to certain things. These may include state-subsidized education, state-subsidized housing, a safe and clean environment, universal health care, and even the right to a job with the concomitant obligation of the government or individuals to provide one. To this end, communitarians generally support social security programs, public works programs, and laws limiting such things as pollution.

A common objection is that by providing such rights, communitarians violate the negative rights of the citizens; rights to &quot;not&quot; have something done for you. For example, taxation to pay for such programs as described above dispossesses individuals of property. Proponents of positive rights, by attributing the protection of negative rights to the society rather than the government, respond that individuals would not have any rights in the absence of societies—a central tenet of communitarianism—and thus have a responsibility to give something back to it. Some have viewed this as a negation of natural rights. However, what is or is not a &quot;natural right&quot; is a source of contention in modern politics, as well as historically; for example, whether or not universal health care, private property or protection from polluters can be considered a birthright.

Alternatively, some agree that negative rights may be violated by a government action, but argue that it is justifiable if the positive rights protected outweigh the negative rights lost.

Still, other communitarians question the very idea of natural rights and their place in a properly functioning community. They claim that instead, claims of rights and entitlements create a society unable to form cultural institutions and grounded social norms based on shared values. Rather, the liberalist claim to individual rights leads to a morality centered on individual emotivism, as ethical issues can no longer be solved by working through common understandings of the good. The worry here is that not only is society individualized, but so are moral claims.

== Responsive communitarianism movement ==
In the early 1990s, in response to the perceived breakdown in the moral fabric of society engendered by excessive individualism, Amitai Etzioni and William A. Galston began to organize working meetings to think through communitarian approaches to key societal issues. This ultimately took the communitarian philosophy from a small academic group, introduced it into public life, and recast its philosophical content.

Deeming themselves &quot;responsive communitarians&quot; in order to distinguish the movement from authoritarian communitarians, Etzioni and Galston, along with a varied group of academics (including Mary Ann Glendon, Thomas A. Spragens, James Fishkin, Benjamin Barber, Hans Joas, Philip Selznick, and Robert N. Bellah, among others) drafted and published The Responsive Communitarian Platform based on their shared political principles, and the ideas in it were eventually elaborated in academic and popular books and periodicals, gaining thereby a measure of political currency in the West. Etzioni later formed the Communitarian Network to study and promote communitarian approaches to social issues and began publishing a quarterly journal, &quot;The Responsive Community&quot;.

The main thesis of responsive communitarianism is that people face two major sources of normativity: that of the common good and that of autonomy and rights, neither of which in principle should take precedence over the other. This can be contrasted with other political and social philosophies which derive their core assumptions from one overarching principle (such as liberty/autonomy for libertarianism). It further posits that a good society is based on a carefully crafted balance between liberty and social order, between individual rights and personal responsibility, and between pluralistic and socially established values.

Responsive communitarianism stresses the importance of society and its institutions above and beyond that of the state and the market, which are often the focus of other political philosophies. It also emphasizes the key role played by socialization, moral culture, and informal social controls rather than state coercion or market pressures. It provides an alternative to liberal individualism and a major counterpoint to authoritarian communitarianism by stressing that strong rights presume strong responsibilities and that one should not be neglected in the name of the other.

Following standing sociological positions, communitarians assume that the moral character of individuals tends to degrade over time unless that character is continually and communally reinforced. They contend that a major function of the community, as a building block of moral infrastructure, is to reinforce the character of its members through the community&#x27;s &quot;moral voice&quot;, defined as the informal sanction of others, built into a web of informal affect-laden relationships, which communities provide.

=== Influence ===
Responsive communitarians have been playing a considerable public role, presenting themselves as the founders of a different kind of environmental movement, one dedicated to shoring up society (as opposed to the state) rather than nature. Like environmentalism, communitarianism appeals to audiences across the political spectrum, although it has found greater acceptance with some groups than others.

Although communitarianism is a small philosophical school, it has had considerable influence on public dialogues and politics. There are strong similarities between communitarian thinking and the Third Way, the political thinking of centrist Democrats in the United States, and the Neue Mitte in Germany. Communitarianism played a key role in Tony Blair&#x27;s remaking of the British socialist Labour Party into &quot;New Labour&quot; and a smaller role in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaigns. Other politicians have echoed key communitarian themes, such as Hillary Clinton, who has long held that to raise a child takes not just parents, family, friends and neighbors, but a whole &quot;village&quot;.

It has also been suggested that the compassionate conservatism espoused by President Bush during his 2000 presidential campaign was a form of conservative communitarian thinking, although he did not implement it in his policy program. Cited policies have included economic and rhetorical support for education, volunteerism, and community programs, as well as a social emphasis on promoting families, character education, traditional values, and faith-based projects.

President Barack Obama gave voice to communitarian ideas and ideals in his book &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot;, and during the 2008 presidential election campaign he repeatedly called upon Americans to &quot;ground our politics in the notion of a common good,&quot; for an &quot;age of responsibility,&quot; and for foregoing identity politics in favor of community-wide unity building. However, for many in the West, the term communitarian conjures up authoritarian and collectivist associations, so many public leaders – and even several academics considered champions of this school – avoid the term while embracing and advancing its ideas.

Reflecting the dominance of liberal and conservative politics in the United States, no major party and few elected officials openly advocate communitarianism. Thus there is no consensus on individual policies, but some that most communitarians endorse have been enacted. Nonetheless, there is a small faction of communitarians within the Democratic Party; prominent communitarians include Bob Casey Jr., Joe Donnelly, and Claire McCaskill. Many communitarian Democrats are part of the Blue Dog Coalition. It is quite possible that the United States&#x27; right-libertarian ideological underpinnings have suppressed major communitarian factions from emerging.

Dana Milbank, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, remarked of modern communitarians, &quot;There is still no such thing as a card-carrying communitarian, and therefore no consensus on policies. Some, such as John DiIulio and outside Bush adviser Marvin Olasky, favor religious solutions for communities, while others, like Etzioni and Galston, prefer secular approaches.&quot;

In August 2011, the right-libertarian &quot;Reason Magazine&quot; worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone. The Reason-Rupe poll found that &quot;Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the &#x27;liberal&#x27; or &#x27;conservative&#x27; groups&quot;. Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.

A similar Gallup survey in 2011 included possible centrist/moderate responses. That poll reported that 17% expressed conservative views, 22% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, 17% expressed centrist views, and 24% expressed liberal views. The organization used the terminology &quot;the bigger the better&quot; to describe communitarianism.

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, founded and led by Imran Khan, is considered the first political party in the world which has declared communitarianism as one of their official ideologies.

== Comparison to other political philosophies ==

Early communitarians were charged with being, in effect, social conservatives. However, many contemporary communitarians, especially those who define themselves as responsive communitarians, fully realize and often stress that they do not seek to return to traditional communities, with their authoritarian power structure, rigid stratification, and discriminatory practices against minorities and women. Responsive communitarians seek to build communities based on open participation, dialogue, and truly shared values. Linda McClain, a critic of communitarians, recognizes this feature of the responsive communitarians, writing that some communitarians do &quot;recognize the need for careful evaluation of what is good and bad about [any specific] tradition and the possibility of severing certain features . . . from others.&quot; And R. Bruce Douglass writes, &quot;Unlike conservatives, communitarians are aware that the days when the issues we face as a society could be settled on the basis of the beliefs of a privileged segment of the population have long since passed.&quot;

One major way the communitarian position differs from the social conservative one is that although communitarianism&#x27;s ideal &quot;good society&quot; reaches into the private realm, it seeks to cultivate only a limited set of core virtues through an organically developed set of values rather than having an expansive or holistically normative agenda given by the state. For example, American society favors being religious over being atheist, but is rather neutral with regard to which particular religion a person should follow. There are no state-prescribed dress codes, &quot;correct&quot; number of children to have, or places one is expected to live, etc. In short, a key defining characteristic of the ideal communitarian society is that in contrast to a liberal state, it creates shared formulations of the good, but the scope of this good is much smaller than that advanced by authoritarian societies.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Liberal theorists, such as Simon Caney, disagree that philosophical communitarianism has any interesting criticisms to make of liberalism. They reject the communitarian charges that liberalism neglects the value of community, and holds an &quot;atomized&quot; or asocial view of the self.

According to Peter Sutch the principal criticisms of communitarianism are:
# that communitarianism leads necessarily to moral relativism;
# that this relativism leads necessarily to a re-endorsement of the status quo in international politics; and
# that such a position relies upon a discredited ontological argument that posits the foundational status of the community or state.

Other critics emphasize close relation of communitarianism to neoliberalism and new policies of dismantling the welfare state institutions through development of the third sector.

<text>The Boston Celtics ( ) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league&#x27;s original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL&#x27;s Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history and hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.

The Celtics&#x27; rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team&#x27;s player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969.

In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the &quot;Big Three&quot; of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the &quot;Showtime&quot; Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones against the Lakers. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s.

After another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new &quot;Big Three&quot; around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013–14 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by &quot;The Jays&quot;, the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship.

The &quot;Celtics&quot; nickname and the team&#x27;s mascot &quot;Lucky the Leprechaun&quot; are nods to Boston&#x27;s historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century. The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams&#x27; rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.

==History==
===1946–1950: Early years===
The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League. In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player. Chuck Connors of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.

===1950–1958: Arrival of Bob Cousy and Red Auerbach===

The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach. In the franchise&#x27;s early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was &quot;too flashy&quot;. Cousy&#x27;s contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags, but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft.

After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft. After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell. Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn. Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade. With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title. In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.

===1958–1969: Decade-long dynasty===

Following the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade. In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships. During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom &#x27;Satch&#x27; Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn. The Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.

Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach&#x27;s ploy to keep Russell interested. With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics&#x27; string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time. Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons. The team&#x27;s run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history, with Russell&#x27;s 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player.

===1969–1978: Rebuilding and further success===

The 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed. The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship. Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game&#x27;s second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years.

In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell. &quot;Cornbread&quot; Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach&#x27;s job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as Havlicek, the Celtics&#x27; all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.

The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft. Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird&#x27;s rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr. Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for &quot;Tiny&quot; Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes. The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team&#x27;s future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.

===1979–1992: Larry Bird era===
The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown&#x27;s decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979, in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise. Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach. Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager. The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53. Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team&#x27;s momentum.
Larry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season. With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo, a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft. He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.

After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team&#x27;s two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish and the Warriors&#x27; first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. The &quot;Big Three&quot; of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together, and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.

Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81. Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets, with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.

Following the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games. In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks; afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.

In 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. Boston came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president. He was succeeded by Jan Volk.

In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning. This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics&#x27; success in 1986.

The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era. Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose. Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship. They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games.

In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston&#x27;s hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford.

Under Ford&#x27;s leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992.

===1993–1998: Tragedy and decline===
The loss of Bird and the aging of the team&#x27;s other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode. Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston&#x27;s Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston&#x27;s four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets. An examination revealed heart problems, but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season. The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35. With McHale having retired after the Celtics&#x27; playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston&#x27;s original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish&#x27;s signing with Charlotte. The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark.

In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team&#x27;s new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston&#x27;s first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics&#x27; final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record.

Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team&#x27;s president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997. Pitino&#x27;s appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.

The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft, and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks. Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year, and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.

===1998–2013: Paul Pierce era===

The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics&#x27; 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals. However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable &quot;walking through that door&quot; speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory. He resigned in January 2001.

Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O&#x27;Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s record to finish the season was 24–24. Following the 2000–01 season O&#x27;Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics.

The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team&#x27;s success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.

====2003–2007: New ownership and arrival of Doc Rivers====
In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime. Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics&#x27; guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk). In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch, and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.
The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season, having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce&#x27;s career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak.

The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team&#x27;s revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe. The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle. The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak. At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.

==== 2007–2012: Pierce, Allen, and Garnett &quot;Big Three&quot; era====
In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle&#x27;s second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU&#x27;s Glen &quot;Big Baby&quot; Davis. The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett. These moves created a new &quot;Big Three&quot; of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.
In the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.

For the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce&#x27;s dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP. With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.

The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history. They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak. After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.

In 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars&#x27; minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record. Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play. For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six, and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games.

During the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Jermaine O&#x27;Neal. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s presence wound up leading to Perkins&#x27; departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury and had a 19–3 record in games when O&#x27;Neal played over 20 minutes. Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed. The 2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.

The Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions.

The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year &quot;Big Three&quot; era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins. The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.

===2013–2016: Rebuilding years===
During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn. The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.
On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach. Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season marked the Celtics&#x27; first missed playoffs since the &quot;Big Three&quot;.

The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks. A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics, leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture, and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining. However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.

In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the Hawks, ending their season.

===2016–present: Brown–Tatum era (&quot;the Jays&quot;)===

In the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford. The Celtics finished the 2016–17 season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference. After a hip injury ended Thomas&#x27; playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick. They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks. The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward. On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets&#x27; 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.

====2017-2019: Kyrie Irving saga====
By the end of the off-season, only four Celtics&#x27; players remained from the 2016–17 team, with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team&#x27;s opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg, causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season. Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams&#x27; history. The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.

The Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record. Analysts started questioning the team&#x27;s performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018. The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10. During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team. The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs. In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.

The Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year). During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston. On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick. On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.

====2019-2021: Rise of &quot;the Jays&quot; ====
Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games. Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.

====2021-22: First Finals appearance for the Jays====
On June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement. On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick. On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics. Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland.

In April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason. They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.

====2022-23: Conference finals loss====
In September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer. Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach. On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team&#x27;s permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break. After overcoming a 3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston.

====2023-24: 18th championship for Boston====

During the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal, and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks. On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks. On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.

The Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record. After the regular season&#x27;s close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics&#x27; victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career. The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who have 17).

==Rivalries==

===Los Angeles Lakers===

The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA&#x27;s best rivalry. The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in . They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.

The Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four.

The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history.

===Atlanta Hawks===
The Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals. While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.

===Brooklyn Nets===
The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics who claimed Martin was a &quot;fake&quot; tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics&#x27; fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of &quot;Wife Beater!&quot; in response to Kidd&#x27;s 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, &quot;Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.&quot; Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the &quot;beginning of the next great NBA rivalry&quot; during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett&#x27;s shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.

===Detroit Pistons===

The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in and their championship seasons of and . Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.

===New York Knicks===

The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA&#x27;s Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.

===Philadelphia 76ers===
The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15. The 76ers are considered the Celtics&#x27; biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.

===Washington Wizards===
One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984, the rivalry intensified during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall&#x27;s nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied &quot;If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.&quot;

In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford&#x27;s ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats. In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk&#x27;s shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4. No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017.

===Miami Heat===

The Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston&#x27;s Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games.

==Coaches==

===Head coaches===
There have been 18 head coaches in Celtics&#x27; history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise&#x27;s head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics&#x27; legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.

==Logos and uniforms==

===Logos===

The Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach. Through the 1995–96 season, the logo&#x27;s only colors were green, white and black. Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky&#x27;s face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.

The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters &quot;Celtics&quot; above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.

===Uniforms===

====Primary uniforms====

For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics&#x27; uniforms was formalized in the team&#x27;s early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.

Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).

When Nike became the NBA&#x27;s uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the &quot;Association&quot; uniforms while the green uniforms became the &quot;Icon&quot; uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.

In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the &quot;exclusive Data and Analytics partner&quot; for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms. Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics&#x27; uniforms.

In November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team. In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team&#x27;s jersey sponsor.

====Alternate uniforms====

From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word &quot;Boston&quot; on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.

A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed &quot;Parquet Pride&quot;, the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas&#x27; NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.

For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black &quot;Statement&quot; uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league&#x27;s third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with &quot;Celtics&quot; in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the &quot;Statement&quot; uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.

====Special uniforms====
Between 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick&#x27;s Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front. For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates. In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping.

During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words &quot;Boston&quot; on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack.

At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season&#x27;s championship team.

The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping.

Starting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition &quot;City&quot; uniforms designed by Nike. Their first &quot;City&quot; uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach&#x27;s signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.

For the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white &quot;City&quot; uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach&#x27;s signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline. In addition, the Celtics wore an &quot;Earned&quot; edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the &quot;City&quot; uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team&#x27;s warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.

The Celtics&#x27; &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized &quot;Boston&quot; wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.

The 2020–21 Celtics&#x27; &quot;City&quot; uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach&#x27;s signature and quote &quot;The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They&#x27;re a way of life.&quot; appears above the manufacturer&#x27;s tag. The Celtics also released a second &quot;Earned&quot; uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.

The Celtics&#x27; green &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise&#x27;s initial uniforms; the left side contained the team&#x27;s 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original &quot;jumping leprechaun&quot; logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 &quot;City&quot; uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.

The 2022–23 &quot;City&quot; uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the &quot;Celtics&quot; wordmark inspired by the Slade&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell&#x27;s championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell&#x27;s jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.

The &quot;City&quot; uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker&#x27;s marks from Boston&#x27;s history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game. In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the &quot;City&quot; uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the &quot;BOSTON&quot; wordmark.

For the 2024–25 &quot;City&quot; uniform, the Celtics built upon last season&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured &quot;Action green&quot; (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers.

====Memorial patches====
During the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname &quot;Red&quot; in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.

The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07), Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18), John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 (later replaced with a dedicated memorial patch), and the death of Isaiah Thomas&#x27; younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs.

In the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.

====Uniform traditions====
The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.

Prior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick&#x27;s Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents. Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers.

The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams.

==Television and radio==

NBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics&#x27; main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision&#x27;s original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast&#x27;s current ownership of NBCUniversal.

As of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst.

All Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group&#x27;s WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as &quot;The Sports Hub&quot;), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season. It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network.

Long-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team&#x27;s radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024.

<doc id="43377" wikidata="Q189474" url="?curid=43377" title="Keratin">
<text>Keratin () is one of a family of structural fibrous proteins also known as &quot;scleroproteins&quot;. It is the key structural material making up scales, hair, nails, feathers, horns, claws, hooves, and the outer layer of skin in vertebrates. Keratin also protects epithelial cells from damage or stress. Keratin is extremely insoluble in water and organic solvents. Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. Excessive keratinization participate in fortification of certain tissues such as in horns of cattle and rhinos, and armadillos&#x27; osteoderm. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin.
Keratin comes in two types: the primitive, softer forms found in all vertebrates and the harder, derived forms found only among sauropsids (reptiles and birds).

Spider silk is classified as keratin, although production of the protein may have evolved independently of the process in vertebrates.

== Examples of occurrence ==

Alpha-keratins (α-keratins) are found in all vertebrates. They form the hair (including wool), the outer layer of skin, horns, nails, claws and hooves of mammals, and the slime threads of hagfish. The baleen plates of filter-feeding whales are also made of keratin. Keratin filaments are abundant in keratinocytes in the hornified layer of the epidermis; these are proteins which have undergone keratinization. They are also present in epithelial cells in general. For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells react with antibodies for keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14. These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets of mouse thymic epithelial cells in genetic studies of the thymus.

The harder beta-keratins (β-keratins) are found only in the sauropsids, i.e., all living reptiles and birds. They are found in the nails, scales, and claws of reptiles, in some reptile shells (Testudines), and in the feathers, beaks, and claws of birds. These keratins are formed primarily in beta sheets. However, beta sheets are also found in α-keratins.
Recent scholarship has shown that sauropsid β-keratins are fundamentally different from α-keratins at a genetic and structural level. The new term &quot;corneous beta protein&quot; (CBP) has been proposed to avoid confusion with α-keratins.

Keratins (also described as cytokeratins) are polymers of type I and type II intermediate filaments that have been found only in chordates (vertebrates, amphioxi, urochordates). Nematodes and many other non-chordate animals seem to have only type VI intermediate filaments, fibers that structure the nucleus.

== Genes ==

The human genome encodes 54 functional keratin genes, located in two clusters on chromosomes 12 and 17. This suggests that they originated from a series of gene duplications on these chromosomes.

The keratins include the following proteins of which KRT23, KRT24, KRT25, KRT26, KRT27, KRT28, KRT31, KRT32, KRT33A, KRT33B, KRT34, KRT35, KRT36, KRT37, KRT38, KRT39, KRT40, KRT71, KRT72, KRT73, KRT74, KRT75, KRT76, KRT77, KRT78, KRT79, KRT8, KRT80, KRT81, KRT82, KRT83, KRT84, KRT85 and KRT86 have been used to describe keratins past 20.

== Protein structure ==
The first sequences of keratins were determined by Israel Hanukoglu and Elaine Fuchs (1982, 1983). These sequences revealed that there are two distinct but homologous keratin families, which were named type I and type II keratins. By analysis of the primary structures of these keratins and other intermediate filament proteins, Hanukoglu and Fuchs suggested a model in which keratins and intermediate filament proteins contain a central ~310 residue domain with four segments in α-helical conformation that are separated by three short linker segments predicted to be in beta-turn conformation. This model has been confirmed by the determination of the crystal structure of a helical domain of keratins.

=== Type I and II keratins ===
The human genome has 54 functional annotated keratin genes, of which 28 are type I keratins and 26 are type II keratins. 
Fibrous keratin molecules supercoil to form a very stable, left-handed superhelical motif to multimerise, forming filaments consisting of multiple copies of the keratin monomer.

The major force that keeps the coiled-coil structure is hydrophobic interactions between apolar residues along the keratin&#x27;s helical segments.

Limited interior space is the reason why the triple helix of the (unrelated) structural protein collagen, found in skin, cartilage and bone, likewise has a high percentage of glycine. The connective tissue protein elastin also has a high percentage of both glycine and alanine. Silk fibroin, considered a β-keratin, can have these two as 75–80% of the total, with 10–15% serine, with the rest having bulky side groups. The chains are antiparallel, with an alternating C → N orientation. A preponderance of amino acids with small, nonreactive side groups is characteristic of structural proteins, for which H-bonded close packing is more important than chemical specificity.

===Disulfide bridges===
In addition to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the distinguishing feature of keratins is the presence of large amounts of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, required for the disulfide bridges that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally stable crosslinking—in much the same way that non-protein sulfur bridges stabilize vulcanized rubber. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair and skin are due to the volatile sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the insolubility of keratins, except in a small number of solvents such as dissociating or reducing agents.

The more flexible and elastic keratins of hair have fewer interchain disulfide bridges than the keratins in mammalian fingernails, hooves and claws (homologous structures), which are harder and more like their analogs in other vertebrate classes. Hair and other α-keratins consist of α-helically coiled single protein strands (with regular intra-chain H-bonding), which are then further twisted into superhelical ropes that may be further coiled. The β-keratins of reptiles and birds have β-pleated sheets twisted together, then stabilized and hardened by disulfide bridges.

Thiolated polymers (thiomers) can form disulfide bridges with cysteine substructures of keratins getting covalently attached to these proteins. Thiomers therefore exhibit high binding properties to keratins found in hair, on skin and on the surface of many cell types.

===Filament formation===
It has been proposed that keratins can be divided into &#x27;hard&#x27; and &#x27;soft&#x27; forms, or &#x27;cytokeratins&#x27; and &#x27;other keratins&#x27;. That model is now understood to be correct. A new nuclear addition in 2006 to describe keratins takes this into account.

Keratin filaments are intermediate filaments. Like all intermediate filaments, keratin proteins form filamentous polymers in a series of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF) capable of annealing end-to-end into long filaments.

===Pairing===

== Cornification ==
Cornification is the process of forming an epidermal barrier in
stratified squamous epithelial tissue. At the cellular level,
cornification is characterised by:
* production of keratin
* production of small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins and transglutaminase which eventually form a cornified cell envelope beneath the plasma membrane
* terminal differentiation
* loss of nuclei and organelles, in the final stages of cornification
Metabolism ceases, and the cells are almost completely filled by keratin. During the process of epithelial differentiation, cells become cornified as keratin protein is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate filaments. Eventually the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles disappear, metabolism ceases and cells undergo a programmed death as they become fully keratinized. In many other cell types, such as cells of the dermis, keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function as part of the cytoskeleton to mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress. It does this through connections to desmosomes, cell–cell junctional plaques, and hemidesmosomes, cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.

Cells in the epidermis contain a structural matrix of keratin, which makes this outermost layer of the skin almost waterproof, and along with collagen and elastin gives skin its strength. Rubbing and pressure cause thickening of the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis and form protective calluses, which are useful for athletes and on the fingertips of musicians who play stringed instruments. Keratinized epidermal cells are constantly shed and replaced.

These hard, integumentary structures are formed by intercellular cementing of fibers formed from the dead, cornified cells generated by specialized beds deep within the skin. Hair grows continuously and feathers molt and regenerate. The constituent proteins may be phylogenetically homologous but differ somewhat in chemical structure and supermolecular organization. The evolutionary relationships are complex and only partially known. Multiple genes have been identified for the β-keratins in feathers, and this is probably characteristic of all keratins.

==Silk==

The silk fibroins produced by insects and spiders are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.

Silk found in insect pupae, and in spider webs and egg casings, also has twisted β-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates. The structure of the spinnerets on spiders&#x27; tails, and the contributions of their interior glands, provide remarkable control of fast extrusion. Spider silk is typically about 1 to 2 micrometers (μm) thick, compared with about 60 μm for human hair, and more for some mammals. The biologically and commercially useful properties of silk fibers depend on the organization of multiple adjacent protein chains into hard, crystalline regions of varying size, alternating with flexible, amorphous regions where the chains are randomly coiled. A somewhat analogous situation occurs with synthetic polymers such as nylon, developed as a silk substitute. Silk from the hornet cocoon contains doublets about 10 μm across, with cores and coating, and may be arranged in up to 10 layers, also in plaques of variable shape. Adult hornets also use silk as a glue, as do spiders.

==Clinical significance==
Abnormal growth of keratin can occur in a variety of conditions including keratosis, hyperkeratosis and keratoderma.

Mutations in keratin gene expression can lead to, among others:
* Alopecia areata
* Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
* Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens
* Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis
* Steatocystoma multiplex
* Keratosis pharyngis
* Rhabdoid cell formation in large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype

Several diseases, such as athlete&#x27;s foot and ringworm, are caused by infectious fungi that feed on keratin.

Keratin is highly resistant to digestive acids if ingested. Cats regularly ingest hair as part of their grooming behavior, leading to the gradual formation of hairballs that may be expelled orally or excreted. In humans, trichophagia may lead to Rapunzel syndrome, an extremely rare but potentially fatal intestinal condition.

===Diagnostic use===
Keratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in anaplastic cancers. Tumors that express keratin include carcinomas, thymomas, sarcomas and trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore, the precise expression-pattern of keratin subtypes allows prediction of the origin of the primary tumor when assessing metastases. For example, hepatocellular carcinomas typically express CK8 and CK18, and cholangiocarcinomas express CK7, CK8 and CK18, while metastases of colorectal carcinomas express CK20, but not CK7.

<text>Lund Municipality () is a municipality in Scania County, southern Sweden. Its seat is the city of Lund.

As most municipalities in Sweden, the territory of municipality consists of many former local government units, united in a series of amalgamations. The number of original entities (as of 1863) is 22. At the time of the nationwide municipal reform of 1952 the number had been reduced to six. In 1967 the rural municipality &quot;Torn&quot; (itself created in 1952) was added to Lund. The &quot;City of Lund&quot; was made a unitary municipality in 1971 and amalgamated with &quot;Dalby&quot;, &quot;Genarp&quot;, &quot;Södra Sandby&quot; and &quot;Veberöd&quot; in 1974 completing the process. Since 2016, the municipality is subdivided into 16 districts for the purposes of population and land registration.

Dalby Söderskog, one of Sweden&#x27;s national parks, is located within the municipality near Dalby. The municipal bird of Lund is the Eurasian penduline tit.

==Localities==

There are nine urban areas in Lund Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Lund Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 127,202 residents, including 93,503 Swedish citizens of voting age. 57.1% voted for the left coalition and 41.4% for the right coalition. This was in stark contrast to the rest of the Skåne Southern constituency, that was won by the right with a sizeable margin. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== Municipal council ==
In the 2018 municipal election, no bloc was able to gain control of the executive, a five-party minority coalition consisting of the four Alliance parties and local party FörNyaLund was formed as a result. Philip Sandberg of the Liberals heads the executive. The election results are presented in the table below. The turnout was 86.37%.

<doc id="43379" wikidata="Q219433" url="?curid=43379" title="Ballista">
<text>The ballista (Latin, from Greek βαλλίστρα &quot;ballistra&quot; and that from βάλλω &quot;ballō&quot;, &quot;throw&quot;), plural ballistae or ballistas, sometimes called bolt thrower, was an ancient missile weapon that launched either bolts or stones at a distant target.

Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs instead of a tension prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow). The springs consisted of several loops of twisted skeins. Early versions projected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. It developed into a smaller precision weapon, the &quot;scorpio&quot;, and possibly the &quot;polybolos&quot;.

== Greek weapon ==

The early ballistae in Ancient Greece were developed from two weapons called oxybeles and gastraphetes. The gastraphetes (&#x27;belly-bow&#x27;) was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon that, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armored troops. The oxybeles were a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch and were mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.

With the invention of the torsion spring bundle, the first ballistae could now be built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance. By contrast, the comparatively slow relaxation time of the bow or prod of a conventional crossbow such as the oxybeles meant that much less energy could be transferred to light projectiles, limiting the effective range of the weapon.

The earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for Dionysius of Syracuse, 400 BC.

The Greek ballista was a siege weapon. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armored, mobile siege towers or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under Philip II of Macedon, and even more so under his son Alexander, that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns. There is even a claim that it was Philip II with his team of engineers who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius&#x27;s device, which was merely an oversized slingshot. It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles. Polybius reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called scorpions, during the Second Punic War.

Ballistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt quickly to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.

As the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a universal joint (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista&#x27;s stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.

== Roman weaponry ==



After the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.

The Romans adopted the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from Pergamon, which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.

The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.

=== Early Roman ballistae ===
The early Roman &quot;ballistae&quot; were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the bolts or stone &quot;shot&quot;. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of &#x27;winches&#x27; and a &#x27;claw&#x27;, used to ratchet the bowstring back to the armed firing position.

The slider passed through the &quot;field frames&quot; of the weapon, in which were located the &quot;torsion springs&quot; (rope made of animal sinew), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.

Drawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.

The &quot;ballista&quot; was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballistarii), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over , but the effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.

The Romans continued the development of the &quot;ballista&quot;, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the Roman Empire.

It was used, just before the start of the Empire, by Julius Caesar during his conquest of Gaul and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.

==== First invasion of Britain ====
The first of Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practical to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.

A total of eighty means of transport, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British charioteers and javeliners were making it difficult.

Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships – which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance – to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy&#x27;s right flank, from which position men on deck could use the slings, bows, and artillery to drive them back. This maneuver was highly successful.&lt;br&gt; Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. (Caesar, &quot;The Conquest of Gaul&quot;, p.99)

==== Siege of Alesia ====

In Gaul, the stronghold of Alesia was under a Roman siege in 52 BC, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden palisade and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small &quot;ballistae&quot; were placed in the towers with other troops armed with bows or slings. The use of the &quot;ballista&quot; in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the Siege of Masada.

=== Ballistae in the Roman Empire ===
During the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.

After Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named &quot;ballista fulminalis&quot; in &quot;De rebus bellicis&quot;: &quot;From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River.&quot; Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after AD 350, at least 22 semi-circular towers were erected around the walls of Londinium (London) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.

=== Eastern Roman Empire ===

During the 6th century, Procopius described the effects of this weapon:
But Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call &quot;ballistae&quot;. Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force...

The missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:

And at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.

==== Carroballista ====
The carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the &quot;cheiroballistra&quot; class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on Trajan&#x27;s Column.

==== Polybolos ====
It has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a &#x27;repeating&#x27; ballista, also known as a &quot;polybolos&quot;. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, &quot;What the Romans Did For Us&quot;, showed that they &quot;were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated&quot;. However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.

==== Cheiroballistra and manuballista ====
The cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon. The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire predominantly used Greek, which added an extra &#x27;r&#x27; to the word ballista.

The manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient gastraphetes, but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.

=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===
Archaeology, and in particular experimental archaeology has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as Vegetius) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.

Attempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognise certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.

Sites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.

The most influential archaeologists in this area have been Peter Connolly and Eric Marsden, who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.

== Middle Ages ==
With the decline of the Roman Empire, resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was likely supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper onager and the more efficient springald.

However, while it remained less and less popular as more efficient siege engines such as the trebuchet and the mangonel became widespread, the Ballista still retained some use in Medieval Siege Warfare, especially by city and castle garrisons, until it became finally extinguished by the more convenient medieval canons, already omnipresent in all major European Catholic cities by the first half of the 14th century.

The Littere Wallie records the existence of 4 &quot;balistas ad turrimi&quot; at &quot;Duluithelan&quot; [Dolwyddelan] Castle in 1280, one &quot;balistam de tur&quot; at &quot;Rothelano&quot;[Rhuddlan] castle and one &quot;magnam ballistam&quot; at &quot;Bere Blada&quot; Castle [Castell y Bere?] in 1286. These all being held under the authority of the English Crown.

In remote and seemingly &quot;savage&quot; places like Ireland, however, where cannons were rare and personal firearms were almost non-existent, ballistae had recorded use well into late 15th century. 

While not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as arbalest crossbows (&quot;arcus&quot; &#x27;bow&#x27; + ballista).

<text>A trebuchet () is a type of catapult that uses a rotating arm with a sling attached to the tip to launch a projectile. It was a common powerful siege engine until the advent of gunpowder. The design of a trebuchet allows it to launch projectiles of greater weights and further distances than that of a traditional catapult.

There are two main types of trebuchet. The first is the &quot;traction trebuchet&quot;, or mangonel, which uses manpower to swing the arm. It first appeared in China by the 4th century BC. It spread westward, possibly by the Avars, and was adopted by the Byzantines, Persians, Arabs, and other neighboring peoples by the sixth to seventh centuries AD.

The later, and often larger and more powerful, counterweight trebuchet, also known as the counterpoise trebuchet, uses a counterweight to swing the arm. It appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the 12th century, and was carried back to China by the Mongols in the 13th century.

==Etymology and terminology==
The numerous forms of the word that appeared during the 13th century, including &quot;trabocco&quot;, &quot;tribok&quot;, &quot;tribuclietta&quot;, and &quot;trubechetum&quot;, have obscured the origin of the term. In Arabic the counterweight trebuchet was called &quot;manjaniq maghribi&quot; or &quot;majaniq ifranji&quot;. In China it was called the &quot;húihúi pào&quot; (Muslim trebuchet).

The English word &quot;trebuchet&quot; is first mentioned in the 14th century (13th century in Anglo-Latin) as &quot;medieval stone-throwing engine of war&quot;. It is borrowed from (Old) French &quot;trebuchet&quot; (now &quot;trébuchet&quot;).

The French word is from the verbal root of &quot;trebucher&quot; (now &quot;trébucher&quot;) : &quot;trebuch-&quot; + diminutive noun suffix &quot;-et&quot;, &quot;trebucher&quot; (10th century) meant &quot;to overthrow, to bring down&quot;, then and now &quot;to stumble&quot;, maybe earlier &quot;to rock&quot; or &quot;to tilt&quot;. It is a compound of (Old) French &quot;tre(s)-&quot;, variant form &quot;tra-&quot; (now &quot;tré-&quot; / &quot;tra-&quot;) from Latin &quot;trans&quot; expressing &quot;displacement&quot; in that case + Old French &quot;buc&quot; &quot;trunk of the body, bulk&quot;, itself from Old Low Franconian &quot;*būk-&quot; &quot;belly&quot; similar to Old High German &quot;buh&quot;, German &quot;Bauch&quot; &quot;belly&quot;.

The earliest appearance of the term &quot;trebuchet&quot; in French dates to the late 12th century and the first attestations of &quot;trebuchet&quot; as a siege weapon are from around the year 1200. The 1174-77 edition of &quot;Roman de Renart&quot;, an epic about &quot;Renard the Fox&quot;, describes it as a &quot;trap whose trigger mechanism consists of an assembly of balanced logs&quot; (understood as animal trap by 1375) while the ca. 1200 edition describes it as a &quot;war engine that throws stones to break down walls&quot;. The word &quot;trabuchellus&quot; appeared alongside &quot;manganum&quot; and &quot;prederia&quot; in a document in Vicenza on . &quot;Trabucha&quot; is found a decade later with &quot;predariae&quot; at the siege of Castelnuovo Bocca d&#x27;Adda in an account by Iohannes Codagnellus. It is unclear, however, whether these referred to counterweight trebuchets. Codagnellus did not specify a specific type of engine with the term and even implied that they were &quot;fairly light in subsequent references&quot;. Only in the late 1210s do variations of &quot;trebuchet&quot; in sources, described as increasingly powerful machines or utilizing different components, identify more closely with the counterweight trebuchet. Other terms, such as &quot;machina maior/magna&quot;, might have also referred to counterweight trebuchets.

&quot;Traction trebuchet&quot; and &quot;counterweight trebuchet&quot; are modern terms (retronyms), not used by contemporary users of the weapons. The term &quot;traction trebuchet&quot; was created mainly to distinguish this type of weapon from the &quot;onager&quot;, a torsion powered catapult that is often conflated in contemporary sources with the &quot;mangonel&quot;, which was used as a generic term for any medieval stone throwing artillery. Both the traction and counterweight trebuchets have been called &quot;mangonel&quot; at one point or another. Confusion between the onager, mangonel, trebuchet, and other catapult types in contemporary terminology has led some historians today to use the more precise &quot;traction trebuchet&quot; instead, with &quot;counterweight trebuchet&quot; used to distinguish what was before called simply a &quot;trebuchet&quot;. Some modern historians use &quot;mangonel&quot; to mean exclusively traction trebuchets, while others call traction trebuchets &quot;traction mangonels&quot; and counterweight trebuchets &quot;counterweight mangonels&quot;.

== Basic design ==
The trebuchet is a compound machine that makes use of the mechanical advantage of a lever to throw a projectile. They are typically large constructions, with the length of the beam as much as , with some purported to be even larger.

A trebuchet consists primarily of a long beam attached by an axle suspended high above the ground by a stout frame and base, such that the beam can rotate vertically through a wide arc (typically over 180°). A sling is attached to one end of the beam to hold the projectile. The projectile is thrown when the beam is quickly rotated by applying force to the opposite end of the beam. The mechanical advantage is primarily obtained by having the projectile section of the beam much longer than the opposite section where the force is applied – usually four to six times longer.

The difference between counterweight and traction trebuchets is what force they use. Counterweight trebuchets use gravity; potential energy is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached to the shorter end of the beam (typically on a hinged connection), and releasing it on command.

Traction trebuchets use human power; on command, men pull ropes attached to the shorter end of the trebuchet beam. The difficulties of coordinating the pull of many men together repeatedly and predictably makes counterweight trebuchets preferable for the larger machines, though they are more complicated to engineer. The trebuchet had further modifications to allow an increase to its range, by creating a slot for the sling and projectile to sit underneath the trebuchet, enabling the sling to be lengthened and thus extending the range, an alteration in the trajectory, or the release point to be changed. Further increasing their complexity is that either winches or treadwheels, aided by block and tackle, are typically required to raise the more massive counterweights. So while counterweight trebuchets require significantly fewer men to operate than traction trebuchets, they require significantly more time to reload. In a long siege, reload time may not be a critical concern.

When the trebuchet is operated, the force causes rotational acceleration of the beam around the axle (the fulcrum of the lever). These factors multiply the acceleration transmitted to the throwing portion of the beam and its attached sling. The sling starts rotating with the beam, but rotates farther (typically about 360°) and therefore faster, transmitting this increased speed to the projectile. The length of the sling increases the mechanical advantage, and also changes the trajectory so that, at the time of release from the sling, the projectile is traveling in the desired speed and angle to give it the range to hit the target. Adjusting the sling&#x27;s release point is the primary means of fine-tuning the range, as the rest of the trebuchet&#x27;s actions are difficult to adjust after construction.

The rotation speed of the throwing beam increases smoothly, starting slow but building up quickly. After the projectile is released, the arm continues to rotate, allowed to smoothly slow down on its own accord and come to rest at the end of the rotation. This is unlike the violent sudden stop inherent in the action of other catapult designs such as the onager, which must absorb most of the launching energy into their own frame, and must be heavily built and reinforced as a result. This key difference makes the trebuchet much more durable, allowing for larger and more powerful machines.

A trebuchet projectile can be almost anything, even debris, rotting carcasses, or incendiaries, but is typically a large stone. Dense stone, or even metal, specially worked to be round and smooth, gives the best range and predictability. When attempting to breach enemy walls, it is important to use materials that will not shatter on impact; projectiles were sometimes brought from distant quarries to get the desired properties.

==History==
=== Traction trebuchet ===

The traction trebuchet, also referred to as a mangonel in some sources, originated in ancient China.

The first recorded use of traction trebuchets was in ancient China. They were probably used by the Mohists as early as 4th century BC; descriptions can be found in the &quot;Mozi&quot; (compiled in the 4th century BC). According to the &quot;Mozi&quot;, the traction trebuchet was high with buried below ground, the fulcrum attached was constructed from the wheels of a cart, the throwing arm was long with three quarters above the pivot and a quarter below to which the ropes are attached, and the sling long. The range given for projectiles are , , and . They were used as defensive weapons stationed on walls and sometimes hurled hollowed-out logs filled with burning charcoal to destroy enemy siege works. By the 1st century AD, commentators were interpreting other passages in texts such as the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; and &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; as references to the traction trebuchet: &quot;the guai is &#x27;a great arm of wood on which a stone is laid, and this by means of a device [ji] is shot off and so strikes down the enemy. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; say that &quot;The flying stones weigh 12 catties and by devices [ji] are shot off 300 paces.&quot; Traction trebuchets went into decline during the Han dynasty due to long periods of peace but became a common siege weapon again during the Three Kingdoms period. They were commonly called stone-throwing machines, thunder carriages, and stone carriages in the following centuries. They were used as ship mounted weapons by 573 for attacking enemy fortifications. It seems that during the early 7th century, improvements were made on traction trebuchets, although it is not explicitly stated what. According to a stele in Barkul celebrating Tang Taizong&#x27;s conquest of what is now Ejin Banner, the engineer Jiang Xingben made great advancements on trebuchets that were unknown in ancient times. Jiang Xingben participated in the construction of siege engines for Taizong&#x27;s campaigns against the Western Regions. In 617 Li Mi (Sui dynasty) constructed 300 trebuchets for his assault on Luoyang, in 621 Li Shimin did the same at Luoyang, and onward into the Song dynasty when in 1161, trebuchets operated by Song dynasty soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur against the ships of the Jin dynasty navy during the Battle of Caishi.

The traction trebuchet was adopted by various peoples west of China such as the Byzantines, Persians, Arabs, and Avars by the sixth to seventh centuries AD. Some scholars suggest that the Avars carried the traction trebuchet westward while others claim that the Byzantines already possessed knowledge of the traction trebuchet beforehand. Regardless of the vector of transmission, it appeared in the eastern Mediterranean by the late 6th century AD, where it replaced torsion powered siege engines such as the ballista and onager. The rapid displacement of torsion siege engines was probably due to a combination of reasons. The traction trebuchet is simpler in design, has a faster rate of fire, increased accuracy, and comparable range and power. It was probably also safer than the twisted cords of torsion weapons, &quot;whose bundles of taut sinews stored up huge amounts of energy even in resting state and were prone to catastrophic failure when in use.&quot; At the same time, the late Roman Empire seems to have fielded &quot;considerably less artillery than its forebears, organised now in separate units, so the weaponry that came into the hands of successor states might have been limited in quantity.&quot; Evidence from Gaul and Germania suggests there was substantial loss of skills and techniques in artillery further west.

According to the &quot;Miracles of Saint Demetrius&quot;, probably written around 620 by John, Archbishop of Thessaloniki, the Avaro-Slavs attacked Thessaloniki in 586 with traction trebuchets. The bombardment lasted for hours, but the operators were inaccurate and most of the shots missed their target. When one stone did reach their target, it &quot;demolished the top of the rampart down to the walkway.&quot; The Byzantines adopted the traction trebuchet possibly as early as 587, the Persians in the early 7th century, and the Arabs in the second half of the 7th century. In 652, the Arabs used trebuchets at the siege of Dongola in the Sudan. Like the Chinese, by 653, the Arabs also had ship mounted traction trebuchets. The Franks and Saxons adopted the weapon in the 8th century. The &quot;Life of Louis the Pious&quot; contains the earliest western European reference to mangonels (traction trebuchets) in its account of the siege of Tortosa (808–809). In 1173, the Republic of Pisa tried to capture an island castle with traction trebuchet on galleys. Traction trebuchets were also used in India.

The traction trebuchet was most efficient as an anti-personnel weapon, used in a supportive position alongside archers and slingers. Most accounts of traction trebuchets describe them as light artillery weapons while actual penetration of defenses was the result of mining or siege towers. At the Siege of Kamacha in 766, Byzantine defenders used wooden cover to protect themselves from the enemy artillery while inflicting casualties with their own stone throwers. Michael the Syrian noted that at the siege of Balis in 823 it was the defenders that suffered from bombardment rather than the fortifications. At the siege of Kaysum, Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani used artillery to damage houses in the town. The Sack of Amorium in 838 saw the use of traction trebuchets to drive away defenders and destroy wooden defenses. At the siege of Marand in 848, traction trebuchets were used, &quot;reportedly killing 100 and wounding 400 on each side during the eight-month siege.&quot; During the siege of Baghdad in 865, defensive artillery were responsible for repelling an attack on the city gate while traction trebuchets on boats claimed a hundred of the defenders&#x27; lives.

Some exceptionally large and powerful traction trebuchets have been described during the 11th century or later. At the Siege of Manzikert (1054), the Seljuks&#x27; initial siege artillery was countered by the defenders&#x27; own, which shot stones at the besieging machine. In response, the Seljuks constructed another one requiring 400 men to pull and threw stones weighing . A breach was created on the first shot but the machine was burnt down by the defenders. According to Matthew of Edessa, this machine weighed and caused a number of casualties to the city&#x27;s defenders. Ibn al-Adim describes a traction trebuchet capable of throwing a man in 1089. At the siege of Haizhou in 1161, a traction trebuchet was reported to have had a range of 200 paces (over ).

West of China, the traction trebuchet remained the primary siege engine until the 12th century when it was replaced by the counterweight trebuchet. In China the traction trebuchet was the primary siege engine until the counterweight trebuchet was introduced during the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty in the 13th century.

=== Counterweight trebuchet ===
====Origins====

There is little to no consensus as to where and when the counterweight trebuchet, which has been described as the &quot;most powerful weapon of the Middle Ages&quot;, was first developed. The earliest known description and illustration of a counterweight trebuchet comes from a commentary on the conquests of Saladin by Mardi ibn Ali al-Tarsusi in 1187. However cases for the existence of both European and Muslim counterweight trebuchets prior to 1187 have been made. In 1090, Khalaf ibn Mula&#x27;ib threw out a man from the citadel in Salamiya with a machine and in the early 12th century, Muslim siege engines were able to breach crusader fortifications. David Nicolle argues that these events could have only been possible with the use of counterweight trebuchets.

Although al-Tarsusi provided the first description and illustration of a counterweight trebuchet, the text implies that the engine was not new and had previously been built. Al-Tarsusi referred to the counterweight trebuchet as the &quot;Persian&quot; trebuchet whereas the &quot;Frankish&quot; trebuchet was a light traction engine. Later during the 13th century, Muslims used &quot;manjaniq maghribi&quot; (Western trebuchet) and &quot;manjaniq ifranji&quot; (Frankish trebuchet) to refer to counterweight trebuchets. Paul E. Chevedden suggests that &quot;manjaniq maghribi&quot; was used to describe hinged counterweight engines in contrast to previous fixed or hanging counterweight trebuchets. Sometimes counterweight trebuchets are separated into two or three different categories based on how their counterweights are attached. These being fixed, hanging, and hinged counterweights. A fixed counterweight is an intrinsic part of the swinging arm and its trajectory is circular. Hanging counterweights hang below the arm and drop vertically. Hinged counterweights are attached to the arm by a swinging joint. Some fixed counterweights also had a hinged component. The type described by al-Tarsusi was a hanging counterweight. Writing in 1280, Giles of Rome claimed that hinged counterweight trebuchets had a greater range than fixed counterweight types.

Chevedden argues that counterweight trebuchets appeared prior to 1187 in Europe based on what might have been counterweight trebuchets in earlier sources. The 12th-century Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates may have been referring to a counterweight trebuchet when he described one equipped with a windlass, which is only useful to counterweight machines, at the siege of Zevgminon in 1165. However the source for this was written in the 1180s to 1190s and Niketas may have been placing the engine of his own time anachronistically into the past. At the siege of Nicaea in 1097 the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos reportedly invented new pieces of heavy artillery which deviated from the conventional design and made a deep impression on everyone. Illustrations produced later in 1270 depicted fixed counterweight trebuchets used at the siege. Possible references to counterweight trebuchets also appear for the second siege of Tyre in 1124, where the crusaders reportedly made use of &quot;great trebuchets&quot;. However the sources for this siege, Fulcher of Chartres and William of Tyre, only mention &quot;machinae&quot; and &quot;machinae iaculatoriae&quot; that were later translated as &quot;perrieres&quot; and &quot;mangoniaux&quot; in the &quot;Estoire d&#x27;Eracles&quot;. Chevedden argues that given the references to new and better trebuchets that by the 1120–30s, the counterweight trebuchet was being used in a variety of places by different peoples such as the crusader states, the Normans of Sicily and the Seljuks.

The earliest solid reference to a &quot;trebuchet&quot; in European sources dates to the siege of Castelnuovo Bocca d&#x27;Adda in 1199. However it is unclear if this referred to counterweight trebuchets since the author did not specify what engine was used and described the machine as fairly light. They may have been used in Germany from around 1205. Only in the late 1210s do references to &quot;trebuchet&quot;, describing more powerful engines and different components, more closely align with the features of a counterweight trebuchet. Some of these more powerful engines may have just been traction trebuchets, as one was described being pulled by ten thousand. At the Siege of Toulouse (1217–1218), &quot;trabuquets&quot; were mentioned to have been deployed, but the siege engine depicted at the tomb of Simon de Montfort, who was killed by artillery at the siege, is a traction trebuchet. Though soon after, clear evidence of counterweight machines appeared. According to the &quot;Song of the Albigensian Crusade&quot;, the defenders &quot;ran to the ropes and wound the trebuchets&quot;, and to shoot the machine, they &quot;then released their ropes.&quot; They were used in England at least by 1217 and in Iberia shortly after 1218. By the 1230s the counterweight trebuchet was a common item in siege warfare. Despite the lack of clearly definable terms in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, it is likely that both Muslims and Europeans already had working knowledge of the counterweight trebuchet beforehand. From the First Crusade (1096–1099) onward, there does not appear to be any discernible difference in the technology of siege engines employed by Muslim and Frankish forces, and by the Third Crusade (1189–1192), both sides seemed well acquainted with the enemy&#x27;s siege weapons, which &quot;appear to have been remarkably similar.&quot;

====China====

Counterweight trebuchets do not appear with certainty in Chinese historical records until about 1268. Prior to 1268, the counterweight trebuchet may have been used in 1232 by the Jurchen Jin commander Qiang Shen. Qiang invented a device called the &quot;Arresting Trebuchet&quot; which only needed a few men to work it, and could hurl great stones more than a hundred paces, further than even the strongest traction trebuchet. However no other details on the machine are given. Qiang died the following year and no further references to the Arresting Trebuchet appear. The earliest definite mention of the counterweight trebuchet in China was in 1268, when the Mongols laid siege to Fancheng and Xiangyang. After failing to take the twin cities of Fancheng and Xiangyang for several years, collectively known as the siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang, the Mongol army brought in two Persian engineers to build hinged counterweight trebuchets. Known as the Huihui trebuchet (回回砲, where &quot;huihui&quot; is a loose slang referring to any Muslims), or Xiangyang trebuchet (襄陽砲) because they were first encountered in that battle. Ismail and Al-aud-Din travelled to South China from Iraq and built trebuchets for the siege. Chinese and Muslim engineers operated artillery and siege engines for the Mongol armies. By 1283, counterweight trebuchets were also used in Southeast Asia by the Chams against the Yuan dynasty.

====Function====
While some historians have described the counterweight trebuchet as a type of medieval super weapon, other historians have urged caution in overemphasizing its destructive capability. On the side of the counterweight engine as a medieval military revolution, historians such as Sydney Toy, Paul Chevedden, and Hugh Kennedy consider its power to have caused significant changes in medieval warfare. This line of thought suggests that rams were abandoned due to the effectiveness of the counterweight trebuchet, which was capable of reducing &quot;any fortress to rubble&quot;. Accordingly, traditional fortifications became obsolete and had to be improved with new architectural structures to support defensive counterweight trebuchets. In southern France during the Albigensian Crusade, sieges were a last resort and negotiations for surrender were common. In these instances, trebuchets were used to threaten or bombard enemy fortifications and ensure victory. On the side of caution, historians such as John France, Christopher Marshall, and Michael Fulton emphasize the still considerable difficulty of reducing fortifications with siege artillery. Examples of the failure of siege artillery include the lack of evidence that artillery ever threatened the defenses of Kerak Castle between 1170 and 1188. Marshall maintains that &quot;the methods of attack and defence remained largely the same through the thirteenth century as they had been during the twelfth.&quot; Reservations on the counterweight trebuchet&#x27;s destructive capability were expressed by Viollet-le-Duc, who &quot;asserted that even counterweight-powered artillery could do little more than destroy crenellations, clear defenders from parapets and target the machines of the besieged.&quot;

In spite of the evidence regarding increasingly powerful counterweight trebuchets during the 13th century, &quot;it remains an important consideration that not one of these appears to have effected a breach that directly led to the fall of a stronghold.&quot; In 1220, Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa laid siege to Atlit with a &quot;trabuculus&quot;, three &quot;petrariae&quot;, and four &quot;mangonelli&quot; but could not penetrate past the outer wall, which was soft but thick. As late as the Siege of Acre (1291), where the Mamluk Sultanate fielded 72 or 92 trebuchets, including 14 or 15 counterweight trebuchets and the remaining traction types, they were never able to fulfill a breaching role. The Mamluks entered the city by sapping the northeast corner of the outer wall. Though stone projectiles of substantial size (~) have been found at Acre, located near the site of the siege and likely used by the Mamluks, surviving walls of a 13th-century Montmusard tower are no more than one meter thick. There is no indication that the thickness of fortress walls increased exponentially rather than a modest increase of between the 12th and 13th century. The Templar of Tyre described the faster firing traction trebuchets as more dangerous to the defenders than the counterweight ones. The Song dynasty described countermeasures against counterweight trebuchets that prevented them from damaging towers and houses: &quot;an extraordinary method was invented of neutralising the effects of the enemy&#x27;s trebuchets. Ropes of rice straw four inches thick and thirty-four feet long were joined together twenty at a time, draped on to the buildings from top to bottom, and covered with [wet] clay. Then neither the incendiary arrows, nor bombs [&quot;huo pao&quot;] from trebuchets, nor even stones of a hundred &quot;jun&quot; caused any damage to the towers and houses.&quot;

The counterweight trebuchet did not completely replace the traction trebuchet. Despite its greater range, counterweight trebuchets had to be constructed close to the site of the siege unlike traction trebuchets, which were smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier to take apart and put back together again where necessary. The superiority of the counterweight trebuchet was not clear cut. Of this, the Hongwu Emperor stated in 1388: &quot;The old type of trebuchet was really more convenient. If you have a hundred of those machines, then when you are ready to march, each wooden pole can be carried by only four men. Then when you reach your destination, you encircle the city, set them up, and start shooting!&quot; The traction trebuchet continued to serve as an anti-personnel weapon. The Norwegian text of 1240, &quot;Speculum regale&quot;, explicitly states this division of functions. Traction trebuchets were to be used for hitting people in undefended areas. At the Siege of Acre (1291), both traction and counterweight trebuchets were used. The traction trebuchets provided cover fire while the counterweight trebuchets destroyed the city&#x27;s fortifications. The counterweight-trebuchet could also be used for cover fire and as an anti-personnel weapon. King James I of Aragon employed this as a defensive tactic in many fortified structures and towns which proved effective. Trebuchets could cause mass casualties due to the destruction of structures. During an assault on Muntcada by King James I, a trebuchet was used to target a tower, destroying the structure and causing the consequential deaths of civilians and livestock. But typically the counterweight trebuchet was used against battlements such as parapets, other defensive structures, and the lower section of walls due to its greater accuracy and longer range, which was how it was employed by the Kingdom of Aragon.

There is some evidence that the counterweight trebuchet could be transported. Armies employed a magister tormentorum (&#x27;master of trebuchets&#x27;) for the reconstruction of trebuchets after they were deconstructed for transportation to their destination, whether on carts or by ship. They could also be equipped with their own wheels, as shown in two 17th- and 18th-century Chinese illustrations, which are also the only Chinese depictions of counterweight trebuchets on land. According to Liang Jieming, the &quot;illustration shows ... its throwing arm disassembled, its counterweight locked with supporting braces, and prepped for transport and not in battle deployment.&quot; However, according to Joseph Needham, the large tank in the middle was the counterweight, while the bulb at the end of the arm was for adjusting between fixed and swinging counterweights. Both Liang and Needham note that the illustrations are poorly drawn and confusing, leading to mislabeling.

The counterweight and traction trebuchets were phased out around the mid-15th century in favor of gunpowder weapons.
===Decline of military use===

With the introduction of gunpowder, the trebuchet began to lose its place as the siege engine of choice to the cannon. Trebuchets were still used both at the siege of Burgos (1475–1476) and siege of Rhodes (1480). One of the last recorded military uses was by Hernán Cortés, at the 1521 siege of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán. Accounts of the attack note that its use was motivated by the limited supply of gunpowder. The attempt was reportedly unsuccessful: the first projectile landed on the trebuchet itself, destroying it.

In China, the last time trebuchets were seriously considered for military purposes was in 1480. Not much is heard of them afterwards.

In 2024, the Israeli military made at least partial use of trebuchets against Hezbollah objectives in southern Lebanon.

==Other trebuchets==

=== Hand-trebuchet ===
The hand-trebuchet () was a staff sling mounted on a pole using a lever mechanism to propel projectiles. Basically a one-man traction trebuchet, it was used by troops of emperor Nikephoros II Phokas around 965 to disrupt enemy formations in the open field. It was also mentioned in the Taktika of general Nikephoros Ouranos (c. 1000), and listed in &quot;De obsidione toleranda&quot; (author anonymous) as a form of artillery.

In China, the hand-trebuchet (&quot;shoupao&quot;) was invented by Liu Yongxi and presented to the emperor in 1002. It was a pole with a pin at its upper end that acted as a fulcrum for the arm. The pole was used as a shot for fixing in the ground and the user could then throw missiles at the enemy from a static position.

===Hybrid trebuchet===
According to Paul E. Chevedden, a hybrid trebuchet existed that used both counterweight and human propulsion. However no illustrations or descriptions of the device exist from the time when they were supposed to have been used. The entire argument for the existence of hybrid trebuchets rests on accounts of increasingly more effective siege weapons. Peter Purton suggests that this was simply because the machines became larger. The earliest depiction of a hybrid trebuchet is dated to 1462, when trebuchets had already become obsolete due to cannons.

===Couillard===
The couillard is a smaller version of a counterweight trebuchet with a single frame instead of the usual double &quot;A&quot; frames. The counterweight is split into two halves to avoid hitting the center frame.

===Recreation and education===
Most trebuchet use in recent centuries has been for recreational or educational, rather than military purposes. New machines have been constructed and old ones restored by living history enthusiasts, for historical re-enactments, and use in other historical celebrations. As their construction is substantially simpler than modern weapons, trebuchets also serve as the object of engineering challenges.

The methods of trebuchet construction were lost at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1984, the French engineer Renaud Beffeyte made the first modern reconstruction of a trebuchet, based on documents from 1324.

The largest currently-functioning trebuchet in the world is the machine at Warwick Castle, England, constructed in 2005. Based on historical designs, it stands tall and throws missiles typically 36 kg (80 lbs) up to . The trebuchet gained significant interest from numerous news sources when in 2015 a burning missile fired from the siege engine struck and damaged a Victorian-era boathouse situated at the River Avon close by, inadvertently demonstrating the weapon&#x27;s power. It is built on the design of a similar trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark. In 1989, Middelaldercentret became the first place in the modern era to have a working trebuchet.

Trebuchets compete in one of the classifications of machines used to hurl pumpkins at the annual pumpkin chucking contest held in Sussex County, Delaware, U.S. The record-holder in that contest for trebuchets is the Yankee Siege II from New Hampshire, which at the 2013 WCPC Championship tossed a pumpkin 2835.8 ft (864.35 metres). The , trebuchet flings the standard pumpkins, specified for all entries in the WCPC competition.

A large trebuchet was tested in late 2017 in Belfast as part of the set for the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

A large trebuchet based on Edward I&#x27;s &quot;Warwolf&quot; was constructed for a scene in David Mackenzie&#x27;s movie &quot;Outlaw King&quot; (2018) about Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. During the film, it hurls an incendiary projectile at Stirling Castle. It recreates the true story that it took some three months to build and Edward would not let his enemy surrender until he could use it.

In recent years several trebuchets has been created capable of throwing cars. In the episode &quot;Carnage A Trois&quot; in series 4 of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; the presenters uses a trebuchet to allegedly sling a Citroën C3 Pluriel from the White Cliffs of Dover across the English Channel. The Stamford based YouTube personality and inventor Colin Furze created a high trebuchet capable of throwing a washing machine in December 2020.

===Developments===

Although rarely used as a weapon today, trebuchets maintain the interest of professional and hobbyist engineers. One modern technological development, especially for the competitive pumpkin-hurling events, is the &quot;floating arms&quot; design. Instead of using the traditional axle fixed to a frame, these devices are mounted on wheels that roll on a track parallel to the ground, with a counterweight that falls directly downward upon release, allowing for greater efficiency by increasing the proportion of energy transferred to the projectile. A more radical design; Jonathan, Orion, and Emmerson Stapleton&#x27;s &quot;walking arm&quot;, described as &quot;a stick falling over with a huge counterweight on top of the stick&quot; debuted in 2016 and in 2018 won both the Grand Champion Best Design and Middleweight Open Division of the 10th annual Vermont Pumpkin Chuckin Festival. Another recent development is the &quot;flywheel trebuchet&quot;, in which a flywheel is spun into rapid rotation to build up momentum before release.

===Uses in activism and insurgency===
In 2013, during the Syrian civil war, rebels were filmed using a trebuchet in the Battle of Aleppo. The trebuchet was used to project explosives at government troops.

In 2014, during the Hrushevskoho street riots in Ukraine, rioters used an improvised trebuchet to throw bricks and Molotov cocktails at the Berkut.

=== Uses in regular armies ===
In 2024, the IDF used a trebuchet to hurl flaming projectiles into Lebanon. The goal was to burn down the thicket that grew alongside the border wall between Israel and Lebanon, so it couldn&#x27;t be used as cover by Hezbollah troops. The IDF later issued a response to suggest that the trebuchet&#x27;s use was a &quot;local initiative&quot;, rather than a widely-used tool in the Israeli military.

<doc id="43382" wikidata="Q189705" url="?curid=43382" title="Zenobia">
<text>Septimia Zenobia (Palmyrene Aramaic: , ; 240 – c. 274) was a third-century queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria. Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner, and she married the ruler of the city, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sasanian Empire of Persia and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus&#x27; assassination, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his reign.

In 270, Zenobia launched an invasion that brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to Upper Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to the campaign of the Roman emperor Aurelian in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress, thus declaring Palmyra&#x27;s secession from Rome. The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the empress was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome, where she spent the remainder of her life.

Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The empress maintained a stable administration, which governed a multicultural, multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.

==Name, appearance and sources==

Zenobia was born c. 240–241, and bore the gentilicium (surname) Septimia. Her native Palmyrene name was Bat-Zabbai (written &quot;Btzby&quot; in the Palmyrene alphabet), an Aramaic name meaning &quot;daughter of Zabbai&quot;. Such compound names for women were common in Palmyra, where the element &quot;bt&quot; means daughter, but the personal name that follows does not necessarily denote the immediate father, rather referring to the ancestor of the family. In Greek—Palmyra&#x27;s diplomatic and second language, used in many Palmyrene inscriptions—she used the name Zenobia. In Palmyra, when written in Greek, names such as Zabeida, Zabdila, Zabbai or Zabda were often transformed into &quot;Zenobios&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Zenobia&quot; (feminine). The element &quot;Zabbai&quot; from Zenobia&#x27;s native name means &quot;gift of N.N. [god]&quot;, and the name Zenobia translates to &quot;one whose life derives from Zeus&quot;. The historian Victor Duruy believed that the queen used the Greek name as a translation of her native name, in deference to her Greek subjects. The philologist Wilhelm Dittenberger argued that the name Bat-Zabbai underwent a detortum (twist), thus resulting in the name Zenobia. 

The ninth-century historian al-Tabari, in his highly fictionalized account, wrote that the queen&#x27;s name was Na&#x27;ila al-Zabba&#x27;. Manichaean sources, reporting the visit of the apostle Addai to the region during the time of Odaenathus, called Zenobia &quot;Queen Tadi&quot;, wife of kysr (caesar). The name given to Zenobia in those Manichaean writings seems to derive from Tadmor, Palmyra&#x27;s native name, and this is supported by the Coptic &quot;Acts Codex&quot;, where Zenobia is named Queen Thadmor.

No contemporary statues of Zenobia have been found in Palmyra or elsewhere, only inscriptions on statues bases survive, indicating that a statue of the queen once stood in the place; most known representations of Zenobia are the idealized portraits of her found on her coins. Sculptures of Palmyrene style were normally impersonal, unlike Greek and Roman ones: a statue of Zenobia in this style would have given an idea of her general style in dress and jewelry but would not have revealed her true appearance. The non-contemporary historian Edward Gibbon has described her as being “of a dark complexion” and considered “most lovely,” and that she “equalled in beauty her [claimed] ancestor Cleopatra.” British scholar William Wright visited Palmyra toward the end of the nineteenth century in a vain search for a sculpture of the queen.

In addition to archaeological evidence, Zenobia&#x27;s life was recorded in different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia in the absence of contemporary sources. Some &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more credible. The Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.

==Origin, family and early life==
Palmyrene society was an amalgam of Semitic-speaking peoples, mostly Arabs and Arameans, and Zenobia cannot be identified with any one group; as a Palmyrene, she may have had both Arab and Aramean ancestry. Information about Zenobia&#x27;s ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and contradictory. Nothing is known about her mother, and her father&#x27;s identity is debated. Manichaean sources mention a &quot;Nafsha&quot;, sister of the &quot;queen of Palmyra&quot;, but those sources are confused and &quot;Nafsha&quot; may refer to Zenobia herself: it is doubtful that Zenobia had a sister.

Apparently not a commoner, Zenobia would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; contains details of her early life, although their veracity is dubious; according to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, the queen&#x27;s hobby as a child was hunting and, in addition to her Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, she was fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. When she was about fourteen years old (ca. 255), Zenobia became the second wife of Odaenathus, the &quot;ras&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;) of Palmyra. Noble families in Palmyra often intermarried, and it is probable that Zenobia and Odaenathus shared some ancestors.

===Contemporary epigraphical evidence===
Basing their suppositions upon archaeological evidence, various historians have suggested several men as Zenobia&#x27;s father:

Julius Aurelius Zenobius appears on a Palmyrene inscription as a strategos of Palmyra in 231–232; based on the similarity of the names, Zenobius was suggested as Zenobia&#x27;s father by the numismatist Alfred von Sallet and others. The archaeologist William Waddington argued in favor of Zenobius&#x27; identification as the father, assuming that his statue stood opposite to where the statue of the queen stood in Great Colonnade. However, the linguist Jean-Baptiste Chabot pointed out that Zenobius&#x27; statue stood opposite to that of Odaenathus not Zenobia and rejected Waddington&#x27;s hypothesis. The only &quot;gentilicium&quot;, a hereditary name borne by people that was originally the name of one&#x27;s gens (family or clan) by patrilineal descent, appearing on Zenobia&#x27;s inscriptions was &quot;Septimia&quot; (not &quot;Julia Aurelia&quot;, which she would have borne if her father&#x27;s &quot;gentilicium&quot; was Aurelius), and it cannot be proven that the queen changed her &quot;gentilicium&quot; to Septimia after her marriage.

One of Zenobia&#x27;s inscriptions recorded her as &quot;Septimia Bat-Zabbai, daughter of Antiochus&quot;. Antiochus&#x27; identity is not definitively known: his ancestry is not recorded in Palmyrene inscriptions, and the name was not common in Palmyra. This, combined with the meaning of Zenobia&#x27;s Palmyrene name (daughter of Zabbai), led scholars such as Harald Ingholt to speculate that Antiochus might have been a distant ancestor: the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes or Antiochus VII Sidetes, whose wife was the Ptolemaic Cleopatra Thea. In the historian Richard Stoneman&#x27;s view, Zenobia would not have created an obscure ancestry to connect herself with the ancient Macedonian rulers: if a fabricated ancestry were needed, a more direct connection would have been invented. According to Stoneman, Zenobia &quot;had reason to believe [her Seleucid ancestry] to be true&quot;. The historian Patricia Southern, noting that Antiochus was mentioned without a royal title or a hint of great lineage, believes that he was a direct ancestor or a relative rather than a Seleucid king who lived three centuries before Zenobia.

On the basis of Zenobia&#x27;s Palmyrene name, Bat Zabbai, her father may have been called Zabbai; alternatively, Zabbai may have been the name of a more distant ancestor. The historian Trevor Bryce suggests that she was related to Septimius Zabbai, Palmyra&#x27;s garrison leader, and he may even have been her father. The archaeologist Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, attempting to reconcile the meaning of the name &quot;Bat Zabbai&quot; with the inscription mentioning the queen as daughter of Antiochus, suggested that two brothers, Zabbai and Antiochus, existed, with a childless Zabbai dying and leaving his widow to marry his brother Antiochus. Thus, since Zenobia was born out of a levirate marriage, she was theoretically the daughter of Zabbai, hence the name.

===Ancient sources===
In the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Zenobia is said to have been a descendant of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the &quot;Souda&quot;, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra. According to modern scholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legends, there is no direct evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra. The connection may have been invented by Zenobia&#x27;s enemies to discredit her, but circumstantial evidence indicates that Zenobia herself made the claim; an imperial declaration once ascribed to Emperor Severus Alexander (died 235) was probably made by Zenobia in the name of her son Vaballathus, where the king named Alexandria &quot;my ancestral city&quot;, which indicates a claim to Ptolemaic ancestry. Zenobia&#x27;s alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies&#x27; throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen&#x27;s ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.

====Arab traditions and al-Zabba&#x27;====
Although some Arab historians linked Zenobia to the Queen of Sheba, their accounts are apocryphal. Medieval Arabic traditions identify a queen of Palmyra named al-Zabba&#x27;, and her most romantic account comes from al-Tabari. According to al-Tabari, she was an Amalekite; her father was &#x27;Amr ibn Zarib, an &#x27;Amālīq sheikh who was killed by the Tanukhids. Al-Tabari identifies a sister of al-Zabba&#x27; as &quot;Zabibah&quot;. Jadhimah ibn Malik, the Tanukhid king who killed the queen&#x27;s father, was killed by al-Zabba&#x27;. According to al-Tabari, al-Zabba&#x27; had a fortress along the Euphrates and ruled Palmyra.

Al-Tabari&#x27;s account does not mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; focusing on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based on the story of Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba&#x27; fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.

==Queen of Palmyra==
===Consort===

During the early centuries AD, Palmyra was a city subordinate to Rome and part of the province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire&#x27;s eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian&#x27;s son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly &quot;corrector totius orientis&quot; (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her late twenties or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.

The first inscription mentioning Zenobia as queen is dated two or three years after Odaenathus&#x27; death, so exactly when Zenobia assumed the title &quot;queen of Palmyra&quot; is uncertain. However, she was probably designated as queen when her husband became king. As queen consort, Zenobia remained in the background and was not mentioned in the historical record. According to later accounts, including one by Giovanni Boccaccio, she accompanied her husband on his campaigns. If the accounts of her accompanying her husband are true, according to Southern, Zenobia would have boosted the morale of the soldiers and gained political influence, which she needed in her later career.

====Possible role in Odaenathus&#x27; assassination====
According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Odaenathus was assassinated by a cousin named Maeonius. In the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Odaenathus&#x27; son from his first wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time because she did not accept her stepson as his father&#x27;s heir (ahead of her own children). The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; does not suggest that Zenobia was involved in the events leading to her husband&#x27;s murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius&#x27; moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to the historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband&#x27;s pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus&#x27; policies during her first years on the throne.

===Regent===
In the &quot;Historia Augusta &quot;, Maeonius was emperor briefly before he was killed by his soldiers, however, no inscriptions or evidence exist for his reign. At the time of Odaenathus&#x27; assassination, Zenobia might have been with her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia. The transfer of power seems to have been smooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day. Zenobia may have been in Palmyra, but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition; the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely. The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and there is no evidence of delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia&#x27;s son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Although she never claimed to rule in her own right and acted as a regent for her son, Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom, and Vaballathus was kept in his mother&#x27;s shadow, never exercising real power.

====Consolidation of power====
The Palmyrene monarchy was new; allegiance was based on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult than it would have been in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty&#x27;s future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father&#x27;s royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.
Odaenathus controlled a large area of the Roman East, and held the highest political and military authority in the region, superseding that of the Roman provincial governors. His self-created status was formalized by Emperor Gallienus, who had little choice but to acquiesce. Odaenathus&#x27;s power relative to that of the emperor and the central authority was unprecedented and elastic, but relations remained smooth until his death. His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers&#x27; authority and position had to be clarified, which led to a conflict over their interpretation. The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman official who derived his power from the emperor, but the Palmyrene court saw his position as hereditary. This conflict was the first step on the road to war between Rome and Palmyra.

Odaenathus&#x27; Roman titles, such as &quot;dux Romanorum&quot;, &quot;corrector totius orientis&quot; and &quot;imperator totius orientis&quot; differed from his royal eastern ones because the Roman ranks were not hereditary. Vaballathus had a legitimate claim to his royal titles, but had no right to the Roman ones—especially &quot;corrector&quot; (denoting a senior military and provincial commander in the Roman system), which Zenobia used for her son in his earliest known inscriptions with &quot;King of Kings&quot;. Although the Roman emperors accepted the royal succession, the assumption of Roman military rank antagonized the empire. Emperor Gallienus may have decided to intervene in an attempt to regain central authority; according to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, praetorian prefect Aurelius Heraclianus was dispatched to assert imperial authority over the east and was repelled by the Palmyrene army. The account is doubtful, however, since Heraclianus participated in Gallienus&#x27; assassination in 268. Odaenathus was assassinated shortly before the emperor, and Heraclianus would have been unable to be sent to the East, fight the Palmyrenes and return to the West in time to become involved in the conspiracy against the emperor.

====Early reign====

The extent of Zenobia&#x27;s territorial control during her early reign is debated; according to the historian Fergus Millar, her authority was confined to Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia&#x27;s conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It is more likely that the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and the historian Udo Hartmann, and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband&#x27;s power). The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus&#x27; reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.

There is no recorded unrest against the queen accompanying her ascendance in ancient sources hostile to her, indicating no serious opposition to the new regime. The most obvious candidates for opposition were the Roman provincial governors, but the sources do not say that Zenobia marched on any of them or that they tried to remove her from the throne. According to Hartmann, the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces apparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of Odaenathus. During Zenobia&#x27;s early regency, she focused on safeguarding the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the Persian borders, the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates (including the citadels of Halabiye—later called Zenobia—and Zalabiye). Circumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians; probably in 269, Vaballathus assumed the victory title of &quot;Persicus Maximus&quot; (the great victor in Persia); this may be connected to an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.

====Expansion====
In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus&#x27; successor) was defending the borders of Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia&#x27;s increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen&#x27;s decision to use military force to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia&#x27;s expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia that the only way to maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. The historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia&#x27;s actions to her desire to protect Palmyra&#x27;s economic interests, which were threatened by Rome&#x27;s failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.

=====Syria and the invasion of Arabia Petraea=====

In the spring of 270, while Claudius was fighting the Goths in the mountains of Thrace, Zenobia sent her general Septimius Zabdas to Bosra (capital of the province of Arabia Petraea); the queen&#x27;s timing seems intentional. In Arabia the Roman governor (&quot;dux&quot;), Trassus (commanding the Legio III Cyrenaica), confronted the Palmyrenes and was routed and killed. Zabdas sacked the city, and destroyed the temple of Zeus Hammon, the legion&#x27;s revered shrine. A Latin inscription after the fall of Zenobia attests to its destruction: &quot;The temple of Iuppiter Hammon, destroyed by the Palmyrene enemies, which ... rebuilt, with a silver statue and iron doors (?)&quot;. The city of Umm el-Jimal may have also been destroyed by the Palmyrenes in connection with their efforts to subjugate the Tanukhids.

After his victory, Zabdas marched south along the Jordan Valley and apparently met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus&#x27; name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria&#x27;s traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius&#x27; name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus&#x27; name.

The Arabian milestones presented the Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander, referring to him as &quot;vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum&quot;. The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobia&#x27;s control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the imperial title. Until now, Zenobia could say that she was acting as a representative of the emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the empire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe. Although Vaballathus&#x27; use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of subordination to Rome; an &quot;imperator&quot; was a commander of troops, not the equal of an emperor (&quot;imperator caesar&quot;).

=====Annexation of Egypt and the campaigns in Asia Minor=====

The invasion of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia&#x27;s desire to secure an alternative trade route to the Euphrates, which was cut because of the war with Persia. This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia&#x27;s ambition. The date of the campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius&#x27; death, which sets it in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus&#x27; account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius&#x27; death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius&#x27; death in August). Zenobia was declared Queen of Egypt after Palmyrene invasion of Egypt. The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt&#x27;s eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.
The Roman position was worsened by the absence of Egypt&#x27;s prefect, Tenagino Probus, who was battling pirates. According to Zosimus, the Palmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes; Zabdas moved into Egypt with 70,000 soldiers, defeating an army of 50,000 Romans. After their victory, the Palmyrenes withdrew their main force and left a 5,000-soldier garrison. By early November, Tenagino Probus returned and assembled an army; he expelled the Palmyrenes and regained Alexandria, prompting Zabdas to return. The Palmyrene general aimed a thrust at Alexandria, where he seems to have had local support; the city fell into Zabdas&#x27; hands, and the Roman prefect fled south. The last battle was at the Babylon Fortress, where Tenagino Probus took refuge; the Romans had the upper hand, since they chose their camp carefully. Timagenes, with his knowledge of the land, ambushed the Roman rear; Tenagino Probus committed suicide, and Egypt became part of Palmyra. In the &quot;Historia Augusta &quot; the Blemmyes were among Zenobia&#x27;s allies, and Gary K. Young cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of a Palmyrene-Blemmyes alliance.

Only Zosimus mentioned two invasions, contrasting with many scholars who argue in favor of an initial invasion and no retreat (followed by a reinforcement, which took Alexandria by the end of 270). During the Egyptian campaign, Rome was entangled in a succession crisis between Claudius&#x27; brother Quintillus and the general Aurelian. Egyptian papyri and coinage confirm Palmyrene rule in Egypt; the papyri stopped using the regnal years of the emperors from September to November 270, due to the succession crisis. By December regnal dating was resumed, with the papyri using the regnal years of the prevailing emperor Aurelian and Zenobia&#x27;s son Vaballathus. Egyptian coinage was issued in the names of Aurelian and the Palmyrene king by November 270. There is no evidence that Zenobia ever visited Egypt.

Although the operation may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas&#x27; second-in-command, the invasion of Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas&#x27; arrival in the spring of 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia&#x27;s control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but the western part of the region did not become part of the queen&#x27;s authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus&#x27; portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.

====Governance====
Zenobia ruled an empire of different peoples; as a Palmyrene, she was accustomed to dealing with multilingual and multicultural diversity since she hailed from a city which embraced many cults. The queen&#x27;s realm was culturally divided into eastern-Semitic and Hellenistic zones; Zenobia tried to appease both, and seems to have successfully appealed to the region&#x27;s ethnic, cultural and political groups. The queen projected an image of a Syrian monarch, a Hellenistic queen and a Roman empress, which gained broad support for her cause.

=====Culture=====

Zenobia turned her court into a center of learning, with many intellectuals and sophists reported in Palmyra during her reign. As academics migrated to the city, it replaced classical learning centers such as Athens for Syrians. The best-known court philosopher was Longinus, who arrived during Odaenathus&#x27; reign and became Zenobia&#x27;s tutor in &quot;paideia&quot; (aristocratic education). Many historians, including Zosimus, accused Longinus of influencing the queen to oppose Rome. This view presents the queen as malleable, but, according to Southern, Zenobia&#x27;s actions &quot;cannot be laid entirely at Longinus&#x27; door&quot;. Other intellectuals associated with the court included Nicostratus of Trapezus and Callinicus of Petra.

From the second to the fourth centuries, Syrian intellectuals argued that Greek culture did not evolve in Greece but was adapted from the Near East. According to Iamblichus, the great Greek philosophers reused Near Eastern and Egyptian ideas. The Palmyrene court was probably dominated by this school of thought, with an intellectual narrative presenting Palmyra&#x27;s dynasty as a Roman imperial one succeeding the Persian, Seleucid and Ptolemaic rulers who controlled the region in which Hellenistic culture allegedly originated. Nicostratus wrote a history of the Roman Empire from Philip the Arab to Odaenathus, presenting the latter as a legitimate imperial successor and contrasting his successes with the disastrous reigns of the emperors.

Zenobia embarked on several restoration projects in Egypt. One of the Colossi of Memnon was reputed in antiquity to sing; the sound was probably due to cracks in the statue, with solar rays interacting with dew in the cracks. The historian Glen Bowersock proposed that the queen restored the colossus (&quot;silencing&quot; it), which would explain third-century accounts of the singing and their disappearance in the fourth.

=====Religion=====

Zenobia followed the Palmyrene paganism, where a number of Semitic gods, with Bel at the head of the pantheon, were worshipped. Zenobia accommodated Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen&#x27;s beliefs; Manichaean sources alleged that Zenobia was one of their own; a manuscript dated to 272 mentions that the Queen of Palmyra supported the Manichaeans in establishing a community in Abidar, which was under the rule of a king named Amarō, who could be the Lakhmid king Amr ibn Adi. It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome. 

Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that Zenobia did not &quot;hand over churches to the Jews to make them into synagogues&quot;; although the queen was not a Christian, she understood the power of bishops in Christian communities. In Antioch—considered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian community—Zenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of Samosata, under her auspices. She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of &quot;ducenarius&quot; (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen&#x27;s protection, which helped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268. Hughes 
suggested that Paul&#x27;s position while Zenobia ruled was in the state treasury.

======Judaism======
Less than a hundred years after Zenobia&#x27;s reign, Athanasius of Alexandria called her a &quot;Jewess&quot; in his &quot;History of the Arians&quot;. In 391, archbishop John Chrysostom wrote that Zenobia was Jewish; so did a Syriac chronicler around 664 and bishop Bar Hebraeus in the thirteenth century. According to French scholar Javier Teixidor, Zenobia was probably a proselyte; this explained her strained relationship with the rabbis. Teixidor believed that Zenobia became interested in Judaism when Longinus spoke about the philosopher Porphyry and his interest in the Old Testament. Although Talmudic sources were hostile to Palmyra because of Odaenathus&#x27; suppression of the Jews of Nehardea, Zenobia apparently had the support of some Jewish communities (particularly in Alexandria). In Cairo, a plaque originally bearing an inscription confirming a grant of immunity to a Jewish synagogue in the last quarter of the first millennium BC by King Ptolemy Euergetes (I or II) was found. At a much later date, the plaque was re-inscribed to commemorate the restoration of immunity &quot;on the orders of the queen and king&quot; and the precedence of the queen in the ordering of the two titles is remarkable. Although it is undated, the letters of the inscription date to long after Cleopatra and Anthony&#x27;s era; Zenobia and her nominal co-monarch Vaballathus, who controlled Egypt in 270–272, are the only candidates for a king and a queen ruling Egypt after the Ptolemies.

The historian E. Mary Smallwood wrote that good relations with the diaspora community did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobia&#x27;s reign, and her rule was apparently opposed in that region. The Jerusalem Talmud, in Tractate Terumot tells the story of the amoraim Rabbi &quot;Ammi&quot; and Rabbi &quot;Samuel bar Nahmani&quot;, who visited Zenobia&#x27;s court and asked for the release of a Jew (&quot;Zeir bar Hinena&quot;) detained on her orders. The queen refused, saying: &quot;Why have you come to save him? He teaches that your creator performs miracles for you. Why not let God save him?&quot; During Aurelian&#x27;s destruction of Palmyra, Palestinian conscripts with &quot;clubs and cudgels&quot; (who may have been Jews) played a vital role in Zenobia&#x27;s defeat and the destruction of her city.

There is no evidence of Zenobia&#x27;s birth as a Jew; the names of her and her husband&#x27;s families belonged to the Aramaic (collection of names). The queen&#x27;s alleged patronage of Paul of Samosata (who was accused of &quot;Judaizing&quot;), may have given rise to the idea that she was a proselyte. Only Christian accounts note Zenobia&#x27;s Jewishness; no Jewish source mentions it.

=====Administration=====
The queen probably spent most of her reign in Antioch, Syria&#x27;s administrative capital. Before the monarchy, Palmyra had the institutions of a Greek city (polis) and was ruled by a senate which was responsible for most civil affairs. Odaenathus maintained Palmyra&#x27;s institutions, as did Zenobia; a Palmyrene inscription after her fall records the name of Septimius Haddudan, a Palmyrene senator. However, the queen apparently ruled autocratically; Septimius Worod, Odaenathus&#x27; viceroy and one of Palmyra&#x27;s most important officials, disappeared from the record after Zenobia&#x27;s ascent. The queen opened the doors of her government to Eastern nobility. Zenobia&#x27;s most important courtiers and advisers were her generals, Septemius Zabdas and Septimius Zabbai; both of whom were generals under Odaenathus and received the &quot;gentilicium&quot; (surname) &quot;Septimius&quot; from him.

Odaenathus respected the Roman emperor&#x27;s privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she probably had the power to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).

======Agreement with Rome======
Zenobia initially avoided provoking Rome by claiming for herself and her son the titles, inherited from Odaenathus, of subject of Rome and protector of its eastern frontier. After expanding her territory, she seems to have tried to be recognized as an imperial partner in the eastern half of the empire and presented her son as subordinate to the emperor. In late 270, Zenobia minted coinage bearing the portraits of Aurelian and Vaballathus; Aurelian was titled &quot;emperor&quot;, and Vaballathus &quot;king&quot;. The regnal year in early samples of the coinage was only Aurelian&#x27;s. By March 271, despite indicating Aurelian as the paramount monarch by naming him first in the dating formulae, the coinage also began bearing Vaballathus&#x27; regnal year. By indicating in the coinage that Vaballathus&#x27; reign began in 267 (three years before the emperor&#x27;s), Vaballathus appeared to be Aurelian&#x27;s senior colleague.

The emperor&#x27;s blessing of Palmyrene authority has been debated; Aurelian&#x27;s acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may be inferred from the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is based solely on the joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia&#x27;s actions may have been a ruse to give her a false sense of security while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian&#x27;s tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as Harold Mattingly, suggest that Claudius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.

====Empress and open rebellion====
An inscription, found in Palmyra and dated to August 271, called Zenobia &quot;eusebes&quot; (the pious); this title, used by Roman empresses, could be seen as a step by the queen toward an imperial title. Another contemporary inscription called her &quot;sebaste&quot;, the Greek equivalent of &quot;empress&quot; (Latin: &quot;Augusta&quot;), but also acknowledged the Roman emperor. A late-271 Egyptian grain receipt equated Aurelian and Vaballathus, jointly calling them &quot;Augusti&quot;. Finally, Palmyra officially broke with Rome; the Alexandrian and Antiochian mints removed Aurelian&#x27;s portrait from the coins in April 272, issuing new tetradrachms in the names of Vaballathus and Zenobia (who were called &quot;Augustus&quot; and &quot;Augusta&quot;, respectively).

The assumption of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline of events and why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In the second half of 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her assumption of the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian&#x27;s campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.

====Downfall====

The usurpation, which began in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271–272 in Byzantium, and probably crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up some resistance before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed by the rest of Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria—which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.

In May 272, Aurelian headed toward Antioch. About north of the city, he defeated the Palmyrene army (led by Zabdas) at the Battle of Immae. As a result, Zenobia, who waited in Antioch during the battle, retreated with her army to Emesa. To conceal the disaster and make her flight safer, she spread reports that Aurelian was captured; Zabdas found a man who resembled the Roman emperor and paraded him through Antioch. The following day, Aurelian entered the city before marching south. After defeating a Palmyrene garrison south of Antioch, Aurelian continued his march to meet Zenobia in the Battle of Emesa.

The 70,000-strong Palmyrene army, assembled on the plain of Emesa, nearly routed the Romans. In an initial thrill of victory they hastened their advance, breaking their lines and enabling the Roman infantry to attack their flank. The defeated Zenobia headed to her capital on the advice of her war council, leaving her treasury behind. In Palmyra, the empress prepared for a siege; Aurelian blockaded food-supply routes, and there were probably unsuccessful negotiations. According to the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, Zenobia said that she would fight Aurelian with the help of her Persian allies; however, the story was probably fabricated and used by the emperor to link Zenobia to Rome&#x27;s greatest enemy. If such an alliance existed, a much-larger frontier war would have erupted; however, no Persian army was sent. As the situation worsened, the queen left the city for Persia intending on seeking help from Palmyra&#x27;s former enemy; according to Zosimus, she rode a &quot;female camel, the fastest of its breed and faster than any horse&quot;.

==Captivity and fate==
Aurelian, learning about Zenobia&#x27;s departure, sent a contingent which captured the empress before she could cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia&#x27;s captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the empress and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra&#x27;s court elite (including Longinus). According to the &quot;Augustan History&quot; and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The empress&#x27;s reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian&#x27;s propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the empress and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.

Zenobia&#x27;s fate after Emesa is uncertain since ancient historians left conflicting accounts. Zosimus wrote that she died before crossing the Bosporus on her way to Rome; according to this account, the empress became ill or starved herself to death. The generally unreliable chronicler, John Malalas, wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through the eastern cities on a dromedary; in Antioch, the emperor had her chained and seated on a dais in the hippodrome for three days before the city&#x27;s populace. Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia appeared in Aurelian&#x27;s triumph and was then beheaded.

Most ancient historians and modern scholars agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelian&#x27;s 274 triumph; Zosimus was the only source to say that the empress died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable. A public humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion. Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia&#x27;s beheading; according to the other historians, her life was spared after Aurelian&#x27;s triumph. The &quot;Augustan History&quot; recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian&#x27;s Villa, where she lived with her children. Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman, and Syncellus wrote that she married a Roman senator. The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.

==Titles==

The queen owed her elevated position to her son&#x27;s minority. To celebrate Herodianus&#x27; coronation, a statue was erected in Palmyra in 263. According to the inscription on the base of the statue, it was commissioned by Septimius Worod, then the &quot;duumviri&quot; (magistrate) of Palmyra, and Julius Aurelius, the Queen&#x27;s &quot;procurator&quot; (treasurer). According to the historian David Potter, Zenobia is the queen mentioned, and the inscription is an evidence for the usage of the title by her during Odaenathus&#x27; lifetime. An inscription on a milestone on the road between Palmyra and Emesa, dated to Zenobia&#x27;s early reign, identifies her as &quot;illustrious queen, mother of the king of kings&quot;; this was the first inscription giving her an official position. A lead token from Antioch also identifies Zenobia as queen.

The earliest confirmed attestation of Zenobia as queen in Palmyra is an inscription on the base of a statue erected for her by Zabdas and Zabbai, dated to August 271 and calling her &quot;most illustrious and pious queen&quot;. On an undated milestone found near Byblos, Zenobia is titled &quot;Sebaste&quot;. The queen was never acknowledged as sole monarch in Palmyra, although she was the &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign of the empire; she was always associated with her husband or son in inscriptions, except in Egypt (where some coins were minted in Zenobia&#x27;s name alone). According to her coins, the queen assumed the title of &quot;Augusta&quot; (empress) in 272, and reigned under the regnal name Septimia Zenobia Augusta. In 272, Zenobia, no longer acting as queen-regent, but as Empress of the East, rode forth to beat back the Roman Empire.

==Descendants==

Aside from Vaballathus, it is unclear if Zenobia had other children, and their alleged identities are subject to scholarly disagreements. The image of a child named Hairan (II) appears on a seal impression with that of his brother Vaballathus; no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. Odaenathus&#x27; son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son of Odaenathus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251. David S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II is the son of Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I. Nathanael Andrade maintained that Hairan I, Herodianus, and Hairan II are the same person, rejecting the existence of a second Hairan.

A controversial Palmyrene inscription mentions the mother of the King Septimius Antiochus; the name of the queen is missing, and Dittenberger refused to fill the gap with Zenobia&#x27;s name, but many scholars, such as Grace Macurdy considered that the missing name is Zenobia. Septimius Antiochus may have been Vaballathus&#x27; younger brother, or was presented in this manner for political reasons; Antiochus was proclaimed emperor in 273, when Palmyra revolted against Rome for a second time. If Antiochus was a son of Zenobia, he was probably a young child not fathered by Odaenathus; Zosimus described him as insignificant, appropriate for a five-year-old boy. On the other hand, Macurdy, citing the language Zosimus used when he described him, considered it more plausible that Antiochus was not a son of Zenobia, but a family relation who used her name to legitimize his claim to the throne.

The names of Herennianus and Timolaus were mentioned as children of Zenobia only in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;. Herennianus may be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus; Timolaus is probably a fabrication, although the historian Dietmar Kienast suggested that he might have been Vaballathus. According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Zenobia&#x27;s descendants were Roman nobility during the reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen&#x27;s descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen&#x27;s other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor&#x27;s marriage to Zenobia&#x27;s daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence (337–417) with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.

==Evaluation and legacy==
An evaluation of Zenobia is difficult; the queen was courageous when her husband&#x27;s supremacy was threatened and by seizing the throne, she protected the region from a power vacuum after Odaenathus&#x27; death. According to Watson, she made what Odaenathus left her a &quot;glittering show of strength&quot;. In the view of Watson, Zenobia should not be seen as a total powermonger, nor as a selfless hero fighting for a cause; according to the historian David Graf, &quot;She took seriously the titles and responsibilities she assumed for her son and that her program was far more ecumenical and imaginative than that of her husband Odenathus, not just more ambitious&quot;.

Zenobia has inspired scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has lingered in the West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen&#x27;s legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to the historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia as a woman who created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women&#x27;s-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.

Her most lasting legacy is in Syria, where the queen is a national symbol. Zenobia became an icon for Syrian nationalists; she had a cult following among Western-educated Syrians, and an 1871 novel by journalist Salim Al Bustani was entitled &quot;Zenobia malikat Tadmor&quot; (&quot;Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra&quot;). Syrian nationalist Ilyas Matar, who wrote Syria&#x27;s first history in Arabic in 1874, (&quot;al-&#x27;Uqud al-durriyya fi tarikh al-mamlaka al-Suriyya&quot;; &quot;The Pearl Necklace in the History of the Syrian Kingdom&quot;), was fascinated by Zenobia and included her in his book. To Matar, the queen kindled hope for a new Zenobia who would restore Syria&#x27;s former grandeur. Another history of Syria was written by Jurji Yanni in 1881, in which Yanni called Zenobia a &quot;daughter of the fatherland&quot;, and yearned for her &quot;glorious past&quot;. Yanni described Aurelian as a tyrant who deprived Syria of its happiness and independence by capturing its queen.

In modern Syria, Zenobia is regarded as a patriotic symbol; her image appeared on banknotes, and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series Al-Ababeed (&quot;The Anarchy&quot;). The series was watched by millions in the Arabic-speaking world. It examined the Israeli–Palestinian conflict from a Syrian perspective, where the queen&#x27;s struggle symbolized the Palestinians&#x27; struggle to gain the right of self-determination. Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria&#x27;s former minister of defense and one of the country&#x27;s most prominent figures.

==Myth, romanticism and popular culture==
Harold Mattingly called Zenobia &quot;one of the most romantic figures in history&quot;. According to Southern, &quot;The real Zenobia is elusive, perhaps ultimately unattainable, and novelists, playwrights and historians alike can absorb the available evidence, but still need to indulge in varied degrees of speculation.&quot;

She has been the subject of romantic and ideologically-driven biographies by ancient and modern writers. The &quot;Augustan History&quot; is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobia&#x27;s life, and its author acknowledged that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus. According to the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was a more able sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the &quot;Augustan History&quot; moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author characterizing Zenobia&#x27;s protection of the eastern frontier as a wise delegation of power by Claudius. When the &quot;Augustan History&quot; reached the biography of Aurelian, the author&#x27;s view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the queen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward; her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.

Zenobia&#x27;s &quot;staunch&quot; beauty was emphasized by the author of the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, who ascribed to her feminine timidity and inconsistency (the reasons for her alleged betrayal of her advisers to save herself). The queen&#x27;s sex posed a dilemma for the &quot;Augustan History&quot; since it cast a shadow on Aurelian&#x27;s victory. Its author ascribed many masculine traits to Zenobia to make Aurelian a conquering hero who suppressed a dangerous Amazon queen. According to the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, Zenobia had a clear, manly voice, dressed as an emperor (rather than an empress), rode horseback, was attended by eunuchs instead of ladies-in-waiting, marched with her army, drank with her generals, was careful with money (contrary to the stereotypical spending habits of her sex) and pursued masculine hobbies such as hunting. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote a fanciful 14th-century account of the queen in which she is a tomboy in childhood who preferred wrestling with boys, wandering in the forests and killing goats to playing like a young girl. Zenobia&#x27;s chastity was a theme of these romanticized accounts; according to the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, she disdained sexual intercourse and allowed Odaenathus into her bed only for conception. Her reputed chastity impressed some male historians; Edward Gibbon wrote that Zenobia surpassed Cleopatra in chastity and valor. According to Boccaccio, Zenobia safeguarded her virginity when she wrestled with boys as a child.

Seventeenth-century visitors to Palmyra rekindled the Western world&#x27;s romantic interest in Zenobia. This interest peaked during the mid-nineteenth century, when Lady Hester Stanhope visited Palmyra and wrote that its people treated her like the queen; she was reportedly greeted with singing and dancing, and Bedouin warriors stood on the city&#x27;s columns. A procession ended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as &quot;queen of the desert&quot;. William Ware, fascinated by Zenobia, wrote a fanciful account of her life. Twentieth-century novelists and playwrights, such as Haley Elizabeth Garwood and Nick Dear, also wrote about the queen.

<text>Elizabeth Cady Stanton ( Cady; November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American writer and activist who was a leader of the women&#x27;s rights movement in the U.S. during the mid- to late-19th century. She was the main force behind the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, the first convention to be called for the sole purpose of discussing women&#x27;s rights, and was the primary author of its Declaration of Sentiments. Her demand for women&#x27;s right to vote generated a controversy at the convention but quickly became a central tenet of the women&#x27;s movement. She was also active in other social reform activities, especially abolitionism.

In 1851, she met Susan B. Anthony and formed a decades-long partnership that was crucial to the development of the women&#x27;s rights movement. During the American Civil War, they established the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League to campaign for the abolition of slavery, and they led it in the largest petition drive in U.S. history up to that time. They started a newspaper called &quot;The Revolution&quot; in 1868 to work for women&#x27;s rights.

After the war, Stanton and Anthony were the main organizers of the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both African Americans and women, especially the right of suffrage. When the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced that would provide suffrage for black men only, they opposed it, insisting that suffrage should be extended to all African Americans and all women at the same time. Others in the movement supported the amendment, resulting in a split. During the bitter arguments that led up to the split, Stanton sometimes expressed her ideas in elitist and racially condescending language. In her opposition to the voting rights of African Americans Stanton was quoted to have said, &quot;It becomes a serious question whether we had better stand aside and let &#x27;Sambo&#x27; walk into the kingdom first.&quot; Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist friend who had escaped from slavery, reproached her for such remarks.

Stanton became the president of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which she and Anthony created to represent their wing of the movement. When the split was healed more than twenty years later, Stanton became the first president of the united organization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association. This was largely an honorary position; Stanton continued to work on a wide range of women&#x27;s rights issues despite the organization&#x27;s increasingly tight focus on women&#x27;s right to vote.

Stanton was the primary author of the first three volumes of the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, a massive effort to record the history of the movement, focusing largely on her wing of it. She was also the primary author of &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, a critical examination of the Bible that is based on the premise that its attitude toward women reflects prejudice from a less civilized age.

==Childhood and family background==
Elizabeth Cady was born into the leading family of Johnstown, New York. Their family mansion on the town&#x27;s main square was handled by as many as twelve servants. Her conservative father, Daniel Cady, was one of the richest landowners in the state. A member of the Federalist Party, he was an attorney who served one term in the U.S. Congress and became a justice in the New York Supreme Court.

Her mother, Margaret Cady ( Livingston), was more progressive, supporting the radical Garrisonian wing of the abolitionist movement and signing a petition for women&#x27;s suffrage in 1867. She was described, at least earlier in her life, as &quot;[n]early six feet tall, strong willed and self-reliant, ... She was the only person in the household not in awe of her husband who was 12 years her senior.&quot;

Elizabeth was the seventh of eleven children, six of whom died before reaching full adulthood, including all of the boys. Her mother, exhausted by giving birth to so many children and the anguish of seeing so many of them die, became withdrawn and depressed. Tryphena, the oldest daughter, together with her husband Edward Bayard, assumed much of the responsibility for raising the younger children.

In her memoir, &quot;Eighty Years &amp; More&quot;, Stanton said there were three African-American manservants in her household when she was young. Researchers have determined that one of them, Peter Teabout, was a slave and probably remained so until all enslaved people in New York state were freed on July 4, 1827. Stanton recalled him fondly, saying that she and her sisters attended the Episcopal church with Teabout and sat with him in the back of the church rather than in front with the white families.

==Education and intellectual development==

Stanton received a better education than most women of her era. She attended Johnstown Academy in her hometown until the age of 15. The only girl in its advanced classes in mathematics and languages, she won second prize in the school&#x27;s Greek competition and became a skilled debater. She enjoyed her years at the school and said she did not encounter any barriers there due to her gender.

She was made sharply aware of society&#x27;s low expectations for women when Eleazar, her last surviving brother, died at the age of 20 just after graduating from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Her father and mother were incapacitated by grief. The ten-year-old Stanton tried to comfort her father, saying she would try to be all her brother had been. Her father said, &quot;Oh my daughter, I wish you were a boy!&quot;

Stanton had many educational opportunities as a young child. Their neighbor, Reverend Simon Hosack, taught her Greek and mathematics. Edward Bayard, her brother-in-law and Eleazar&#x27;s former classmate at Union College, taught her philosophy and horsemanship. Her father brought her law books to study so she could participate in debates with his law clerks at the dinner table. She wanted to go to college, but no colleges at that time accepted female students. Moreover, her father initially decided she did not need further education. He eventually agreed to enroll her in the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, which was founded and run by Emma Willard.

In her memoirs, Stanton said that during her student days in Troy she was greatly disturbed by a six-week religious revival conducted by Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelical preacher and a central figure in the revivalist movement. His preaching, combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood, terrified her with the possibility of her own damnation: &quot;Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my dreams. Mental anguish prostrated my health.&quot;
Stanton credited her father and brother-in-law with convincing her to disregard Finney&#x27;s warnings. She said they took her on a six-week trip to Niagara Falls during which she read works of rational philosophers who restored her reason and sense of balance. Lori D. Ginzberg, one of Stanton&#x27;s biographers, says there are problems with this story. For one thing, Finney did not preach for six weeks in Troy while Stanton was there. Ginzberg suspects that Stanton embellished a childhood memory to underline her belief that women harm themselves by falling under the spell of religion.

==Marriage and family==

As a young woman, Stanton traveled often to the home of her cousin, Gerrit Smith, who also lived in upstate New York. His views were very different from those of her conservative father. Smith was an abolitionist and a member of the &quot;Secret Six,&quot; a group of men who financed John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in an effort to spark an armed uprising of enslaved African Americans. At Smith&#x27;s home, where she spent summers and was considered &quot;part of the family,&quot; she met Henry Brewster Stanton, a prominent abolitionist agent. Despite her father&#x27;s reservations, the couple married in 1840, omitting the word &quot;obey&quot; from the marriage ceremony. Stanton later wrote, &quot;I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I supposed I was entering into an equal relation.&quot;
While uncommon, this practice was not unheard of; Quakers had been omitting &quot;obey&quot; from the marriage ceremony for some time.
Stanton took her husband&#x27;s surname as part of her own, signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton, but not Mrs. Henry B. Stanton.

Soon after returning from their European honeymoon, the Stantons moved into the Cady household in Johnstown. Henry Stanton studied law under his father-in-law until 1843, when the Stantons moved to Boston (Chelsea), Massachusetts, where Henry joined a law firm. While living in Boston, Elizabeth enjoyed the social, political, and intellectual stimulation that came with a constant round of abolitionist gatherings. Here, she was influenced by such people as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Ralph Waldo Emerson. In 1847, the Stantons moved to Seneca Falls, New York, in the Finger Lakes region. Their house, which is now a part of the Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park, was purchased for them by Elizabeth&#x27;s father.

The couple had seven children. At that time, child-bearing was considered to be a subject that should be handled with great delicacy. Stanton took a different approach, raising a flag in front of her house after giving birth, a red flag for a boy and a white one for a girl. One of her daughters, Harriot Stanton Blatch, became, like her mother, a leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Because of the spacing of their children&#x27;s births, one historian has concluded that the Stantons must have used birth control methods. Stanton herself said her children were conceived by what she called &quot;voluntary motherhood.&quot; In an era when it was commonly held that a wife must submit to her husband&#x27;s sexual demands, Stanton believed that women should have command over their sexual relationships and childbearing. She also said, however, that &quot;a healthy woman has as much passion as a man.&quot; 
Stanton encouraged both her sons and daughters to pursue a broad range of interests, activities, and learning. She was remembered by her daughter Margaret as being &quot;cheerful, sunny and indulgent.&quot; She enjoyed motherhood and running a large household, but she found herself unsatisfied and even depressed by the lack of intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls.

During the 1850s, Henry&#x27;s work as a lawyer and politician kept him away from home for nearly 10 months out of every year. This frustrated Elizabeth when the children were small because it made it difficult for her to travel. The pattern continued in later years, with husband and wife living apart more often than together, maintaining separate households for several years. Their marriage, which lasted 47 years, ended with Henry Stanton&#x27;s death in 1887.

Both Henry and Elizabeth were staunch abolitionists, but Henry, like Elizabeth&#x27;s father, disagreed with the idea of female suffrage. One biographer described Henry as, &quot;at best a halfhearted &#x27;women&#x27;s rights man.&#x27;&quot;

==Early activism==
=== World Anti-Slavery Convention ===

While on their honeymoon in England in 1840, the Stantons attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. Elizabeth was appalled by the convention&#x27;s male delegates, who voted to prevent women from participating even if they had been appointed as delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. The men required the women to sit in a separate section, hidden by curtains from the convention&#x27;s proceedings. William Lloyd Garrison, a prominent American abolitionist and supporter of women&#x27;s rights who arrived after the vote had been taken, refused to sit with the men and sat with the women instead.

Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights advocate, was one of the women who had been sent as a delegate. Although Mott was much older than Stanton, they quickly bonded in an enduring friendship, with Stanton eagerly learning from the more experienced activist. While in London, Stanton heard Mott preach in a Unitarian chapel, the first time Stanton had heard a woman give a sermon or even speak in public.
Stanton later gave credit to this convention for focusing her interests on women&#x27;s rights.

===Seneca Falls Convention===

An accumulation of experiences was having an effect on Stanton. The London convention had been a turning point in her life. Her study of law books had convinced her that legal changes were necessary to overcome gender inequities. She had personal experience of the stultifying role of women as wives and housekeepers. She said, &quot;the wearied, anxious look of the majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular.&quot; This knowledge, however, did not immediately lead to action. Relatively isolated from other social reformers and fully occupied with household duties, she was at a loss as to how she could engage in social reform.

In the summer of 1848, Lucretia Mott traveled from Pennsylvania to attend a Quaker meeting near the Stanton&#x27;s home. Stanton was invited to visit with Mott and three other progressive Quaker women. Finding herself in sympathetic company, Stanton said she poured out her &quot;long-accumulating discontent, with such vehemence and indignation that I stirred myself, as well as the rest of the party, to do and dare anything.&quot; The gathered women agreed to organize a women&#x27;s rights convention in Seneca Falls a few days later, while Mott was still in the area.

Stanton was the primary author of the convention&#x27;s Declaration of Rights and Sentiments, which was modeled on the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Its list of grievances included the wrongful denial of women&#x27;s right to vote, signaling Stanton&#x27;s intent to generate a discussion of women&#x27;s suffrage at the convention. This was a highly controversial idea at the time but not an entirely new one. Her cousin Gerrit Smith, no stranger to radical ideas himself, had called for women&#x27;s suffrage shortly before at the Liberty League convention in Buffalo. When Henry Stanton saw the inclusion of women&#x27;s suffrage in the document, he told his wife that she was acting in a way that would turn the proceedings into a farce. Lucretia Mott, the main speaker, was also disturbed by the proposal.

An estimated 300 women and men attended the two-day Seneca Falls Convention. In her first address to a large audience, Stanton explained the purpose of the gathering and the importance of women&#x27;s rights. Following a speech by Mott, Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments, which the attendees were invited to sign. Next came the resolutions, all of which the convention adopted unanimously except for the ninth, which read, &quot;it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the sacred right of the elective franchise.&quot; Following a vigorous debate, this resolution was adopted only after Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist leader who had formerly been enslaved, gave it his strong support.

Stanton&#x27;s sister Harriet attended the convention and signed its Declaration of Sentiments. Her husband, however, made her remove her signature.

Although this was a local convention organized on short notice, its controversial nature ensured that it was widely noted in the press, with articles appearing in newspapers in New York City, Philadelphia and many other places. The Seneca Falls Convention is now recognized as an historic event, the first convention to be called for the purpose of discussing women&#x27;s rights. The convention&#x27;s Declaration of Sentiments became &quot;the single most important factor in spreading news of the women&#x27;s rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future,&quot; according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention. The convention initiated the use of women&#x27;s rights conventions as organizing tools for the early women&#x27;s movement. By the time of the second National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1851, the demand for women&#x27;s right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women&#x27;s rights movement.

A Rochester Women&#x27;s Rights Convention was held in Rochester, New York two weeks later, organized by local women who had attended the one in Seneca Falls. Both Stanton and Mott spoke at this convention. The convention in Seneca Falls had been chaired by James Mott, the husband of Lucretia Mott. The Rochester convention was chaired by a woman, Abigail Bush, another historic first. Many people were disturbed by the idea of a woman chairing a convention of both men and women. How, for example, might people react if a woman ruled a man out of order? Stanton herself spoke in opposition to the election of a woman as the chair of this convention, although she later acknowledged her mistake and apologized for her action.

When the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention was organized in 1850, Stanton was unable to attend because she was pregnant. Instead, she sent a letter to the convention entitled &quot;Should women hold office&quot; that outlined the movement&#x27;s goals. The letter emphatically endorsed women&#x27;s right to hold office, stating that &quot;women might have a &#x27;purifying, elevating, softening influence&#x27; on the &#x27;political experiment of our Republic.&#x27;” Thereafter it became a tradition to open national women&#x27;s rights conventions with a letter by Stanton, who did not participate in person in a national convention until 1860.

===Partnership with Susan B. Anthony===
While visiting Seneca Falls in 1851, Susan B. Anthony was introduced to Stanton by Amelia Bloomer, a mutual friend and a supporter of women&#x27;s rights. Anthony, who was five years younger than Stanton, came from a Quaker family that was active in reform movements. Anthony and Stanton soon became close friends and co-workers, forming a relationship that was a turning point in their lives and of great importance to the women&#x27;s movement.

The two women had complementary skills. Anthony excelled at organizing, while Stanton had an aptitude for intellectual matters and writing. Stanton later said, &quot;In writing we did better work together than either could alone. While she is slow and analytical in composition, I am rapid and synthetic. I am the better writer, she the better critic.&quot; Anthony deferred to Stanton in many ways throughout their years of work together, not accepting an office in any organization that would place her above Stanton. In their letters, they referred to one another as &quot;Susan&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Stanton.&quot;
Because Stanton was homebound with seven children while Anthony was unmarried and free to travel, Anthony assisted Stanton by supervising her children while Stanton wrote.
Among other things, this allowed Stanton to write speeches for Anthony to give.
One of Anthony&#x27;s biographers said, &quot;Susan became one of the family and was almost another mother to Mrs. Stanton&#x27;s children.&quot; One of Stanton&#x27;s biographers said, &quot;Stanton provided the ideas, rhetoric, and strategy; Anthony delivered the speeches, circulated petitions, and rented the halls. Anthony prodded and Stanton produced.&quot; Stanton&#x27;s husband said, &quot;Susan stirred the puddings, Elizabeth stirred up Susan, and then Susan stirs up the world!&quot; Stanton herself said, &quot;I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.&quot;
By 1854, Anthony and Stanton &quot;had perfected a collaboration that made the New York State movement the most sophisticated in the country,&quot; according to Ann D. Gordon, a professor of women&#x27;s history.

After the Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1861, a room was set aside for Anthony in every house they lived in. One of Stanton&#x27;s biographers estimated that, over her lifetime, Stanton spent more time with Anthony than with any other adult, including her own husband.

In December 1865, Stanton and Anthony submitted the first women&#x27;s suffrage petition directed to Congress during the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment. The women challenged the use of the word &quot;male&quot; in the version submitted to the States for ratification. When Congress failed to remove the language, Stanton announced her candidacy as the first woman to run for Congress in October 1866. She ran as an independent and secured only 24 votes, but her candidacy sparked conversations surrounding women&#x27;s officeholding separate from suffrage.

In December 1872, Stanton and Anthony each wrote New Departure memorials to Congress and were invited to read their memorials to the Senate Judiciary Committee. This further brought women&#x27;s suffrage and officeholding to the forefront of Congress&#x27;s agenda, even though the New Departure agenda was ultimately rejected.

The relationship was not without its strains, especially as Anthony could not match Stanton&#x27;s charm and charisma. In 1871, Anthony said, &quot;whoever goes into a parlor or before an audience with that woman does it at the cost of a fearful overshadowing, a price which I have paid for the last ten years, and that cheerfully, because I felt that our cause was most profited by her being seen and heard, and my best work was making the way clear for her.&quot;

===Temperance activity===
Excessive consumption of alcohol was a severe social problem during this period, one that began to diminish only in the 1850s. Many activists considered temperance to be a women&#x27;s rights issue because of laws that gave husbands complete control of the family and its finances. The law provided almost no recourse to a woman with a drunken husband, even if his condition left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she managed to obtain a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with sole guardianship of their children.

In 1852, Anthony was elected as a delegate to the New York state temperance convention. When she tried to participate in the discussion, the chairman stopped her, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Years later, Anthony observed, &quot;No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.&quot; Anthony and other women walked out and announced their intention to organize a women&#x27;s temperance convention. Later that year, about five hundred women met in Rochester and created the Women&#x27;s State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent. This leadership arrangement, with Stanton in the public role as president and Anthony as the energetic force behind the scenes, was characteristic of the organizations they founded in later years.

In her first public speech since 1848, Stanton delivered the convention&#x27;s keynote address, one that antagonized religious conservatives. She called for drunkenness to be legal grounds for divorce at a time when many conservatives opposed divorce for any reason. She appealed for wives of drunkard husbands to take control of their marital relations, saying, &quot;Let no woman remain in relation of wife with the confirmed drunkard. Let no drunkard be the father of her children.&quot; She attacked the religious establishment, calling for women to donate their money to the poor instead of to the &quot;education of young men for the ministry, for the building up a theological aristocracy and gorgeous temples to the unknown God.&quot;

At the organization&#x27;s convention the following year, conservatives voted Stanton out as president, whereupon she and Anthony resigned from the organization. Temperance was not a significant reform activity for Stanton afterwards, although she continued to use local temperance societies in the early 1850s as conduits for advocating women&#x27;s rights. She regularly wrote articles for &quot;The Lily&quot;, a monthly temperance newspaper that she helped transform into one that reported news of the women&#x27;s rights movement. She also wrote for The Una, a women&#x27;s rights periodical edited by Paulina Wright Davis, and for the New York Tribune, a daily newspaper edited by Horace Greeley.

===Married Women&#x27;s Property Act===

The status of married women at that time was in part set by English common law which for centuries had set the doctrine of coverture in local courts. It held wives were under the protection and control of their husbands. In the words of William Blackstone&#x27;s 1769 book &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;: &quot;By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.&quot; The husband of a married woman became the owner of any property she brought into a marriage. She could not sign contracts, operate a business in her own name, or retain custody of their children in the event of a divorce. In practice some American courts followed the common law. Some Southern states like Texas and Florida provided more equality for women. Across the country state legislatures were taking control away from common law traditions by passing legislation.

In 1836, the New York legislature began considering a Married Women&#x27;s Property Act, with women&#x27;s rights advocate Ernestine Rose an early supporter who circulated petitions in its favor. Stanton&#x27;s father supported this reform. Having no sons to pass his considerable wealth to, he was faced with the prospect of having it eventually pass to the control of his daughters&#x27; husbands. Stanton circulated petitions and lobbied legislators in favor of the proposed law as early as 1843.

The law eventually passed in 1848. It allowed a married woman to retain the property that she possessed before the marriage or acquired during the marriage, and it protected her property from her husband&#x27;s creditors. Enacted shortly before the Seneca Falls Convention, it strengthened the women&#x27;s rights movement by increasing the ability of women to act independently. By weakening the traditional belief that husbands spoke for their wives, it assisted many of the reforms that Stanton championed, such as the right of women to speak in public and to vote.

In 1853, Susan B. Anthony organized a petition campaign in New York state for an improved property rights law for married women.
As part of the presentation of these petitions to the legislature, Stanton spoke in 1854 to a joint session of the Judiciary Committee, arguing that voting rights were needed to enable women to protect their newly won property rights. In 1860, Stanton spoke again to the Judiciary Committee, this time before a large audience in the assembly chamber, arguing that women&#x27;s suffrage was the only real protection for married women, their children and their material assets. She pointed to similarities in the legal status of woman and slaves, saying, &quot;The prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger than that against sex. It is produced by the same cause, and manifested very much in the same way. The negro&#x27;s skin and the woman&#x27;s sex are both prima facie evidence that they were intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man.&quot; The legislature passed the improved law in 1860.

===Dress reform===
In 1851, Elizabeth Smith Miller, Stanton&#x27;s cousin, brought a new style of dress to the upstate New York area. Unlike traditional floor-length dresses, it consisted of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Amelia Bloomer, Stanton&#x27;s friend and neighbor, publicized the attire in &quot;The Lily&quot;, a monthly magazine that she published. Thereafter it was popularly known as the &quot;Bloomer&quot; dress, or just &quot;Bloomers.&quot; It was soon adopted by many female reform activists despite harsh ridicule from traditionalists, who considered the idea of women wearing any sort of trousers as a threat to the social order. To Stanton, it solved the problem of climbing stairs with a baby in one hand, a candle in the other, and somehow also lifting the skirt of a long dress to avoid tripping. Stanton wore &quot;Bloomers&quot; for two years, abandoning the attire only after it became clear that the controversy it created was distracting people from the campaign for women&#x27;s rights. Other women&#x27;s rights activists eventually did the same.

===Divorce reform===
Stanton had already antagonized traditionalists in 1852 at the women&#x27;s temperance convention by advocating a woman&#x27;s right to divorce a drunken husband. In an hour-long speech at the Tenth National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1860, she went further, generating a heated debate that took up an entire session. She cited tragic examples of unhealthy marriages, suggesting that some marriages amounted to &quot;legalized prostitution.&quot; She challenged both the sentimental and the religious views of marriage, defining marriage as a civil contract subject to the same restrictions of any other contract. If a marriage did not produce the expected happiness, she said, then it would be a duty to end it. Strong opposition to her speech was voiced in the ensuing discussion. Abolitionist leader Wendell Phillips, arguing that divorce was not a women&#x27;s rights issue because it affected both women and men equally, said the subject was out of order and tried unsuccessfully to have it removed from the record.

In later years on the lecture circuit, Stanton&#x27;s speech on divorce was one of her most popular, drawing audiences of up to 1200 people. In an 1890 essay entitled &quot;Divorce versus Domestic Warfare,&quot; Stanton opposed calls by some women activists for stricter divorce laws, saying, &quot;The rapidly increasing number of divorces, far from showing a lower state of morals, proves exactly the reverse. Woman is in a transition period from slavery to freedom, and she will not accept the conditions and married life that she has heretofore meekly endured.&quot;

===Abolitionist activity===

In 1860 Stanton published a pamphlet called &quot;The Slaves Appeal&quot; written from what she imagined to be the viewpoint of a female slave. The fictional speaker uses vivid religious language (&quot;Men and women of New York, the God of thunder speaks through you&quot;) that expresses religious views very different from those that Stanton herself held. The speaker describes the horrors of slavery, saying, &quot;The trembling girl for whom thou didst pay a price but yesterday in a New Orleans market, is not thy lawful wife. Foul and damning, both to the master and the slave, is this wholesale violation of the immutable laws of God.&quot; The pamphlet called for defiance of the Federal Fugitive Slave Act, and it included petitions to be used for opposing the practice of hunting escaped slaves.

In 1861, Anthony organized a tour of abolitionist lecturers in upstate New York that included Stanton and several other speakers. The tour began in January just after South Carolina had seceded from the union but before other states had seceded and before the outbreak of war. In her speech, Stanton said that South Carolina was like a willful son whose behavior jeopardized the whole family and that the best course of action was to let it secede. The lecture meetings were repeatedly disrupted by mobs operating under the belief that abolitionist activity was causing southern states to secede. Stanton was not able to participate in some of the lectures because she had to return home to her children. At her husband&#x27;s urging, she left the lecture tour because of the persistent threat of violence.

==Women&#x27;s Loyal National League==

In 1863, Anthony moved into the Stantons&#x27; house in New York City and the two women began organizing the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would abolish slavery. Stanton became president of the new organization and Anthony was secretary.
It was the first national women&#x27;s political organization in the United States. In the largest petition drive in the nation&#x27;s history up to that time, the League collected nearly 400,000 signatures to abolish slavery, representing approximately one out of every twenty-four adults in the Northern states.
The petition drive significantly assisted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery.
The League disbanded in 1864 after it became clear that the amendment would be approved.

Although its purpose was the abolition of slavery, the League made it clear that it also stood for political equality for women, approving a resolution at its founding convention that called for equal rights for all citizens regardless of race or sex. The League indirectly advanced the cause of women&#x27;s rights in several ways. Stanton pointedly reminded the public that petitioning was the only political tool available to women at a time when only men were allowed to vote. The success of the League&#x27;s petition drive demonstrated the value of formal organization to the women&#x27;s movement, which had traditionally resisted being anything other than loosely organized up to that point. Its 5000 members constituted a widespread network of women activists who gained experience that helped create a pool of talent for future forms of social activism, including suffrage. Stanton and Anthony emerged from this endeavor with significant national reputations.

==American Equal Rights Association==

After the Civil War, Stanton and Anthony became alarmed at reports that the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would provide citizenship for African Americans, would also for the first time introduce the word &quot;male&quot; into the constitution. Stanton said, &quot;if that word &#x27;male&#x27; be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.&quot;

Organizing opposition to this development required preparation because the women&#x27;s movement had become largely inactive during the Civil War. In January 1866, Stanton and Anthony sent out petitions calling for a constitutional amendment providing for women&#x27;s suffrage, with Stanton&#x27;s name at the top of the list of signatures. Stanton and Anthony organized the Eleventh National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in May 1866, the first since the Civil War began. The convention voted to transform itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens regardless of race or sex, especially the right of suffrage. Stanton was offered the post of president but declined in a favor of Lucretia Mott. Other officers included Stanton as first vice president, Anthony as a corresponding secretary, Frederick Douglass as a vice president, and Lucy Stone as a member of the executive committee. Stanton provided hospitality for some of the attendees at this convention. Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights activist who had formerly been enslaved, stayed at Stanton&#x27;s house as, of course, did Anthony.

Leading abolitionists opposed the AERA&#x27;s drive for universal suffrage. Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, &quot;This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is &#x27;the negro&#x27;s hour.&#x27;&quot; Abolitionist leaders Wendell Phillips and Theodore Tilton arranged a meeting with Stanton and Anthony, trying to convince them that the time had not yet come for women&#x27;s suffrage, that they should campaign for voting rights for black men only, not for all African Americans and all women. The two women rejected this guidance and continued to work for universal suffrage.

In 1866, Stanton declared herself a candidate for Congress, the first woman to do so. She said that although she could not vote, there was nothing in the Constitution to prevent her from running for Congress. Running as an independent against both the Democrat and Republican candidates, she received only 24 votes. Her campaign was noted by newspapers as far away as New Orleans.

In 1867, the AERA campaigned in Kansas for referendums that would enfranchise both African Americans and women. Wendell Phillips, who opposed mixing those two causes, blocked the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.
By the end of summer, the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted. Anthony and Stanton created a storm of controversy by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from George Francis Train, a wealthy businessman who supported women&#x27;s rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.
There is reason to believe that Stanton and Anthony hoped to draw the volatile Train away from his cruder forms of racism, and that he had actually begun to do so. In any case, Stanton said she would accept support from the devil himself if he supported women&#x27;s suffrage.

After the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, a sharp dispute erupted within the AERA over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. Stanton and Anthony opposed the amendment, which would have the effect of enfranchising black men, insisting that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. Stanton argued in the pages of &quot;The Revolution&quot; that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an &quot;aristocracy of sex,&quot; giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.
Lucy Stone, who was emerging as a leader of those who were opposed to Stanton and Anthony, argued that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men but supported the amendment, saying, &quot;I will be thankful in my soul if &quot;any&quot; body can get out of the terrible pit.&quot;

During the debate over the Fifteenth Amendment, Stanton wrote articles for &quot;The Revolution&quot; with language that was elitist and racially condescending. She believed that a long process of education would be needed before many of the former slaves and immigrant workers would be able to participate meaningfully as voters. Stanton wrote, &quot;American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.&quot; In another article, Stanton objected to laws being made for women by &quot;Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a Monarchy and a Republic.&quot; She also used the term &quot;Sambo&quot; on other occasions, drawing a rebuke from her old friend Frederick Douglass.

Douglass strongly supported women&#x27;s suffrage but said that suffrage for African Americans was a more urgent issue, literally a matter of life and death. He said that white women already exerted a positive influence on government through the voting power of their husbands, fathers and brothers, and that it &quot;does not seem generous&quot; for Anthony and Stanton to insist that black men should not achieve suffrage unless women achieved it at the same time. Sojourner Truth, on the other hand, supported Stanton&#x27;s position, saying, &quot;if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.&quot;

Early in 1869, Stanton called for a Sixteenth Amendment that would provide suffrage for women, saying, &quot;The male element is a destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving war, violence, conquest, acquisition … in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of violence and ruin that she only has the power to curb.&quot;

The AERA increasingly divided into two wings, each advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Stanton and Anthony, insisted that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a women&#x27;s movement that would no longer be tied to the Republican Party or be financially dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath. In the words of one of Stanton&#x27;s biographers, one consequence of the split for Stanton was that, &quot;Old friends became either enemies, like Lucy Stone, or wary associates, as in the case of Frederick Douglass.&quot;

==&quot;The Revolution&quot;==

In 1868, Anthony and Stanton began publishing a sixteen-page weekly newspaper called &quot;The Revolution&quot; in New York City. Stanton was co-editor along with Parker Pillsbury, an experienced editor who was an abolitionist and a supporter of women&#x27;s rights. Anthony, the owner, managed the business aspects of the paper. Initial funding was provided by George Francis Train, the controversial businessman who supported women&#x27;s rights but who alienated many activists with his political and racial views. The newspaper focused primarily on women&#x27;s rights, especially suffrage for women, but it also covered topics such as politics, the labor movement and finance. One of its stated goals was to provide a forum in which women could exchange opinions on key issues. Its motto was &quot;Men, their rights and nothing more: women, their rights and nothing less.&quot;

Sisters Harriet Beecher Stowe and Isabella Beecher Hooker offered to provide funding for the newspaper if its name was changed to something less inflammatory, but Stanton declined their offer, strongly favoring its existing name.

Their goal was to grow &quot;The Revolution&quot; into a daily paper with its own printing press, all owned and operated by women. The funding that Train had arranged for the newspaper, however, was less than expected. Moreover, Train sailed for England after &quot;The Revolution&quot; published its first issue and was soon jailed for supporting Irish independence. Train&#x27;s financial support eventually disappeared entirely. After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced the transfer of the paper to a wealthy women&#x27;s rights activist who gave it a less radical tone. Despite the relatively short time it was in their hands, &quot;The Revolution&quot; gave Stanton and Anthony a means for expressing their views during the developing split within the women&#x27;s movement. It also helped them promote their wing of the movement, which eventually became a separate organization.

Stanton refused to take responsibility for the $10,000 debt the newspaper had accumulated, saying she had children to support. Anthony, who had less money than Stanton, took responsibility for the debt, repaying it over a six-year period through paid speaking tours.

==National Woman Suffrage Association==

In May 1869, two days after the final AERA convention, Stanton, Anthony and others formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), with Stanton as president. Six months later, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and others formed the rival American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which was larger and better funded. The immediate cause for the split in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, but the two organizations had other differences as well. The NWSA was politically independent while the AWSA aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to Republican support for women&#x27;s suffrage. The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women&#x27;s issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and equal pay for women.

As the new organization was being formed, Stanton proposed to limit its membership to women, but her proposal was not accepted. In practice, however, the overwhelming majority of its members and officers were women.

Stanton disliked many aspects of organizational work because it interfered with her ability to study, think, and write. She begged Anthony, without success, to arrange the NWSA&#x27;s first convention so that she herself would not need to attend. For the rest of her life, Stanton attended conventions only reluctantly if at all, wanting to maintain the freedom to express her opinions without worrying about who in the organization might be offended.
Of the fifteen NWSA meetings between 1870 and 1879, Stanton presided at four and was present at only one other, leaving Anthony effectively in charge of the organization.

In 1869 Francis and Virginia Minor, husband and wife suffragists from Missouri, developed a strategy based on the idea that the U.S. Constitution implicitly enfranchised women. It relied heavily on the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States … nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; In 1871 the NWSA officially adopted what had become known as the New Departure strategy, encouraging women to attempt to vote and to file lawsuits if denied that right. Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities. Susan B. Anthony actually succeeded in voting in 1872, for which she was arrested and found guilty in a widely publicized trial. In 1880, Stanton also tried to vote. When the election officials refused to let her place her ballot in the box, she threw it at them. When the Supreme Court ruled in 1875 in &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; that &quot;the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone,&quot; the NWSA decided to pursue the far more difficult strategy of campaigning for a constitutional amendment that would guarantee voting rights for women.

In 1878, Stanton and Anthony convinced Senator Aaron A. Sargent to introduce into Congress a women&#x27;s suffrage amendment that, more than forty years later, would be ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Its text is identical to that of the Fifteenth Amendment except that it prohibits the denial of suffrage because of sex rather than &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot;

Stanton traveled with her daughter Harriet to Europe in May 1882 and did not return for a year and a half. Already a public figure of some prominence in Europe, she gave several speeches there and wrote reports for American newspapers. She visited her son Theodore in France, where she met her first grandchild, and traveled to England for Harriet&#x27;s marriage to an Englishman. After Anthony joined her in England in March 1883, they traveled together to meet with leaders of European women&#x27;s movements, laying the groundwork for an international women&#x27;s organization. Stanton and Anthony returned to the U.S. together in November 1883. Hosted by the NWSA, delegates from fifty-three women&#x27;s organizations in nine countries met in Washington in 1888 to form the organization that Stanton and Anthony had been working toward, the International Council of Women (ICW), which is still active.

Stanton traveled again to Europe in October 1886, visiting her children in France and England. She returned to the U.S. in March 1888 barely in time to deliver a major speech at the founding meeting of the ICW. When Anthony discovered that Stanton had not yet written her speech, she insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room until she had written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door to make sure she did so.
Stanton later teased Anthony, saying, &quot;Well, as all women are supposed to be under the thumb of some man, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall not deny the patent fact of my subjection.&quot;
The convention succeeded in bringing increased publicity and respectability to the women&#x27;s movement, especially when President Grover Cleveland honored the delegates by inviting them to a reception at the White House.

Despite her record of racially insensitive remarks and occasional appeals to the racial prejudices of white people, Stanton applauded the marriage in 1884 of her friend Frederick Douglass to Helen Pitts, a white woman, a marriage that enraged racists. Stanton wrote Douglass a warm letter of congratulation, to which Douglass responded that he had been sure that she would be happy for him. When Anthony realized that Stanton was planning to publish her letter, she convinced her not to do so, wanting to avoid associating women&#x27;s suffrage with an unrelated and divisive issue.

==&quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;==

In 1876, Anthony moved into Stanton&#x27;s house in New Jersey to begin working with Stanton on the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;. She brought with her several trunks and boxes of letters, newspaper clippings, and other documents. Originally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years.

The first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were produced by Stanton, Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage. Anthony handled the production details and the correspondence with contributors. Stanton wrote most of the first three volumes, with Gage writing three chapters of the first volume and Stanton writing the rest. Gage was forced to abandon the project afterwards because of the illness of her husband. After Stanton&#x27;s death, Anthony published Volume 4 with the help of Ida Husted Harper. After Anthony&#x27;s death, Harper completed the last two volumes, which brought the history up to 1920.

Stanton and Anthony encouraged their rival Lucy Stone to assist with the work, or at least to send material that could be used by someone else to write the history of her wing of the movement, but she refused to cooperate in any way. Stanton&#x27;s daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch, who had returned from Europe to assist with the editing, insisted that the history would not be taken seriously if Stone and the AWSA were not included. She herself wrote a 120-page chapter on Stone and the AWSA, which appears in Volume 2.

The &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; preserves an enormous amount of material that might have been lost forever. Written by leaders of one wing of the divided women&#x27;s movement it does not, however, give a balanced view of events where their rivals are concerned. It overstates the role of Stanton and Anthony, and it understates or ignores the roles of Stone and other activists who did not fit into the historical narrative they had developed. Because it was for years the main source of documentation about the suffrage movement, historians have had to uncover other sources to provide a more balanced view.

==Lecture circuit==

Stanton worked as a lecturer for the New York bureau of the Redpath Lyceum from late 1869 until 1879. This organization was part of the Lyceum movement, which arranged for speakers and entertainers to tour the country, often visiting small communities where educational opportunities and theaters were scarce. For ten years, Stanton traveled eight months of the year on the lecture circuit, usually delivering one lecture per day, two on Sundays. She also arranged smaller meetings with local women who were interested in women&#x27;s rights. Traveling was sometimes difficult. One year, when deep snow closed the railroads, Stanton hired a sleigh and kept going, bundled in furs to protect against freezing weather.
During 1871, she and Anthony traveled together for three months through several western states, eventually arriving in California.

Her most popular lecture, &quot;Our Girls,&quot; urged young women to be independent and to seek self-fulfillment. In &quot;The Antagonism of Sex,&quot; she addressed the question of women&#x27;s rights with a special fervor. Other popular lectures were &quot;Our Boys,&quot; &quot;Co-education,&quot; &quot;Marriage and Divorce&quot; and &quot;The Subjugation of Women.&quot; On Sundays she would often speak on &quot;Famous Women in the Bible&quot; and &quot;The Bible and Women&#x27;s Rights.&quot;

Her earnings were impressive. During her first three months on the road, Stanton reported, she cleared &quot;$2000 above all expenses … besides stirring women generally up to rebellion.&quot; Accounting for inflation, that would be about $ in today&#x27;s dollars. Because her husband&#x27;s income had always been erratic and he had invested it badly, the money she earned was welcome, especially with most of their children either in college or soon to begin.

==Family events==

After 15 years in Seneca Falls, Stanton moved to New York City in 1862 when her husband secured the position of deputy collector for the Port of New York. Their son Neil, who worked for Henry as his clerk, was caught taking bribes, causing both father and son to lose their jobs. Henry worked intermittently afterward as a journalist and a lawyer.

When her father died in 1859, Stanton received an inheritance worth an estimated $50,000, or about $ in today&#x27;s dollars. In 1868, she bought a substantial country house near Tenafly, New Jersey, an hour&#x27;s ride by train from New York City. The Stanton house in Tenafly is now a National Historic Landmark. Henry remained in the city in a rented apartment. Aside from visits, she and Henry afterward mostly lived apart.

Six of the seven Stanton children graduated from college. Colleges were closed to women when Stanton sought higher education, but both of her daughters were educated at Vassar College. Because graduate studies were not yet available to women in the U.S., Harriet enrolled in a master&#x27;s program in France, which she abandoned after she became engaged to be married. Harriet earned a master&#x27;s degree from Vassar at the age of 35.

After 1884, Henry began to spend more time at Tenafly. In 1885, just before his 80th birthday, he published a short autobiography called &quot;Random Recollections&quot;. In it, he said that he had married the daughter of the famous Judge Cady, but he did not provide her name. In the third edition of his book, he mentioned his wife by name a single time. He died in 1887 while she was in England visiting their daughter.

==National American Woman Suffrage Association==

The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, removing much of the original reason for the split in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more tightly on women&#x27;s suffrage instead of a variety of women&#x27;s issues, which brought it closer to the AWSA&#x27;s approach. The rivalry between the two organizations remained bitter, however, as the AWSA began to decline in strength during the 1880s.

In the late 1880s, Alice Stone Blackwell, daughter of AWSA leader Lucy Stone, began working to heal the breach among the older generation of leaders. Anthony warily cooperated with this effort, but Stanton did not, disappointed that both organizations wanted to focus almost exclusively on suffrage. She wrote to a friend: &quot;Lucy &amp; Susan alike see suffrage only. They do not see women&#x27;s religious &amp; social bondage, neither do the young women in either association, hence they may as well combine.&quot;

In 1890, the two organizations merged as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). At Anthony&#x27;s insistence, Stanton accepted its presidency despite her unease at the direction of the new organization. In her speech at the founding convention, she urged it to work on a broad range of women&#x27;s issues and called for it to include all races, creeds and classes, including &quot;Mormon, Indian and black women.&quot;
The day after she was elected president, Stanton sailed to her daughter&#x27;s home in England, where she stayed for eighteen months, leaving Anthony effectively in charge. When Stanton declined reelection to the presidency at the 1892 convention, Anthony was elected to that post.

In 1892, Stanton delivered the speech that became known as &quot;The Solitude of Self&quot; three different times in as many days, twice to Congressional committees and once as her final address to the NAWSA.
She considered it her best speech, and many others agreed. Lucy Stone printed it in its entirety in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; in the space where her own speech normally would have appeared. In pursuit of her lifelong quest to overturn the belief that women were lesser beings than men and therefore not suited for independence, Stanton said in this speech that women must develop themselves, acquiring an education and nourishing an inner strength, a belief in themselves. Self-sovereignty was the essential element in a woman&#x27;s life, not her role as daughter, wife or mother. Stanton said, &quot;no matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone.&quot;

==&quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot; and views on religion==

Stanton said she had been terrified as a child by a minister&#x27;s talk of damnation, but, after overcoming those fears with the help of her father and brother-in-law, had rejected that type of religion entirely. As an adult, her religious views continued to evolve. While living in Boston in the 1840s, she was attracted to the preaching of Theodore Parker, who, like her cousin Gerritt Smith, was a member of the Secret Six, a group of men who financed John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in an effort to spark an armed slave rebellion. Parker was a transcendentalist and a prominent Unitarian minister who taught that the &quot;Bible&quot; need not be taken literally, that God need not be envisioned as a male, and that individual men and women had the ability to determine religious truth for themselves.

In the Declaration of Sentiments written for the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, Stanton listed a series of grievances against males who, among other things, excluded women from the ministry and other leading roles in religion. In one of those grievances, Stanton said that man &quot;has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.&quot; This was the only grievance that was not a matter of fact (such as exclusion of women from colleges, from the right to vote, etc.), but one of belief, one that challenged a fundamental basis of authority and autonomy.

The years after the Civil War saw a significant increase in the variety of women&#x27;s social reform organizations and the number of activists in them. Stanton was uneasy about the belief held by many of these activists that government should enforce Christian ethics through such actions as teaching the &quot;Bible&quot; in public schools and strengthening Sunday closing laws. In her speech at the 1890 unity convention that established the NAWSA, Stanton said, &quot;I hope this convention will declare that the Woman Suffrage Association is opposed to all Union of Church and State and pledges itself … to maintain the secular nature of our government.

In 1895, Stanton published &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, a provocative examination of the &quot;Bible&quot; that questioned its status as the word of God and attacked the way it was being used to relegate women to an inferior status. Stanton wrote most of it, with the assistance of several other women, including Matilda Joslyn Gage, who had assisted with the History of Woman Suffrage. In it, Stanton methodically worked her way through the &quot;Bible&quot;, quoting selected passages and commenting on them, often sarcastically. A best-seller, with seven printings in six months, it was translated into several languages. A second volume was published in 1898.

The book created a storm of controversy that affected the entire women&#x27;s rights movement. Stanton could not have been surprised, having earlier told an acquaintance, &quot;Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear.&quot;

The process of critically examining the text of the &quot;Bible&quot;, known as historical criticism, was already an established practice in scholarly circles. What Stanton did that was new was to scrutinize the &quot;Bible&quot; from a woman&#x27;s point of view, basing her findings on the proposition that much of its text reflected not the word of God but prejudice against women during a less civilized age.

In her book, Stanton explicitly denied much of what was central to traditional Christianity, saying, &quot;I do not believe that any man ever saw or talked with God, I do not believe that God inspired the Mosaic code, or told the historians what they say he did about woman, for all the religions on the face of the earth degrade her, and so long as woman accepts the position that they assign her, her emancipation is impossible.&quot; In the book&#x27;s closing words, Stanton expressed the hope for reconstructing &quot;a more rational religion for the nineteenth century, and thus escape all the perplexities of the Jewish mythology as of no more importance than those of the Greek, Persian, and Egyptian.&quot;

At the 1896 NAWSA convention, Rachel Foster Avery, a rising young leader, harshly attacked &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, calling it a &quot;volume with a pretentious title … without either scholarship or literary merit.&quot; Avery introduced a resolution to distance the organization from Stanton&#x27;s book. Despite Anthony&#x27;s strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful, the resolution passed by a vote of 53 to 41. Stanton told Anthony that she should resign from her leadership post in protest, but Anthony refused. Stanton afterward grew increasingly alienated from the suffrage movement. The incident led many of the younger suffrage leaders to hold Stanton in low regard for the rest of her life.

==Final years==

When Stanton returned from her final trip to Europe in 1891, she moved in with two of her unmarried children who shared a home in New York City.
She increased her advocacy of &quot;educated suffrage,&quot; something she had long promoted. In 1894, she debated William Lloyd Garrison Jr. on this issue in the pages of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Her daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch, who was then active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Britain and would later be a leading figure in the U.S. movement, was disturbed by the views that Stanton expressed during this debate. She published a critique of her mother&#x27;s views, saying there were many people who had not enjoyed the opportunity to acquire an education and yet were intelligent and accomplished citizens who deserved the right to vote.
In a letter to the 1902 NAWSA convention, Stanton continued her campaign, calling for &quot;a constitutional amendment requiring an educational qualification&quot; and saying that &quot;everyone who votes should read and write the English language intelligently.&quot;

In her later years, Stanton became interested in efforts to create cooperative communities and workplaces. She was also attracted to various forms of political radicalism, applauding the Populist movement and identifying herself with socialism, especially Fabianism, a gradualist form of democratic socialism.

In 1898, Stanton published her memoirs, &quot;Eighty Years and More&quot;, in which she presented the image of herself by which she wished to be remembered. In it, she minimized political and personal conflicts and omitted any discussion of the split in the women&#x27;s movement. Largely dealing with political topics, the memoir barely mentions her mother, husband or children.
Despite some degree of friction between Stanton and Anthony in their later years, on the dedication page Stanton said, &quot;I dedicate this volume to Susan B. Anthony, my steadfast friend for half a century.&quot;

Stanton continued to write articles prolifically for a variety of publications right up until she died.

==Death and burial==

Stanton died in New York City on October 26, 1902, 18 years before women achieved the right to vote in the United States via the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The medical report said the cause of death was heart failure. According to her daughter Harriet, she had developed breathing problems that had begun to interfere with her work. The day before she died, Stanton told her doctor, a woman, to give her something to speed her death if the problem could not be cured.
Stanton had signed a document two years earlier directing that her brain was to be donated to Cornell University for scientific study after her death, but her wishes in that regard were not carried out. She was interred beside her husband in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

After Stanton&#x27;s death, Susan B. Anthony wrote to a friend: &quot;Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton&#x27;s opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am all at sea.&quot;

Even after her death, foes of women&#x27;s suffrage continued to use Stanton&#x27;s more unorthodox statements to promote opposition to ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which became law in 1920. Younger women in the suffrage movement responded by belittling Stanton and glorifying Anthony. In 1923, Alice Paul, leader of the National Women&#x27;s Party, introduced the proposed Equal Rights Amendment in Seneca Falls on the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. The planned ceremony and printed program made no mention of Stanton, the primary force behind the convention. One of the speakers was Stanton&#x27;s daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, who insisted on paying tribute to her mother&#x27;s role. Aside from a collection of her letters published by her children, no significant book about Stanton was written until a full-length biography was published in 1940 with the assistance of her daughter. Stanton began to regain recognition for her role in the women&#x27;s rights movement with the rise of the new feminist movement in the 1960s and the establishment of academic women&#x27;s history programs.

===Commemorations===
Stanton is commemorated, along with Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony, in the 1921 sculpture &quot;Portrait Monument&quot; by Adelaide Johnson in the United States Capitol. Placed for years in the crypt of the capitol building, it was moved in 1997 to a more prominent location in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.

In 1965, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca Falls was declared a National Historic Landmark. It is now part of the Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park.

In 1969, the group New York Radical Feminists was founded. It was organized into small cells or &quot;brigades&quot; named after notable feminists of the past; Anne Koedt and Shulamith Firestone led the Stanton-Anthony Brigade.

In 1973, Stanton was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 1975, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Tenafly, New Jersey, was declared a National Historic Landmark.

In 1982, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project began work as an academic undertaking to collect and document all available materials written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The six-volume &quot;The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony&quot; was published from the 14,000 documents collected by the project. The project has since ended.

In 1999, Ken Burns and Paul Barnes produced the documentary &quot;Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &amp; Susan B. Anthony&quot;, which won a Peabody Award.

In 1999, a sculpture by Ted Aub was unveiled to commemorate the introduction of Stanton to Susan B. Anthony by Amelia Bloomer on May 12, 1851. This sculpture, called &quot;When Anthony Met Stanton,&quot; consists of the three women depicted as life-size bronze statues. It overlooks Van Cleef Lake in Seneca Falls, New York, where the introduction occurred.

The &quot;Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act&quot; was introduced into Congress in 2005 to fund services for students who were pregnant or already were parents. It did not become law.

In 2008, 37 Park Row, the site of the office of Stanton and Anthony&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Revolution,&quot; was included in the map of Manhattan historical sites related to women&#x27;s history that was created by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President.

Stanton is commemorated, together with Amelia Bloomer, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Ross Tubman, in the calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church on July 20 of each year.

The U.S. Treasury Department announced in 2016 that an image of Stanton would appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession. New $5, $10 and $20 bills were planned to be introduced in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote, but were delayed.

In 2020, the Women&#x27;s Rights Pioneers Monument was unveiled in Central Park in New York City on the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment giving women the right to vote. Created by Meredith Bergmann, this sculpture depicts Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth engaged in animated discussion.

<text>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).

OSPF gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology is presented as a routing table to the internet layer for routing packets by their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) networks and is widely used in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks.

Originally designed in the 1980s, OSPF version 2 is defined in RFC 2328 (1998). The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.

==Concepts==
OSPF is an interior gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology is presented as a routing table to the internet layer which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address.

OSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and converges on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds. It computes the shortest-path tree for each route using a method based on Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm. The OSPF routing policies for constructing a route table are governed by link metrics associated with each routing interface. Cost factors may be the distance of a router (round-trip time), data throughput of a link, or link availability and reliability, expressed as simple unitless numbers. This provides a dynamic process of traffic load balancing between routes of equal cost.

OSPF divides the network into routing &quot;areas&quot; to simplify administration and optimize traffic and resource utilization. Areas are identified by 32-bit numbers, expressed either simply in decimal, or often in the same octet-based dot-decimal notation used for IPv4 addresses. By convention, area 0 (zero), or 0.0.0.0, represents the core or &quot;backbone&quot; area of an OSPF network. While the identifications of other areas may be chosen at will, administrators often select the IP address of a main router in an area as the area identifier. Each additional area must have a connection to the OSPF backbone area. Such connections are maintained by an interconnecting router, known as an area border router (ABR). An ABR maintains separate link-state databases for each area it serves and maintains summarized routes for all areas in the network.

OSPF runs over IPv4 and IPv6, but does not use a transport protocol such as UDP or TCP. It encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This is in contrast to other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport error detection and correction functions. OSPF also uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. It reserves the multicast addresses (IPv4) and (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and (IPv4) and (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The protocol may therefore be considered a link layer protocol, but is often also attributed to the application layer in the TCP/IP model. It has a virtual link feature that can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. OSPF over IPv4 can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3 (IPv6) relies on standard IPv6 protocol security (IPsec), and has no internal authentication methods.

For routing IP multicast traffic, OSPF supports the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) protocol. Cisco does not include MOSPF in their OSPF implementations. Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in conjunction with OSPF or other IGPs, is widely deployed.

OSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol. Except for virtual links, all neighbor exchanges use IPv6 link-local addressing exclusively. The IPv6 protocol runs per link, rather than based on the subnet. All IP prefix information has been removed from the link-state advertisements and from the &quot;hello&quot; discovery packet making OSPFv3 essentially protocol-independent. Despite the expanded IP addressing to 128 bits in IPv6, area and router Identifications are still based on 32-bit numbers.
==Router relationships==
OSPF supports complex networks with multiple routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple links to other subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or at each end of a point-to-point link communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form &quot;adjacencies&quot; when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a &quot;hello&quot; protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a &quot;two-way state&quot; and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a &quot;designated router&quot; (DR) and a &quot;backup designated router&quot; (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast transmission modes to send &quot;hello&quot; packets and link-state updates.

As a link-state routing protocol, OSPF establishes and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an &quot;adjacency database&quot;. Two OSPF routers are neighbors if they are members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information the only packets they exchange are hello packets. OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if at least one of them is designated router or backup designated router (on multiaccess-type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.

===Operation modes===
The OSPF can have different operation modes on the following setups on an interface or network:
* Point-to-point. Each router advertises itself by periodically multicasting hello packets. No designated router is elected. The interface can be IP unnumbered (without a unique IP address assigned to it).
* Broadcast (default), each router advertises itself by periodically multicasting hello packets.
* Non-broadcast multi-access, with the use of designated routers. May need static configuration. Packets are sent as unicast. 
* Point-to-multipoint, where OSPF treats neighbours as a collection of point-to-point links. No designated router is elected. Separate hello packets are sent to each neighbor.
* Point to Multipoint Non Broadcast (P2MP-NB), No designated router is elected. Separate hello packets are sent to each neighbor, Packets are sent as unicast.
* Passive, Only advertised to other neighbours. No adjacency is advertised on network.

====Indirect connections====

Virtual link over Virtual links, tunneling and sham links, are a form of connections that goes over the routing engine, and is not a direct connection to the remote host.

* Virtual links: The packets are sent as unicast. Can only be configured on a non-backbone area (but not stub-area). Endpoints need to be ABR, the virtual links behave as unnumbered point-to-point connections. The cost of an intra-area path between the two routers is added to the link.
* Virtual link over tunneling (like GRE and WireGuard): Since OSPF does not support virtual links for areas other than the backbone, a workaround is to use of tunneling. If the same IP or router ID is used, the link creates two equal-cost routes to the destination.
* Sham link: An intra-area link that connects two sites via the MPLS VPN backbone that is preferred to an internal intra-area &quot;OSPF backdoor link&quot; between the same two sites. A sham link is only needed if the MPLS VPN backbone is preferred over the OSPF backdoor link.

===Adjacency state machine===
Each OSPF router within a network communicates with other neighboring routers on each connecting interface to establish the states of all adjacencies. Every such communication sequence is a separate &quot;conversation&quot; identified by the pair of router IDs of the communicating neighbors. RFC 2328 specifies the protocol for initiating these conversations (&quot;Hello Protocol&quot;) and for establishing full adjacencies (&quot;database description packets&quot;, &quot;link-state request packets&quot;). During its course, each router conversation transitions through a maximum of eight conditions defined by a state machine:

====Neighbor state changes====

#Down: The state &quot;down&quot; represents the initial state of a conversation when no information has been exchanged and retained between routers with the Hello Protocol.
#Attempt: The &quot;attempt&quot; state is similar to the &quot;down&quot; state, except that a router is in the process of efforts to establish a conversation with another router, but is only used on non-broadcast multiple-access networks (NBMAs).
#Init: The &quot;init&quot; state indicates that a hello packet has been received from a neighbor, but the router has not established a two-way conversation.
#Two-way: The &quot;two-way&quot; state indicates the establishment of a bidirectional conversation between two routers. This state immediately precedes the establishment of adjacency. This is the lowest state of a router that may be considered as a DR.

====Database exchange====

#Exchange start (exstart): The &quot;exstart&quot; state is the first step of adjacency of two routers.
#Exchange: In the &quot;exchange&quot; state, a router is sending its link-state database information to the adjacent neighbor. At this state, a router can exchange all OSPF routing protocol packets. 
#Loading: In the &quot;loading&quot; state, a router requests the most recent link-state advertisements (LSAs) from its neighbor discovered in the previous state.
#Full: The &quot;full&quot; state concludes the conversation when the routers are fully adjacent, and the state appears in all router- and network-LSAs. The link-state databases of the neighbors are fully synchronized.

===Broadcast networks===
In broadcast multiple-access networks, neighbor adjacency is formed dynamically using multicast hello packets to .

 IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 224.0.0.5: OSPFv2, hello
 IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 224.0.0.5: OSPFv2, hello
 IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, database description
 IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, database description

===Passive network===
A network where OSPF adverts the network, but the OSPF will not start neighbour adjacency.

===Non-broadcast networks===
In a non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) network, a neighbor adjacency is formed by sending unicast packets to another router. A non-broadcast network can have more than two routers, but broadcast is not supported.

 IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, hello
 IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, hello
 IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, database description
 IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, database description

Examples of non-broadcast networks:
* X.25 public data network
* Wireguard
* Serial interface
* Requires all routers to be able to communicate directly, on the same network.
* Designated Router is elected for the network. 
* LSA is generated for the network.

==OSPF areas ==
A network is divided into OSPF &quot;areas&quot; that are logical groupings of hosts and networks. An area includes its connecting router having an interface for each connected network link. Each router maintains a separate link-state database for the area whose information may be summarized towards the rest of the network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.

OSPF can handle thousands of routers with more a concern of reaching capacity of the forwarding information base (FIB) table when the network contains lots of routes and lower-end devices. Modern low-end routers have a full gigabyte of RAM, which allows them to handle many routers in an area 0. Many resources refer to OSPF guides from over 20 years ago where it was impressive to have 64 MB of RAM.

Areas are uniquely identified with 32-bit numbers. The area identifiers are commonly written in the dot-decimal notation, familiar from IPv4 addressing. However, they are not IP addresses and may duplicate, without conflict, any IPv4 address. The area identifiers for IPv6 implementations (OSPFv3) also use 32-bit identifiers written in the same notation. When dotted formatting is omitted, most implementations expand area &quot;1&quot; to the area identifier &quot;0.0.0.1&quot;, but some have been known to expand it as &quot;1.0.0.0&quot;.

Several vendors (Cisco, Allied Telesis, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Quagga), implement &quot;totally stubby&quot; and &quot;NSSA totally stubby area&quot; for stub and not-so-stubby areas. Although not covered by RFC standards, they are considered by many to be standard features in OSPF implementations.

OSPF defines several area types: 
* Backbone
* Non-backbone/regular
* Stub 
* Totally stubby 
* Not-so-stubby
* Totally not-so-stubby
* Transit

===Backbone area===

The backbone area (also known as &quot;area 0&quot; or &quot;area 0.0.0.0&quot;) forms the core of an OSPF network. All other areas are connected to it, either directly or through other routers. OSPF requires this to prevent routing loops. Inter-area routing happens via routers connected to the backbone area and to their own associated areas. It is the logical and physical structure for the &#x27;OSPF domain&#x27; and is attached to all nonzero areas in the OSPF domain. In OSPF the term &quot;autonomous system boundary router&quot; (ASBR) is historic, in the sense that many OSPF domains can coexist in the same Internet-visible autonomous system, RFC 1996.

All OSPF areas must connect to the backbone area. This connection, however, can be through a virtual link. For example, assume area 0.0.0.1 has a physical connection to area 0.0.0.0. Further assume that area 0.0.0.2 has no direct connection to the backbone, but this area does have a connection to area 0.0.0.1. Area 0.0.0.2 can use a virtual link through the &quot;transit area&quot; 0.0.0.1 to reach the backbone. To be a transit area, an area has to have the transit attribute, so it cannot be stubby in any way.

=== Regular area ===

A regular area is just a non-backbone (nonzero) area without specific feature, generating and receiving summary and external LSAs. The backbone area is a special type of such area.

===Stub area===

:In hello packets the E-flag is not high, indicating &quot;External routing: not capable&quot;
A stub area is an area that does not receive route advertisements external to the AS and routing from within the area is based entirely on a default route. An ABR deletes type 4 and 5 LSAs from internal routers, sends them a default route of 0.0.0.0 and turns itself into a default gateway. This reduces LSDB and routing table size for internal routers.

Modifications to the basic concept of stub area have been implemented by systems vendors, such as the &quot;totally stubby area&quot; (TSA) and the &quot;not-so-stubby area&quot; (NSSA), both an extension in Cisco Systems routing equipment.

====Totally stubby area====

A &quot;totally stubby area&quot; is similar to a stub area. However, this area does not allow &quot;summary&quot; routes in addition to not having &quot;external&quot; routes, that is, &quot;inter-area&quot; (IA) routes are not summarized into totally stubby areas. The only way for traffic to get routed outside the area is a default route which is the only Type-3 LSA advertised into the area. When there is only one route out of the area, fewer routing decisions have to be made by the route processor, which lowers system resource utilization.

:Occasionally, it is said that a TSA can have only one ABR.

===Not-so-stubby area===

:In hello packets the N-flag is set high, indicating &quot;NSSA: supported&quot;
A &quot;not-so-stubby area&quot; (NSSA) is a type of stub area that can import autonomous system external routes and send them to other areas, but still cannot receive AS-external routes from other areas.

NSSA is an extension of the stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes in a limited fashion into the stub area. A case study simulates an NSSA getting around the stub-area problem of not being able to import external addresses. It visualizes the following activities: the ASBR imports external addresses with a type 7 LSA, the ABR converts a type 7 LSA to type 5 and floods it to other areas, the ABR acts as an ASBR for other areas.
The ASBRs do not take type 5 LSAs and then convert to type 7 LSAs for the area.

====Totally not-so-stubby area====

An addition to the standard functionality of an NSSA, the &quot;totally stubby NSSA&quot; is an NSSA that takes on the attributes of a TSA, meaning that type 3 and 4 summary routes are not flooded into this type of area. It is also possible to declare an area both totally stubby and not-so-stubby, which means that the area will receive only the default route from area 0.0.0.0, but can also contain an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) that accepts external routing information and injects it into the local area, and from the local area into area 0.0.0.0.

:Redistribution into an NSSA area creates a special type of LSA known as type 7, which can exist only in an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA, and an NSSA ABR router translates it into a type 5 LSA, which gets propagated into the OSPF domain.

A newly acquired subsidiary is one example of where it might be suitable for an area to be simultaneously not-so-stubby and totally stubby if the practical place to put an ASBR is on the edge of a totally stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the totally stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. In Cisco&#x27;s implementation, the external routes can be summarized before injecting them into the totally stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an advertisement makes sense.

By declaring the totally stubby area as NSSA, no external routes from the backbone, except the default route, enter the area being discussed. The externals do reach area 0.0.0.0 via the TSA-NSSA, but no routes other than the default route enter the TSA-NSSA. Routers in the TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR, except to routes advertised by the ASBR.

==Router types==
OSPF defines the following overlapping categories of routers:
;Internal router (IR): An &quot;internal router&quot; has all its interfaces belonging to the same area.
;Area border router (ABR): An &quot;area border router&quot; is a router that connects one or more areas to the main backbone network. It is considered a member of all areas it is connected to. An ABR keeps multiple instances of the link-state database in memory, one for each area to which that router is connected.
;Backbone router (BR): A &quot;backbone router&quot; has an interface to the backbone area. Backbone routers may also be area border routers, but do not have to be.
;Autonomous system boundary router (ASBR): An &quot;autonomous system boundary router&quot; is a router that is connected by using more than one routing protocol and that exchanges routing information with routers autonomous systems. ASBRs typically also run an exterior routing protocol (e.g., BGP), or use static routes, or both. An ASBR is used to distribute routes received from other, external ASs throughout its own autonomous system. An ASBR creates External LSAs for external addresses and floods them to all areas via ABR. Routers in other areas use ABRs as next hops to access external addresses. Then ABRs forward packets to the ASBR that announces the external addresses.

The router type is an attribute of an OSPF process. A given physical router may have one or more OSPF processes. For example, a router that is connected to more than one area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an area border router and an autonomous system boundary router.

Each router has an identifier, customarily written in the dotted-decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, it does not have to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn&#x27;t to avoid confusion.

==Non-point-to-point network==

On networks (same subnet) with networks type of:
* Broadcast 
* Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) 

A system of &quot;designated router&quot; (DR) and &quot;backup designated router&quot; (BDR), is used to reducing network traffic by providing a source for routing updates.
This is done using multicast addresses:

* , all routers in the topology will listen on that multicast address.
* , DR and BDR will listen on that multicast address.

The DR and BDR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a leader/follower relationship with the DR and BDR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address . The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address . This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. DR&#x27;s can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either side of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.

===Designated router===
A &quot;designated router&quot; (DR) is the router interface elected among all routers on a particular multiaccess network segment, generally assumed to be broadcast multiaccess. Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, may be needed to support the DR function on non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) media. It is usually wise to configure the individual virtual circuits of an NBMA subnet as individual point-to-point lines; the techniques used are implementation-dependent.

===Backup designated router===
A &quot;backup designated router&quot; (BDR) is a router that becomes the designated router if the current designated router has a problem or fails. The BDR is the OSPF router with the second-highest priority at the time of the last election.

A given router can have some interfaces that are designated (DR) and others that are backup designated (BDR), and others that are non-designated. If no router is a DR or a BDR on a given subnet, the BDR is first elected, and then a second election is held for the DR.

===DR Other===
A router that has not been selected to be &quot;designated router&quot; (DR) or &quot;backup designated router&quot; (BDR). The router forms an adjacency to both the &quot;designated router&quot; (DR) and the &quot;backup designated router&quot; (BDR).

For other non (B)DR, the adjacency stops at &quot;2-ways&quot; State.

===Designated router election===
The DR is elected based on the following default criteria:
* If the priority setting on an OSPF router is set to 0, that means it can NEVER become a DR or BDR.
* If no DR exists on the network, routes will wait until &quot;Wait Timer&quot; runs out.
* When a DR fails and the BDR takes over, there is another election to see who becomes the replacement BDR.
* The router sending the Hello packets with the highest priority wins the election.
* If two or more routers tie with the highest priority setting, the router sending the Hello with the highest RID (Router ID) wins. NOTE: a RID is the highest logical (loopback) IP address configured on a router, if no logical/loopback IP address is set then the router uses the highest IP address configured on its active interfaces (e.g. would be higher than ).
* Usually the router with the second-highest priority number becomes the BDR.
* The priority values range between 0 – 255, with a higher value increasing its chances of becoming DR or BDR.
* If a higher priority OSPF router comes online after the election has taken place, it will not become DR or BDR until (at least) the DR and BDR fail.
* If the current DR &#x27;goes down&#x27; the current BDR becomes the new DR and a new election takes place to find another BDR. If the new DR then &#x27;goes down&#x27; and the original DR is now available, still previously chosen BDR will become DR.

===Routing update flow===

==Protocol messages==


Unlike other routing protocols, OSPF does not carry data via a transport protocol, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Instead, OSPF forms IP datagrams directly, packaging them using protocol number 89 for the IP Protocol field. OSPF defines five different message types, for various types of communication. Multiple packets can be sent per frame.

OSPF uses 5 packet types:
* Hello
* Database description
* Link state request
* Link state update
* Link state acknowledgement

=== Hello Packet ===

OSPF&#x27;s Hello messages are used as a form of greeting, to allow a router to discover other adjacent routers on its local links and networks. The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is to be used in the autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the &quot;hello interval&quot;); if a router stops receiving hello messages from a neighbor, after a set period (the &quot;dead interval&quot;) the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.

=== Database description (DBD) ===
&quot;Database description&quot; messages contain descriptions of the topology of the autonomous system or area. They convey the contents of the link-state database (LSDB) for the area from one router to another. Communicating a large LSDB may require several messages to be sent by having the sending device designated as a leader device and sending messages in sequence, with the follower (recipient of the LSDB information) responding with acknowledgments.

===Link state packets ===


;Link state request (&quot;LSR&quot;): &quot;Link state request&quot; messages are used by one router to request updated information about a portion of the LSDB from another router. The message specifies the link(s) for which the requesting device wants more current information.
;Link state update (&quot;LSU&quot;): &quot;Link-state update&quot; messages contain updated information about the state of certain links on the LSDB. They are sent in response to a link state request message, and also broadcast or multicast by routers on a regular basis. Their contents are used to update the information in the LSDBs of routers that receive them.

;Link state acknowledgment (&quot;LSAck&quot;): &quot;Link-state acknowledgment&quot; messages provide reliability to the link-state exchange process, by explicitly acknowledging receipt of a Link State Update message.

==== OSPF v2 area types and accepted LSAs ====
Not all area types use all LSA. Below is a matrix of accepted LSAs.
==Routing metrics==
OSPF uses &quot;path cost&quot; as its basic routing metric, which was defined by the standard not to equate to any standard value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric important to the design. In practice, it is determined by comparing the speed of the interface to a reference-bandwidth for the OSPF process. The cost is determined by dividing the reference bandwidth by the interface speed (although the cost for any interface can be manually overridden). If a reference bandwidth is set to &#x27;10000&#x27;, then a 10 Gbit/s link will have a cost of 1. Any speeds less than 1 are rounded up to 1. Here is an example table that shows the routing metric or &#x27;cost calculation&#x27; on an interface.
* Type-1 LSA has a size of 16-bit field (65,535 in decimal)
* Type-3 LSA has a size of 24-bit field (16,777,216 in decimal)
OSPF is a layer 3 protocol. If a layer 2 switch is between the two devices running OSPF, one side may negotiate a speed different from the other side. This can create an asymmetric routing on the link (Router 1 to Router 2 could cost &#x27;1&#x27; and the return path could cost &#x27;10&#x27;), which may lead to unintended consequences.

Metrics, however, are only directly comparable when of the same type. Four types of metrics are recognized. In decreasing preference (for example, an intra-area route is always preferred to an external route regardless of metric), these types are:
# Intra-area
# Inter-area
# External Type 1, which includes both the external path cost and the sum of internal path costs to the ASBR that advertises the route,
# External Type 2, the value of which is solely that of the external path cost,

==OSPF v3==
OSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol. 
Despite the expansion of addresses to 128 bits in IPv6, area and router identifications are still 32-bit numbers.

=== High-level changes ===
* Except for virtual links, all neighbor exchanges use IPv6 link-local addressing exclusively. The IPv6 protocol runs per link, rather than based on the subnet. 
* All IP prefix information has been removed from the link-state advertisements and from the &quot;hello&quot; discovery packet, making OSPFv3 essentially protocol-independent. 
* Three separate flooding scopes for LSAs:
** Link-local scope: LSA is flooded only on the local link and no further.
** Area scope: LSA is flooded throughout a single OSPF area. 
** AS scope: LSA is flooded throughout the routing domain.
* Use of IPv6 link-local addresses, for neighbor discovery, auto-configuration.
* Authentication has been moved to the IP Authentication Header

=== Changes introduced in OSPF v3, then backported by vendors to v2 ===
* Explicit support for multiple instances per link

=== Packet format changes ===
* OSPF version number changed to 3
* From the LSA header, the options field has been removed.
* In hello packets and database description, the options field is changed from 16 to 24 bits.
* In hello packet, the address information has been removed. The interface ID has been added.
* In router-LSAs, two options bits, the &quot;R-bit&quot; and the &quot;V6-bit&quot;, have been added.
** &quot;R-bit&quot;: allows for multi-homed hosts to participate in the routing protocol.
** &quot;V6-bit&quot;: specializes the R-bit. 
* Add &quot;instance ID&quot;, which allows multiple OSPF protocol instances on the same logical interface.

=== LSA format changes ===
* The LSA type field is changed to 16 bits.
** Add support for handling unknown LSA types
** Three bits are used for encoding flooding scope.
* With IPv6, addresses in LSAs are expressed as prefix and prefix length.
* In router-LSAs and network-LSAs, the address information is removed.
* Router-LSAs and network-LSAs are made network-protocol independent.
* A new LSA type is added, link-LSA, which provides the router&#x27;s link-local address to all other routers attached to the logical interface, provides a list of IPv6 prefixes to associate with the link, and can send information that reflect the router&#x27;s capabilities.
* LSA Type-3 summary-LSAs have been renamed &quot;inter-area-prefix-LSAs&quot;.
* LSA Type-4 summary LSAs have been renamed &quot;inter-area-router-LSAs&quot;.
* Intra-area-prefix-LSA is added, an LSA that carries all IPv6 prefix information.

== OSPF over MPLS VPN ==


A customer can use OSPF over a MPLS VPN, where the service provider uses BGP or RIP as their interior gateway protocol.
When using OSPF over MPLS VPN, the VPN backbone becomes part of the OSPF backbone area 0. In all areas, isolated copies of the IGP are run.

Advantages: 
* The MPLS VPN is transparent to the customer&#x27;s OSPF standard routing.
* Customer&#x27;s equipment only needs to support OSPF.
* Reduce the need for tunnels (Generic Routing Encapsulation, IPsec, wireguard) to use OSPF.

To achieve this, a modified OSPF-BGP redistribution is used. All OSPF routes retain the source LSA type and metric.
To prevent loops, an optional DN bit is set by the service provider in LSAs from the provider equipment to indicate that a route has already been sent to the customer&#x27;s equipment.

==OSPF extensions==

===Traffic engineering===
OSPF-TE is an extension to OSPF extending the expressivity to allow for traffic engineering and use on non-IP networks. Using OSPF-TE, more information about the topology can be exchanged using opaque LSA carrying type–length–value elements. These extensions allow OSPF-TE to run completely out of band of the data plane network. This means that it can also be used on non-IP networks, such as optical networks.

OSPF-TE is used in GMPLS networks as a means to describe the topology over which GMPLS paths can be established. GMPLS uses its own path setup and forwarding protocols, once it has the full network map.

In the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), OSPF-TE is used for recording and flooding RSVP signaled bandwidth reservations for label-switched paths within the link-state database.

===Optical routing===
 documents work in optical routing for IP based on extensions to OSPF and IS-IS.

=== Multicast Open Shortest Path First ===
The Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) protocol is an extension to OSPF to support multicast routing. MOSPF allows routers to share information about group memberships.

==Applications==
OSPF is a widely deployed routing protocol that can converge a network in a few seconds and guarantee loop-free paths. It has many features that allow the imposition of policies about the propagation of routes that it may be appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing. IS-IS, in contrast, can be tuned for lower overhead in a stable network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISPs today may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF, after first considering the pros and cons of IS-IS in service provider environments.

 When the default route to an ISP is injected into OSPF from multiple ASBRs as a Type I external route and the same external cost specified, other routers will go to the ASBR with the least path cost from its location. This can be tuned further by adjusting the external cost. If the default route from different ISPs is injected with different external costs, as a Type II external route, the lower-cost default becomes the primary exit and the higher-cost becomes the backup only.
