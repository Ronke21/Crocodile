<text>Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901May 13, 1961) was an American actor known for his strong, silent screen persona and understated acting style. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice and had a further three nominations, as well as an Academy Honorary Award in 1961 for his career achievements. He was one of the top-10 film personalities for 23 consecutive years and one of the top money-making stars for 18 years. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper at number11 on its list of the 50 greatest screen legends.

Cooper&#x27;s career spanned 36 years, from 1925 to 1961, and included leading roles in 84 feature films. He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range included roles in most major film genres. His ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his natural and authentic appearance on screen. Throughout his career, he sustained a screen persona that represented the ideal American hero.

Cooper began his career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, he became a movie star with his first sound picture, playing the title role in 1929&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot;. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero, a champion of the common man in films such as &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936), &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941), &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942), and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943). He later portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949) and &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952). In his final films, he played nonviolent characters searching for redemption in films such as &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956) and &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958).

==Early life==
Frank James Cooper was born in Helena, Montana, on May 7, 1901, the younger of two sons of English immigrant parents Alice (née Brazier; 1873–1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865–1946). His brother, Arthur, was six years his senior. Cooper&#x27;s father came from Houghton Regis, England and became a prominent lawyer, rancher, and Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother hailed from Gillingham, England, and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch, about north of Helena near Craig, Montana. Cooper and Arthur spent their summers at the ranch and learned to ride horses, hunt and fish. Cooper attended Central Grade School in Helena.

Alice wanted their sons to have a British education, so she took them back to the United Kingdom in 1909 to enroll them in Dunstable Grammar School in Dunstable, England. While there, Cooper and his brother lived with their father&#x27;s cousins, William and Emily Barton, at their home in Houghton Regis. Cooper studied Latin, French and English history at Dunstable until 1912. While he adapted to English school discipline and learned the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the formal Eton collars he was required to wear. He received his confirmation in the Church of England at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis on December 3, 1911. His mother accompanied their sons back to the U.S. in August 1912 and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.

When Cooper was 15, he injured his hip in a car accident. On his doctor&#x27;s recommendation, he returned to the Seven-Bar-Nine ranch to recuperate with horseback riding. The misguided therapy left him with his characteristic stiff, off-balanced walk and slightly angled horse-riding style. He left Helena High School after two years in 1918 and returned to the family ranch to work full-time as a cowboy. In 1919, his father arranged for his son to attend Gallatin County High School in Bozeman, Montana, where English teacher Ida Davis encouraged him to focus on academics and participate in debating and dramatics. Cooper later called Davis &quot;the woman partly responsible for [his] giving up cowboy-ing and going to college&quot;.

Cooper was still attending high school in 1920, when he took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross&#x27; Hole&quot; (1910), which still hangs in the state capitol building in Helena. 
In 1922, to continue his art education, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa. He did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted into the school&#x27;s drama club. His drawings and watercolor paintings were exhibited throughout the dormitory and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses. Despite a promising first 18 months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist and then returned to Helena, where he sold editorial cartoons to the local &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper.

In autumn 1924, Cooper&#x27;s father left the Montana Supreme Court bench and moved with his wife to Los Angeles to administer the estates of two relatives, and Cooper joined his parents there in November at his father&#x27;s request. After briefly working a series of unpromising jobs, he met two friends from Montana, who were working as film extras and stunt riders in low-budget Western films for the small movie studios on Poverty Row. They introduced him to another Montana cowboy, rodeo champion Jay &quot;Slim&quot; Talbot, who took him to see a casting director. Wanting money for a professional art course, Cooper worked as a film extra for $5 a day and as a stunt rider for $10. Cooper and Talbot became close friends and hunting companions and Talbot later worked as Cooper&#x27;s stuntman and stand-in for over three decades.

==Career==
===Silent films, 1925–1928===

In early 1925, Cooper began his film career in silent pictures such as &quot;The Thundering Herd&quot; and &quot;Wild Horse Mesa&quot; with Jack Holt, &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; and &quot;The Lucky Horseshoe&quot; with Tom Mix, and &quot;The Trail Rider&quot; with Buck Jones. He worked for several Poverty Row studios, but also the already emergent major studios, Famous Players–Lasky and Fox Film Corporation. While his skilled horsemanship led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work, which sometimes injured horses and riders, &quot;tough and cruel&quot;. Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent. Knowing that other actors were using the name &quot;Frank Cooper&quot;, Collins suggested he change his first name to &quot;Gary&quot; after her hometown of Gary, Indiana. Cooper immediately liked the name.

Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in &quot;The Eagle&quot; (1925), as a Roman guard in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1925), and as a flood survivor in &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot; (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as &quot;Tricks&quot; (1925), in which he played the film&#x27;s antagonist, and the short film &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Wins&quot; (1926). As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for $50 a week.

Cooper&#x27;s first important film role was a supporting part in &quot;The Winning of Barbara Worth&quot; (1926) starring Ronald Colman and Vilma Bánky, in which he plays a young engineer who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster. Cooper&#x27;s experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an &quot;instinctive authenticity&quot;, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers. The film was a major success. Critics singled out Cooper as a &quot;dynamic new personality&quot; and future star. Goldwyn rushed to offer Cooper a long-term contract, but he held out for a better deal – a five-year contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for $175 a week. In 1927, with help from Clara Bow, Cooper landed high-profile roles in &quot;Children of Divorce&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; (both 1927), the latter being the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in &quot;Arizona Bound&quot; and &quot;Nevada&quot;, both films directed by John Waters.

Paramount paired Cooper with Fay Wray in &quot;The Legion of the Condemned&quot; and &quot;The First Kiss&quot; (both 1928), advertising them as the studio&#x27;s &quot;glorious young lovers&quot;. Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences. With each new film, Cooper&#x27;s acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers. During this time, he was earning as much as $2,750 per film and receiving 1,000 fan letters a week. Looking to exploit Cooper&#x27;s growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent in &quot;Beau Sabreur&quot;, Florence Vidor in &quot;Doomsday&quot;, and Esther Ralston in &quot;Half a Bride&quot; (all 1928). Around the same time, Cooper made &quot;Lilac Time&quot; (1928) with Colleen Moore for First National Pictures, his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects. It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.

===Hollywood stardom, 1929–1935===
Cooper became a major movie star in 1929 playing the lead role in his first talking picture, &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929), which was directed by Victor Fleming and co-starred Mary Brian and Walter Huston. Based on the popular novel by Owen Wister, &quot;The Virginian&quot; was one of the first sound films to define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions of the Western movie genre that persist to the present day. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, the romantic image of the tall, handsome, and shy cowboy hero who embodied male freedom, courage, and honor was created in large part by Cooper in the film. Unlike some silent-film actors who had trouble adapting to the new sound medium, Cooper transitioned naturally, with his &quot;deep and clear&quot; and &quot;pleasantly drawling&quot; voice, which perfectly suited the characters he portrayed on screen. Looking to capitalize on Cooper&#x27;s growing popularity, Paramount cast him in several Westerns and wartime dramas, including &quot;Only the Brave&quot;, &quot;The Texan&quot;, &quot;Seven Days&#x27; Leave&quot;, &quot;A Man from Wyoming&quot;, and &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (all released in 1930). Norman Rockwell depicted Cooper in his role as &quot;The Texan&quot; for the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on May 24, 1930.
One of the most important performances in Cooper&#x27;s early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s film &quot;Morocco&quot; (also 1930) with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The actor approached the director, picked him up by the collar, and said, &quot;If you expect to work in this country, you&#x27;d better get on to the language we use here.&quot; Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced &quot;one of his best performances&quot;, according to Thornton Delehanty of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;.

After returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Caravans&quot; (1931) with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film &quot;City Streets&quot; (also 1931), co-starring Sylvia Sidney and Paul Lukas, playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: &quot;I Take This Woman&quot; (also 1931) with Carole Lombard, and &quot;His Woman&quot; with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making 10 films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost , and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.

During his time abroad, Cooper stayed with the Countess Dorothy di Frasso, the former Dorothy Cadwell Taylor, at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe&#x27;s nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and galleries of Italy, she accompanied him on a 10-week big-game hunting safari on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with more than 60 kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, the countess and he set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.
In 1932, after completing &quot;Devil and the Deep&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead to fulfill his old contract, Cooper appeared in &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. Co-starring Helen Hayes, a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner, and Adolphe Menjou, the film presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles, playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy, who falls in love with an English nurse during World War I. Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance, and the film became one of the year&#x27;s most commercially successful pictures. In 1933, after making &quot;Today We Live&quot; with Joan Crawford and &quot;One Sunday Afternoon&quot; with Fay Wray, Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film &quot;Design for Living&quot;, based on the successful Noël Coward play. Co-starring Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March, the film was a box-office success, ranking as one of the top-10 highest-grossing films of 1933. All three of the lead actorsMarch, Cooper, and Hopkinsreceived attention from this film, as they were all at the peak of their careers. Cooper&#x27;s performance, as an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman, was singled out for its versatility and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy. Cooper changed his name legally to &quot;Gary Cooper&quot; in August 1933.
In 1934, Cooper was lent out to MGM for the Civil War drama film &quot;Operator 13&quot; with Marion Davies, about a beautiful Union spy who falls in love with a Confederate soldier. Despite Richard Boleslawski&#x27;s imaginative direction and George J. Folsey&#x27;s lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office.

Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway, &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple&#x27;s intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.

In 1935, Cooper was lent to Samuel Goldwyn Productions to appear in King Vidor&#x27;s romance film &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; with Anna Sten, who was being groomed as &quot;another Garbo&quot;. In the film, Cooper plays an alcoholic novelist who retreats to his family&#x27;s New England farm, where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polish neighbor. Cooper delivered a performance of surprising range and depth, according to biographer Larry Swindell. Despite receiving generally favorable reviews, the film was not popular with American audiences, who may have been offended by the film&#x27;s depiction of an extramarital affair and its tragic ending.

Also in 1935, Cooper appeared in two Henry Hathaway films: the melodrama &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot; with Ann Harding, about a man caught up in a dream world created by his love for a childhood sweetheart, and the adventure film &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;, about a daring British officer and his men who defend their stronghold at Bengal against rebellious local tribes. While the former, championed by the surrealists became more successful in Europe than in the United States, the latter was nominated for seven Academy Awards and became one of Cooper&#x27;s most popular and successful adventure films. Hathaway had the highest respect for Cooper&#x27;s acting ability, calling him &quot;the best actor of all of them&quot;.

===American folk hero, 1936–1943===
====From &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; to &quot;The Real Glory&quot;, 1936–1939====
Cooper&#x27;s career took an important turn in 1936. After making Frank Borzage&#x27;s romantic comedy film &quot;Desire&quot; with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount, in which he delivered a performance considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest, Cooper returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent-film days to make Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; with Jean Arthur for Columbia Pictures. In the film, Cooper plays Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New York City, where he faces a world of corruption and deceit. Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin were able to use Cooper&#x27;s well-established screen persona as the &quot;quintessential American hero&quot;a symbol of honesty, courage, and goodnessto create a new type of &quot;folk hero&quot; for the common man. Commenting on Cooper&#x27;s impact on the character and the film, Capra observed:
Both &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; opened in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box-office successes. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Nugent wrote that Cooper was &quot;proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood&quot;. For his performance in &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;, Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.
Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936. In Lewis Milestone&#x27;s adventure film &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; with Madeleine Carroll, he plays an American soldier of fortune in China who helps the peasants defend themselves against the oppression of a cruel warlord. Written by playwright Clifford Odets, the film was a critical and commercial success.

In Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s sprawling frontier epic &quot;The Plainsman&quot;, his first of four films with the director, Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickok in a highly fictionalized version of the opening of the American western frontier. The film was an even greater box-office hit than its predecessor, due in large part to Jean Arthur&#x27;s definitive depiction of Calamity Jane and Cooper&#x27;s inspired portrayal of Hickok as an enigmatic figure of &quot;deepening mythic substance&quot;. That year, Cooper appeared for the first time on the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; exhibitor&#x27;s poll of top-10 film personalities, where he remained for the next 23 years.

In late 1936, Paramount was preparing a new contract for Cooper that would raise his salary to $8,000 a week, when Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn for six films over six years with a minimum guarantee of $150,000 per picture. Paramount brought suit against Goldwyn and Cooper, and the court ruled that Cooper&#x27;s new Goldwyn contract afforded the actor sufficient time to also honor his Paramount agreement. Cooper continued to make films with both studios, and by 1939, the United States Treasury reported that Cooper was the country&#x27;s highest wage earner, at $482,819 (equivalent to $million in ).

In contrast to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Souls at Sea&quot;. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper referred to it as his &quot;almost picture&quot;, saying, &quot;It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good.&quot; In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo&#x27;s biographical film &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot;. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn&#x27;s biggest failure to date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick&#x27;s first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, &quot;It was one of the best roles ever offered in Hollywood... But I said no. I didn&#x27;t see myself as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right.&quot;
Back at Paramount, Cooper returned to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Eighth Wife&quot; (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an impoverished aristocrat&#x27;s daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. It succeeded only at the European box-office market.

In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady&#x27;s maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper&#x27;s fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.

In the next two years, Cooper was more discerning about the roles he accepted and made four successful large-scale adventure and cowboy films. In William A. Wellman&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), he plays one of three daring English brothers who join the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara to fight local tribes. Filmed in the same Mojave Desert locations as the original 1926 version with Ronald Colman, &quot;Beau Geste&quot; provided Cooper with magnificent sets, exotic settings, high-spirited action, and a role tailored to his personality and screen persona. This was the last film in Cooper&#x27;s contract with Paramount.

In Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;The Real Glory&quot; (1939), he plays a military doctor who accompanies a small group of American Army officers to the Philippines to help the Christian Filipinos defend themselves against Muslim radicals. Many film critics praised Cooper&#x27;s performance, including author and film critic Graham Greene, who recognized that he &quot;never acted better&quot;.

====From &quot;The Westerner&quot; to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, 1940–1943====
Cooper returned to the Western genre in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940) with Walter Brennan and Doris Davenport, about a drifting cowboy who defends homesteaders against Roy Bean, a corrupt judge known as the &quot;law west of the Pecos&quot;. Screenwriter Niven Busch relied on Cooper&#x27;s extensive knowledge of Western history while working on the script. The film received positive reviews and did well at the box office, with reviewers praising the performances of the two lead actors. That same year, Cooper appeared in his first all-Technicolor feature, Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s adventure film &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940). In the film, Cooper plays a Texas Ranger who pursues an outlaw into western Canada, where he joins forces with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who are after the same man, a leader of the North-West Rebellion. While not as popular with critics as its predecessor, the film was another box-office success, the sixth-highest grossing film of 1940.
The early 1940s were Cooper&#x27;s prime years as an actor. In a relatively short period, he appeared in five critically successful and popular films that produced some of his finest performances. When Frank Capra offered him the lead role in &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; before Robert Riskin even developed the script, Cooper accepted his friend&#x27;s offer, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s okay, Frank, I don&#x27;t need a script.&quot; In the film, Cooper plays Long John Willoughby, a down-and-out bush-league pitcher hired by a newspaper to pretend to be a man who promises to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to protest all the hypocrisy and corruption in the country. Considered by some critics to be Capra&#x27;s best film at the time, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; was received as a &quot;national event&quot; with Cooper appearing on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; on March 3, 1941. In his review in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Howard Barnes called Cooper&#x27;s performance a &quot;splendid and utterly persuasive portrayal&quot; and praised his &quot;utterly realistic acting which comes through with such authority&quot;. Bosley Crowther, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;Gary Cooper, of course, is &#x27;John Doe&#x27; to the life and in the wholeshy, bewildered, nonaggressive, but a veritable tiger when aroused.&quot;
That same year, Cooper made two films with director and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, one of the most decorated American soldiers in World WarI. The film chronicles York&#x27;s early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York&#x27;s encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called &quot;one of extraordinary conviction and versatility&quot;, and that Archer Winston of the &quot;New York Post&quot; called &quot;one of his best&quot;. After the film&#x27;s release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his &quot;powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty&quot;. York admired Cooper&#x27;s performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. &quot;Sergeant York&quot; became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, &quot;It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I&#x27;ve been in the business 16 years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these. That&#x27;s all I can say... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech.&quot;
Cooper concluded the year back at Goldwyn with Howard Hawks to make the romantic comedy &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; with Barbara Stanwyck. In the film, Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia. While researching slang, he meets Stanwyck&#x27;s flirtatious burlesque stripper Sugarpuss O&#x27;Shea who blows the dust off their staid life of books. The screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise the full range of his light comedy skills. In his review for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with &quot;great skill and comic emphasis&quot; and that his performance was &quot;utterly delightful&quot;. Though small in scale, &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; was one of the top-grossing films of the year and Cooper&#x27;s fourth consecutive picture to make the top 20.

Cooper&#x27;s only film appearance in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn contract. In Sam Wood&#x27;s biographical film &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, Cooper portrays baseball star Lou Gehrig, who established a record with the New York Yankees for playing in 2,130 consecutive games. Cooper was reluctant to play the seven-time All-Star, who had died only the previous year from ALS (now commonly called &quot;Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease&quot;). Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying such a popular and nationally recognized figure, Cooper knew very little about baseball and was not left-handed like Gehrig.

After Gehrig&#x27;s widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband, Cooper accepted the role that covered a 20-year span of Gehrig&#x27;s life: his early love of baseball, his rise to greatness, his loving marriage, and his struggle with illness, culminating in his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, before 62,000 fans. Cooper quickly learned the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid, believable swing. The handedness issue was solved by reversing the print for certain batting scenes. The film was one of the year&#x27;s top-10 pictures and received 11 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper&#x27;s third).
Soon after the publication of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, Paramount paid $150,000 for the film rights with the express intent of casting Cooper in the lead role of Robert Jordan, an American explosives expert who fights alongside the Republican loyalists during the Spanish Civil War. The original director, Cecil B. DeMille, was replaced by Sam Wood, who brought in Dudley Nichols for the screenplay. After the start of principal photography in the Sierra Nevada in late 1942, Ingrid Bergman was brought in to replace ballerina Vera Zorina as the female lead, a change supported by Cooper and Hemingway. The love scenes between Bergman and Cooper were &quot;rapturous&quot; and passionate. Howard Barnes in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote that both actors performed with &quot;the true stature and authority of stars&quot;. While the film distorted the novel&#x27;s original political themes and meaning, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was a critical and commercial success and received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper&#x27;s fourth).
====World War II related activities====
Due to his age and health, Cooper did not serve in the military during World War II, but like many of his colleagues, he got involved in the war effort by entertaining the troops. In June 1943, he visited military hospitals in San Diego, and often appeared at the Hollywood Canteen serving food to the Servicemen. In late 1943, Cooper undertook a tour of the South West Pacific with actresses Una Merkel and Phyllis Brooks and accordionist Andy Arcari.

Traveling on a B-24A Liberator bomber, the group toured the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Queensland, Brisbanewhere General Douglas MacArthur told Cooper he was watching &quot;Sergeant York&quot; in a Manila theater when Japanese bombs began fallingNew Guinea, Jayapura then throughout the Solomon Islands.

The group often shared the same sparse living conditions and K-rations as the troops. Cooper met with the servicemen and women, visited military hospitals, introduced his attractive colleagues and participated in occasional skits. The shows concluded with Cooper&#x27;s moving recitation of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s farewell speech. When he returned to the United States, he visited military hospitals throughout the country. Cooper later called his time with the troops the &quot;greatest emotional experience&quot; of his life.

===Mature roles, 1944–1952===
In 1944, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s wartime adventure film &quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot; with Laraine Dayhis third movie with the director. In the film, Cooper plays American doctor and missionary Corydon M. Wassell, who leads a group of wounded sailors through the jungles of Java to safety. Despite receiving poor reviews, &quot;Dr. Wassell&quot; was one of the top-grossing films of the year. With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded, Cooper decided to remain independent and formed his own production company, International Pictures, with Leo Spitz, William Goetz, and Nunnally Johnson. The fledgling studio&#x27;s first offering was Sam Wood&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Casanova Brown&quot; with Teresa Wright, about a man who learns his soon-to-be ex-wife is pregnant with his child, just as he is about to marry another woman. The film received poor reviews, with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; calling it &quot;delightful nonsense&quot;, and Bosley Crowther, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, criticizing Cooper&#x27;s &quot;somewhat obvious and ridiculous clowning&quot;. The film was barely profitable.

In 1945, Cooper starred in and produced Stuart Heisler&#x27;s Western comedy &quot;Along Came Jones&quot; with Loretta Young for International. In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image, Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones, who is mistaken for a ruthless killer. Audiences embraced Cooper&#x27;s character, and the film was one of the top box-office pictures of the yeara testament to Cooper&#x27;s still vital audience appeal. It was also International&#x27;s biggest financial success during its brief history before being sold off to Universal Studios in 1946.

Cooper&#x27;s career during the postwar years drifted in new directions as American society was changing. While he still played conventional heroic roles, his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings. In November 1945, Cooper appeared in Sam Wood&#x27;s 19th-century period drama &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; with Ingrid Bergman, about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune hunter. Filmed in early 1943, the movie&#x27;s release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies. Despite poor reviews, &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; did well at the box office and became one of the top moneymakers of the year for Warner Bros. Cooper&#x27;s only film in 1946 was Fritz Lang&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;, about a mild-mannered physics professor recruited by the Office of Strategic Services during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic-bomb program. Playing a part loosely based on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, Cooper was uneasy with the role and unable to convey the &quot;inner sense&quot; of the character. The film received poor reviews and was a box-office failure. In 1947, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic adventure film &quot;Unconquered&quot; with Paulette Goddard, about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the 18th century. The film received mixed reviews, but even long-time DeMille critic James Agee acknowledged the picture had &quot;some authentic flavor of the period&quot;. This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper&#x27;s most lucrative, earning the actor over $300,000 (equal to $ today) in salary and percentage of profits. &quot;Unconquered&quot; was his last unqualified box-office success for the next five years.
In 1948, after making Leo McCarey&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Good Sam&quot;, Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $295,000 (equal to $ today) per picture. His first film under the new contract was King Vidor&#x27;s drama &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey. In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal pressures to conform to popular standards. Based on the novel by Ayn Rand, who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her philosophy and attacks the concepts of collectivism while promoting the virtues of individualism. For most critics, Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther concluded he was &quot;Mr. Deeds out of his element&quot;. Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves&#x27; war drama &quot;Task Force&quot; (1949), about a retiring rear admiral, who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his role in the development of aircraft carriers. Cooper&#x27;s performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper&#x27;s most popular during this period. In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly received films: Michael Curtiz&#x27; period drama &quot;Bright Leaf&quot; (1950), Stuart Heisler&#x27;s Western melodrama &quot;Dallas&quot; (1950), Henry Hathaway&#x27;s wartime comedy &quot;You&#x27;re in the Navy Now&quot; (1951), and Raoul Walsh&#x27;s Western action film &quot;Distant Drums&quot; (1951).
Cooper&#x27;s most important film during the postwar years was Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s Western drama &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) with Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado for United Artists. In the film, Cooper plays retiring sheriff Will Kane, who is preparing to leave town on his honeymoon when he learns that an outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen are returning to seek their revenge. Unable to gain the support of the frightened townspeople, and abandoned by his young bride, Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws alone. During the filming, Cooper was in poor health and in considerable pain from stomach ulcers. His ravaged face and discomfort in some scenes &quot;photographed as self-doubt&quot;, according to biographer Hector Arce, and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance. Considered one of the first &quot;adult&quot; Westerns for its theme of moral courage, &quot;High Noon&quot; received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry, with &quot;Time&quot; placing it in the ranks of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; and &quot;The Gunfighter&quot;. Bosley Crowther, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that Cooper was &quot;at the top of his form&quot;, and John McCarten, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote that Cooper was never more effective. The film earned $3.75million in the United States and $18million worldwide. Following the example of his friend James Stewart, Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percentage of the profits, and ended up making $600,000. Cooper&#x27;s understated performance was widely praised, and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor.

===Later films, 1953–1959===
After appearing in Andre de Toth&#x27;s Civil War drama &quot;Springfield Rifle&quot; (1952)a standard Warner Bros. film that was overshadowed by the success of its predecessorCooper made four films outside the United States. In Mark Robson&#x27;s drama &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor. Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during the three-month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa. Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews. Cooper&#x27;s next three films were shot in Mexico. In Hugo Fregonese&#x27;s action adventure film &quot;Blowing Wild&quot; (1953) with Barbara Stanwyck, he plays a wildcatter in Mexico, who gets involved with an oil-company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair.

In 1954, Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s Western drama &quot;Garden of Evil&quot;, with Susan Hayward, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman&#x27;s husband. That same year, he appeared in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s Western adventure &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; with Burt Lancaster. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor MaximilianI to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during the Mexican Rebellion of 1866. All these films received poor reviews, but did well at the box office. For his work in &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, Cooper earned $1.4million in salary and a percentage of the gross.
During this period, Cooper struggled with health problems. He suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of &quot;Blowing Wild&quot; when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well, as well as his ongoing treatment for ulcers. During the filming of &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, he reinjured his hip by falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing.

Cooper appeared in Otto Preminger&#x27;s 1955 biographical war drama &quot;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot;, about the World WarI general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell&#x27;s dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler&#x27;s Civil War drama &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; with Dorothy McGuire. Like &quot;Sergeant York&quot; and &quot;High Noon&quot;, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8million worldwide.
Cooper traveled to France in 1956 to make Billy Wilder&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier. In the film, Cooper plays a middle-aged American playboy in Paris who is pursued by—and eventually falls in love with—a much younger woman. Despite receiving some positive reviews, including from Bosley Crowther, who praised the film&#x27;s &quot;charming performances&quot;, most reviewers concluded that Cooper was simply too old for the part. While audiences may not have welcomed seeing Cooper&#x27;s heroic screen image tarnished by his playing an aging &quot;roué&quot; having an affair with a young girl, the film was still a box-office success. The following year, Cooper appeared in Philip Dunne&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot;. In the film, which was based on the novel by John O&#x27;Hara, Cooper plays an attorney whose life is ruined by a double-crossing politician and his own secret affair with his daughter&#x27;s young roommate. While Cooper brought &quot;conviction and controlled anguish&quot; to his performance, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, it was not enough to save what Bosley Crowther called a &quot;hapless film&quot;.
Despite his ongoing health problems and several operations for ulcers and hernias, Cooper continued to work in action films. In 1958, he appeared in Anthony Mann&#x27;s Western drama &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958) with Julie London and Lee J. Cobb, about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train in which he is riding is held up by his former gang members. The film has been called Cooper&#x27;s &quot;most pathological Western&quot;, with its themes of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, &quot;understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity... [and] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man&quot;. Mostly ignored by critics at the time, the film is now well-regarded by film scholars and is considered Cooper&#x27;s last great film.

After his Warner Bros. contract ended, Cooper formed his own production company, Baroda Productions, and made three unusual films in 1959 about redemption. In Delmer Daves&#x27; Western drama &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob, and later tries to exploit his sordid past. Cooper delivered a &quot;powerful and persuasive&quot; performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman. In Robert Rossen&#x27;s historical adventure &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; with Rita Hayworth, he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916. While Cooper received positive reviews, &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Films in Review&quot; felt he was too old for the part. 

In Michael Anderson&#x27;s action drama &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot; with Charlton Heston, Cooper plays a disgraced merchant-marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name. Like its two predecessors, the film was physically demanding. Cooper, who was a trained scuba diver, did most of his own underwater scenes. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles Cooper effectively conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemptionwhat Joseph Conrad in &quot;Lord Jim&quot; called the &quot;struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
Cooper was formally introduced to his future wife, 20-year-old New York debutante Veronica Balfe, on Easter Sunday 1933 at a party given by her uncle, art director Cedric Gibbons. Called &quot;Rocky&quot; by her family and friends, she grew up on Park Avenue and attended finishing schools. Her stepfather was Wall Street tycoon Paul Shields. Cooper and Rocky were quietly married at her parents&#x27; Park Avenue residence on December 15, 1933. According to his friends, the marriage had a positive impact on Cooper, who turned away from past indiscretions and took control of his life. Athletic and a lover of the outdoors, Rocky shared many of Cooper&#x27;s interests, including riding, skiing, and skeet-shooting. While she organized their social life, her wealth and social connections provided Cooper access to New York high society. Cooper and his wife owned homes in the Los Angeles area in Encino (1933–36), Brentwood (1936–53), and Holmby Hills (1954–61), and owned a vacation home in Aspen, Colorado (1949–53).

Gary and Veronica Cooper&#x27;s daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, was born on September 15, 1937. By all accounts, he was a patient and affectionate father, teaching Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, ski, and ride horses. Sharing many of her parents&#x27; interests, she accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them. Like her father, she developed a love for art and drawing. As a family, they vacationed together in Sun Valley, Idaho, spent time at Rocky&#x27;s parents&#x27; country house in Southampton, New York, and took frequent trips to Europe. Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 1951, when Cooper moved out of their home. For over two years, they maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter. Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953, and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954.

===Romantic relationships===
Prior to his marriage, Cooper had a series of romantic relationships with leading actresses, beginning in 1927 with Clara Bow, who advanced his career by helping him get one of his first leading roles in &quot;Children of Divorce&quot;. Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in &quot;Wings&quot;, which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor. In 1928, he had a relationship with another experienced actress, Evelyn Brent, whom he met while filming &quot;Beau Sabreur&quot;. In 1929, while filming &quot;The Wolf Song&quot;, Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe Vélez, which was the most important romance of his early life. During their two years together, Cooper also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming &quot;Morocco&quot; in 1930 and with Carole Lombard while making &quot;I Take This Woman&quot; in 1931. During his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso, the former Dorothy Cadwell Taylor, while staying at her Villa Madama near Rome.

After he was married in December 1933, Cooper remained faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Cooper began an affair with Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first, they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper&#x27;s wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed that he was in love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper&#x27;s child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.

Cooper biographers have explored his friendship in the late &#x27;20s with the actor Anderson Lawler, with whom Cooper shared a house on and off for a year, while at the same time seeing Clara Bow, Evelyn Brent, and Lupe Vélez. Lupe Vélez once told Hedda Hopper of Lawler&#x27;s affair with Cooper; whenever he would come home after seeing Lawler, she would sniff for Lawler&#x27;s cologne. Vélez&#x27; biographer Michelle Vogel has reported that Vélez consented to Cooper&#x27;s sexual behavior with Lawler, but only as long as she, too, could participate. In later life, he became involved with costume designer Irene, and was, according to her, &quot;the only man she ever loved&quot;. A year after his death in 1961, Irene committed suicide by jumping from the 11th floor of the Knickerbocker Hotel, after telling Doris Day of her grief over Cooper&#x27;s death.

===Friendships, interests, and character===
According to Cooper

Cooper&#x27;s 20-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper&#x27;s image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling; Cooper kept a copy of the poem &quot;If—&quot; in his dressing room, and retained as adults Kipling&#x27;s sense of boyish adventure.

As well as admiring Cooper&#x27;s hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, &quot;If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He&#x27;s just too good to be true.&quot; They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.

Cooper&#x27;s social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. Cooper, in addition to hunting, enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.

Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional &quot;yup&quot; and &quot;shucks&quot;. He once said, &quot;If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.&quot; According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively, boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie-star status; he never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, &quot;Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody [who] worked with him liked him.&quot;

===Political views===
Like his father, Cooper was a conservative Republican; he voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924 and Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting &quot;foreign&quot; ideas. In a radio address he had paid for himself just before the election, Cooper said, &quot;I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finishedand has to borrow foreign notions that don&#x27;t even seem to work any too well where they come from... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again.&quot; He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters. In 1952, Cooper, along with John Wayne, Adolphe Menjou and Glenn Ford, supported Robert A. Taft over Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Republican primaries.

Cooper was one of the founding members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement of principles, to preserving the &quot;American way of life&quot; and opposing communism and fascism. The organization (members included Walter Brennan, Laraine Day, Walt Disney, Clark Gable, Hedda Hopper, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Stanwyck, and John Wayne) advised the United States Congress to investigate communist influence in the motion-picture industry. On October 23, 1947, Cooper was subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed any &quot;communistic influence&quot; in Hollywood.

Cooper recounted statements he had heard suggesting the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution, comments which Cooper said he found to be &quot;very un-American&quot;, and testified that he had rejected several scripts because he thought they were &quot;tinged with communist ideas&quot;. Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals or scripts.

In 1951, while making &quot;High Noon&quot;, Cooper befriended the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Carl Foreman, who had been a member of the Communist Party. When Foreman was subpoenaed by the HUAC, Cooper put his career on the line to defend Foreman. When John Wayne and others threatened Cooper with blacklisting himself and the loss of his passport if he did not walk off the film, Cooper gave a statement to the press in support of Foreman, calling him &quot;the finest kind of American&quot;. When producer Stanley Kramer removed Foreman&#x27;s name as screenwriter, Cooper and director Fred Zinnemann threatened to walk off the film if Foreman&#x27;s name were not restored. Foreman later said that of all his friends and allies and colleagues in Hollywood, &quot;Cooper was the only big one who tried to help. The only one.&quot; Cooper even offered to testify in Foreman&#x27;s behalf before the committee, but character witnesses were not allowed. Foreman always sent future scripts to Cooper for first refusal, including &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Key&quot;, and &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. Cooper had to turn them down because of his age.

===Religion===
Cooper was baptized in the Church of All Saints, Houghton Regis, in Bedfordshire, England, in December 1911, and was raised in the Episcopal Church in the United States. While he was not an observant Christian for most of his adult life, many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual side.

On June 26, 1953, Cooper accompanied his wife and daughter, who were devout Catholics, to Rome, where they had an audience with Pope Pius XII. Cooper and his wife were still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation. In the following years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Catholic on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.

==Final years and death==
On April 14, 1960, Cooper underwent surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had metastasized to his colon. He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Cedar’s of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine. After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation to the south of France before traveling to the UK in the fall to star in &quot;The Naked Edge&quot;. In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary &quot;The Real West&quot;, which was part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Project 20&quot; series.

On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper&#x27;s cancer had spread to his lungs and bones and was inoperable. His family decided not to tell him immediately.

On January 9, 1961, Cooper attended a dinner given in his honor and hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin at the Friars Club. The dinner was attended by many of his industry friends and concluded with a brief speech by Cooper, who said, &quot;The only achievement I&#x27;m proud of is the friends I&#x27;ve made in this community.&quot;

In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together. Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time. On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, &quot;We&#x27;ll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that&#x27;s God&#x27;s will, that&#x27;s all right, too.&quot; On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper&#x27;s behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievementhis third Oscar. Holding back tears, Stewart said, &quot;Coop, I&#x27;ll get this to you right away. And Coop, I want you to know this, that with this goes all the warm friendship and the affection and the admiration and the deep, the deep respect of all of us. We&#x27;re very, very proud of you, Coop. All of us are tremendously proud.&quot; The following day, newspapers around the world announced that Cooper was dying. In the coming days, he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, and a telephone call from President John F. Kennedy.

In his last public statement on May 4, 1961, Cooper said, &quot;I know that what is happening is God&#x27;s will. I am not afraid of the future.&quot; He received the last rites on Friday, May 12, and died quietly the next day.

A requiem was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended by many of Cooper&#x27;s friends, including James Stewart, Jack Benny, Henry Hathaway, Joel McCrea, Audrey Hepburn, Jack L. Warner, John Ford, John Wayne, Edward G. Robinson, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Fred Astaire, Randolph Scott, Walter Pidgeon, Bob Hope, and Marlene Dietrich. Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper&#x27;s remains were exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton. His grave is marked next to a three-ton boulder from a Montauk quarry.

==Acting style and reputation==
Cooper&#x27;s acting style consisted of three essential characteristics - his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: &quot;The simplest examples of Stanislavsky&#x27;s ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act, but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters.&quot; Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among &quot;the greatest actors&quot; because of his ability to deliver great performances &quot;without direction&quot;. This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced he was simply &quot;playing himself&quot;.

Cooper&#x27;s ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, &quot;This fellow is the world&#x27;s greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learnnamely, to be natural.&quot; Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in &quot;Devil and the Deep&quot; agreed, &quot;In truth, that boy hasn&#x27;t the least idea how well he acts... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life.&quot; William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a &quot;superb actor, a master of movie acting&quot;.

In his review of Cooper&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Real Glory&quot;, Graham Greene wrote, &quot;Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholerathe casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn&#x27;t have to think anymore.&quot;

Cooper&#x27;s style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera&#x27;s ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper&#x27;s performance in &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, director Howard Hawks observed, &quot;He worked very hard and yet he didn&#x27;t seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you&#x27;d look at him during a scene and you&#x27;d think... this isn&#x27;t going to be any good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he&#x27;d been thinking.&quot; Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper&#x27;s performance in &quot;Pride of the Yankees&quot;, noting, &quot;What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he&#x27;s perfect, yet on the set you&#x27;d swear it&#x27;s the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures.&quot;

Fellow actors admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, &quot;The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpoweringand that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn&#x27;t notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with.&quot;

Tom Hanks declared, &quot;In only one scene in the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, we see the future of screen acting in the form of Gary Cooper. He is quiet and natural, somehow different from the other cast members. He does something mysterious with his eyes and shoulders that is much more like &#x27;being&#x27; than &#x27;acting&#x27;.&quot;

Daniel Day-Lewis said, &quot;I don&#x27;t particularly like westerns as a genre, but I do love certain westerns. &quot;High Noon&quot; means a lot to meI love the purity and the honesty, I love Gary Cooper in that film, the idea of the last man standing.&quot;

Chris Pratt stated, &quot;I started watching Westerns when I was shooting in London about four or five years ago. I really fell in love with Gary Cooper, and his stuff. That sucked me into the Westerns. Before, I never got engrossed in the story. I&#x27;d just dip in, and there were guys in horses in black and white. High Noon&#x27;s later Gary Cooper, I liked that. But I liked &quot;The Westerner&quot;. That&#x27;s my favorite one. I have that poster hung up in my house because I really like that one.&quot;

To Al Pacino, &quot;Gary Cooper was a phenomenonhis ability to take some thing and elevate it, give it such dignity. One of the great presences.&quot;

Mylène Demongeot first met Gary Cooper at the opening of the first escalator to be installed in a cinema, at the Rex Theatre in Paris, on June 7, 1957. She declared in a 2015 filmed interview: &quot;Gary Cooper... il est sublime ! Aaahhh &quot;(Mylène pushing a cry of love not to say ecstasy)&quot; il est sublime... Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Là je dois dire que ça fait partie des stars, y&#x27;a Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, John Wayne, ces grands Américains que j&#x27;ai rencontrés comme ça, c&#x27;est vraiment des mecs incroyables. Y&#x27;en a plus des comme ça ! Euh non. (Gary Cooper was sublime, there I have to say, now he, was part of the stars, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, John Wayne, those great
Americans who I&#x27;ve met really were unbelievable guys, there aren&#x27;t any like them anymore).&quot;

==Career assessment and legacy==
Cooper&#x27;s career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961. During that time he appeared in eighty-four feature films in a leading role. He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films. He appeared on the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; exhibitor&#x27;s poll of top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958. According to Quigley&#x27;s annual poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936–37, 1941–49, and 1951–57. He topped the list in 1953. In Quigley&#x27;s list of all-time money-making stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Tom Cruise. At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films grossed well over $200million (equivalent to $billion in ).

In more than half his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers, all men of action. In the rest, he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper&#x27;s heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (&quot;The Virginian&quot;). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero: a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (&quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;).

In the postwar years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world, who must face adversity alone (&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;High Noon&quot;). In his final films, Cooper&#x27;s hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Man of the West&quot;). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American heroa tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.

On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry. He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.

On May 6, 1961, Cooper was awarded the French Order of Arts and Letters in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts. On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the David di Donatello Special Award in Italy for his career achievements.

In 1966, Cooper was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. In 2015, he was inducted into the Utah Cowboy and Western Heritage Hall of Fame. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper 11th on its list of the 25 male stars of classic Hollywood. Three of his charactersWill Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant Yorkmade AFI&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest heroes and villains, all of them as heroes. His Lou Gehrig line, &quot;Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.&quot;, is ranked by AFI as the 38th greatest movie quote of all time.

More than half a century after his death, Cooper&#x27;s enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances. Charlton Heston once observed, &quot;He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that&#x27;s ever lived.&quot;

==In popular culture==

In the 1930s hit song &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;, Cooper is referenced in the line &quot;dress up like a million-dollar trooper/Tryin&#x27; hard to look like Gary Cooper, Super duper!&quot; More than two decades after Cooper&#x27;s death, a new version of the song was released in 1983 by Taco; the original lyrics were kept, including the references to Cooper.

In J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, chapter 10, Cooper is &quot;spotted&quot; by Holden Caulfield to distract a woman with whom he is dancing.

Gary Cooper is referenced several times in the critically acclaimed television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, with protagonist Tony Soprano asking, &quot;Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? The strong, silent type...&quot; whilst complaining about his problems to his therapist Dr. Melfi.

In the TV series &quot;Justified&quot;, based on works and characters created by Elmore Leonard, Gary Cooper is used throughout the six seasons as the man whom U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, played by Timothy Olyphant, aspires to be. When his colleague asks Marshal Givens how he thinks his dangerous plan to bring down a villain can possibly work, he replies: &quot;Why not? Worked for Gary Cooper.&quot;

Patricia Neal named the Abbey of Regina Laudis&#x27; outdoor theater building The Gary-The Olivia in honor of Cooper and her daughter Olivia Dahl.

A San Antonio, Texas, subdivision has several streets named after Hollywood stars, including a Gary Cooper Drive.

A Wetherspoons-owned pub near the grammar school Cooper attended in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, is named &quot;The Gary Cooper&quot;.

<doc id="44361" wikidata="Q3503" url="?curid=44361" title="Congo River">
<text>The Congo River, formerly also known as the Zaire River, is the second-longest river in Africa, shorter only than the Nile, as well as the third-largest river in the world by discharge volume, following the Amazon and Ganges rivers. It is the world&#x27;s deepest recorded river, with measured depths of around . The Congo–Lualaba–Luvua–Luapula–Chambeshi River system has an overall length of , which makes it the world&#x27;s ninth-longest river. The Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River, and &quot;Lualaba&quot; is the name of the Congo River upstream of Boyoma Falls, extending for .

Measured along with the Lualaba, the main tributary, the Congo River has a total length of . It is the only major river to cross the equator twice. The Congo Basin has a total area of about , or 13% of the entire African landmass.

==Name==
The name &quot;Congo/Kongo&quot; originates from the Kingdom of Kongo once located on the southern bank of the river. The kingdom in turn was named after the indigenous Bantu Kongo people, known in the 17th century as &quot;Esikongo&quot;. South of the Kingdom of Kongo proper lay the similarly named Kakongo kingdom, mentioned in 1535. Abraham Ortelius labelled &quot;Manicongo&quot; as the city at the mouth of the river in his world map of 1564. The tribal names in &quot;Kongo&quot; possibly derive from a word for a public gathering or tribal assembly. The modern name of the Kongo people or &quot;Bakongo&quot; was introduced in the early 20th century.

The name &quot;Zaire&quot; is from a Portuguese adaptation of a Kikongo word, (&quot;river&quot;), a truncation of (&quot;river swallowing rivers&quot;). The river was known as &quot;Zaire&quot; during the 16th and 17th centuries; &quot;Congo&quot; seems to have replaced &quot;Zaire&quot; gradually in English usage during the 18th century, and &quot;Congo&quot; is the preferred English name in 19th-century literature, although references to &quot;Zahir&quot; or &quot;Zaire&quot; as the name used by the inhabitants remained common. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo are named after it, as was the previous Republic of the Congo which had gained independence in 1960 from the Belgian Congo. The Republic of Zaire during 1971–1997 was also named after the river&#x27;s name in French and Portuguese.

==Basin and course==

The Congo&#x27;s drainage basin covers , an area nearly equal to that of the European Union. The Congo&#x27;s discharge at its mouth ranges from , with an average of . The river transports annually 86 million tonnes of suspended sediment to the Atlantic Ocean and an additional 6% of bedload.

The river and its tributaries flow through the Congo rainforest, the second largest rainforest area in the world, after the Amazon rainforest in South America. The river also has the second-largest flow in the world, behind the Amazon; the second-largest drainage basin of any river, behind the Amazon; and is one of the deepest rivers in the world, at depths greater than . Because its drainage basin includes areas both north and south of the Equator, its flow is stable, as there is always at least one part of the river experiencing a rainy season.

The sources of the Congo are in the highlands and mountains of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru, which feed the Lualaba River, which then becomes the Congo below Boyoma Falls. The Chambeshi River in Zambia is generally taken as the source of the Congo in line with the accepted practice worldwide of using the longest tributary, as with the Nile River.

The Congo flows generally toward the northwest from Kisangani just below the Boyoma Falls, then gradually bends southwestward, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa (formerly Léopoldville) and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool, where the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), running by Matadi and Boma, and into the sea at Muanda.

Lower Congo constitutes the &quot;lower&quot; parts of the great river; that is the section of the river from the river mouth at the Atlantic coast to the twin capitals of Brazzaville and Kinshasa. In this section of the river, there are two significant tributaries, both on the left or south side. The Kwilu River originates in the hills near the Angolan border and enters the Congo some 100 km upstream from Matadi. The other is the Inkisi River, that flows in a northerly direction from the Uíge Province in Angola to the confluence with the Congo at Zongo some downstream from the twin capitals. Because of the vast number of rapids, in particular the Livingstone Falls, this section of the river is not operated continuously by riverboats.

==Drainage basin==
The Congo basin covers ten countries and accounts for about 13% of Africa. The highest point in the Congo basin is in the Ruwenzori Mountains, at an altitude of around above sea level.

==Economic importance==

Although the Livingstone Falls prevent access from the sea, nearly the entire Congo above them is readily navigable in sections, especially between Kinshasa and Kisangani. Large river steamers worked the river until quite recently. The Congo River still is a lifeline in a land with few roads or railways. Railways now bypass the three major falls, and much of the trade of Central Africa passes along the river, including copper, palm oil (as kernels), sugar, coffee, and cotton.

===Hydroelectric power===
The Congo River is the most powerful river in Africa. During the rainy season over of water per second flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Opportunities for the Congo River and its tributaries to generate hydropower are therefore enormous. Scientists have calculated that the entire Congo Basin accounts for 13 percent of global hydropower potential. This would provide sufficient power for all of Sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s electricity needs.

Currently, there are about 40 hydropower plants in the Congo Basin. The largest are the Inga dams, about southwest of Kinshasa. The project was launched in the early 1970s, when the first dam was completed. The plan (as originally conceived) called for the construction of five dams that would have had a total generating capacity of 34,500 megawatts (MW). To date only the Inga I and Inga II dams have been built, generating 1,776 MW.

In February 2005, South Africa&#x27;s state-owned power company, Eskom, announced a proposal to expand generation through improvements and the construction of a new hydroelectric dam. The project would bring the maximum output of the facility to 40,000 megawatts (MW). It is feared that these new hydroelectric dams could lead to the extinction of many of the fish species that are native to the river.

==Natural history==
The current course of the Congo River formed between 1.5 and 2 million years BP, during the Pleistocene. It is likely that during this period many upper tributaries of the Congo were captured from adjacent river basins, including the Uele and upper Ubangi from the Chari system and the Chambeshi River alongside a number of upper Kasai River tributaries from the Zambezi system.

The Congo&#x27;s formation may have led to the allopatric speciation of the bonobo and the common chimpanzee from their most recent common ancestor. The bonobo is endemic to the humid forests in the region, as are other iconic species like the Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey, dryas monkey, aquatic genet, okapi, and Congo peafowl.

In terms of aquatic life, the Congo River Basin has a very high species richness and among the highest known densities of endemics. , almost 800 fish species have been recorded from the Congo River Basin (not counting Lake Tanganyika, which is connected but ecologically very different), and large sections remain virtually unstudied. For example, the section in Salonga National Park, which is about the size of Belgium, had still not been sampled at all in 2006. New fish species are scientifically described with some regularity from the Congo River Basin, and many undescribed species are known.

The Congo has by far the highest diversity of any African river system; in comparison, the next richest are the Niger, Volta and Nile with about 240, 140 and 130 fish species, respectively. Because of the great ecological differences between the regions in the Congo basin—including habitats such as river rapids, deep rivers, swamps, and lakes—it is often divided into multiple ecoregions (instead of treating it as a single ecoregion). Among these ecoregions, the Livingstone Falls cataracts has more than 300 fish species, including approximately 80 endemics while the southwestern part (Kasai River basin) has more than 200 fish species, of which about a quarter are endemic.

The dominant fish families—at least in parts of the river—are Cyprinidae (carp/cyprinids, such as &quot;Labeo simpsoni&quot;), Mormyridae (elephant fishes), Alestidae (African tetras), Mochokidae (squeaker catfishes), and Cichlidae (cichlids). Among the natives in the river is the huge, highly carnivorous giant tigerfish. Three of the more unusual endemics are the whitish (non-pigmented) and blind &quot;Lamprologus lethops&quot;, which is believed to live as deep as below the surface, &quot;Heterochromis multidens&quot;, which is more closely related to cichlids of the Americas than other African cichlids, and &quot;Caecobarbus geertsii&quot;, the only known cavefish in Central Africa. There are also numerous endemic frogs and snails. Several hydroelectric dams are planned on the river, and these may lead to the extinction of many of the endemics.

Several species of turtles and the slender-snouted, Nile and dwarf crocodile are native to the Congo River Basin. African manatees inhabit the lower parts of the river.

==History==
===Pre-colonial history===


The entire Congo basin is populated by Bantu peoples, divided into several hundred ethnic groups. Bantu expansion is estimated to have reached the middle Congo by about 500 BC and the upper Congo by the first century AD. Remnants of the aboriginal population displaced by the Bantu migration, Pygmies/&quot;Abatwa&quot; of the Ubangian phylum, remain in the remote forest areas of the Congo Basin.

By the 13th century there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin. In the east were the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza, considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included Nsundi, Mbata, Mpangu, and possibly Kundi and Okanga. South of these was Mpemba which stretched from modern-day Angola to the Congo River. It included various kingdoms such as Mpemba Kasi and Vunda. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; Vungu (its leader), Kakongo, and Ngoyo.

The Kingdom of Kongo was formed in the late 14th century from a merging of the kingdoms of Mpemba Kasi and Mbata Kingdom on the left banks of the lower Congo River. Its territorial control along the river remained limited to what corresponds to the modern Kongo Central province. European exploration of the Congo began in 1482 when Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão discovered the river estuary (likely in August 1482), which he marked by a Padrão, or stone pillar (still existing, but only in fragments) erected on Shark Point. Cão sailed up the river for a short distance, establishing contact with the Kingdom of Kongo. The full course of the river remained unknown throughout the early modern period.

The upper Congo basin runs west of the Albertine Rift. Its connection to the Congo was unknown until 1877. The extreme northeast of the Congo basin was reached by the Nilotic expansion at some point between the 15th and 18th centuries, by the ancestors of the Southern Luo speaking Alur people. Francisco de Lacerda followed the Zambezi and reached the uppermost part of the Congo basin (the Kazembe in the upper Luapula basin) in 1796.

The upper Congo River was first reached by the Arab slave trade by the 19th century. Nyangwe was founded as a slavers&#x27; outpost around 1860. David Livingstone was the first European to reach Nyangwe in March 1871. Livingstone proposed to prove that the Lualaba connected to the Nile, but on 15 July, he witnessed a massacre of about 400 Africans by Arab slavers in Nyangwe, which experience left him too horrified and shattered to continue his mission to find the sources of the Nile, so he turned back to Lake Tanganyika.

===Early European colonization===
The Europeans had not reached the central regions of the Congo basin from either the east or west, until Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s expedition of 1876–77, supported by the Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo. At the time one of the last open questions of the European exploration of Africa was whether the Lualaba River fed the Nile (Livingstone&#x27;s theory), the Congo, or even the Niger River. Financed in 1874, Stanley&#x27;s first trans-Africa exploration started in Zanzibar and reached the Lualaba on October 17, 1876. Overland he reached Nyangwe, the center of a lawless area containing cannibal tribes at which Tippu Tip based his trade in slaves. Stanley managed to hire a force from Tippu Tip to guard him for the next or so, for 90 days.

The party left Nyangwe overland through the dense Matimba forest. On November 19 they reached the Lualaba again. Since the going through the forest was so heavy, Tippu Tip turned around with his party on December 28, leaving Stanley on his own, with 143 people, including eight children and 16 women. They had 23 canoes. His first encounter with a local tribe was with the cannibal Wenya. In total Stanley reports 32 unfriendly meetings on the river, some violent, even though he attempted to negotiate a peaceful thoroughfare. But the tribes were wary as their only experience of outsiders was with slave traders.

On January 6, 1877, after , they reached Boyoma Falls (called Stanley Falls for some time after), consisting of seven cataracts spanning which they had to bypass overland. It took them to February 7 to reach the end of the falls. Here Stanley learned that the river was called &quot;Ikuta Yacongo&quot;, proving to him that he had reached the Congo and that the Lualaba did not feed the Nile.

From this point, the tribes were no longer cannibals but possessed firearms, apparently as a result of Portuguese influence. Some four weeks and later he reached Stanley Pool (now Pool Malebo), the site of the present day cities Kinshasa and Brazzaville. Further downstream were the Livingstone Falls, misnamed as Livingstone had never been on the Congo: a series of 32 falls and rapids with an elevation change of over . On 15 March they started the descent of the falls, which took five months and cost numerous lives. From the Isangile Falls, five falls from the foot, they beached the canoes and &quot;Lady Alice&quot; and left the river, aiming for the Portuguese outpost of Boma via land.

On August 3 they reached the hamlet Nsada. From there Stanley sent four men with letters forward to Boma, asking for food for his starving people. On August 7 relief came, being sent by representatives from the Liverpool trading firm Hatton &amp; Cookson. On August 9 they reached Boma, 1,001 days since leaving Zanzibar on November 12, 1874. The party then consisted of 108 people, including three children born during the trip. Most probably (Stanley&#x27;s own publications give inconsistent figures), he lost 132 people through disease, hunger, drowning, killing and desertion.

Kinshasa was founded as a trading post by Stanley in 1881 and named Léopoldville in honor of Leopold II of Belgium. The Congo Basin was privately claimed by Leopold II as Congo Free State in 1885 where the many Atrocities in the Congo Free State were committed until the region was called the Belgian Congo.

<text>In physics, Wien&#x27;s displacement law states that the black-body radiation curve for different temperatures will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the temperature. The shift of that peak is a direct consequence of the Planck radiation law, which describes the spectral brightness or intensity of black-body radiation as a function of wavelength at any given temperature. However, it had been discovered by German physicist Wilhelm Wien several years before Max Planck developed that more general equation, and describes the entire shift of the spectrum of black-body radiation toward shorter wavelengths as temperature increases.

Formally, the wavelength version of Wien&#x27;s displacement law states that the spectral radiance of black-body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the wavelength formula_1 given by:
formula_2
where is the absolute temperature and is a constant of proportionality called &quot;Wien&#x27;s displacement constant&quot;, equal to or .

This is an inverse relationship between wavelength and temperature. So the higher the temperature, the shorter or smaller the wavelength of the thermal radiation. The lower the temperature, the longer or larger the wavelength of the thermal radiation. For visible radiation, hot objects emit bluer light than cool objects. If one is considering the peak of black body emission per unit frequency or per proportional bandwidth, one must use a different proportionality constant. However, the form of the law remains the same: the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, and the peak frequency is directly proportional to temperature.

There are other formulations of Wien&#x27;s displacement law, which are parameterized relative to other quantities. For these alternate formulations, the form of the relationship is similar, but the proportionality constant, , differs.

Wien&#x27;s displacement law may be referred to as &quot;Wien&#x27;s law&quot;, a term which is also used for the Wien approximation.

In &quot;Wien&#x27;s displacement law&quot;, the word displacement refers to how the intensity-wavelength graphs appear shifted (displaced) for different temperatures.

==Examples==
Wien&#x27;s displacement law is relevant to some everyday experiences:

*A piece of metal heated by a blow torch first becomes &quot;red hot&quot; as the very longest visible wavelengths appear red, then becomes more orange-red as the temperature is increased, and at very high temperatures would be described as &quot;white hot&quot; as shorter and shorter wavelengths come to predominate the black body emission spectrum. Before it had even reached the red hot temperature, the thermal emission was mainly at longer infrared wavelengths, which are not visible; nevertheless, that radiation could be felt as it warms one&#x27;s nearby skin.
*One easily observes changes in the color of an incandescent light bulb (which produces light through thermal radiation) as the temperature of its filament is varied by a light dimmer. As the light is dimmed and the filament temperature decreases, the distribution of color shifts toward longer wavelengths and the light appears redder, as well as dimmer.
*A wood fire at 1500 K puts out peak radiation at about 2000 nanometers. 98% of its radiation is at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm, and only a tiny proportion at visible wavelengths (390–700 nanometers). Consequently, a campfire can keep one warm but is a poor source of visible light.
*The effective temperature of the Sun is 5778 Kelvin. Using Wien&#x27;s law, one finds a peak emission per nanometer (of wavelength) at a wavelength of about 500 nm, in the green portion of the spectrum near the peak sensitivity of the human eye. On the other hand, in terms of power per unit optical frequency, the Sun&#x27;s peak emission is at 343 THz or a wavelength of 883 nm in the near infrared. In terms of power per percentage bandwidth, the peak is at about 635 nm, a red wavelength. About half of the Sun&#x27;s radiation is at wavelengths shorter than 710 nm, about the limit of the human vision. Of that, about 12% is at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, ultraviolet wavelengths, which is invisible to an unaided human eye. A large amount of the Sun&#x27;s radiation falls in the fairly small visible spectrum and passes through the atmosphere.
*The preponderance of emission in the visible range, however, is not the case in most stars. The hot supergiant Rigel emits 60% of its light in the ultraviolet, while the cool supergiant Betelgeuse emits 85% of its light at infrared wavelengths. With both stars prominent in the constellation of Orion, one can easily appreciate the color difference between the blue-white Rigel (&quot;T&quot; = 12100 K) and the red Betelgeuse (&quot;T&quot; ≈ 3800 K). While few stars are as hot as Rigel, stars cooler than the Sun or even as cool as Betelgeuse are very commonplace.
*Mammals with a skin temperature of about 300 K emit peak radiation at around 10 μm in the far infrared. This is therefore the range of infrared wavelengths that pit viper snakes and passive IR cameras must sense.
*When comparing the apparent color of lighting sources (including fluorescent lights, LED lighting, computer monitors, and photoflash), it is customary to cite the color temperature. Although the spectra of such lights are not accurately described by the black-body radiation curve, a color temperature (the correlated color temperature) is quoted for which black-body radiation would most closely match the subjective color of that source. For instance, the blue-white fluorescent light sometimes used in an office may have a color temperature of 6500 K, whereas the reddish tint of a dimmed incandescent light may have a color temperature (and an actual filament temperature) of 2000 K. Note that the informal description of the former (bluish) color as &quot;cool&quot; and the latter (reddish) as &quot;warm&quot; is exactly opposite the actual temperature change involved in black-body radiation.

The law is named for Wilhelm Wien, who derived it in 1893 based on a thermodynamic argument. Wien considered adiabatic expansion of a cavity containing waves of light in thermal equilibrium. Using Doppler&#x27;s principle, he showed that, under slow expansion or contraction, the energy of light reflecting off the walls changes in exactly the same way as the frequency. A general principle of thermodynamics is that a thermal equilibrium state, when expanded very slowly, stays in thermal equilibrium.

Wien himself deduced this law theoretically in 1893, following Boltzmann&#x27;s thermodynamic reasoning. It had previously been observed, at least semi-quantitatively, by an American astronomer, Langley. This upward shift in formula_3 with formula_4 is familiar to everyone—when an iron is heated in a fire, the first visible radiation (at around 900 K) is deep red, the lowest frequency visible light. Further increase in formula_4 causes the color to change to orange then yellow, and finally blue at very high temperatures (10,000 K or more) for which the peak in radiation intensity has moved beyond the visible into the ultraviolet.

The adiabatic principle allowed Wien to conclude that for each mode, the adiabatic invariant energy/frequency is only a function of the other adiabatic invariant, the frequency/temperature. From this, he derived the &quot;strong version&quot; of Wien&#x27;s displacement law: the statement that the blackbody spectral radiance is proportional to formula_6 for some function of a single variable. A modern variant of Wien&#x27;s derivation can be found in the textbook by Wannier and in a paper by E. Buckingham

The consequence is that the shape of the black-body radiation function (which was not yet understood) would shift proportionally in frequency (or inversely proportionally in wavelength) with temperature. When Max Planck later formulated the correct black-body radiation function it did not explicitly include Wien&#x27;s constant formula_7. Rather, the Planck constant formula_8 was created and introduced into his new formula. From the Planck constant formula_8 and the Boltzmann constant formula_10, Wien&#x27;s constant formula_7 can be obtained.

==Peak differs according to parameterization==
The results in the tables above summarize results from other sections of this article. Percentiles are percentiles of the Planck blackbody spectrum. Only 25 percent of the energy in the black-body spectrum is associated with wavelengths shorter than the value given by the peak-wavelength version of Wien&#x27;s law.
Notice that for a given temperature, different parameterizations imply different maximal wavelengths. In particular, the curve of intensity per unit frequency peaks at a different wavelength than the curve of intensity per unit wavelength.

For example, using and parameterization by wavelength, the wavelength for maximal spectral radiance is with corresponding frequency . For the same temperature, but parameterizing by frequency, the frequency for maximal spectral radiance is with corresponding wavelength .

These functions are radiance &quot;density&quot; functions, which are probability &quot;density&quot; functions scaled to give units of radiance. The density function has different shapes for different parameterizations, depending on relative stretching or compression of the abscissa, which measures the change in probability density relative to a linear change in a given parameter. Since wavelength and frequency have a reciprocal relation, they represent significantly non-linear shifts in probability density relative to one another.

The total radiance is the integral of the distribution over all positive values, and that is invariant for a given temperature under &quot;any&quot; parameterization. Additionally, for a given temperature the radiance consisting of all photons between two wavelengths must be the same regardless of which distribution you use. That is to say, integrating the wavelength distribution from formula_12 to formula_13 will result in the same value as integrating the frequency distribution between the two frequencies that correspond to formula_12 and formula_13, namely from formula_16 to formula_17. However, the distribution &quot;shape&quot; depends on the parameterization, and for a different parameterization the distribution will typically have a different peak density, as these calculations demonstrate.

The important point of Wien&#x27;s law, however, is that &quot;any&quot; such wavelength marker, including the median wavelength (or, alternatively, the wavelength below which &quot;any&quot; specified percentage of the emission occurs) is proportional to the reciprocal of temperature. That is, the shape of the distribution for a given parameterization scales with and translates according to temperature, and can be calculated once for a canonical temperature, then appropriately shifted and scaled to obtain the distribution for another temperature. This is a consequence of the strong statement of Wien&#x27;s law.

==Frequency-dependent formulation==

For spectral flux considered per unit frequency formula_18 (in hertz), Wien&#x27;s displacement law describes a peak emission at the optical frequency formula_19 given by:
formula_20
or equivalently
formula_21
where is a constant resulting from the maximization equation, is the Boltzmann constant, is the Planck constant, and is the absolute temperature. With the emission now considered per unit frequency, this peak now corresponds to a wavelength about 76% longer than the peak considered per unit wavelength. The relevant math is detailed in the next section.

==Derivation from Planck&#x27;s law==
===Parameterization by wavelength===
Planck&#x27;s law for the spectrum of black-body radiation predicts the Wien displacement law and may be used to numerically evaluate the constant relating temperature and the peak parameter value for any particular parameterization. Commonly a wavelength parameterization is used and in that case the black body spectral radiance (power per emitting area per solid angle) is:
formula_22

Differentiating formula_23 with respect to formula_24 and setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
formula_25
which can be simplified to give:
formula_26

By defining:
formula_27
the equation becomes one in the single variable &quot;x&quot;:
formula_28
which is equivalent to:
formula_29

This equation is solved by
formula_30
where formula_31 is the principal branch of the Lambert &quot;W&quot; function, and gives . Solving for the wavelength formula_24 in millimetres, and using kelvins for the temperature yields:

===Parameterization by frequency===
Another common parameterization is by &quot;frequency&quot;. The derivation yielding peak parameter value is similar, but starts with the form of Planck&#x27;s law as a function of frequency formula_33:
formula_34

The preceding process using this equation yields:
formula_35
The net result is:
formula_36
This is similarly solved with the Lambert &quot;W&quot; function:
formula_37
giving .

Solving for formula_33 produces:

===Parameterization by the logarithm of wavelength or frequency===

Using the implicit equation formula_39 yields the peak in the spectral radiance density function expressed in the parameter radiance &quot;per proportional bandwidth&quot;. (That is, the density of irradiance per frequency bandwidth proportional to the frequency itself, which can be calculated by considering infinitesimal intervals of formula_40 (or equivalently formula_41) rather of frequency itself.) This is perhaps a more intuitive way of presenting &quot;wavelength of peak emission&quot;. That yields .

== Mean photon energy as an alternate characterization ==

Another way of characterizing the radiance distribution is via the mean photon energy
formula_42
where formula_43 is the Riemann zeta function.
The wavelength corresponding to the mean photon energy is given by 
formula_44

==Criticism==

Marr and Wilkin (2012) contend that the widespread teaching of Wien&#x27;s displacement law in introductory courses is undesirable, and it would be better replaced by alternate material. They argue that teaching the law is problematic because:
# the Planck curve is too broad for the peak to stand out or be regarded as significant;
# the location of the peak depends on the parameterization, and they cite several sources as concurring that &quot;the designation of any peak of the function is not meaningful and should, therefore, be de-emphasized&quot;;
# the law is not used for determining temperatures in actual practice, direct use of the Planck function being relied upon instead.

They suggest that the average photon energy be presented in place of Wien&#x27;s displacement law, as being a more physically meaningful indicator of changes that occur with changing temperature. In connection with this, they recommend that the average number of photons per second be discussed in connection with the Stefan–Boltzmann law. They recommend that the Planck spectrum be plotted as a &quot;spectral energy density per fractional bandwidth distribution,&quot; using a logarithmic scale for the wavelength or frequency.

<text>A black body or blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. The radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium with its environment is called &quot;black-body radiation&quot;. The name &quot;black body&quot; is given because it absorbs all colors of light. In contrast, a white body is one with a &quot;rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.&quot;

A black body in thermal equilibrium (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic black-body radiation. The radiation is emitted according to Planck&#x27;s law, meaning that it has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone (see figure at right), not by the body&#x27;s shape or composition.

An ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two main properties:
#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.
#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated isotropically, independent of direction.

Real materials emit energy at a fraction—called the emissivity—of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity . A source with a lower emissivity, independent of frequency, is often referred to as a gray body.
Constructing black bodies with an emissivity as close to 1 as possible remains a topic of current interest.

In astronomy, the radiation from stars and planets is sometimes characterized in terms of an effective temperature, the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.

== Definition ==
Isaac Newton introduced the notion of a black body in his 1704 book &quot;Opticks&quot;, with query 6 of the book stating:The idea of a black body originally was introduced by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860 as follows:
A more modern definition drops the reference to &quot;infinitely small thicknesses&quot;:
== Idealizations ==
This section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.

=== Cavity with a hole ===
A widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation. Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large. Lack of any re-emission, means that the hole is behaving like a perfect black surface. The hole is not quite a perfect black surface—in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected. Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.

Suppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature &quot;T&quot; and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at thermal equilibrium with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate black-body radiation that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature &quot;T&quot; and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole. See the figure in the Introduction for the spectrum as a function of the frequency of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;hf&quot;, with &quot;E&quot; = energy, &quot;h&quot; = Planck constant, &quot;f&quot; = frequency.

At any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but the second law of thermodynamics states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium, although the time it takes to do so may be very long. Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls. Radiation entering the cavity will be &quot;thermalized&quot; by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a Planck distribution. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas. At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct photon–photon interactions are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter. Photons are an example of an interacting boson gas, and as described by the H-theorem, under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.

=== Transmission, absorption, and reflection ===
A body&#x27;s behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission &quot;τ&quot;, absorption &quot;α&quot;, and reflection &quot;ρ&quot;.
The boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the Fresnel equations for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ. A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:

An &quot;opaque body&quot; is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected. That is, &quot;τ&quot; = 0 and &quot;α&quot; + &quot;ρ&quot; = 1.

A &quot;transparent body&quot; is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, &quot;τ&quot; = 1 and &quot;α&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot; = 0.

A grey body is one where &quot;α&quot;, &quot;ρ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; are constant for all wavelengths; this term also is used to mean a body for which &quot;α&quot; is temperature- and wavelength-independent.

A &quot;white body&quot; is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: &quot;τ&quot; = 0, &quot;α&quot; = 0, and &quot;ρ&quot; = 1.

For a black body, &quot;τ&quot; = 0, &quot;α&quot; = 1, and &quot;ρ&quot; = 0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfect black bodies ===
Kirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.

== Realizations ==
A &quot;realization&quot; of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.

=== Cavity with a hole ===
In 1898, Otto Lummer and Ferdinand Kurlbaum published an account of their cavity radiation source. Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck&#x27;s law. A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides. See also Hohlraum.

=== Near-black materials ===
There is interest in blackbody-like materials for camouflage and radar-absorbent materials for radar invisibility. They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable. They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.

It has long been known that a lamp-black coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured carbon nanotubes. Nano-porous materials can achieve refractive indices nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%. In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.

Other examples of nearly perfect black materials are super black, prepared by chemically etching a nickel–phosphorus alloy, vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays (like Vantablack) and flower carbon nanostructures; all absorb 99.9% of light or more.

=== Stars and planets ===

A star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as black-body radiation. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The photosphere of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature &quot;T&quot; that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.

Using this model the effective temperature of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the &quot;B&quot; (blue) or &quot;V&quot; (visible) range lead to the so-called &quot;B-V&quot; color index, which increases the redder the star, with the Sun having an index of +0.648 ± 0.006. Combining the &quot;U&quot; (ultraviolet) and the &quot;B&quot; indices leads to the &quot;U-B&quot; index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its &quot;U-B&quot; index is +0.12. The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given &quot;B-V&quot; index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body &quot;U-B&quot; index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same &quot;B-V&quot; index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths. For example, the Sun has an effective temperature of 5780 K, which can be compared to the temperature of its photosphere (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the chromosphere to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the convection zone approximately deep.

=== Black holes ===

A black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called &quot;black&quot; because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the diameter of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies). Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit black-body radiation, radiation with a nearly perfect black-body spectrum, ultimately evaporating. The mechanism for this emission is related to vacuum fluctuations in which a virtual pair of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted. The energy distribution of emission is described by Planck&#x27;s law with a temperature &quot;T&quot;:
:formula_1
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant and &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the black hole. These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.

=== Cosmic microwave background radiation ===

The Big Bang theory is based upon the cosmological principle, which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 1010 K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled. The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is &quot;the most perfect black body ever measured in nature&quot;. It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7 K. It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.

== Radiative cooling ==
The integration of Planck&#x27;s law over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature &quot;T&quot;, and is known as the Stefan–Boltzmann law:

where &quot;σ&quot; is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature &quot;T&quot;, the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of power &quot;P&quot; over the given area &quot;A&quot;.

The cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law supplemented with a &quot;gray body&quot; emissivity (). The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body&#x27;s heat capacity. This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, phase transitions or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature, and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.

If a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan–Boltzmann law and its power emission &quot;P&quot; and temperature &quot;T&quot; are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10 km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured. An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.

<text>A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing characters. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on paper by striking an inked ribbon selectively against the paper with a type element. Thereby, the machine produces a legible written document composed of ink and paper. By the end of the 19th century, a &quot;person&quot; who used such a device was also referred to as a &quot;typewriter&quot;.

The first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874, but did not become common in offices in the United States until after the mid-1880s. The typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all writing other than personal handwritten correspondence. It was widely used by professional writers, in offices, in business correspondence in private homes, and by students preparing written assignments.

Typewriters were a standard fixture in most offices up to the 1980s. After that, they began to be largely supplanted by personal computers running word processing software. Nevertheless, typewriters remain common in some parts of the world. For example, typewriters are still used in many Indian cities and towns, especially in roadside and legal offices, due to a lack of continuous, reliable electricity.

The QWERTY keyboard layout, developed for typewriters in the 1870s, remains the de facto standard for English-language computer keyboards. The origins of this layout still need to be clarified. Similar typewriter keyboards, with layouts optimised for other languages and orthographies, emerged soon afterward, and their layouts have also become standard for computer keyboards in their respective markets.

== History ==

Although many modern typewriters have one of several similar designs, their invention was incremental, developed by numerous inventors working independently or in competition with each other over a series of decades. As with the automobile, the telephone, and telegraph, several people contributed insights and inventions that eventually resulted in ever more commercially successful instruments. Historians have estimated that some form of the typewriter was invented 52 times as thinkers and tinkerers tried to come up with a workable design.

Some early typing instruments include:

* In 1575, an Italian printmaker, Francesco Rampazetto, invented the , a machine to impress letters in papers.
* In 1714, Henry Mill obtained a patent in Britain for a machine that, from the patent, appears to have been similar to a typewriter. The patent shows that this machine was created: &quot;[he] hath by his great study and paines &amp; expence invented and brought to perfection an artificial machine or method for impressing or transcribing of letters, one after another, as in writing, whereby all writing whatsoever may be engrossed in paper or parchment so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from print; that the said machine or method may be of great use in settlements and public records, the impression being deeper and more lasting than any other writing, and not to be erased or counterfeited without manifest discovery.&quot;
* In 1802, Italian Agostino Fantoni developed a particular typewriter to enable his blind sister to write.
* Between 1801 and 1808, Italian Pellegrino Turri invented a typewriter for his blind friend Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano.
* In 1823, Italian Pietro Conti da Cilavegna invented a new model of the typewriter, the , also known as .
* In 1829, American William Austin Burt patented a machine called the &quot;Typographer&quot; which, in common with many other early machines, is listed as the &quot;first typewriter&quot;. The London Science Museum describes it merely as &quot;the first writing mechanism whose invention was documented&quot;, but even that claim may be excessive since Turri&#x27;s invention pre-dates it.

By the mid-19th century, the increasing pace of business communication had created a need to mechanize the writing process. Stenographers and telegraphers could take down information at rates up to 130 words per minute, whereas a writer with a pen was limited to a maximum of 30 words per minute (the 1853 speed record).

From 1829 to 1870, many printing or typing machines were patented by inventors in Europe and America, but none went into commercial production.

* American Charles Thurber developed multiple patents, of which his first in 1843 was created as an aid to blind people, such as the 1845 Chirographer.
* In 1855, the Italian Giuseppe Ravizza created a prototype typewriter called &quot;Cembalo scrivano o macchina da scrivere a tasti&quot; (&quot;Scribe harpsichord, or machine for writing with keys&quot;). It was an advanced machine that let the user see the writing as it was typed.
* In 1861, Father Francisco João de Azevedo, a Brazilian priest, made his typewriter with basic materials and tools, such as wood and knives. In that same year, the Brazilian emperor D. Pedro II, presented a gold medal to Father Azevedo for this invention. Many Brazilian people, as well as the Brazilian federal government recognize Fr. Azevedo as the inventor of the typewriter, a claim that has been the subject of some controversy.
* In 1865, John Pratt, of Centre, Alabama (US), built a machine called the &quot;Pterotype&quot; which appeared in an 1867 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article and inspired other inventors.
* Between 1864 and 1867, , a carpenter from South Tyrol (then part of Austria) developed several models and a fully functioning prototype typewriter in 1867.

=== Hansen Writing Ball ===

In 1865, Rev. Rasmus Malling-Hansen of Denmark invented the Hansen Writing Ball, which went into commercial production in 1870 and was the first commercially sold typewriter. It was a success in Europe and was reported as being used in offices on the European continent as late as 1909.

Malling-Hansen used a solenoid escapement to return the carriage on some of his models, which makes him a candidate for the title of inventor of the first &quot;electric&quot; typewriter.

The Hansen Writing Ball was produced with only upper-case characters. The Writing Ball was a template for inventor Frank Haven Hall to create a derivative that would produce letter prints cheaper and faster.

Malling-Hansen developed his typewriter further through the 1870s and 1880s and made many improvements, but the writing head remained the same. On the first model of the writing ball from 1870, the paper was attached to a cylinder inside a wooden box. In 1874, the cylinder was replaced by a carriage, moving beneath the writing head. Then, in 1875, the well-known &quot;tall model&quot; was patented, which was the first of the writing balls that worked without electricity. Malling-Hansen attended the world exhibitions in Vienna in 1873 and Paris in 1878 and he received the first-prize for his invention at both exhibitions.

=== Sholes and Glidden typewriter ===

The first typewriter to be commercially successful was patented in 1868 by Americans Christopher Latham Sholes, Frank Haven Hall, Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soule in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, although Sholes soon disowned the machine and refused to use or even recommend it. The working prototype was made by clock-maker and machinist Matthias Schwalbach. Hall, Glidden and Soule sold their shares in the patent (US 79,265) to Sholes and James Densmore, who made an agreement with E. Remington and Sons (then famous as a manufacturer of sewing machines) to commercialize the machine as the &quot;Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer&quot;. This was the origin of the term &quot;typewriter&quot;.

Remington began production of its first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in Ilion, New York. It had a QWERTY keyboard layout, which, because of the machine&#x27;s success, was slowly adopted by other typewriter manufacturers. As with most other early typewriters, because the typebars struck upwards, the typist could not see the characters as they were typed. This arrangement, retronymically known as &quot;understrike&quot; would eventually give way to so-called frontstrike mechanisms in later, competing machines.

=== Index typewriter ===
The index typewriter came into the market in the early 1880s. The index typewriter uses a pointer or stylus to choose a letter from an index. The pointer is mechanically linked so that the letter chosen could then be printed, most often by the activation of a lever.

The index typewriter was briefly popular in niche markets. Although they were slower than keyboard type machines, they were mechanically simpler and lighter. They were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers and, because they could be produced more cheaply than keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence. For example, the Simplex Typewriter Company made index typewriters for 1/40 the price of a Remington typewriter.

The index typewriter&#x27;s niche appeal however soon disappeared as, on the one hand new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable, and on the other refurbished second-hand machines began to become available. The last widely available western index machine was the Mignon typewriter produced by AEG which was produced until 1934. Considered one of the very best of the index typewriters, part of the Mignon&#x27;s popularity was that it featured interchangeable indexes as well as type, fonts and character sets. This is something very few keyboard machines were capable of--and only at considerable added cost.

Although they were pushed out of the market in most of the world by keyboard machines, successful Japanese and Chinese typewriters typewriters are of the index type--albeit with a very much larger index and number of type elements.

Embossing tape label makers are the most common index typewriters today, and perhaps the most common typewriters of any kind still being manufactured.

The platen was mounted on a carriage that moved horizontally to the left, automatically advancing the typing position, after each character was typed. The carriage-return lever at the far left was then pressed to the right to return the carriage to its starting position and rotating the platen to advance the paper vertically. A small bell was struck a few characters before the right hand margin was reached to warn the operator to complete the word and then use the carriage-return lever.

=== Other typewriters ===

* 1884 – Hammond &quot;Ideal&quot; typewriter with case, by Hammond Typewriter Company Limited, United States. Despite an unusual, curved keyboard (see pictures in Gallery and citation), the Hammond became popular because of its superior print quality and changeable typeface. Invented by James Hammond of Boston, Massachusetts in 1880, and commercially released in 1884. The type is carried on a pair of interchangeable rotating sectors, one controlled by each half of the keyboard. A small hammer pushes the paper against the ribbon and type sector to print each character. The mechanism was later adapted to give a straight QWERTY keyboard and proportional spacing.
* 1888 – Fitch typewriter – Made by the Fitch Typewriter Company, Brooklyn, N.Y. and later in the UK with a slightly different look. Operators of the early typewriters had to work &quot;blind&quot;: the typed text emerged only after several lines had been completed or the carriage was lifted to look underneath at the page. The Fitch was one of the first machines to allow prompt correction of mistakes with its visible writing; it was said to be the second machine operating on the visible writing system. The typebars were positioned behind the paper and the writing area faced upwards so that the result could be seen instantly. A curved frame kept the emerging paper from obscuring the keyboard, but the Fitch was soon eclipsed by machines in which the paper could be fed more conveniently at the rear.
* 1893 – Gardner typewriter. This typewriter, patented by Mr J Gardner in 1893, was an attempt to reduce the size and cost. Although it prints 84 symbols, it has only 14 keys and two change-case keys. Several characters are indicated on each key and the character printed is determined by the position of the case keys, which choose one of six cases.
* 1896 – The &quot;Underwood 1 typewriter, 10&quot; Pica, No. 990&quot;. This was the first typewriter with a typing area fully visible to the typist until a key is struck. These features, copied by all subsequent typewriters, allowed the typist to see and if necessary correct the typing as it proceeded. The mechanism was developed in the US by Franz X. Wagner from about 1892 and taken up, in 1895, by John T. Underwood (1857–1937), a producer of office supplies.

=== Standardization ===
By about 1910, the &quot;manual&quot; or &quot;mechanical&quot; typewriter had reached a somewhat standardized design. There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head. When a key was struck briskly and firmly, the typebar hit a ribbon (usually made of inked fabric), making a printed mark on the paper wrapped around a cylindrical platen.

The platen was mounted on a carriage that moved horizontally to the left, automatically advancing the typing position, after each character was typed. The carriage-return lever at the far left was then pressed to the right to return the carriage to its starting position and rotating the platen to advance the paper vertically. A small bell was struck a few characters before the right hand margin was reached to warn the operator to complete the word and then use the carriage-return lever. Typewriters for languages written right-to-left operate in the opposite direction.

By 1900, notable typewriter manufacturers included E. Remington and Sons, IBM, Godrej, Imperial Typewriter Company, Oliver Typewriter Company, Olivetti, Royal Typewriter Company, Smith Corona, Underwood Typewriter Company, Facit, Adler, and Olympia-Werke.

After the market had matured under the market dominance of large companies from Britain, Europe and the United States—but before the advent of daisywheel and electronic machines—the typewriter market faced strong competition from less expensive typewriters from Asia, including Brother Industries and Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan.

==== Frontstriking ====
In most of the early typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper and pressed against the bottom of the platen (understrike), so the typist could not see the text as it was typed. What was typed was not visible until a carriage return caused it to scroll into view.

The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called &quot;visible typewriters&quot; which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward against the front side of the platen, which became standard. One of the first front-strike typewriters was the Daugherty Visible, introduced in 1893. 

==== Four-bank keyboard ====
The Daugherty Visible also introduced the four-bank keyboard, which also became standard, although the Underwood, which came out two years later, was the first &quot;major&quot; typewriter to support frontstriking and a four-bank keyboard.

==== Shift key ====


A significant innovation was the shift key, introduced with the Remington No. 2 in 1878. This key physically &quot;shifted&quot; either the basket of typebars, in which case the typewriter is described as &quot;basket shift&quot;, or the paper-holding carriage, in which case the typewriter is described as &quot;carriage shift&quot;. Either mechanism caused a different portion of the typebar to come in contact with the ribbon/platen.

The result is that each typebar could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half (and simplifying the internal mechanisms considerably). The obvious use for this was to allow letter keys to type both upper and lower case, but normally the number keys were also duplexed, allowing access to special symbols such as percent, , and ampersand, .

Before the shift key, typewriters had to have a separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two full keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology.

===== Three-bank typewriters =====
Certain models further reduced the number of keys and typebars by making each key perform three functions – each typebar could type three different characters. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.

Such three-row machines were popular with WWI journalists because they were lighter and more compact than four-bank typewriters, while they could type just as fast and use just as many symbols.

Such three-row machines, such as the Bar-Let and the Corona No. 3 Typewriter have two separate shift keys, a &quot;CAP&quot; shift (for uppercase) and a &quot;FIG&quot; shift (for numbers and symbols).

The Murray code was developed for a teletypewriter with a similar three-row typewriter keyboard.

==== Tab key ====
To facilitate typewriter use in business settings, a tab (tabulator) key was added in the late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical &quot;tab stops&quot;, pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one tab stop and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the tab stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.)

==== Dead keys ====
Languages such as French, Spanish, and German required diacritics, special signs attached to or on top of the base letter: for example, a combination of the acute accent plus produced ; plus produced . In metal typesetting, , , and others were separate sorts. With mechanical typewriters, the number of whose characters (sorts) was constrained by the physical limits of the machine, the number of keys required was reduced by the use of dead keys. Diacritics such as (acute accent) would be assigned to a dead key, which did not move the platen forward, permitting another character to be imprinted at the same location; thus a single dead key such as the acute accent could be combined with ,, and to produce ,, and , reducing the number of sorts needed from 5 to 1. The typebars of &quot;normal&quot; characters struck a rod as they moved the metal character desired toward the ribbon and platen, and each rod depression moved the platen forward the width of one character. Dead keys had a typebar shaped so as not to strike the rod.

==== Character sizes ====
In English-speaking countries, ordinary typewriters printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines per vertical inch, and had either of two variants of character width, one called &quot;pica&quot; for ten characters per horizontal inch and the other &quot;elite&quot;, for twelve. This differed from the use of these terms in printing, where pica is a linear unit (approximately of an inch) used for any measurement, the most common one being the height of a typeface.

==== Color ====
Some ribbons were inked in black and red stripes, each being half the width and running the entire length of the ribbon. A lever on most machines allowed switching between colors, which was useful for bookkeeping entries where negative amounts were highlighted in red. The red color was also used on some selected characters in running text, for emphasis. When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink. Some typewriters also had a third position which stopped the ribbon being struck at all. This enabled the keys to hit the paper unobstructed, and was used for cutting stencils for stencil duplicators (aka mimeograph machines).

==== &quot;Noiseless&quot; designs ====
The first typewriter to have the sliding type bars (laid out horizontally like a fan) that enable a typewriter to be &quot;noiseless&quot; was the American made Rapid which appeared briefly on the market in 1890. The Rapid also had the remarkable ability for the typist to have entire control of the carriage by manipulation of the keyboard alone. The two keys that achieve this are positioned at the top of the keyboard (seen in the detail image below). They are a &quot;Lift&quot; key that advances the paper, on the platen, to the next line and a &quot;Return&quot; key that causes the carriage to automatically swing back to the right, ready for one to type the new line. So an entire page could be typed without one&#x27;s hands leaving the keyboard.

In the early part of the 20th century, a typewriter was marketed under the name Noiseless and advertised as &quot;silent&quot;. It was developed by Wellington Parker Kidder and the first model was marketed by the Noiseless Typewriter Company in 1917. Noiseless portables sold well in the 1930s and 1940s, and noiseless standards continued to be manufactured until the 1960s.

In a conventional typewriter the type bar reaches the end of its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. The Noiseless, developed by Kidder, has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the type bar mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper in an attempt to dampen the noise.

=== Electric designs ===
Although electric typewriters would not achieve widespread popularity until nearly a century later, the basic groundwork for the electric typewriter was laid by the Universal Stock Ticker, invented by Thomas Edison in 1870. This device remotely printed letters and numbers on a stream of paper tape from input generated by a specially designed typewriter at the other end of a telegraph line.

==== Early electric models ====
Some electric typewriters were patented in the 19th century, but the first machine known to be produced in series is the Cahill of 1900.

Another electric typewriter was produced by the Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company, of Stamford, Connecticut, in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. The machine was produced in several variants but apparently not a commercial success, having come to market ahead of its time, before ubiquitous electrification.

The next step in the development of the electric typewriter came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical teletypewriter. The Krums&#x27; machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars. This machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City in 1910.

James Fields Smathers of Kansas City invented what is considered the first practical power-operated typewriter in 1914. In 1920, after returning from Army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 turned it over to the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester for development. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers&#x27;s design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast&#x27;s motors.

After some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, Northeast asked Remington for a firm contract for the next batch. However, Remington was engaged in merger talks, which would eventually result in the creation of Remington Rand and no executives were willing to commit to a firm order. Northeast instead decided to enter the typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first Electromatic Typewriter.

In 1928, Delco, a division of General Motors, purchased Northeast Electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as Electromatic Typewriters, Inc. In 1933, Electromatic was acquired by IBM, which then spent $1 million on a redesign of the Electromatic Typewriter, launching the IBM Electric Typewriter Model 01.

In 1931, an electric typewriter was introduced by Varityper Corporation. It was called the Varityper, because a narrow cylinder-like wheel could be replaced to change the font.

In 1941, IBM announced the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated the appearance of a typeset page, an effect that was further enhanced by including the 1937 innovation of carbon-film ribbons that produced clearer, sharper words on the page.

==== IBM Selectric ====
IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly smaller than a golf ball, with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate the ball into the correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.

Due to the physical similarity, the typeball was sometimes referred to as a &quot;golfball&quot;. The typeball design had many advantages, especially the elimination of &quot;jams&quot; (when more than one key was struck at once and the typebars became entangled) and in the ability to change the typeball, allowing multiple fonts to be used in a single document.

The IBM Selectric became a commercial success, dominating the office typewriter market for at least two decades. IBM also gained an advantage by marketing more heavily to schools than did Remington, with the idea that students who learned to type on a Selectric would later choose IBM typewriters over the competition in the workplace as businesses replaced their old manual models.

Later models of IBM Executives and Selectrics replaced inked fabric ribbons with &quot;carbon film&quot; ribbons that had a dry black or colored powder on a clear plastic tape. These could be used only once, but later models used a cartridge that was simple to replace. A side effect of this technology was that the text typed on the machine could be easily read from the used ribbon, raising issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents (ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists did not carry them from the facility).
A variation known as &quot;Correcting Selectrics&quot; introduced a correction feature, later imitated by competing machines, where a sticky tape in front of the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable &quot;pitch&quot; so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 characters per inch) and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced – each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital &quot;W&quot; to a period. IBM did produce a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the IBM Executive.

The only fully electromechanical Selectric Typewriter with fully proportional spacing and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive Selectric Composer, which was capable of right-margin justification (typing each line twice was required, once to calculate and again to print) and was considered a typesetting machine rather than a typewriter. Composer typeballs physically resembled those of the Selectric typewriter but were not interchangeable.In addition to its electronic successors, the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC), the Mag Card Selectric Composer, and the Electronic Selectric Composer, IBM also made electronic typewriters with proportional spacing using the Selectric element that were considered typewriters or word processors instead of typesetting machines.

The first of these was the relatively obscure Mag Card Executive, which used 88-character elements. Later, some of the same typestyles used for it were used on the 96-character elements used on the IBM Electronic Typewriter 50 and the later models 65 and 85.

By 1970, as offset printing began to replace letterpress printing, the Composer would be adapted as the output unit for a phototypesetting system. The system included a computer-driven input station to capture the key strokes on magnetic tape and insert the operator&#x27;s format commands, and a Composer unit to read the tape and produce the formatted text for photo reproduction.

The IBM 2741 terminal was a popular example of a Selectric-based computer terminal, and similar mechanisms were employed as the console devices for many IBM System/360 computers. These mechanisms used &quot;ruggedized&quot; designs compared to those in standard office typewriters.

==== Later electric models ====

Some of IBM&#x27;s advances were later adopted in less expensive machines from competitors. For example, Smith-Corona electric typewriters introduced in 1973 switched to interchangeable Coronamatic (SCM-patented) ribbon cartridges. including fabric, film, erasing, and two-color versions. At about the same time, the advent of photocopying meant that carbon copies, correction fluid and erasers were less and less necessary; only the original need be typed, and photocopies made from it.

==== Electronic typewriters ====
The final major development of the typewriter was the electronic typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a plastic or metal daisy wheel mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the &quot;petals&quot;). The daisy wheel concept first emerged in printers developed by Diablo Systems in the 1970s. The first electronic daisywheel typewriter marketed in the world (in 1976) is the Olivetti Tes 501, and subsequently in 1978, the Olivetti ET101 (with function display) and Olivetti TES 401 (with text display and floppy disk for memory storage). This has allowed Olivetti to maintain the world record in the design of electronic typewriters, proposing increasingly advanced and performing models in the following years.

Unlike the Selectrics and earlier models, these really were &quot;electronic&quot; and relied on integrated circuits and electromechanical components. These typewriters were sometimes called &quot;display typewriters&quot;, &quot;dedicated word processors&quot; or &quot;word-processing typewriters&quot;, though the latter term was also frequently applied to less sophisticated machines that featured only a tiny, sometimes just single-row display. Sophisticated models were also called &quot;word processors&quot;, though today that term almost always denotes a type of software program. Manufacturers of such machines included Olivetti (TES501, first totally electronic Olivetti word processor with daisywheel and floppy disk in 1976; TES621 in 1979 etc.), Brother (Brother WP1 and WP500 etc., where WP stood for word processor), Canon (Canon Cat), Smith-Corona (PWP, i.e. Personal Word Processor line) and Philips/Magnavox (VideoWriter).
=== Decline===
The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff to have to learn several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.

Due to falling sales, IBM sold its typewriter division in 1991 to the newly formed Lexmark, completely exiting from a market it once dominated.

The increasing dominance of personal computers, desktop publishing, the introduction of low-cost, truly high-quality laser and inkjet printer technologies, and the pervasive use of web publishing, email, text messaging, and other electronic communication techniques have largely replaced typewriters in the United States. Still, , typewriters continued to be used by a number of government agencies and other institutions in the US, where they are primarily used to fill preprinted forms. According to a Boston typewriter repairman quoted by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Every maternity ward has a typewriter, as well as funeral homes&quot;.

A rather specialized market for typewriters exists due to the regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own typewriters. The Swintec corporation (headquartered in Moonachie, New Jersey), which, as of 2011, still produced typewriters at its overseas factories (in Japan, Indonesia, and/or Malaysia), manufactures a variety of typewriters for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to make it harder for prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.

In April 2011, Godrej and Boyce, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of mechanical typewriters, closed its doors, leading to a flurry of news reports that the &quot;world&#x27;s last typewriter factory&quot; had shut down. The reports were quickly contested, with opinions settling to agree that it was indeed the world&#x27;s last producer of manual typewriters.

In November 2012, Brother&#x27;s UK factory manufactured what it claimed to be the last typewriter ever made in the UK; the typewriter was donated to the London Science Museum.

Russian typewriters use Cyrillic, which has made the ongoing Azerbaijani reconversion from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet more difficult. In 1997, the government of Turkey offered to donate western typewriters to the Republic of Azerbaijan in exchange for more zealous and exclusive promotion of the Latin alphabet for the Azerbaijani language; this offer, however, was declined.

In Latin America and Africa, mechanical typewriters are still common because they can be used without electrical power. In Latin America, the typewriters used are most often Brazilian models; Brazil continues to produce mechanical (Facit) and electronic (Olivetti) typewriters to the present day.

The early 21st century saw revival of interest in typewriters among certain subcultures, including makers, steampunks, hipsters, and street poets.

== Correction technologies ==
According to the standards taught in secretarial schools in the mid-20th century, a business letter was supposed to have no mistakes and no visible corrections.

=== Typewriter erasers ===

The traditional erasing method involved the use of a special &quot;typewriter eraser&quot; made of hard rubber that contained an abrasive material. Some were thin, flat disks, pink or gray, approximately in diameter by thick, with a brush attached from the center, while others looked like pink pencils, with a sharpenable eraser at the &quot;lead&quot; end and a stiff nylon brush at the other end. Either way, these tools made possible erasure of individual typed letters. Business letters were typed on heavyweight, high-rag-content bond paper, not merely to provide a luxurious appearance, but also to stand up to erasure.

Typewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.
=== Erasing shield ===
Erasing a set of carbon copies was particularly difficult, and called for the use of a device called an &quot;erasing shield&quot; or &quot;eraser shield&quot; (a thin stainless-steel rectangle about with several tiny holes in it) to prevent the pressure of erasing on the upper copies from producing carbon smudges on the lower copies. To correct copies, typists had to go from one carbon copy layer to the next carbon copy layer, trying not to get their fingers dirty as they leafed through the carbon papers, and moving and repositioning the eraser shield and eraser for each copy.

=== Erasable bond ===
Paper companies produced a special form of typewriter paper called &quot;erasable bond&quot; (for example, Eaton&#x27;s Corrasable Bond). This incorporated a thin layer of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.

=== Correction fluid ===

In the 1950s and 1960s, correction fluid made its appearance, under brand names such as Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid was a kind of opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry correction fluid (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.

A different fluid was available for correcting stencils. It sealed up the stencil ready for retyping but did not attempt to color match.

== Legacy ==
=== Keyboard layouts ===
==== QWERTY ====

The 1874 Sholes &amp; Glidden typewriters established the &quot;QWERTY&quot; layout for the letter keys. During the period in which Sholes and his colleagues were experimenting with this invention, other keyboard arrangements were apparently tried, but these are poorly documented. The QWERTY layout of keys has become the de facto standard for English-language typewriter and computer keyboards. Other languages written in the Latin alphabet sometimes use variants of the QWERTY layouts, such as the French AZERTY, the Italian QZERTY and the German QWERTZ layouts.

The QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout possible for the English language. Touch-typists are required to move their fingers between rows to type the most common letters. Although the QWERTY keyboard was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.

One popular but incorrect explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.

==== Other layouts for English ====
A number of radically different layouts such as Dvorak have been proposed to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of QWERTY, but none have been able to displace the QWERTY layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far none has been widely used. The Blickensderfer typewriter with its DHIATENSOR layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.

On modern keyboards, the exclamation point is the shifted character on the 1 key, because these were the last characters to become &quot;standard&quot; on keyboards. Holding the spacebar down usually suspended the carriage advance mechanism (a so-called &quot;dead key&quot; feature), allowing one to superimpose multiple keystrikes on a single location. The ¢ symbol (meaning cents) was located above the number 6 on American electric typewriters, whereas ANSI-INCITS-standard computer keyboards have ^ instead.

====Keyboards for other languages====

The keyboards for other Latin languages are broadly similar to QWERTY but are optimised for the relevant orthography. In addition to some changes in the order of letters, perhaps the most obvious is the presence of precomposed characters and diacritics.

Many non-Latin alphabets have keyboard layouts that have nothing to do with QWERTY. The Russian layout, for instance, puts the common trigrams ыва, про, and ить on adjacent keys so that they can be typed by rolling the fingers.

Text in the Arabic alphabet is written from right to left (rather than from left to right): consequently, the carriage on an Arabic typewriter moves to the right after each keystroke. In Arabic script, letters take different shapes depending upon their position in the word and whether they are connected to a preceding letter. A special key is used to allow switching between independent and connected letters. 

Typewriters were also made for East Asian languages with thousands of characters, such as Chinese or Japanese. They were not easy to operate, but professional typists used them for a long time until the development of electronic word processors and laser printers in the 1980s.

=== Typewriter conventions ===

A number of typographical conventions stem from the typewriter&#x27;s characteristics and limitations. For example, the QWERTY keyboard typewriter did not include keys for the en dash and the em dash. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.

Other examples of typewriter practices that are sometimes still used in desktop publishing systems include inserting a double space between sentences, and the use of the typewriter apostrophe, , and straight quotes, , as quotation marks and prime marks. The practice of underlining text in place of italics and the use of all capitals to provide emphasis are additional examples of typographical conventions that derived from the limitations of the typewriter keyboard that still carry on today.

Many older typewriters did not include a separate key for the numeral or the exclamation point , and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero, . Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter (&quot;ell&quot;) for the digit , and the uppercase (&quot;oh&quot;) for the zero. A cents symbol, was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case with a slash character (typing , then backspace, then ). Similarly, the exclamation point was created by combining an apostrophe and a period ( ≈).

=== Terminology repurposed for the computer age ===
Some terminology from the typewriter age has survived into the computer era.

* backspace (BS) – a keystroke that moved the cursor backwards one position (on a typewriter, this moved the physical platen backwards), to enable a character to be overtyped. Originally this was used to combine characters (for example, the sequence , backspace, to make ). Subsequently it facilitated &quot;erase and retype&quot; corrections (using correction tape or fluid.) Only the latter concept has survived into the computer age.
* carriage return (CR) – return to the first column of text. (Most typewriters switched automatically to the next line. In computer systems, &quot;line feed&quot; (see below) is a function that is controlled independently.)
* cursor – a marker used to indicate where the next character will be printed. The cursor was originally a term to describe the clear slider on a slide rule; on typewriters, it was the paper that moved and the insertion point was fixed.
* cut and paste – taking text, a numerical table, or an image and pasting it into a document. The term originated when such compound documents were created using manual paste up techniques for typographic page layout. Actual brushes and paste were later replaced by hot-wax machines equipped with cylinders that applied melted adhesive wax to developed prints of &quot;typeset&quot; copy. This copy was then cut out with knives and rulers, and slid into position on layout sheets on slanting layout tables. After the &quot;copy&quot; had been correctly positioned and squared up using a T-square and set square, it was pressed down with a brayer, or roller. The whole point of the exercise was to create so-called &quot;camera-ready copy&quot; which existed only to be photographed and then printed, usually by offset lithography.
* dead key – a key that, when typed, does not advance the typing position, thus allowing another character to be overstruck on top of the original character. This was typically used to combine diacritical marks with letters they modified (e.g. &quot;è&quot; can be generated by first pressing and then ). In Europe, where most languages have diacritics, a typical mechanical arrangement meant that hitting the accent key typed the symbol but did not advance the carriage, consequently the next character to be typed &#x27;landed&#x27; on the same position. It was this method that carried across to the computer age whereas an alternative method (press the space bar simultaneously) did not.
* line feed (LF), also called &quot;newline&quot; – Whereas most typewriters rolled the paper forward automatically on a &quot;carriage return), this is an explicit control character on computer systems that moves the cursor to the next on-screen line of text. (But not to the beginning of that line a CR is also needed if that effect is desired.)
* shift – a modifier key used to type capital letters and other alternate &quot;upper case&quot; characters; when pressed and held down, would shift a typewriter&#x27;s mechanism to allow a different typebar impression (such as &#x27;D&#x27; instead of &#x27;d&#x27;) to press into the ribbon and print on a page. The concept of a shift key or modifier key was later extended to Ctrl, Alt, AltGr and Super (&quot;Windows&quot; or &quot;Apple&quot;) keys on modern computer keyboards. The generalized concept of a shift key reached its apex in the MIT space-cadet keyboard.
* tab (HT), shortened from &quot;horizontal tab&quot; or &quot;tabulator stop&quot; – caused the print position to advance horizontally to the next pre-set &quot;tab stop&quot;. This was used for typing lists and tables with vertical columns of numbers or words. 
** The vertical tab (VT) control character, named by analogy with HT, was designed for use with early computer line printers, and would cause the fan-fold paper to be fed until the next line&#x27;s position.
* tty, short for teletypewriter – used in Unix-like operating systems to designate a given &quot;terminal&quot;.

== Social effects ==

When Remington started marketing typewriters, the company assumed the machine would not be used for composing but for transcribing dictation, and that the person typing would be a woman. The 1800s Sholes and Glidden typewriter had floral ornamentation on the case.

During World Wars I and II, increasing numbers of women were entering the workforce. In the United States, women often started in the professional workplace as copy typists. Being a typist was considered the right choice for a &quot;good girl&quot;, meaning women who present themselves as being chaste and having good conduct. According to the 1900 census, 94.9% of stenographers and typists were unmarried women. This also led to an increase in schools and classes for typing in order to prepare for a future job. Moreover, the word &quot;typewriter&quot; also became associated with the women who typed during the timeperiod.

Questions about morals made a salacious businessman making sexual advances to a female typist into a cliché of office life, appearing in vaudeville and movies. The &quot;Tijuana bibles&quot; – adult comic books produced in Mexico for the American market, starting in the 1930s – often featured women typists. In one panel, a businessman in a three-piece suit, ogling his secretary&#x27;s thigh, says, &quot;Miss Higby, are you ready for—ahem!—er—dictation?&quot;

The typewriter was a useful machine during the censorship era of the Soviet government, starting during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). Samizdat was a form of surreptitious self-publication used when the government was censoring what literature the public could see. The Soviet government signed a Decree on Press which prohibited the publishing of any written work that had not been previously officially reviewed and approved. Unapproved work was copied manually, most often on typewriters. In 1983, a new law required anyone who needed a typewriter to get police permission to buy or keep one. In addition, the owner would have to register a typed sample of all its letters and numbers, to ensure that any illegal literature typed with it could be traced back to its source. The typewriter became increasingly popular as the interest in prohibited books grew.

== Writers with notable associations with typewriters ==
=== Early adopters ===
* Henry James dictated to a typist.
* Mark Twain claimed in his autobiography that he was the first important writer to present a publisher with a typewritten manuscript, for &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876). Research showed that Twain&#x27;s memory was incorrect and that the first book submitted in typed form was &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883, also by Twain).

=== Others ===

* William S. Burroughs wrote in some of his novels – and possibly believed – that &quot;a machine he called the &#x27;Soft Typewriter&#x27; was writing our lives, and our books, into existence&quot;, according to a book review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In the 1991 film adaptation of his 1959 novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, his typewriter is a living, insect-like entity (voiced by North American actor Peter Boretski) and actually dictates the book to him.
* J. R. R. Tolkien was accustomed to typing from awkward positions: &quot;balancing his typewriter on his attic bed, because there was no room on his desk&quot;. 
* Jack Kerouac, a fast typist at 100 words per minute, typed his 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot; on a roll of paper so he would not be interrupted by having to change the paper. Within two weeks of starting to write &quot;On the Road&quot;, Kerouac had one single-spaced paragraph, long. Some scholars say the scroll was shelf paper; others contend it was a Thermal-fax roll; another theory is that the roll consisted of sheets of architect&#x27;s paper taped together. Kerouac himself stated that he used rolls of teletype paper.
* Don Marquis purposely used the limitations of a typewriter (or more precisely, a particular typist) in his &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot; series of newspaper columns, which were later compiled into a series of books. According to his literary conceit, a cockroach named &quot;Archy&quot; was a reincarnated free-verse poet, who would type articles overnight by jumping onto the keys of a manual typewriter. The writings were typed completely in lower case, because of the cockroach&#x27;s inability to generate the heavy force needed to operate the shift key. The lone exception is the poem &quot;CAPITALS AT LAST&quot; from &quot;archys life of mehitabel&quot;, written in 1933.

=== Late users ===

* Richard Polt, a philosophy professor at Xavier University in Cincinnati who collects typewriters, has edited &quot;ETCetera&quot;, a quarterly magazine about historic writing machines, and is the author of the book &quot;The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist&#x27;s Companion for the 21st Century&quot;.
* William Gibson used a Hermes 2000 model manual typewriter to write his 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and half of &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1983) before a mechanical failure and lack of replacement parts forced him to upgrade to an Apple IIc computer.
* Harlan Ellison used typewriters for his entire career, and when he was no longer able to have them repaired, learned to do it himself; he repeatedly stated his belief that computers are bad for writing, maintaining that &quot;Art is not supposed to be easier!&quot;
* Cormac McCarthy wrote his novels on an Olivetti Lettera 32 typewriter until his death. In 2009, the Lettera he obtained from a pawn shop in 1963, on which nearly all his novels and screenplays were written, was auctioned for charity at Christie&#x27;s for US$254,500; McCarthy obtained an identical replacement for $20 to continue writing on.
* Will Self explains why he uses a manual typewriter: &quot;I think the computer user does their thinking on the screen, and the non-computer user is compelled, because he or she has to retype a whole text, to do a lot more thinking in the head.&quot;
* Ted Kaczynski (the &quot;Unabomber&quot;) infamously used two old manual typewriters to write his polemic essays and messages.
* Actor Tom Hanks uses and collects manual typewriters. To control the size of his collection, he gifts autographed machines to appreciative fans and repair shops around the world.
* Historian David McCullough used a Royal typewriter to compose his books.
* Biographer Robert Caro has used various models of the Smith Corona Electra 210 to write his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson.

* Erik Satie&#x27;s 1917 score for the ballet &quot;Parade&quot; includes a &quot;Mach. à écrire&quot; as a percussion instrument, along with (elsewhere) a roulette wheel and a pistol.
* The composer Leroy Anderson wrote &quot;The Typewriter&quot; (1950) for orchestra and typewriter, and it has since been used as the theme for numerous radio programs. The solo instrument is a real typewriter played by a percussionist. The piece was later made famous by comedian Jerry Lewis as part of his regular routine both on screen and stage, most notably in the 1963 film &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;.
* A typewriter plays an integral part (and is used on stage as a prop) in the song &#x27;Opening Doors&#x27;, from Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (1981).
* &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot;, a 1981 single by Tom Tom Club, opens with the sound of a typewriter.
* Typewriter samples are woven into the texture of &#x27;Dissidents&#x27;, the opening track of Thomas Dolby&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;The Flat Earth&quot;.
* The Boston Typewriter Orchestra (BTO), a comedic musical percussion group, has performed at numerous art festivals, clubs, and parties since 2004. 
* Max Richter&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Notebooks&quot; (2004) features the sound of the typewriter underneath the narration of Tilda Swinton.
* South Korean improviser Ryu Hankil frequently performs on typewriters, most prominently in his 2009 album &quot;Becoming Typewriter&quot;.
=== Other ===
* The 2012 French comedy movie &quot;Populaire&quot;, starring Romain Duris and Déborah François, centers on a young secretary in the 1950s striving to win typewriting speed competitions.
* The manga (2015–2020) and anime (2018) &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot; series follows a disabled war veteran who learns to type because her handwriting has been impaired, and soon she becomes a popular typist.
* &quot;California Typewriter&quot;, a 2016 documentary film, investigates the culture of typewriter enthusiasts, including an eponymous repair store in Berkeley, California.
== Forensic examination ==
Typewritten documents may be examined by forensic document examiners. This is done primarily to determine 1) the make and/or model of the typewriter used to produce a document, or 2) whether or not a particular suspect typewriter might have been used to produce a document.

The determination of a make and/or model of typewriter is a &#x27;classification&#x27; problem and several systems have been developed for this purpose. These include the original Haas Typewriter Atlases (Pica version) and (Non-Pica version) and the TYPE system developed by Philip Bouffard, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s Termatrex Typewriter classification system, and Interpol&#x27;s typewriter classification system, among others.

The earliest reference in fictional literature to the potential identification of a typewriter as having produced a document was by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;A Case of Identity&quot; in 1891.

In non-fiction, the first document examiner to describe how a typewriter might be identified was William E. Hagan who wrote, in 1894, &quot;All typewriter machines, even when using the same kind of type, become more or less peculiar by use as to the work done by them&quot;. Other early discussions of the topic were provided by A. S. Osborn in his 1908 treatise, &quot;Typewriting as Evidence&quot;, and again in his 1929 textbook, &quot;Questioned Documents&quot;.

A modern description of the examination procedure is laid out in ASTM Standard E2494-08 (Standard Guide for Examination of Typewritten Items).

Typewriter examination was used in the Leopold and Loeb and Alger Hiss cases.

In the Eastern Bloc, typewriters (together with printing presses, copy machines, and later computer printers) were a controlled technology, with secret police in charge of maintaining records of the typewriters and their owners. In the Soviet Union, the First Department of each organization sent data on organization&#x27;s typewriters to the KGB. This posed a significant risk for dissidents and samizdat authors. In Romania, according to State Council Decree No. 98 of March 28, 1983, owning a typewriter, both by businesses or by private persons, was subject to an approval given by the local police authorities. People previously convicted of any crime or those who because of their behaviour were considered to be &quot;a danger to public order or to the security of the state&quot; were refused approval. In addition, once a year, typewriter owners had to take the typewriter to the local police station, where they would be asked to type a sample of all the typewriter&#x27;s characters. It was also forbidden to borrow, lend, or repair typewriters other than at the places that had been authorized by the police.

==Collections==

<doc id="44366" wikidata="Q1500457" url="?curid=44366" title="Where the Heart Is (2000 film)">
<text>Where the Heart Is is a 2000 American romantic drama film directed by Matt Williams and starring Natalie Portman, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and Joan Cusack with supporting roles by James Frain, Dylan Bruno, Keith David, and Sally Field. The screenplay, written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, is based on the best-selling 1995 novel of the same name by Billie Letts. The film follows five years in the life of Novalee Nation, a pregnant 17-year-old who is abandoned by her boyfriend at a Walmart in a small Oklahoma town. She secretly moves into the store, where she eventually gives birth to her baby, which attracts media attention. With the help of friends, she makes a new life for herself in the town.

==Plot==
Novalee Nation—a 17-year-old with a seven-month pregnancy and an aversion to the 
number 5—is abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack Pickens at a Walmart store in Sequoyah, Oklahoma when they stop to buy shoes. While stranded, she befriends Thelma &quot;Sister&quot; Husband, who presents her with a buckeye tree, and local photographer Moses Whitecotton, who advises her to give her baby a strong name. Novalee also becomes acquainted with surly librarian Forney Hull, who cares for his invalid sister Mary Elizabeth. During a thunderstorm, Novalee, who has been living undetected inside the Walmart, goes into labour. Forney, now in awe of Novalee, smashes through the window to help deliver the child, whom Novalee names Americus. Novalee instantly becomes a media darling and is befriended by local nurse Lexie Coop. Her estranged mother Mama Lil visits after seeing her daughter on television, but disappears with the money donated by well-wishers, after which Sister Husband offers to take in both Novalee and Americus.

Novalee trains as a photographer under Moses&#x27; mentorship while working at Walmart. A tornado blows through Sequoyah and Sister Husband is killed, but Novalee discovers she is the beneficiary of Sister&#x27;s estate, and builds a new home for herself and Americus. Meanwhile, Willy Jack, who had continued his trip to California, is sent to prison for transporting a minor across state lines whilst possessing stolen goods. He writes a song, and upon release travels to Nashville, where he teams with cranky music agent Ruth Meyers, who gives him a makeover and the stage name &quot;Billy Shadow.&quot; Novalee arrives in Las Vegas to accept a photo contest award after submitting an image of Americus—who had previously survived an abduction attempt—and the still-standing buckeye tree amidst the damage from the storm. Simultaneously, Willy Jack—who happens to be in the same hotel—is informed that his old cellmate is suing him for plagiarism, and Ruth drops Willy Jack as a client for disloyalty. Upon her return to Sequoyah, Novalee discovers Lexie has been attacked by a new love interest who molested her two eldest children. Lexie&#x27;s injuries hinder her nursing job, and since she is unable to pay rent, she and her children move in with Novalee and Americus.

Mary Elizabeth later passes away, and when Forney does not appear at the funeral, Novalee finds him in a hotel and comforts him. They act on the feelings they have long denied and spend the night together. Forney confesses his love, but Novalee confides in Lexie she has never considered herself good enough for Forney and is confused about her feelings for him. Believing his life would be a dead end with her, Novalee lies to Forney, claiming she does not love him, leaving Forney heartbroken. Novalee learns that Lexie is seeing Ernie, an exterminator who lacks the physical attributes that she prefers, but whom she fell in love with after learning he gave his ex-wife his restored 1967 Chevy Camaro in exchange for custody of his stepdaughter whom he adopted as his own. The couple marry, and Lexie informs Novalee that she is pregnant.

Severely depressed at his ruined career following the lawsuit, Willy Jack becomes a depressed alcoholic. He wanders off drunk one night and collapses on a railroad track, resulting in a passing train severing both his legs. On Americus&#x27;s 5th birthday, Novalee reads an article about Willy Jack&#x27;s accident, visits him in hospital, and realises he is a changed man, but warns him never to contact Americus. After driving Willy Jack home to Tennessee, she visits Forney at Bowdoin College where she confesses her love for him, and they return to Sequoyah where they marry in a ceremony held in the Walmart, surrounded by their close friends.

<doc id="44370" wikidata="Q905612" url="?curid=44370" title="Trefoil">
<text>A trefoil () is a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings, used in architecture, Pagan and Christian symbolism, among other areas. The term is also applied to other symbols with a threefold shape. A similar shape with four rings is called a quatrefoil.

==Architecture==
===Ornamentation===
&#x27;Trefoil&#x27; is a term in Gothic architecture given to the ornamental foliation or cusping introduced in the heads of window-lights, tracery, and panellings, in which the centre takes the form of a three-lobed leaf (formed from three partially overlapping circles). One of the earliest examples is in the plate tracery at Winchester Cathedral (1222–1235). The fourfold version of an architectural trefoil is a quatrefoil.

A simple trefoil shape in itself can be symbolic of the Trinity, while a trefoil combined with an equilateral triangle was also a moderately common symbol of the Christian Trinity during the late Middle Ages in some parts of Europe, similar to a barbed quatrefoil. Two forms of a trefoil combined with a triangle are shown below:

A dove, which symbolizes the Holy Spirit, is sometimes depicted within the outlined form of the trefoil combined with a triangle.

===Architectural layout===
In architecture and archaeology, a &#x27;trefoil&#x27; describes a layout or floor plan consisting of three apses in clover-leaf shape, as for example in the Megalithic temples of Malta.

Particularly in church architecture, such a layout may be called a &quot;triconchos&quot;.

==Heraldry==
The heraldic &#x27;trefoil&#x27; is a stylized clover. It should not be confused with the figure named in French heraldry (&quot;threefoil&quot;), which is a stylized flower with three petals, and differs from the heraldic trefoil in being not slipped.

==Symbols==
Symmetrical trefoils are particularly popular as warning and informational symbols. If a box containing hazardous material is moved around and shifted into different positions, it is still easy to recognize the symbol, while the distinctive trefoil design of the recycling symbol makes it easy for a consumer to notice and identify the packaging the symbol has been printed on as recyclable. Easily stenciled symbols are also favored.

While the green trefoil is considered by many to be the symbol of Ireland, the harp has much greater officially recognized status. Therefore, shamrocks generally do not appear on Irish coins or postage stamps.

A trefoil is also part of the logo for Adidas Originals, which also includes three stripes.

<doc id="44371" wikidata="Q3359" url="?curid=44371" title="Triton (moon)">
<text>Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune. It is the only moon of Neptune massive enough to be rounded under its own gravity and hosts a thin, hazy atmosphere. Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde orbit—revolving in the opposite direction to the parent planet&#x27;s rotation—the only large moon in the Solar System to do so. Triton is thought to have once been a dwarf planet from the Kuiper belt, captured into Neptune&#x27;s orbit by the latter&#x27;s gravity.

At in diameter, Triton is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System, the second-largest planetary moon in relation to its primary (after Earth&#x27;s Moon), and larger than all of the known dwarf planets. The mean density is , reflecting a composition of approximately 30–45% water ice by mass, with the rest being mostly rock and metal. Triton is differentiated, with a crust of primarily ice atop a probable subsurface ocean of liquid water and a solid rocky-metallic core at its center. Although Triton&#x27;s orbit is nearly circular with a very low orbital eccentricity of , Triton&#x27;s interior may still experience tidal heating through obliquity tides.

Triton is one of the most geologically active worlds in the Solar System, with an estimated average surface age of less than 100 million years old. Its surface is covered by frozen nitrogen and is geologically young, with very few impact craters. Young, intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains suggest a complex geological history. The atmosphere of Triton is composed primarily of nitrogen, with minor components of methane and carbon monoxide. Triton&#x27;s atmosphere is relatively thin and strongly variable, with its atmospheric surface pressure varying by up to a factor of three within the past 30 years. Triton&#x27;s atmosphere supports clouds of nitrogen ice crystals and a layer of organic atmospheric haze. 

Triton was the first Neptunian moon to be discovered, on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. The 1989 flyby of Triton by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft remains the only up-close visit to the moon as of 2025. As the probe was only able to study about 40% of the moon&#x27;s surface, multiple concept missions have been developed to revisit Triton. These include a Discovery-class &quot;Trident&quot; and New Frontiers-class &quot;Triton Ocean Worlds Surveyor&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

== Discovery and naming ==

Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune. When John Herschel received news of Neptune&#x27;s discovery, he wrote to Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed for a period to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that it is not plausible he saw them. A brewer by trade, Lassell spotted Triton with his self-built aperture metal mirror reflecting telescope (also known as the &quot;two-foot&quot; reflector). This telescope was donated to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1880s, but was eventually dismantled.

Triton is named after the Greek sea god Triton (Τρίτων), the son of Poseidon (the Greek god corresponding to the Roman Neptune). The name was first proposed by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book &quot;Astronomie Populaire&quot;, and was officially adopted many decades later. Until the discovery of the second moon Nereid in 1949, Triton was commonly referred to as &quot;the satellite of Neptune&quot;. Lassell did not name his discovery; he later successfully suggested the name Hyperion for the eighth moon of Saturn when he discovered it.

== Orbit and rotation ==

Triton is unique among all large moons in the Solar System for its retrograde orbit around its planet (i.e. it orbits in a direction opposite to the planet&#x27;s rotation). Most of the outer irregular moons of Jupiter and Saturn also have retrograde orbits, as do some of the irregular moons of Uranus and Neptune. However, these moons are all much more distant from their primaries and are small in comparison, with the largest of them (Phoebe) having only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.

Triton&#x27;s orbit is associated with two tilts, the obliquity of Neptune&#x27;s rotation to Neptune&#x27;s orbit, 30°, and the inclination of Triton&#x27;s orbit to Neptune&#x27;s rotation, 157° (an inclination over 90° indicates retrograde motion). Triton&#x27;s orbit precesses forward relative to Neptune&#x27;s rotation with a period of about 678 Earth years (4.1 Neptunian years), making its Neptune-orbit-relative inclination vary between 127° and 173°. That inclination is currently 130°; Triton&#x27;s orbit is now near its maximum departure from coplanarity with Neptune&#x27;s.

Triton&#x27;s rotation is tidally locked to be synchronous with its orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At present, Triton&#x27;s rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune&#x27;s orbital plane, hence as Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton&#x27;s polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.

Triton&#x27;s revolution around Neptune has become a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought to be capable of circularizing Triton&#x27;s orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton&#x27;s orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6 billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune&#x27;s Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune&#x27;s atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a new ring system similar to that found around Saturn.

== Capture ==

The current understanding of moons in retrograde orbits means they cannot form in the same region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit. Therefore Triton must have been captured from elsewhere in the Solar System. Astrophysicists believe it might have originated in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy objects extending from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50 AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin for the majority of short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in resonant orbits with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and is nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.

This has been further supported in a 2024 study of the chemical composition of Pluto and Triton which suggests they originated in the same region of the outer Solar System before the latter was pulled into Neptune’s orbit. Kathleen Mandt at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and her colleagues hypothesize that Triton and Pluto formed close to each other before the Solar System settled down. &quot;They probably formed in the same region, which wouldn&#x27;t be where the Kuiper belt is now—it would have been either closer or further away,&quot; says Mandt.

Studying prior data on the two bodies, the team found that both have a large amount of nitrogen and trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide, which could have accumulated in the outer regions of the young nebula &quot;For some reason, Triton was then ejected from this region and ensnared by Neptune&quot;. &quot;They had to have formed beyond the water-ice line,&quot; says Mandt, referring to the distance from the sun where water would freeze into ice or snow, which is why Triton and Pluto have similar amounts of certain key elements. &quot;One possibility is that the giant planets moved closer to the sun early in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System, which may have disrupted the orbits of some bodies like Triton.&quot;, says Mandt.

The proposed capture of Triton may explain several features of the Neptunian system, including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune&#x27;s moon Nereid and the scarcity of moons as compared to the other giant planets. Triton&#x27;s initially eccentric orbit would have intersected the orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.

Triton&#x27;s eccentric post-capture orbit would have also resulted in tidal heating of its interior, which could have kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton&#x27;s interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.

Two types of mechanisms have been proposed for Triton&#x27;s capture. To be gravitationally captured by a planet, a passing body must lose sufficient energy to be slowed down to a speed less than that required to escape. An early model of how Triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object, either one that happened to be passing by Neptune (which is unlikely), or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around Neptune (which is more likely). A more recent hypothesis suggests that, before its capture, Triton was part of a binary system. When this binary encountered Neptune, it interacted in such a way that the binary dissociated, with one portion of the binary expelled, and the other, Triton, becoming bound to Neptune. This event is more likely for more massive companions. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence, including binaries being very common among the large Kuiper belt objects. The event was brief but gentle, saving Triton from collisional disruption. Events like this may have been common during the formation of Neptune, or later when it migrated outward.

However, simulations in 2017 showed that after Triton&#x27;s capture, and before its orbital eccentricity decreased, it probably did collide with at least one other moon, and caused collisions between other moons.

== Physical characteristics ==
Triton is the seventh-largest moon and sixteenth-largest object in the Solar System and is modestly larger than the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris. It is also the largest retrograde moon in the Solar System. It accounts for more than 99.5% of all the mass known to orbit Neptune, including the planet&#x27;s rings and fifteen other known moons, and is also more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Also, with a diameter 5.5% that of Neptune, it is the largest moon of a gas giant relative to its planet in terms of diameter, although Titan is bigger relative to Saturn in terms of mass (the ratio of Triton&#x27;s mass to that of Neptune is approximately 1:4788). It has a radius, density (2.061 g/cm3), temperature, and chemical composition similar to that of Pluto.

Triton&#x27;s surface is covered with a transparent layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton&#x27;s surface has been observed and studied, but it may be entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Triton&#x27;s surface consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton&#x27;s mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton&#x27;s surface area is 23 million km2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth&#x27;s land area. Triton has an unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed only slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. This high albedo causes Triton to reflect a lot of whatever little sunlight there is instead of absorbing it, causing it to have the coldest recorded temperature in the Solar System at . Triton&#x27;s reddish color is thought to be the result of methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Because Triton&#x27;s surface indicates a long history of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton&#x27;s mantle, enveloping a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton&#x27;s interior for radioactive decay to maintain a liquid subsurface ocean to this day, similar to what is thought to exist beneath the surface of Europa and several other icy outer Solar System worlds. This is not thought to be adequate to power convection in Triton&#x27;s icy crust. However, the strong obliquity tides are believed to generate enough additional heat to accomplish this and produce the observed signs of recent surface geological activity. The black material ejected is suspected to contain organic compounds, and if liquid water is present on Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.

== Atmosphere ==

Triton has a tenuous but well-structured and global nitrogen atmosphere, with trace amounts of carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane near its surface. Like Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere, the atmosphere of Triton is thought to result from the evaporation of nitrogen from its surface. Its surface temperature is at least because Triton&#x27;s nitrogen ice is in the warmer, hexagonal crystalline state, and the phase transition between hexagonal and cubic nitrogen ice occurs at that temperature. An upper limit in the low 40s (K) can be set from vapor pressure equilibrium with nitrogen gas in Triton&#x27;s atmosphere. This is colder than Pluto&#x27;s average equilibrium temperature of . Triton&#x27;s surface atmospheric pressure is only about .

Turbulence at Triton&#x27;s surface creates a troposphere (a &quot;weather region&quot;) rising to an altitude of 8 km. Streaks on Triton&#x27;s surface left by geyser plumes suggest that the troposphere is driven by seasonal winds capable of moving material over a micrometer in size. Unlike other atmospheres, Triton&#x27;s lacks a stratosphere and instead has a thermosphere from altitudes of 8 to 950 km and an exosphere above that. The temperature of Triton&#x27;s upper atmosphere, at , is higher than that at its surface, due to heat absorbed from solar radiation and Neptune&#x27;s magnetosphere. A haze permeates most of Triton&#x27;s troposphere, thought to be composed largely of hydrocarbons and nitriles created by the action of sunlight on methane. Triton&#x27;s atmosphere also has clouds of condensed nitrogen that lie between 1 and 3 km from its surface.

In 1997, observations from Earth were made of Triton&#x27;s limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated a denser atmosphere than was deduced from &quot;Voyager 2&quot; data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicated Triton was approaching an unusually warm southern hemisphere summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Hypotheses for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton&#x27;s surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another hypothesis argues that temperature changes are a result of the deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton&#x27;s Bond albedo is among the highest in the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo. Based on the increase in atmospheric pressure between 1989 and 1997, it is estimated that by 2010 Triton&#x27;s atmospheric pressure may have increased to as much as 4 Pa. By 2017, however, Triton&#x27;s atmospheric surface pressure had nearly returned to &quot;Voyager 2&quot; levels; the cause for the rapid spike in atmospheric pressure between 1989 and 2017 remains unexplained.

== Surface features ==
All detailed knowledge of the surface of Triton was acquired from a distance of 40,000 km by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft during a single encounter in 1989. The 40% of Triton&#x27;s surface imaged by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; revealed blocky outcrops, ridges, troughs, furrows, hollows, plateaus, icy plains, and a few craters. Triton is relatively flat; its observed topography never varies beyond a kilometer. The impact craters observed are concentrated almost entirely in Triton&#x27;s leading hemisphere. Analysis of crater density and distribution has suggested that in geological terms, Triton&#x27;s surface is extremely young, with regions varying from an estimated 50 million years old to just an estimated 6 million years old. Fifty-five percent of Triton&#x27;s surface is covered with frozen nitrogen, with water ice comprising 15–35% and frozen CO2 forming the remaining 10–20%. The surface also has deposits of tholins, a dark, tarry slurry of various organic chemical compounds.

=== Cryovolcanism ===
One of the largest cryovolcanic features found on Triton is Leviathan Patera, a caldera-like feature roughly 100 km in diameter seen near the equator. Surrounding this caldera is a massive cryovolcanic plain, Cipango Planum, which is at least 490,000 km2 in area; assuming Leviathan Patera is the primary vent, Leviathan Patera is one of the largest volcanic or cryovolcanic constructs in the Solar System. This feature is also connected to two enormous cryolava lakes seen northwest of the caldera. Because the cryolava on Triton is believed to be primarily water ice with some ammonia, these lakes would qualify as stable bodies of surface liquid water while they were molten. This is the first place such bodies have been found apart from Earth, and Triton is the only icy body known to feature cryolava lakes, although similar cryomagmatic extrusions can be seen on Ariel, Ganymede, Charon, and Titan.

=== Plumes ===

The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe in 1989 observed a handful of geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas or water and entrained dust from beneath the surface of Triton in plumes up to 8 km high. Triton is thus one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are the Hili plume and Mahilani plume (named after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).

The precise mechanism behind Triton&#x27;s plumes is debated; one hypothesis is that Triton&#x27;s plumes are driven by solar heating underneath a transparent or translucent layer of nitrogen ice, creating a sort of &quot;solid greenhouse effect&quot;. As solar radiation warms the darker material beneath, this causes a rapid increase in pressure as the nitrogen begins to sublimate until enough pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the translucent layer. This model is largely supported by the observation that Triton was near peak southern summer at the time of &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s flyby, ensuring its southern polar cap was receiving prolonged sunlight. If this were the case, CO2 geysers on Mars are thought to erupt from its south polar cap each spring in the same way.

However, the significant geological activity on Triton has led to alternative proposals that the plumes may be cryovolcanic in nature, rather than driven by solar radiation. A cryovolcanic origin better explains the estimated output of Triton’s plumes, which possibly exceeds . This is similar to that which is estimated for Enceladus&#x27;s cryovolcanic plumes at . However, if Triton&#x27;s plumes are cryovolcanically driven, it remains to be explained why they predominantly appear over its southern polar cap. Triton&#x27;s high surface heat flux may directly melt or vaporize nitrogen ice at the base of its polar caps, creating &#x27;hot spots&#x27; which break through the ice or move to the ice caps&#x27; margins, before erupting explosively.

Though only observed up close once by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, it is estimated that a plume eruption on Triton may last up to a year. 

=== Polar cap, plains and ridges ===

Triton&#x27;s south polar region is covered by a highly reflective cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little is known about the north pole because it was on the night side during the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar ice cap.

The high plains found on Triton&#x27;s eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are therefore almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.

Four roughly circular &quot;walled plains&quot; have been identified on Triton. They are the flattest regions so far discovered, with a variance in altitude of less than 200 m. They are thought to have formed from the eruption of icy lava. The plains near Triton&#x27;s eastern limb are dotted with black spots, the &quot;maculae&quot;. Some maculae are simple dark spots with diffuse boundaries, and others comprise a dark central patch surrounded by a white halo with sharp boundaries. The maculae typically have diameters of about 100 km and widths of the halos of between 20 and 30 km.

There are extensive ridges and valleys in complex patterns across Triton&#x27;s surface, probably the result of freeze–thaw cycles. Many also appear to be tectonic and may result from an extension or strike-slip faulting. There are long double ridges of ice with central troughs bearing a strong resemblance to Europan lineae (although they have a larger scale), and which may have a similar origin, possibly shear heating from strike-slip motion along faults caused by diurnal tidal stresses experienced before Triton&#x27;s orbit was fully circularized. These faults with parallel ridges expelled from the interior cross complex terrain with valleys in the equatorial region. The ridges and furrows, or &quot;sulci,&quot; such as Yasu Sulci, Ho Sulci, and Lo Sulci, are thought to be of intermediate age in Triton&#x27;s geological history, and in many cases to have formed concurrently. They tend to be clustered in groups or &quot;packets&quot;.

=== Cantaloupe terrain ===

Triton&#x27;s western hemisphere consists of a strange series of fissures and depressions known as &quot;cantaloupe terrain&quot; because it resembles the skin of a cantaloupe melon. Although it has few craters, it is thought that this is the oldest terrain on Triton. It probably covers much of Triton&#x27;s western half.

Cantaloupe terrain, which is mostly dirty water ice, is only known to exist on Triton. It contains depressions in diameter. The depressions (&quot;cavi&quot;) are probably not impact craters because they are all of the similar size and have smooth curves. The leading hypothesis for their formation is diapirism, the rising of &quot;lumps&quot; of less dense material through a stratum of denser material. Alternative hypotheses include formation by collapses, or by flooding caused by cryovolcanism.

=== Impact craters ===

Due to constant erasure and modification by ongoing geological activity, impact craters on Triton&#x27;s surface are relatively rare. A census of Triton&#x27;s craters imaged by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; found only 179 that were incontestably of impact origin, compared with 835 observed for Uranus&#x27;s moon Miranda, which has only three percent of Triton&#x27;s surface area. The largest crater observed on Triton thought to have been created by an impact is a feature called Mazomba. Although larger craters have been observed, they are generally thought to be volcanic.

The few impact craters on Triton are almost all concentrated in the leading hemisphere—that facing the direction of the orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imaged only 40% of Triton&#x27;s surface, so this remains uncertain. However, the observed cratering asymmetry exceeds what can be explained based on the impactor populations, and implies a younger surface age for the crater-free regions (≤ 6 million years old) than for the cratered regions (≤ 50 million years old).

== Observation and exploration ==
The orbital properties of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It was found to have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune&#x27;s orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flew by in 1989.

Before the flyby of &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, astronomers suspected that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density as much as 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved incorrect. As with Mars, a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.

The first attempt to measure the diameter of Triton was made by Gerard Kuiper in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800 km. Subsequent measurement attempts arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000 km, or from slightly smaller than the Moon (3,474.2 km) to nearly half the diameter of Earth. Data from the approach of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; to Neptune on August 25, 1989, led to a more accurate estimate of Triton&#x27;s diameter (2,706 km).

In the 1990s, various observations from Earth were made of the limb of Triton using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated the presence of an atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggest that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser since &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flew past in 1989.

New concepts for missions to the Neptune system to be conducted in the 2010s were proposed by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA&#x27;s funding for missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems. A proposed lander mission to Triton, called &quot;Triton Hopper&quot;, would mine nitrogen ice from the surface of Triton and process it to be used as a propellant for a small rocket, enabling it to fly or &#x27;hop&#x27; across the surface. Another concept, involving a flyby, was formally proposed in 2019 as part of NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program under the name &quot;Trident&quot;. Neptune Odyssey is a mission concept for a Neptune orbiter with a focus on Triton being studied beginning April 2021 as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch in 2033 and arrive at the Neptune system in 2049. Two lower-cost mission concepts were subsequently developed for the New Frontiers program: the first the following June and the second in 2023. The first is &quot;Triton Ocean World Surveyor&quot;, which would launch in 2031 and arrive in 2047, and the second is &quot;Nautilus&quot;, which would launch August 2042 and arrive in April 2057.

<text>The Sermon on the Mount (anglicized from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: ) is a collection of sayings spoken by Jesus of Nazareth found in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5, 6, and 7) that emphasizes his moral teachings. It is the first of five discourses in the Gospel and has been one of the most widely quoted sections of the Gospels.

== Background and setting ==
The Sermon on the Mount is placed relatively early in Matthew&#x27;s portrayal of Jesus&#x27;s ministry--following, in chapter 3, his baptism by John and, in chapter 4, his sojourn and temptation in the desert, his call of four disciples, and his early preaching in Galilee. 

The five discourses in the Gospel of Matthew are: the Sermon on the Mount (5-7), the discourse on discipleship (10), the discourse of parables (13), the discourse on the community of faith (18), and the discourse on future events (24-25). Also, like all the other &quot;discourses&quot;, this one has Matthew&#x27;s concluding statement (7:28-29) that distinguishes it from the material that follows. For similar statements at the end of the other discourses, see 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1.

Traditionally, the Mount of Beatitudes has been commemorated by Christians as the physical site at which the sermon took place. Other locations, such as Mount Arbel and the Horns of Hattin, have also been suggested as possibilities.

This sermon is one of the most widely quoted sections of the canonical gospels, including some of the best-known sayings attributed to Jesus, such as the Beatitudes and the commonly recited version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. It also contains what many consider to be the central tenets of Christian discipleship.

The setting for the sermon is given in Matthew 5:1-2. There, Jesus is said to see the crowds, to go up the mountain accompanied by his disciples, to sit down, and to begin his speech. He comes down from the mountain in Matthew 8:1.

==Components==
Although the issues of Matthew&#x27;s compositional plan for the Sermon on the Mount remain unresolved among scholars, its structural components are clear.

Matthew 5:3–12 includes the Beatitudes. These describe the character of the people of the Kingdom of Heaven, expressed as &quot;blessings&quot;. The Greek word most versions of the Gospel render as &quot;blessed,&quot; can also be translated &quot;happy&quot; (Matthew 5:3–12 in Young&#x27;s Literal Translation for an example). In Matthew, there are eight (or nine) blessings, while in Luke there are four, followed by four woes.

In almost all cases, the phrases used in the Beatitudes are familiar from an Old Testament context, but in the sermon Jesus gives them new meaning. Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and mastery; they echo the highest ideals of Jesus&#x27;s teachings on spirituality and compassion.

In Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy. These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.

Matthew 5:13–16 presents the metaphors of salt and light. This completes the profile of God&#x27;s people presented in the Beatitudes and acts as the introduction to the next section.

There are two parts in this section, using the terms &quot;salt of the earth&quot; and Light of the World to refer to the disciples implying their value. Elsewhere, in John 8:12, Jesus applies &#x27;Light of the World&#x27; to himself.

Jesus preaches about Hell and what Hell is like: &quot;But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother &quot;&quot;Raca&quot; (fool)&quot; shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.&quot;
The longest section of the Sermon is Matthew 5:17–48, traditionally referred to as &quot;the Antitheses&quot; or &quot;Matthew&#x27;s Antitheses&quot;. In the section, Jesus fulfils and reinterprets the Old Covenant and in particular its Ten Commandments, contrasting with what &quot;you have heard&quot; from others. For example, he advises turning the other cheek, and to love one&#x27;s enemies, in contrast to taking an eye for an eye. According to most interpretations of Matthew 5:17, 18, 19, and 20, and most Christian views of the Old Covenant, these new interpretations of the Law and Prophets are not opposed to the Old Testament, which was the position of Marcion, but form Jesus&#x27;s new teachings which bring about salvation, and hence must be adhered to, as emphasized in Matthew 7:24–27 towards the end of the sermon.

In Matthew 6, Jesus condemns doing what would normally be &quot;good works&quot; simply for recognition and not from the heart, such as those of alms (6:1–4), prayer (6:5–15), and fasting (6:16–18). The discourse goes on to condemn the superficiality of materialism and calls the disciples not to worry about material needs or fret about the future, but to &quot;seek&quot; God&#x27;s kingdom first. Within the discourse on ostentation, Matthew presents an example of correct prayer. Luke places this in a different context. The Lord&#x27;s Prayer (6:9–13) contains parallels to 1 Chronicles 29:10–18.

The first part of Matthew 7 (Matthew 7:1–6) deals with judging. Jesus condemns those who judge others without first sorting out their own affairs on the matter: &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot; Jesus concludes the sermon in Matthew 7:17–29 by warning against false prophets.

==Teachings and theology==
The teachings of the Sermon on the Mount have been a key element of Christian ethics, and for centuries the sermon has acted as a fundamental recipe for the conduct of the followers of Jesus. Various religious and moral thinkers (e.g. Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi) have admired its message, and it has been one of the main sources of Christian pacifism.

In the 5th century, Saint Augustine began his book &quot;Our Lord&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount&quot; by stating:

The last verse of chapter 5 of Matthew (Matthew 5:48) is a focal point of the Sermon that summarizes its teachings by advising the disciples to seek perfection. The Greek word used to refer to perfection also implies an end, or destination, advising the disciples to seek the path towards perfection and the Kingdom of God. It teaches that God&#x27;s children are those who act like God.

The teachings of the sermon are often referred to as the &quot;Ethics of the Kingdom&quot;: they place a high level of emphasis on &quot;purity of the heart&quot; and embody the basic standard of Christian righteousness.

===Theological structure===
The theological structure of the Sermon on the Mount is widely discussed. One group of theologians ranging from Saint Augustine in the 5th century to Michael Goulder in the 20th century, see the Beatitudes as the central element of the Sermon. Others such as Günther Bornkamm see the Sermon arranged around the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, while Daniel Patte, closely followed by Ulrich Luz, see a chiastic structure in the sermon. Dale Allison and Glen Stassen have proposed a structure based on triads. Jack Kingsbury and Hans Dieter Betz see the sermon as composed of theological themes, e.g. righteousness or way of life.

===Extension===
The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; suggests that &quot;it is fitting to add [to the Sermon on the Mount] the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc.&quot;

==Interpretation==
A central debate over the sermon is how literally its high ethical standards are meant to be applied to everyday life. Almost all Christian groups have developed non-literal ways to interpret and apply the sermon. North American Biblical scholar Craig S. Keener finds at least 36 different interpretations. Biblical scholar Harvey K. McArthur lists 12 basic schools of thought:
#The &quot;Absolutist View&quot; interprets the Sermon on the Mount as conveying an unambiguous message regarding moral perfection and enduring persecution. For instance, Anabaptists claim to adhere to a literal interpretation, directly applying the sermon&#x27;s teachings to their lives.
#Other Christians have addressed the issue by &quot;Modifying the Text&quot; of the sermon. In antiquity, this modification was sometimes achieved through the alteration of the text itself to render it more acceptable. For example, some early scribes altered , changing the phrase &quot;whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment&quot; to the softened, &quot;whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.&quot; Similarly, the phrase &quot;Love your enemies&quot; was changed to &quot;Pray for your enemies,&quot; among other revisions.
#The &quot;Hyperbole View&quot; asserts that certain statements in the sermon are to be understood as exaggerations. A prominent example is , where believers are commanded to gouge out their eyes and cut off their hands if these body parts lead them to sin. However, there is some debate regarding which parts of the sermon should be interpreted figuratively.
#The &quot;General Principles View&quot; maintains that Jesus did not provide specific instructions but rather offered broad guidelines for behavior, outlining general principles of conduct.
#The &quot;Double Standard View&quot;, widely accepted in the Middle Ages, posits that the teachings of the sermon can be divided into general precepts and specific counsels. According to this view, the precepts apply to the broader population, while the specific counsels are directed toward a select group, typically the pious few. This view reserves a &quot;higher ethic&quot; for clergy, especially those in monastic orders.
#The &quot;Two Realms View&quot;, associated with the theology of Martin Luther, separates the world into the religious and secular realms. According to this perspective, the sermon applies exclusively to the spiritual realm. In the secular world, individuals&#x27; obligations to family, employers, and society may require compromises. For instance, a judge may be compelled to sentence a criminal to death, but inwardly, he should grieve for the criminal&#x27;s fate.
#The &quot;Analogy of Scripture View&quot; suggests that the more stringent precepts of the sermon are moderated by other parts of the New Testament. For instance, both the Old and New Testaments hold that all people sin, so the command to &quot;be perfect&quot; cannot be taken literally, and even Jesus himself did not always obey the command to refrain from being angry with one&#x27;s brother.
#The notion of &quot;Attitudes not Acts&quot; asserts that, while complete adherence to the Sermon on the Mount is unattainable, the focus should be placed on one&#x27;s internal attitude rather than external actions.
#The &quot;Interim Ethic View&quot; holds that Jesus was convinced the world would end imminently, thus rendering material well-being irrelevant. In this view, survival in the world did not matter, as the end times would render earthly concerns obsolete. Although it was known earlier, Albert Schweitzer is particularly associated with popularizing this view.
#The &quot;Unconditional Divine Will View&quot;, presented by Martin Dibelius, posits that while the ethical teachings of the sermon are absolute and unyielding, the fallen state of the world makes it impossible for humans to fully live according to them. Despite this, humans are still bound to strive towards this ideal, with the realization of the Kingdom of Heaven expected to bring fulfillment of these teachings.
#The &quot;Repentance View&quot; holds that Jesus knew that the precepts in his sermon were unattainable, and that it was meant to stimulate repentance and faith in the Gospel, which teaches that we are saved not by works of righteousness, but faith in the atoning death and resurrection of Jesus.
#Another &quot;Eschatological View&quot; is that of modern dispensationalism, first developed by the Plymouth Brethren, which divides human history into a series of ages or dispensations. According to this view, while the teachings of the sermon may be unattainable in the current age, they will become a prerequisite for salvation in the future Millennium (see inaugurated eschatology).

==Comparison with the Sermon on the Plain==
While Matthew groups Jesus&#x27;s teachings into sets of similar material, the same material is scattered when found in Luke. The Sermon on the Mount may be compared with the similar but shorter Sermon on the Plain as recounted by the Gospel of Luke (), which occurs at the same moment in Luke&#x27;s narrative, and also features Jesus heading up a mountain, but giving the sermon on the way down at a level spot. Some scholars believe that they are the same sermon, while others hold that Jesus frequently preached similar themes in different places.

<doc id="44373" wikidata="Q148030" url="?curid=44373" title="Triton (mythology)">
<text>Triton (; ) is a Greek god of the sea, the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite. Triton lived with his parents in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea. Later he is often depicted as having a conch shell he would blow like a trumpet.

Triton is usually represented as a merman, with the upper body of a human and the tailed lower body of a fish. At some time during the Greek and Roman era, Triton(s) became a generic term for a merman (mermen) in art and literature. In English literature, Triton is portrayed as the messenger or herald for the god Poseidon.

Triton of Lake Tritonis of ancient Libya is a namesake mythical figure that appeared and aided the Argonauts. Moreover, according to Apollonius Rhodius, he married the Oceanid of the said region, Libya.

== Sea god ==
Triton was the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite according to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. He was the ruler (possessor) of the depths of the sea, who is either &quot;dreadful&quot; or &quot;mighty&quot; () according to the epithet given him by Hesiod.

Triton dwelt with his parents in underwater golden palaces. Poseidon&#x27;s golden palace was located at Aegae on Euboea in one passage of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; 12.21.

Unlike his father Poseidon who is always fully anthropomorphic in ancient art (this has only changed in modern popular culture), Triton&#x27;s lower half is that of a fish, while the top half is presented in a human figure.
Triton in later times became associated with possessing a conch shell, which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves. He was &quot;trumpeter and bugler&quot; to Oceanus and Poseidon. Its sound was so cacophonous that when loudly blown, it put the giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast.

The original Greek Triton only sometimes bore a trident. In literature, Triton carries a trident in Accius&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot; fragment.

Triton is &quot;sea-hued&quot; according to Ovid and &quot;his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells&quot;. Ovid actually here calls Triton &quot;cerulean&quot; in color, to choose a cognate rendering to the original language (); Ovid also includes Triton among other deities (Proteus, Aegaeon, Doris) of being this blue color, with green (&quot;&quot;) hair, as well describing the steed Triton rides as cerulean.

== Libyan lake god ==
There is also Triton, the god of Lake Tritonis of Ancient Libya encountered by the Argonauts. This Triton is treated as a separate deity in some references. He had a different parentage, as his father was Poseidon but his mother Europa according to the Greek writers of this episode.

This Triton first appeared in the guise of Eurypylus before eventually revealing his divine nature. This local deity has thus been euhemeristically rationalized as &quot;then ruler over Libya&quot; by Diodorus Siculus.

Triton-Eurypylus welcomed the Argonauts with a guest-gift of a clod of earth which was a pledge that the Greeks would be granted the land of Cyrene, Libya in the future. The &quot;Argo&quot; had been driven ashore in the Syrtes (Gulf of Syrtes Minor according to some), and Triton guided them through the lake&#x27;s marshy outlet back to the Mediterranean.

One of the works which recounts this adventure is Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot; (3rd century BC), the first work in written literature that describes a Triton as &quot;fish-tailed&quot;.

In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, book 6, it is told that Triton killed Misenus, son of Aeolus, by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did.

=== Iconography of Triton duels ===
Herakles wrestling Triton is a common theme in Classical Greek art particularly black-figure pottery, but no literature survives that tells the story. In fewer examples, the Greek pottery depicting apparently the same motif are labeled &quot;Nereus&quot; or &quot;Old Man of the Sea&quot; instead, and among these, Nereus&#x27; struggle with Herakles is attested in literature (Pseudo-Apollodorus, &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;). &quot;Old Man of the Sea&quot; is a generic term applicable to Nereus, who was also frequently depicted as half-fishlike. One explanation is that some vase painters developed the convention of depicting Nereus as a fully human form, so that Triton had to be substituted in the depiction of the sea-monster wrestling Herakles. And Nereus appears as a spectator in some examples of this motif.

In the red-figure period, the Triton-Herakles theme became completely outmoded, supplanted by such scenes as Theseus&#x27;s adventures in Poseidon&#x27;s golden mansion, embellished with the presence of Triton. Again, extant literature describing the adventure omits any mention of Triton, but placement of Triton in the scene is not implausible.

== Further genealogy ==

Triton was the father of a daughter named Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena, according to Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. Elsewhere in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, there appears a different Pallas, a male figure overcome by Athena.

Athena bears the epithet &quot;Tritogeneia&quot; () &quot;Triton-born&quot; and while this is suggestive of Triton&#x27;s daughter being Athena, the appellation is otherwise explainable in several ways, e.g., as Athena&#x27;s birth (from Zeus&#x27;s head) taking place at the River Triton or Lake Tritonis.

Triton also had a daughter named Triteia. According to Pausanias writing in the 2nd century CE, one origin story of the city of Triteia held that this was an eponymous city after Triteia, founded by her and Ares&#x27;s son, named Melanippus (&quot;Black Horse&quot;).

== Tritons ==

At some time during the Greco-Roman period, &quot;Tritons&quot;, in the plural, came to be used a generic term for mermen.

=== Hellenistic and Roman art ===
Greek pottery depicting a half-human, half-fish being bearing an inscription of &quot;Triton&quot; is popular by the 6th century BC. It has also been hypothesized that by this time &quot;Triton&quot; has become a generic term for a merman.

Furthermore, Tritons in groups or multitudes began to be depicted in Classical Greek art by around the 4th century BC. Among these is the work by Greek sculptor Scopas (d. 350 BC) which was later removed to Rome. The sirens of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; were sometimes being depicted, not as human-headed birds but as tritonesses by around this time, as seen in a bowl dated to the 3rd century BC, and this is explained as a conflation with Odysseus&#x27;s Scylla and Charybdis episode.

Though not a contemporaneous inscription or commentary, Pliny (d. 79 CE) commented on the work that &quot;there are Nereids riding on dolphins… and also Tritons&quot; in this sculpture.

In later Greek periods into the Roman period Tritons were depicted as ichthyocentaurs, i.e., merman with a horse&#x27;s forelegs in place of arms. The earliest known examples are from the 2nd century BC. The term &quot;Ichthyocentaur&quot; did not originate in Ancient Greece, and only appeared in writing in the Byzantine period (12th century); &quot;Centaur-Triton&quot; is another word for a Triton with horse-legs.

Besides examples in which the horse-like forelimbs have been replaced by wings, there are other examples where the forelegs have several clawed digits (somewhat like lions), as in one relief at the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany. A Triton with a lower extremity like a lobster or crayfish, in a fresco unearthed from Herculanum has been mentioned.

Double-tailed tritons began to be depicted by the late 2nd century BC, such as in the Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus. Rumpf thought that might be the earliest example of a &quot;Triton with two fish-tails (Triton mit zwei Fischschwänzen)&quot;. However the double-tailed tritonesses in Damophon&#x27;s sculptures at Lycosura predates it, and even this is doubted to be the first example. Lattimore believed the two-tailed triton should be dated to the 4th century BC, and speculated that Skopas was the one to devise it.

As aforementioned, there is the female version of the half-human, half-fishlike being, sometimes called a &quot;tritoness&quot; or a &quot;female triton&quot;.

=== Literature in the Roman period ===

The first literary attestation of Tritons () in the plural was Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (). In the 1st century CE, another Latin poet Valerius Flaccus wrote in &quot;Argonautica&quot; that there was a huge Triton at each side of Neptune&#x27;s chariot, holding the reins of horses. And Statius (1st century) makes a Triton figurehead adorn the prow of the &quot;Argo&quot;.

Trions and nereids appear as marine retinues () to the goddess Venus in Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, or &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;.

=== Pausanias ===
Tritons () were described in detail in the 2nd century CE by Pausanias (ix. 21).
Pausanias was basing his descriptions on a headless Triton exhibited in Tanagra and another curiosity in Rome. These Tritons were preserved mummies or taxidermied real animals or humans (or fabrication made to appear as such). The Tanagran Triton was seen by Aelian who described it as an embalmed or stuffed mummy (). While Pausanias related a legend around the Tanagran Triton that its head was cut off, J. G. Frazer conjectured that such a had to be invented after a sea mammal&#x27;s carcass with a severed or severely mutilated head was passed off as a Triton.

== Renaissance ==
Triton was referred to as &quot;trumpeter of Neptune (&quot;Neptuni tubicen&quot;)&quot; in Cristoforo Landino (d. 1498)&#x27;s commentary on Virgil; this phrasing later appeared in the gloss for &quot;Triton&quot; in Marius Nizolius&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus&quot; (1551), and Konrad Gesner&#x27;s book (1558).

Triton makes appearance in English literature as the messenger for the god Poseidon. In Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;, Triton blew &quot;his trompet shrill before&quot; Neptune and Amphitrite. And in Milton (1637), &quot;Lycidas&quot; v. 89, &quot;The Herald of the Sea&quot; refers to Triton.

Gianlorenzo Bernini sculpted the &quot;Neptune and Triton&quot; fountain (1622–23) now in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Triton Fountain (1642–43) in Bernini Square, Rome. There is differing opinion on what earlier works he may have drawn from near-contemporary works or examples from antiquity. He may have been influenced by Battista di Domenico Lorenzi&#x27;s &quot;Alpheus and Arethusa&quot; (1568–70) or his Triton blowing the conch (late 1570s), or Stoldo Lorenzi&#x27;s Neptune fountain. But Rudolf Wittkower has cautioned against exaggerating the influences of Florentine fountains. It has been pointed out that Bernini had access to the Papal collection of genuine Greco-Roman sculptures, and worked with restoring ancient fragments, although it is unclear if any Triton was among these. It is within the realm of possibilities that Bernini might have used as his model the ancient Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus, which does include Triton in its composition. The Triton of this altar, the Stoldo Lorenzi Triton and the Bernini Triton are all double-tailed, like a pair of human legs.

== Romantic era ==

In Wordsworth&#x27;s sonnet &quot;The World Is Too Much with Us&quot; (, published 1807), the poet regrets the prosaic humdrum modern world, yearning for

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Mascot ==
There are numerous universities, colleges, and high schools and businesses that use Triton as their mascot. These include the following:
* University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California
* Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida
* Edmonds College, Lynnwood, Washington
* Iowa Central Community College, Fort Dodge, Iowa
* Mariner High School, Cape Coral, Florida
* Notre Dame Academy, Green Bay, Wisconsin
* San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)
* University of Guam, Mangilao, Guam
* University of Missouri–St. Louis
* University of Rennes 1, Brittany France
Many club sports teams, especially swimming leagues, use the symbol of Triton.

* Drew Marine, a leading maritime company, also uses the symbol

== Eponyms ==
The largest moon of the planet Neptune has been given the name Triton, as Neptune is the Roman equivalent of Poseidon. A family of large sea snails, the shells of some of which have been used as trumpets since antiquity, are commonly known as &quot;tritons&quot;, see Triton (gastropod).

The name Triton is associated in modern industry with tough hard-wearing machines such as the Ford Triton engine and Mitsubishi Triton pickup truck.

The USS Triton (SSN-586) was the only attack submarine of her class, and the only US Navy nuclear-powered submarine to have two reactors. She was decommissioned in 1969 and languished awaiting scrapping until 2007, which began at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and was completed as of 30 November 2009.

<text>Anna Ioannovna (; ), also russified as Anna Ivanovna and sometimes anglicized as Anne, served as regent of the duchy of Courland from 1711 until 1730 and then ruled as Empress of Russia from 1730 to 1740. Much of her administration was defined or heavily influenced by actions set in motion by her uncle, Peter the Great (), such as the lavish building projects in St. Petersburg, funding the Russian Academy of Science, and measures which generally favored the nobility, such as the repeal of a primogeniture law in 1730. In the West, Anna&#x27;s reign was traditionally viewed as a continuation of the transition from the old Muscovy ways to the European court envisioned by Peter the Great. Within Russia, Anna&#x27;s reign is often referred to as a &quot;dark era&quot;.

==Early life==
Anna was born in Moscow as the daughter of Tsar Ivan V by his wife Praskovia Saltykova. Ivan V was co-ruler of Russia along with his younger half-brother Peter the Great, but he was mentally disabled and reportedly had limited capacity for administering the country effectively, and thus Peter effectively ruled alone. Ivan V died in February 1696, when Anna was only three years old, and her half-uncle became the sole ruler of Russia.

Although Anna was the fourth child of her parents, she had only one surviving elder sister, Catherine, and one younger sister, Praskovia. The three girls were raised in a disciplined and austere manner by their widowed mother, a stern lady of sterling character. Born into a family of relatively modest means, Praskovia Saltykova had been an exemplary wife to a mentally disabled man, and expected her daughters to live up to her own high standards of morality and virtue. Anna grew up within a milieu which cherished womanly virtue and domesticity above all else, and placed strong emphasis on thrift, charity and religious observances. Her education consisted of French, German, religious texts and folklore, leavened with some music and dancing. As she grew older, she developed into an obstinate girl, with a mean streak, earning her the nickname &quot;Iv-anna the Terrible&quot;. Anna was famed for her big cheeks, &quot;which, as shown in her portraits&quot;, says Thomas Carlyle, were &quot;comparable to a Westphalian ham&quot;.

In time, her uncle Peter the Great ordered the family to move from Moscow to St. Petersburg. This meant a change of not just location but also society, and this had a significant effect on Anna. She greatly enjoyed the splendour of court and the lavishness of high society, which was very different from the austerity preferred by her mother.

==Courland Regency==
In 1710, Peter the Great arranged for the 17-year-old Anna to marry Frederick William, Duke of Courland, who was about the same age as her. Her wedding was held on a grand scale, as per her own inclinations, on 11 November 1710; and her uncle gave her a fabulous dowry of 200,000 roubles. At the feast which followed the wedding, two dwarfs performed a parody by jumping out of enormous pies and dancing on the tables.

The newly wedded couple spent several weeks in Russia before proceeding to Courland. Only twenty miles out of St. Petersburg, on the road to Courland, on 21 January 1711, Duke Frederick died. The cause of death was uncertain - it has been attributed variously to a chill or to the effects of alcohol.

After her husband died, Anna proceeded to Mitau (now known as Jelgava), the capital of Courland (now western Latvia) and ruled that province for almost twenty years, from 1711 to 1730. During this period, the Russian resident, Count Peter Bestuzhev, was her adviser (and sometimes lover). She never remarried after the death of her husband, but her enemies claimed she conducted a love affair with Duke Ernst Johann von Biron, a prominent courtier, for many years.

==Accession==
In 1730, Tsar Peter II (grandson of Anna&#x27;s uncle Peter the Great) died childless at a young age. His death rendered extinct the male line of the Romanov dynasty, which had ruled Russia for over a century, since 1613. There were four possible candidates for the throne: the three surviving daughters of Ivan V, namely Catherine (born 1691), Anna herself (born 1693) and Praskovya (born 1694), and the sole surviving daughter of Peter the Great, Elizabeth (born 1709).

Ivan V had been the older brother of Peter the Great and co-ruler with him, and by that reckoning, his daughters may be considered to have the prior claim. However, if seen from the perspective that the successor should be the nearest kin of the most recent monarch, then the daughters of Peter the Great were nearer to the throne, because they were the aunts of the recently deceased Tsar Peter II. The dilemma was made greater because the daughters of Peter the Great had been born out of wedlock, and had been legitimized later by him, after he formally married their mother Catherine I, who had previously been a maid in his household. On the other hand, Praskovia Saltykova, the wife of Ivan V, had been a nobleman&#x27;s daughter and a devoted wife and mother; moreover, she had been a lady greatly respected for her many virtues, not least her chastity. 
Finally, the Russian Supreme Privy Council led by Prince Dmitri Golitzyn selected Anna, the second daughter of Ivan V, to be the new Empress of Russia. She was selected in preference to her elder sister Catherine even though Catherine was at that time resident in Russia whereas Anna was not. There were some reasons for this: Anna was a childless widow and there was no immediate danger of an unknown foreigner wielding power in Russia; she also had some experience of government, because she had been administering her late husband&#x27;s duchy of Courland for almost two decades. Catherine, on the other hand, was married to the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was now separated from him and living in Russia, which was in itself disgraceful; and whether her husband was present or absent, his existence could raise problems at her very coronation. His intervention in government affairs at some later point could hardly be prevented, especially since Catherine had a daughter by him. In that event, since he was ruling prince of ancient lineage with years of experience, he would not be as amenable to the council&#x27;s advice as a Russian princess. Also, the fact that Catherine had a daughter already would provide a certainty of succession which the nobles perhaps preferred not to have.

The Supreme Privy Council preferred the childless and widowed Duchess of Courland. They hoped that she would feel indebted to the nobles and remain a figurehead at best, and malleable at worst. To make sure of that, the Council convinced Anna to sign a declaration of &quot;Conditions&quot; to her accession, modeled after a Swedish precedent, which stated that Anna was to govern according to their counsel and was not permitted to declare war, call for peace, impose new taxes or spend the revenue of the state without their consent. Without the consent of the council, she could not punish nobility without trial, make grants of estates or villages, appoint high officials, or promote anyone (foreign or Russian) to court office.

The deliberations of the council were held even as Peter II lay dying of smallpox during the winter of 1729–30. The document of &quot;Conditions&quot; was presented to Anna in January, and she signed the same on 18 January 1730, which was just around the time of his death. The ceremony of endorsement was held at her capital, Mitau in Courland (now known as Jelgava), and she then proceeded to the Russian capital. On 20 February 1730, shortly after her arrival, Empress Anna exercised her prerogative to do away with her predecessor&#x27;s Privy Council and dissolved that body. The Supreme Privy Council which had stipulated those onerous &quot;Conditions&quot; had been composed largely of the families of the princes Dolgorouki and Galitzin. Within a matter of days, another faction rose at court which was opposed to the domination of these two families. On 7 March 1730, a group of people belonging to this faction (numbering between 150 and 800 people, depending on the source) arrived at the palace and petitioned the empress to repudiate the &quot;Conditions&quot; and assume the autocracy of her predecessors. Among those who urged Anna to do so was her elder sister Catherine. Anna duly repudiated the document of Conditions, and for good measure sent some of the framers of the document to the scaffold, and many others to Siberia. She then assumed autocratic powers and ruled as an absolute monarch, in the same fashion as her predecessors. On the night that Anna tore up the Conditions, an aurora borealis appeared in the sky, making the horizon &quot;appear in all blood&quot; in the words of one contemporary, which was widely taken to be a dark omen of what Anna&#x27;s reign would be like.

Strong-willed and eccentric, Anna was known for her cruelty and vulgar sense of humor. She forced Prince Mikhail Alekseevich Golitsyn to become her court jester and had him married off to her unattractive Kalmyk maid Avdotya Buzheninova. To celebrate the wedding, the Empress had an ice palace measuring thirty-three feet high and eighty feet long built together with icy beds, steps, chairs, windows and even logs of ice in a fireplace of ice. Prince Golitsyn and his bride were placed in a cage atop an elephant and paraded through the streets to this structure, to spend their wedding night in the ice palace, despite it being an extremely cold night in the dead of winter. Empress Anna told the couple to make love and keep their bodies close if they did not wish to freeze to death. Eventually, the couple survived when the maid traded a pearl necklace for a sheepskin coat from one of the guards. An enthusiastic hunter, Anna always kept a shotgun by her window so she could blast away at birds at all hours of the day whenever she felt the urge to hunt.

==Empress of Russia==
Anna continued to lavish architectural advances in St. Petersburg. She completed a waterway that began construction under Peter the Great and called for seafaring ships to accompany this new canal and continue naval expansion. Anna&#x27;s lover Ernst Johann von Biron was a Baltic German and due to his influence Baltic Germans were favored with government offices, leading to the resentment of the ethnic Russian nobility, though the American historian Walter Moss cautioned that the popular image of the &quot;Bironovschina&quot; as one of total Baltic German domination of Russia is exaggerated.

===Cadet Corps===
Anna founded the Cadet Corps in 1731, one year after coming to the throne. The Cadet Corps was a group of young boys starting at the age of eight being trained for the military. It incorporated a very rigorous training program which included all the schooling necessary for someone to hold an important position in the military. As time went on, the program was improved upon by other emperors and empresses, such as Catherine the Great. These began to include the arts and sciences into cadets&#x27; schooling, alongside established studies of military topics.

===Academy of Science===
Anna continued to fund the Russian Academy of Science, started by Peter the Great. This school was designed to further the sciences in Russia, in order to help the country reach the level of the Western countries of that period. Some of the subjects taught were mathematics, astronomy, and botany. The Academy of Science was also responsible for many expeditions; a notable example was the Bering Sea Expedition. While attempting to determine if America and Asia had been at one point connected, Siberia and its people was also studied. These studies were referenced long after the expedition returned from Siberia.
The academy suffered interference from outside parties. Frequently the government and the church would meddle with funding and experimentation, altering data to match their respective points of view.
This school of science was very small, never exceeding a population of twelve students in the university and barely over a hundred in the secondary school. Still, it was a huge step forward for education in Russia. Many of the teachers and professors were imported from Germany, bringing a Western viewpoint to instruction students received. Some of the students taught by these German professors later became advisors or teachers to future leaders, such as Catherine the Great&#x27;s tutor, Adodurov.
During Anna&#x27;s reign the Academy of Science began to include the Arts into the program, as there was no school for the arts yet, and the Empress was a firm supporter of the arts. Theatre, architecture, engraving, and journalism were all added to the curriculum. It was during this time the foundation of what is now the world-famous Russian Ballet was laid down.

===The Secret Office of Investigation===
Anna resurrected the Secret Office of Investigation, whose purpose was to punish those convicted of political crimes, although some cases were occasionally taken that were not of a political nature. It has been rumored since Anna&#x27;s reign that Biron was the power behind the Secret Office of Investigation when in fact it was run by the senator A. I. Ushakov. The punishments meted out for the convicted were often very painful and disgusting. For example, some people that had supposedly been plotting against the government had their noses slit in addition to being beaten with the knout. Russian authorities listed a total of around 20,000 Russians—including some of the highest native nobility—who fell victim to Biron and Anna&#x27;s police.

=== Office for the Affairs of New Converts ===
The government under Anna established an Office for the Affairs of New Converts in 1740 to expand the conversion to Orthodoxy. The office which was situated in the Bogoroditsky Monastery in Kazan was staffed by monks and aided by state authorities. Under the empress&#x27; decree, they presided under a huge increase in conversions, where converts were provided goods and cash in return for a &quot;reward for accepting baptism&quot;. However, intimidation and violence also played a role in conversions, as a Chuvash petition described how the clergy &quot;mercilessly beat them and baptized them against their will&quot;. In addition, hundreds of mosques were destroyed. By the 1750s, over 400,000 pagans and Muslims had converted.

===Nobility===
Anna gave many privileges to the nobility. In 1730 she ensured the repeal of Peter the Great&#x27;s primogeniture law prohibiting the division of estates among heirs. Starting in 1731 landlords were made responsible for their serfs&#x27; taxes, which had the effect of tightening their economic bondage further. In 1736, the age for a noble to begin his compulsory service to the state changed to 20 with a 25-year service time. Anna and her government also determined that if a family had more than one son, one could now stay behind to run the family estate.

===Westernization===
Westernization continued after Peter the Great&#x27;s reign in areas of prominent Western culture such as the Academy of Science, cadet corps education, and imperial culture including theater and opera. Although not at the fast-paced speed of Westernization under her Uncle Peter&#x27;s reign, it is evident that a culture of the expansion of knowledge continued during Anna&#x27;s rule and affected mostly the nobility. It is argued that this success in Westernization is due to the efforts of the German court nobility; the foreigners&#x27; impacts are viewed both positively and negatively.

Anna&#x27;s reign was different from that of other imperial Russian rulers in one respect: her court was almost entirely made up of foreigners, the majority of whom were German. Some observers have argued that historians isolate her rule from Russian history due to their long-term prejudice towards Germans, towards whom Anna seems to have been sympathetic.

There is a lot of mention of Germans throughout the reign of Anna. For example, she often gave them ruling positions in her cabinet and other important decision-making positions. This was because she had very little trust in the Russians. It was because of this strong German influence in government that many Russians came to resent them.

The Imperial Theatre School, known as Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet after 1957, was founded during Anna&#x27;s reign on May 4, 1738. It was the first ballet school in Russia, as well as the second in the world. The school was established through the initiative of the French ballet master and teacher Jean-Baptiste Landé.

===Foreign affairs===
During Anna&#x27;s reign Russia became involved in two major conflicts, the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735) and another Turkish war. In the former, Russia worked with Austria to support Augustus II&#x27;s son Augustus against the candidacy of Stanisław Leszczyński who was dependent on the French and amiable with Sweden and the Ottomans. Russia&#x27;s involvement with the conflict was quickly over, however, and the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739) was much more important.

In 1732 Nader Shah had forced Russia to return the lands in northern mainland Persia that had been taken during Peter the Great&#x27;s Russo-Persian War; the Treaty of Resht furthermore permitted an alliance against the Ottoman Empire, the common enemy and, in any case, the provinces of Shirvan, Ghilan, and Mazanderan had been a net drain on the imperial treasury for the entirety of their occupation. Three years later, in 1735, conforming to the Treaty of Ganja, the remainder of the territories taken more than a decade earlier from Persia in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus were returned as well.

The war against the Turks took four and a half years, a hundred thousand men, and millions of rubles; its burdens caused great stress on the people of Russia, and it only gained Russia the city of Azov and its environs. Its effects, however, were greater than they first appeared. Osterman&#x27;s policy of southern expansion prevailed over the 1711 Peace of Pruth signed by Peter the Great. Münnich had given Russia its first campaign against Turkey that had not ended in crushing disaster and dissipated the illusion of Ottoman invincibility. He had further shown that Russia&#x27;s grenadiers and hussars could defeat twice their number of janissaries and spahis. The Tatar hordes of the Crimea had been exterminated and Russia&#x27;s signal and unexpected successes greatly increased its prestige within Europe.

The Russians also established a protectorate over the khan of the Kirghiz, sending officers to assist his short-lived conquest of Khiva.

Two Chinese embassies to Anna&#x27;s court, first at Moscow in 1731, then at St Petersburg the following year, were the only ones China dispatched to Europe through the 18th century. These embassies were unique also in that they represented the only occasions where officials of the Chinese Empire kowtowed before a foreign ruler.

==Relationship with Biron==

After being widowed just weeks following her wedding, Anna never remarried. As empress of Russia, she enjoyed the power she held over all men and may have thought that marriage would undermine her power and position. Nevertheless, Anna&#x27;s reign is often referred to as &quot;The Age of Biron&quot; (&quot;&quot;), after her German lover Ernst Johann Biron. Historians concur that Biron not only had a strong influence on Anna&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies, but also that at times he wielded power solely without reference to the Empress. Anna was attracted to Biron&#x27;s personal charm and he proved to be a good companion to her, but his name became synonymous with cruelty and terror. In public perception these negative qualities became the hallmark of Anna&#x27;s reign.

==Death and succession==
As her health declined Anna declared her grandnephew, Ivan VI, as her successor and appointed Biron as regent. This was an attempt to secure the line of her father, Ivan V, and exclude the descendants of Peter the Great from inheriting the throne. It was recorded that she had an ulcer on her kidneys, and she continued having attacks of gout; as her condition worsened, her health began to fail.

Anna died on 28 October 1740 at the age of 47 from a kidney stone that made for a slow and painful death. The tsaritsa&#x27;s final words focused on Biron. Ivan VI was only a two-month-old baby at the time, and his mother, Anna Leopoldovna, was detested for her German counsellors and relations. As a consequence, shortly after Anna&#x27;s death, Elizabeth Petrovna, legitimized daughter of Peter the Great, managed to gain the favor of the populace, locked Ivan VI in a dungeon, and exiled his mother. Anna was buried three months later on 15 January 1741, leaving behind uncertainty for the future of Russia.

==Legacy==
In the West, Anna&#x27;s reign was traditionally viewed as a continuation of the transition from the old Muscovy ways to the European court envisioned by Peter the Great. Her severe government was universally unpopular. Within Russia Anna&#x27;s reign is often referred to as a &quot;dark era&quot;. Her unpopularity also derived from personality flaws. Even considering the need of Russian rulers to avoid displays of weakness, Anna&#x27;s rule involved questionable actions towards her subjects. She was known to enjoy hunting animals from the palace windows and, on more than a few occasions, humiliated individuals with disabilities. The issues of serfdom, peasant and lower class slavery, taxation, dishonesty, and rule through constant fear persisted in Russia during her rule. Her empire was described by Lefort, the Saxon minister, as being &quot;comparable to a storm-threatened ship, manned by a pilot and crew who are all drunk or asleep. . . with no considerable future&quot;. Anna&#x27;s war with Turkey, economic issues, and conspiracy revolving around her accession all bring to light an ominous glow of the empress&#x27; reign. She restored the court in St. Petersburg and brought Russia&#x27;s political atmosphere back to where Peter the Great had intended, and its grandeur was almost unmatched in Europe or Asia; but such lavish court life was overshadowed by the thousands of men slaughtered in war.

<text>Gunderic (; 379–428), King of Hasding Vandals (407-418), then King of Vandals and Alans (418–428), led the Hasding Vandals, a Germanic tribe originally residing near the Oder River, to take part in the barbarian invasions of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century.

== History ==
He was a son of King Godigisel, the Hasdingi&#x27;s Vandal king when his people breached the Rhine river frontier of the Empire on the last day of 406. During that year, the Vandals had become heavily involved in a war with the Franks, who were already settled as allies of the Romans, and who attempted to keep the Vandals out. Godigisel was killed in the fighting and Gunderic succeeded him.

Gunderic and his people ultimately crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula in October 409. With the Hasdingi portion of the Vandals he established the Kingdom in the Roman province of Gallaecia (north-western Iberia). They were driven out by the Visigoths in 418 on the orders of the Romans (the Visigoths were recalled and settled as a reward for their service in Aquitania). In 418 Attaces, the king of the Alans, fell in battle against the Visigoths, who at the time were allies of Rome, in Hispania, and most of the surviving Alans appealed to Gunderic who accepted their request and thus became King of the Vandals and Alans. In 420 Comes Hispaniarum attacked the Vandals who had gone to war with the Sueves in Galicia where the tribes were confined after the Visigoths had severely defeated them in 418. The imperial vicar (head of a diocese) defeated Maximus, son of earlier usurper Gerontius (409), in 420–421, but it resulted in the Vandals moving south to Baetica. Conflicts with the Suebi drove him into Baetica in the south of Hispania, where he joined the surviving Silingi portion of the Vandals. The Vandals moved south to Baetica in 420–1. They defeated a Roman army, led by magister militum Castinus, outside the walls of Cordoba in 422. The Vandals attacked Mauretania Tingitana, the Balearics, and sacked Cartagena and Seville in 425. They did not remain in these cities. Gunderic re-took the city in 428. The Vandals departed Spain in 429 and for 10 years Roman Spain was intact except for Galicia under the control of the Sueves. Hydatius writes that in 428 Gunderic laid &quot;hands on the church of that very city, by the will of God he was seized by a demon and died.&quot; It is unclear how Gunderic died, however it is theorized that Hydatius&#x27; writing was in reference to Gunderic&#x27;s attempt to convert a Catholic church to an Arian church. The attempt was short-lived: not long after his attempt to seize the church in Hispalis, he unexpectedly died. After Gunderic died early in 428, the Vandals elected his half-brother Genseric as his successor, and Genseric left Iberia to the Visigoths in favor of invading Roman Africa.

<text>In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, a Muggle () is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family. Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood inside them. It differs from the term &quot;Squib&quot;, which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power or ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive term &quot;mudblood&quot;, which is used to imply the supposed impurity of Muggle blood), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. Equivalent terms used by the in-universe magic community of the USA include No-Maj and No-Majs (short for &quot;no magic&quot;); French equivalents are Non-Magiques and No-Majes. Other terms are Can&#x27;t-Spells and Non-Wizards.

== Usage in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; ==
The term &quot;Muggle&quot; is sometimes used in a pejorative manner in the novels. Since &quot;Muggle&quot; refers to a person who is a member of the non-magical community, Muggles are simply ordinary human beings without any magical abilities and almost always with no awareness of the existence of magic. Witches and wizards with non-magical parents are called &quot;Muggle-borns&quot;. There have also been some children known to have been born to one magical and one non-magical parent. People of this mixed parentage are called &quot;half-bloods&quot;; magical people with any Muggle ancestry on the one side or the other are half-bloods as well. The most prominent Muggle-born in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series is Hermione Granger, who was born to Muggles of undisclosed names. Witches and wizards with all-magical heritage are called &quot;pure bloods&quot;.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels, Muggles are often portrayed as foolish, sometimes befuddled characters, who are completely oblivious to the wizarding world that exists in their midst. If, by unfortunate means, Muggles do happen to observe the working of magic, the Ministry of Magic sends Obliviators to cast Memory Charms upon them, causing them to forget the event.

Some Muggles are aware of the wizarding world. These include Muggle parents of magical children, such as Hermione Granger&#x27;s parents, the Muggle Prime Minister (and predecessors), the Dursley family (Harry Potter&#x27;s unsupportive non-magical and only living relatives), and the non-magical spouses of some witches and wizards.

Rowling has created the word &quot;Muggle&quot; from &quot;mug&quot;, an English term for someone who is easily fooled.

=== Notable Muggles ===
* The Dursleys, Harry&#x27;s maternal relatives with whom he lives for sixteen years
* The Muggle Prime Minister
* Frank Bryce, the Riddle family gardener
* Jacob Kowalski, Newt Scamander&#x27;s No-Maj friend
* Mary Lou Barebone, leader of the New Salem Philanthropic Society (or the &quot;Second Salemers&quot;)

== Other usages ==
The word &quot;muggle&quot;, or &quot;muggles&quot;, is now used in various contexts in which its meaning is similar to the sense in which it appears in the Harry Potter book series. Generally speaking, it is used by members of a group to describe those outside the group, comparable to &quot;civilian&quot; as used by military personnel. Whereas in the books &quot;muggle&quot; is consistently capitalized, in other uses it is often predominantly lowercase.

* According to the BBC quiz show &quot;QI&quot;, in the episode &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, &quot;muggle&quot; was a 1930s jazz slang word for someone who uses cannabis. &quot;Muggles&quot; is the title of a 1928 recording by Louis Armstrong and His Orchestra.
* A &quot;muggle&quot; is, according to Abbott Walter Bower, the author of the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, &quot;an Englishman&#x27;s tail&quot;. In Alistair Moffat&#x27;s book &quot;A History of the Borders from Early Times&quot;, it is stated that there was a widely held 13th-century belief amongst Scots that Englishmen had tails.
* Ernest Bramah referred to &quot;the artful Muggles&quot; in a detective story published decades before the Potter books (&quot;The Ghost at Massingham Mansions&quot;, in &quot;The Eyes of Max Carrados&quot;, Doran, New York, 1924).
* Muggles is the name of a female character in the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Gammage Cup&quot; by Carol Kendall published in 1959 by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World.
* Published in 1982, Roald Dahl&#x27;s character the Big Friendly Giant uses the word &quot;Muggled&quot; while describing a good dream to the other main character, Sophie - “And the whole school is then cheering like mad and shouting bravo well done, and, for ever after that, even when you is getting your sums all gungswizzled and muggled up, Mr. Figgins is always giving you ten out of ten and writing Good Work Sophie in your exercise book.” – &quot;The BFG&quot;. Roald Dahl also names a family of monkeys &quot;The Muggle-Wumps&quot; in &quot;The Twits&quot; and other works.
* &quot;Muggle&quot; was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2003, where it is said to refer to a person who is lacking a skill.
* &quot;Muggle&quot; is used in informal English by members of small, specialised groups, usually those that consider their activities to either be analogous to or directly involve magic (such as within hacker culture; and pagans, magicians, Neopagans and Wiccans) to refer to those outside the group.
* &quot;Muggle&quot; (or &quot;geomuggle&quot;) is used by geocachers to refer to those not involved in or aware of the sport of geocaching. A cache that has been tampered with by non-participants is said to be plundered or &quot;muggled&quot;.

===Trademark lawsuit===
Nancy Stouffer, author of &quot;The Legend of Rah and the Muggles&quot; (1984) accused Rowling of a trademark violation for the use of the term &quot;muggles&quot;, as well as copyright violations for some similarities to her book. Rowling and Scholastic, her publisher, sued for declaratory judgment and won on a summary judgment motion, based on a lack of likelihood of confusion.

<doc id="44387" wikidata="Q336198" url="?curid=44387" title="Socrates of Constantinople">
<text>Socrates of Constantinople ( 380 – after 439), also known as Socrates Scholasticus (), was a 5th-century Greek Christian church historian, a contemporary of Sozomen and Theodoret.

He is the author of a &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (&quot;Church History&quot;, Ἐκκλησιαστική Ἱστορία) which covers the history of late ancient Christianity during the years 305 to 439.

==Life==
He was born in Constantinople. Even in ancient times, nothing seems to have been known of his life except what can be gathered from notices in his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, which departed from its ostensible model, Eusebius of Caesarea, in emphasizing the place of the emperor in church affairs and in giving secular as well as church history.

Socrates&#x27; teachers, noted in his prefaces, were the grammarians Helladius and Ammonius, who came to Constantinople from Alexandria, where in 391 they had been involved in a violent revolt that culminated in the destruction of the Serapeum of Alexandria.

It is not proved that Socrates of Constantinople later profited from the teachings of the sophist Troilus. No certainty exists as to Socrates&#x27; precise vocation, though it may be inferred from his work that he was a layman.

In later years, he traveled and visited, among other places, Paphlagonia and Cyprus.

== The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; ==
The history covers the years 305 to 439, and experts believe it was finished in 439 or soon thereafter, and certainly during the lifetime of Emperor Theodosius II, i.e., before 450. The purpose of the history is to continue the work of Eusebius of Caesarea (1.1). It relates in simple Greek language what the Church experienced from the days of Constantine to the writer&#x27;s time. Ecclesiastical dissensions occupy the foreground, for when the Church is at peace, there is nothing for the church historian to relate (7.48.7). In the preface to Book 5, Socrates defends dealing with Arianism and with political events in addition to writing about the church.

Socrates&#x27; account is in many respects well-balanced. He is careful not to use hyperbolic titles when referring to prominent personalities in the church and the government and he even criticizes Eusebius for his excessive praises to Emperor Constantine the Great in his &quot;Vita Constantini&quot;.

The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; is one of the few sources of information about Hypatia, the female mathematician and philosopher of Alexandria, who was brutally murdered by a mob, allegedly by order of Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria. Socrates presents Hypatia&#x27;s murder as entirely politically motivated and makes no mention of any role that Hypatia&#x27;s neoplatonism might have played in her death, arguing instead that she was killed for supporting local prefect Orestes in his political struggle against Cyril. Socrates unequivocally condemns the actions of the mob, declaring, &quot;Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.&quot;

Socrates is often assumed to have been a follower of Novatianism, but this is based on the fact that he gives a lot of details about the Novatianists, and speaks of them in generous terms, as he does of Arians and other groups. He speaks of himself as belonging to the church.

Socrates asserts that he owed the impulse to write his work to a certain Theodorus, who is alluded to in the proemium to the second book as &quot;a holy man of God&quot; and seems therefore to have been a monk or one of the higher clergy. The contemporary historians Sozomen and Theodoret were combined with Socrates in a sixth-century compilation, which has obscured their differences until recently, when their individual portrayals of the series of Christian emperors were distinguished one from another and contrasted by Hartmut Leppin, &quot;Von Constantin dem Großen zu Theodosius II&quot; (Göttingen 1996).

===Editions and translations===
The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was first edited in Greek by Robert Estienne, on the basis of &quot;Codex Regius&quot; 1443 (Paris, 1544); a translation into Latin by Johannes Christophorson (1612) is important for its variant readings. The fundamental early modern edition, however, was produced by Henricus Valesius (Henri Valois) (Paris, 1668), who used the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;, a Codex Vaticanus, and a Codex Florentinus, and also employed the indirect tradition of Theodorus Lector (&quot;Codex Leonis Alladi&quot;).

The text was edited in &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; vol. 67 (online at documentacatholicaomnia.eu). The new critical edition of the text is edited by G. C. Hansen, and published in the series &quot;Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller&quot; (Berlin:Akademie Verlag) 1995. An English translation by A. C. Zenos was published in &quot; Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot;, Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wallace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.) (online editions: newadvent.org ccel.orgmunseys.com . More recently (2004-2007), Socrates&#x27; &quot;History&quot; has been published in four bilingual (Greek/Latin and French) volumes by Pierre Maraval in the &quot;Sources Chrétiennes&quot; collection.

<text>Andrzej Witold Wajda (; 6 March 1926 – 9 October 2016) was a Polish film and theatre director. Recipient of an Honorary Oscar, the Palme d&#x27;Or, as well as Honorary Golden Lion and Honorary Golden Bear Awards, he was a prominent member of the &quot;Polish Film School&quot;. He was known especially for his trilogy of war films consisting of &quot;A Generation&quot; (1955), &quot;Kanał&quot; (1957) and &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (1958).

He is considered one of the world&#x27;s most renowned filmmakers, whose works chronicled his native country&#x27;s political and social evolution and dealt with the myths of Polish national identity offering insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience – the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances.

Four of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (1975), &quot;The Maids of Wilko&quot; (1979), &quot;Man of Iron&quot; (1981) and &quot;Katyń&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Wajda was born in Suwałki, the son of Aniela (née Białowąs), a school teacher, and Jakub Wajda, an army officer. In 1942, he joined the Polish resistance and served in the Home Army. After the war, he studied to be a painter at Kraków&#x27;s Academy of Fine Arts before entering the Łódź Film School, where many famous Polish directors, such as Roman Polanski, studied.

==Early career==
After Wajda&#x27;s apprenticeship to director Aleksander Ford, Wajda was given the opportunity to direct his own film. &quot;A Generation&quot; (1955) was his first major film. At the same time Wajda began his work as a director in theatre, including Michael V. Gazzo&#x27;s &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1959), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1960), and &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; (1963) by William Gibson. Wajda made two more increasingly accomplished films, which developed further the anti-war theme of &quot;A Generation&quot;: &quot;Kanał&quot; (1957) (Special Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival in 1957, shared with Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;) and &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (1958) with Zbigniew Cybulski.

While capable of turning out mainstream commercial fare (often dismissed as &quot;trivial&quot; by critics), Wajda was more interested in works of allegory and symbolism, and certain symbols (such as setting fire to a glass of liquor, representing the flame of youthful idealism that was extinguished by the war) recur often in his films. &quot;Lotna&quot; (1959) is full of surrealistic and symbolic scenes and shots, but he managed to explore other styles, making new wave style &quot;Innocent Sorcerers&quot; (1960) with music by Krzysztof Komeda, starring Roman Polanski and Jerzy Skolimowski (who was also a co-script writer) in the episodes. Then Wajda directed &quot;Samson&quot; (1961), the story of Jacob, a Jewish boy, who wants to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland. In the mid-1960s Wajda made &quot;The Ashes&quot; (1965) based on the novel by Polish writer Stefan Żeromski and directed several films abroad: &quot;Love at Twenty&quot; (1962), &quot;Siberian Lady Macbeth&quot; (1962) and &quot;Gates To Paradise&quot; (1968).

In 1967, Cybulski was killed in a train accident, whereupon the director articulated his grief with &quot;Everything for Sale&quot; (1968), considered one of his most personal films, using the technique of a film-within-a-film to tell the story of a film maker&#x27;s life and work. The following year he directed an ironic satire &quot;Hunting Flies&quot; with the script written by Janusz Głowacki and a short television film called &quot;Przekładaniec&quot; based on a screenplay by Stanisław Lem.

==Artistic recognition==

The 1970s were the most prolific artistic period for Wajda, who made over ten films: &quot;Landscape After the Battle&quot; (1970), &quot;Pilate and Others&quot; (1971), &quot;The Wedding&quot; (1972) – the film version of the famous Polish poetic drama by Stanisław Wyspiański, &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (1974), &quot;Man of Marble&quot; (1977) – the film takes place in two time periods, the first film showing the episodes of Stalinism in Poland, &quot;The Shadow Line&quot; (1976), &quot;Rough Treatment&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Without Anesthesia&quot;) (1978), &quot;The Orchestra Conductor&quot; (1980), starring John Gielgud; and two psychological and existential films based upon novels by Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz – &quot;The Birch Wood&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Maids of Wilko&quot; (1979). &quot;The Birch Wood&quot; was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival where Wajda won the Golden Prize for Direction.

Wajda continued to work in theatre, including &quot;Play Strindberg&quot;, Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Possessed&quot; and &quot;Nastasja Filippovna&quot; – Wajda&#x27;s version of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;November Night&quot; by Wyspiański, &quot;The Immigrants&quot; by Sławomir Mrożek, &quot;The Danton Affair&quot; or &quot;The Dreams of Reason&quot;.

Wajda&#x27;s later commitment to Poland&#x27;s burgeoning Solidarity movement was manifested in &quot;Man of Iron&quot; (1981), a thematic sequel to &quot;The Man of Marble&quot;, with Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa appearing as himself in the latter film. The film sequence is loosely based on the life of Anna Walentynowicz, a hero of socialist labor Stakhanovite turned dissident and alludes to events from real life, such as the firing of Walentynowicz from the shipyard and the underground wedding of Bogdan Borusewicz to Alina Pienkowska. The director&#x27;s involvement in this movement would prompt the Polish government to force Wajda&#x27;s production company out of business. For the film, Wajda won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 1983, he directed &quot;Danton&quot;, starring Gérard Depardieu in the title role, a film set in 1794 (Year Two of the French Republican calendar) dealing with the Post-Revolutionary Terror. Made against the backdrop of the martial law in Poland, Wajda showed how easily revolution can change into terror and start to &quot;eat its own children.&quot; For this film Wajda was honoured with the Louis Delluc Prize and a César Award for Best Director. In the 1980s, he also made &quot;A Love in Germany&quot; (1983) featuring Hanna Schygulla, &quot;The Chronicle of Amorous Incidents&quot; (1986) an adaptation of Tadeusz Konwicki&#x27;s novel and &quot;The Possessed&quot; (1988) based on Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel. In theatre he prepared an interpretation of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1984) and other unique spectacles such as &quot;Antygone&quot;, his sequential &quot;Hamlet&quot; versions and the early 20th-century Jewish play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. In 1989, he was the president of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Career after 1990==

In 1990, Andrzej Wajda was honoured by the European Film Awards for his lifetime achievement, only the third director to be so honoured, after Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman. In the early 1990s, he was elected a senator and also appointed artistic director of Warsaw&#x27;s Teatr Powszechny. He continued to make films set during World War II, including &quot;Korczak&quot; (1990), a story about a Jewish-Polish doctor who takes care of orphan children, in &quot;The Crowned-Eagle Ring&quot; (1993) and &quot;Holy Week&quot; (1995) specifically on Jewish-Polish relations. In 1994, Wajda presented his own film version of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel The Idiot in the movie &quot;Nastasja&quot;, starring Japanese actor Tamasoburo Bando in the double role of Prince Mishkin and Nastasja. The film&#x27;s cinematographer was Paweł Edelman, who subsequently became one of Wajda&#x27;s great collaborators. In 1996, the director went in a different direction with &quot;Miss Nobody&quot;, a coming-of-age drama that explored the darker and more spiritual aspects of a relationship between three high-school girls. In 1999, Wajda released the epic film &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, based on the epic poem of the Polish 19th-century romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz.

A year later, at the 2000 Academy Awards, Wajda was presented with an honorary Oscar for his contribution to world cinema; he subsequently donated the award to Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University. In 2002, Wajda directed &quot;The Revenge&quot;, a film version of his 1980s comedy theatre production, with Roman Polanski in one of the main roles. In February 2006, Wajda received an Honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 2007, &quot;Katyń&quot; was released, a well-received film about the Katyń massacre, in which Wajda&#x27;s father was murdered; the director also shows the dramatic situation of those who await their relatives (mothers, wives and children). The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2008.

Wajda followed it with &quot;Sweet Rush&quot; (2009) with Krystyna Janda as a main character. It is partly based upon a short Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz novel. The film is dedicated to Edward Kłosiński, Janda&#x27;s husband, a cinematographer and a long-time Wajda friend and co-worker who died of cancer the same year. For this film Wajda was awarded by Alfred Bauer Prize at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. He received the Prix FIPRESCI during the 2009 European Film Awards. &quot;Walesa. Man of Hope&quot; (&quot;Wałęsa. Człowiek z nadziei&quot;), Wajda&#x27;s biography of Lech Wałęsa, based on a script by Janusz Głowacki and starring Robert Więckiewicz in the title role, had its world premiere at the 2013 Venice International Film Festival. His last film was the 2016 &quot;Afterimage&quot; (&quot;Powidoki&quot;), starring Bogusław Linda as Polish avant-garde painter Władysław Strzemiński.

Wajda founded The Japanese Centre of Art and Technology in Kraków in 1994. In 2002, he founded and led his own film school with Polish filmmaker Wojciech Marczewski. Students of Wajda School take part in different film courses led by famous European film makers.

==Personal life and death==
Wajda was married four times. His third wife was actress Beata Tyszkiewicz with whom he had a daughter, Karolina (born 1967). His fourth wife was the theatre costume designer and actress Krystyna Zachwatowicz.

In September 2009, Wajda called for the release of director Roman Polanski after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

Wajda died in Warsaw on 9 October 2016 at the age of 90 from pulmonary failure. He was buried at Salwator Cemetery in Kraków.

<text>Marcus Aurelius Claudius &quot;Gothicus&quot; (10 May 214 – August/September 270), also known as Claudius II, was Roman emperor from 268 to 270. During his reign he fought successfully against the Alemanni and decisively defeated the Goths at the Battle of Naissus. He died after succumbing to a &quot;pestilence&quot;, possibly the Plague of Cyprian that had ravaged the provinces of the Empire.

== Early life and origin ==
The most significant source for Claudius II (and the only one regarding his early life) is the collection of imperial biographies called the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;. However, his story, like the rest of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, is riddled with fabrications and obsequious praises. In 4th century, Claudius was declared a relative of Constantine the Great&#x27;s father, Constantius Chlorus, and, consequently, of the ruling dynasty. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; should be used with extreme caution and supplemented with information from other sources: the works of Aurelius Victor, Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Orosius, Joannes Zonaras, and Zosimus, as well as coins and inscriptions.

The future emperor Marcus Aurelius Claudius was born on 10 May 214. Some researchers suggest a later date of 219 or 220. Nevertheless, most historians adhere to the first version. Moreover, as the 6th century Byzantine historian John Malalas reports, at the time of his death Claudius was 56 years old. The birthplace of Claudius is unknown. He might have been born somewhere near the Danube.

According to the fourth-century &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;, he was thought to be a bastard son of Gordian II, although this is doubted by some historians.

The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; refers to him as a member of the &quot;gens Flavia&quot;, likely an attempt to further connect him with the future emperor Flavius Valerius Constantius.

== Rise to power ==

Before coming to power, Claudius served with the Roman army, where he had a successful career and secured appointments to the highest military posts. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; says that he was a military tribune in the reign of Decius (249–251). The same source describes his being sent to defend Thermopylae, in connection with which the governor of Achaea was ordered to supply him with soldiers. However, there is no evidence that the Goths who invaded at that time threatened the region, since their activities did not extend beyond the middle Balkans. Most likely the account in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is an anachronism, since it is known that the garrison at Thermopylae appeared in 254. Historian François Pashau suggests that this passage was invented in order to contrast the successful pagan commander Claudius with the unlucky Christian generals who allowed the ruin of Greece by the Gothic leader Alaric I in 396. In addition, Trebellius Pollio reveals that Decius rewarded Claudius after he demonstrated his strength while fighting another soldier at the Games of Mars.

His troops then proclaimed him emperor amid charges, never proven, that he murdered his predecessor Gallienus. However, he soon showed himself to be less than bloodthirsty, as he asked the Roman Senate to spare the lives of Gallienus&#x27;s family and supporters. He was less magnanimous toward Rome&#x27;s enemies and it was to this that he owed his popularity.

It is possible Claudius gained his position and the respect of the soldiers by being physically strong and especially cruel. A legend tells of Claudius knocking out a horse&#x27;s teeth with one punch. When Claudius performed as a wrestler in the 250s, he supposedly knocked out the teeth of his opponent when his genitalia had been grabbed in the match.

Claudius, like Maximinus Thrax before him, was of barbarian birth. After a period of failed aristocratic Roman emperors following Maximinus&#x27;s death, Claudius was the first in a series of tough &quot;soldier emperors&quot; who would eventually restore the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century.

=== Downfall of Gallienus ===

During the 260s, the breakup of the Roman Empire into three distinct governing entities (the core Roman Empire, the Gallic Empire and the Palmyrene Empire) placed the whole Roman imperium in a precarious position. Gallienus was seriously weakened by his failure to defeat Postumus in the West, and his acceptance of Odaenathus ruling a de facto independent kingdom within the Roman Empire in the East. By 268, this situation had changed, as Odaenathus was assassinated, most likely due to court intrigue, and Gallienus fell victim to a mutiny in his own ranks. Upon the death of Odaenathus, power fell to his younger son, who was dominated by his mother, Zenobia.

Under threat of invasion in the Balkans by multiple Germanic tribes, Gallienus&#x27;s troubles primarily lay with Postumus, whom he could not attack because his attention was required in dealing with an insurrection led by Macrianus and the threats created by the invading Scythians. After four years of delay, Postumus had established some control over the Empire. In 265, when Gallienus and his men crossed the Alps, they defeated and besieged Postumus in an (unnamed) Gallic city. When victory appeared to be near, Gallienus made the mistake of approaching the city walls too closely and was gravely injured, compelling him to cease his campaign against Postumus. Over the next three years, Gallienus&#x27;s troubles only got worse. The Scythians successfully invaded the Balkans in the early months of 268, and Aureolus, a commander of the Roman cavalry based in Milan, declared himself an ally of Postumus and went so far as to claim the imperial throne for himself.

At this time, another invasion was taking place. In 268, a tribe or grouping called the Herulians moved through Asia Minor and then into Greece on a naval expedition. Despite this, scholars assume Gallienus&#x27;s efforts were focused on Aureolus, the officer who betrayed him, and the defeat of the Herulians was left to his successor, Claudius Gothicus.

The death of Gallienus was surrounded by conspiracy and betrayal, as were many emperors&#x27; deaths. Different accounts of the incident have been recorded, but they agree that senior officials wanted Gallienus dead. According to two accounts, the prime conspirator was Aurelius Heraclianus, the Praetorian Prefect. One version of the story tells of Heraclianus bringing Claudius into the plot while the account given by the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; exculpates the soon-to-be emperor and adds the prominent general Lucius Aurelius Marcianus into the plot. The removal of Claudius from the conspiracy may be due to his later role as the progenitor of the house of Constantine, a fiction of Constantine&#x27;s time, and suggests that the original version from which these two accounts derive was current prior to the reign of Constantine. It was written that while sitting down at dinner, Gallienus was told that Aureolus and his men were approaching the camp. Gallienus rushed to the front lines, ready to give orders, when he was struck down by a commander of his cavalry. In a different and more controversial account, Aureolus forges a document in which Gallienus appears to be plotting against his generals and makes sure it falls into the hands of the emperor&#x27;s senior staff. In this plot, Aurelian is added as a possible conspirator. The tale of his involvement in the conspiracy might be seen as at least partial justification for the murder of Aurelian himself under circumstances that seem remarkably similar to those in this story.

Whichever story is true, Gallienus was killed in the summer of 268, probably between July and October, and Claudius was chosen by the army outside of Milan to succeed him. Accounts tell of people hearing the news of the new emperor, and reacting by murdering Gallienus&#x27;s family members until Claudius declared he would respect the memory of his predecessor. Claudius had the deceased emperor deified and buried in a family tomb on the Appian Way. The traitor Aureolus was not treated with the same reverence, as he was killed by his besiegers after a failed attempt to surrender.

== Reign ==
At the time of Claudius&#x27;s accession, the Roman Empire was in serious danger from several incursions, both inside and outside its borders. The most pressing of these was an invasion of Illyricum and Pannonia by the Goths. Although Gallienus had already inflicted some damage on them at the Battle of Nestus, Claudius, not long after being named emperor, followed this up by winning his greatest victory, and one of the greatest in the history of Roman arms.

At the Battle of Naissus, Claudius and his legions routed a huge Gothic army. Together with his cavalry commander, the future Emperor Aurelian, the Romans took thousands of prisoners and destroyed the Gothic cavalry as a force. The victory earned Claudius his surname of &quot;Gothicus&quot; (conqueror of the Goths). The Goths were soon driven back across the Danube by Aurelian, and nearly a century passed before they again posed a serious threat to the empire.

Around the same time, the Alamanni had crossed the Alps and attacked the empire. Claudius responded quickly, routing the Alamanni at the Battle of Lake Benacus in the late fall of 268, a few months after the Battle of Naissus. For this he was awarded the title of &quot;Germanicus Maximus.&quot; He then turned on the Gallic Empire, ruled by a pretender for the past eight years and encompassing Britain, Gaul, and the Iberian Peninsula. He won several victories and soon regained control of Hispania and the Rhone river valley of Gaul. This set the stage for the later destruction of the Gallic Empire under Aurelian.

=== Government and foreign affairs ===

Claudius was not the only man to reap the benefits of holding high office after the death of Gallienus. Before the rule of Claudius Gothicus, there had only been two emperors from the Balkans, but afterwards there would only be one emperor who did not hail from the provinces of Pannonia, Moesia or Illyricum until 378, when Theodosius I from Hispania would take the throne. Four inscriptions provide an insight into the government at the time. The first is a dedication to Aurelius Heraclianus, the prefect involved in the conspiracy against Gallienus, from Traianus Mucianus, who also gave a dedication to Heraclianus&#x27;s brother, Aurelius Appollinaris, who was the equestrian governor of the province of Thracia in 267–68 AD. Because these men shared the family name, Marcus Aurelius, a name given to those made citizens by the constitutio Antoniniana, these men did not come from the imperial &quot;élite&quot;. The third inscription reveals the career of Marcianus, another leading general by the time that Gallienus died. The fourth honours Julius Placidianus, the prefect of the vigiles. Heraclianus, Appollinaris, Placidianus, or Marcianus may not have been of Danubian origin themselves, but none of them were members of the Severan aristocracy, and all of them appear to owe their prominence to their military roles. Marcus Aurelius Probus (another emperor in waiting) was also of Balkan background, and from a family enfranchised in the time of Caracalla.

Although their influence was weakened, there were still a number of men with influence from the older aristocracy. Claudius assumed the consulship in 269 with Paternus, a member of the prominent senatorial family, the Paterni, who had supplied consuls and urban prefects throughout Gallienus&#x27;s reign, and thus were quite influential. In addition, Flavius Antiochianus, one of the consuls of 270, who was an urban prefect the year before, would continue to hold his office for the following year. A colleague of Antiochianus, Virius Orfitus, also the descendant of a powerful family, would continue to hold influence during his father&#x27;s term as prefect. Aurelian&#x27;s colleague as consul was another such man, Pomponius Bassus, a member of one of the oldest senatorial families, as was one of the consuls in 272, Junius Veldumnianus.

In his first full year of power, Claudius was greatly assisted by the sudden destruction of the imperium Galliarum. When Ulpius Cornelius Laelianus, a high official under Postumus, declared himself emperor in Germania Superior, in the spring of 269, Postumus defeated him, but in doing so, refused to allow the sack of Mainz, which had served as Laelianus&#x27;s headquarters. This proved to be his downfall, for out of anger, Postumus&#x27;s army mutinied and murdered him. Selected by the troops, Marcus Aurelius Marius was to replace Postumus as ruler. Marius&#x27;s rule did not last long though, as Victorinus, Postumus&#x27;s praetorian prefect, defeated him. Now emperor of the Gauls, Victorinus was soon in a precarious position, for the Spanish provinces had deserted the Gallic Empire and declared their loyalty to Claudius, while in southern Gaul, Placidianus had captured Grenoble. Luckily, it was there that Placidianus stopped and Victorinus&#x27;s position stabilized. In the next year, when Autun revolted, declaring itself for Claudius, the central government made no moves to support it. As a result, the city went through a siege, lasting many weeks, until it was finally captured and sacked by Victorinus.

It is still unknown why Claudius did nothing to help the city of Autun, but sources tell us his relations with Palmyra were waning in the course of 269. An obscure passage in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;″s life of Gallienus states that he had sent an army under Aurelius Heraclianus to the region that had been annihilated by Zenobia. But because Heraclianus was not actually in the east in 268 (instead, at this time, he was involved in the conspiracy of Gallienus&#x27;s death), this cannot be correct. But the confusion evident in this passage, which also places the bulk of Scythian activity during 269 a year earlier, under Gallienus, may stem from a later effort to pile all possible disasters in this year into the reign of the former emperor. This would keep Claudius&#x27;s record of being an ancestor of Constantine from being tainted. If this understanding of the sources is correct, it might also be correct to see the expedition of Heraclianus to the east as an event of Claudius&#x27;s time.

The victories of Claudius over the Goths would not only make him a hero in Latin tradition, but an admirable choice as an ancestor for Constantine I, who was born at Naissus, the site of Claudius&#x27;s victory in 269. Claudius is also held in high esteem by Zonaras, whose Greek tradition seems to have been influenced by Latin. For Zosimus, a more reasoned contemporary view shows Claudius as less grand. Claudius&#x27;s successes in the year 269 were not continued in his next year as emperor. As the Scythians starved in the mountains or surrendered, the legions pursuing them began to see an epidemic spreading throughout the men. Also, Claudius&#x27;s unwillingness to do anything at the siege of Autun likely provoked a quarrel with Zenobia.

Although it is not proven that the invasion of Gaul was the breaking point between Claudius and Zenobia, the sequence of events point to the siege as an important factor. The issue at hand was the position that Odaenathus held as &quot;corrector totius orientis&quot; (imparting overall command of the Roman armies and authority over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region). Vaballathus, the son of Zenobia, was given this title when Zenobia claimed it for him. From then on, tension between the two empires would only get worse. Aurelius Heraclianus&#x27;s fabled arrival might have been an effort to reassert central control after the death of Odaenathus, but, if so, it failed. Although coins were never minted with the face of Odaenathus, soon after his death coins were made with image of his son – outstripping his authority under the emperor.

Under Zabdas, a Palmyrene army invaded Arabia and moved into Egypt in the late summer. At this time, the prefect of Egypt was Tenagino Probus, described as an able soldier who not only defeated an invasion of Cyrenaica by the nomadic tribes to the south in 269, but also was successful in hunting down Scythian ships in the Mediterranean. However, he did not see the same success in Egypt, for a group allied to the Palmyrene empire, led by Timagenes, undermined Probus, defeated his army, and killed him in a battle near the modern city of Cairo in the late summer of 270.

Generally, when a Roman commander is killed it is taken as a sign that a state of war is in existence, and if we can associate the death of Heraclianus in 270, as well as an inscription from Bostra recording the rebuilding of a temple destroyed by the Palmyrene army, then these violent acts could be interpreted the same way. Yet they apparently were not. As David Potter writes, &quot;The coins of Vaballathus avoid claims to imperial power: he remains vir consularis, rex, imperator, dux Romanorum, a range of titles that did not mimic those of the central government. The status vir consularis was, as we have seen, conferred upon Odaenathus; the title rex, or king, is simply a Latin translation of mlk, or king; imperator in this context simply means &quot;victorious general&quot;; and dux Romanorum looks like yet another version of corrector totius orientis&quot; (Potter, 263). These titles suggest that Odaenathus&#x27;s position was inheritable. In Roman culture, the status gained in procuring a position could be passed on, but not the position itself. It is possible that the thin line between office and the status that accompanied it were dismissed in the Palmyrene court, especially when the circumstance worked against the interests of a regime that was able to defeat Persia, which a number of Roman emperors had failed to do. Vaballathus stressed the meanings of titles, because in the Palmyrene context, the titles of Odaenathus meant a great deal. When the summer of 270 ended, things were looking very different in the empire than they did a year before. After its success, Gaul was in a state of inactivity and the empire was failing in the east. Insufficient resources plagued the state, as a great deal of silver was used for the antoninianus, which was again diluted.

=== Death ===
Claudius did not live long enough to fulfil his goal of reuniting all the lost territories of the empire. Late in 269 he had travelled to Sirmium and was preparing to go to war against the Vandals, who were raiding in Pannonia. However, he fell victim to the Plague of Cyprian (possibly smallpox), and died early in 270. Before his death, he is thought to have named Aurelian as his successor, though Claudius&#x27;s brother Quintillus briefly seized power. The Senate immediately deified Claudius as &quot;Divus Claudius Gothicus&quot;.

Historians date Claudius&#x27;s death in either January, April, August, or September. These discrepancies are the result of the various conflicting sources. The &quot;Chronograph of 354&quot; gives Claudius a reign of &quot;1 year and 4 months&quot;, Jerome and Aurelius Victor both give &quot;1 year and 9 months&quot;. Some Alexandrian coins have been dated to his third year, suggesting that he died in September 270 (the Coptic calendar began on 29 August). Arthur Stein dated Claudius&#x27; death to April, citing a document of Aurelian that he dated to 25 May 270. However, modern scholars believe this document to be dated to 271. The date is strangely given as the &quot;3rd&quot; and &quot;1st year&quot;, which most likely refers to the third year of Claudius and first of Aurelian (who dated his reign from Claudius&#x27; death). The last confirmed document is dated to 20 September 270, although another undated papyri could be tentatively dated to October.

== Religion ==
A short history of imperial Rome, entitled &quot;De Caesaribus&quot;, written by Aurelius Victor in 361, states that Claudius consulted the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; prior to his campaigns against the Goths. Hinting that Claudius &quot;revived the tradition of the Decii&quot;, Victor illustrates the senatorial view, which saw Claudius&#x27;s predecessor, Gallienus, as too relaxed when it came to religious policies.

== Links to the Constantinian dynasty ==
The unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia, who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to Constantius Chlorus. The same source also gives Claudius the nomina &quot;Flavius Valerius&quot; to strengthen his connection to Constantius. Zonaras and Eutropius on the other hand claim Chlorus was Claudia&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s son. Historians suspect these accounts to be a genealogical fabrication intended to link the family of Constantine I to that of a well-respected emperor.

== Saint Valentine ==
Claudius Gothicus has been linked to Saint Valentine since the Middle Ages. Contemporary records of his deeds were most probably destroyed during the Diocletianic Persecution in early 4th century and a tale of martyrdom was recorded in &quot;Passio Marii et Marthae&quot;, a work published in the 5th or 6th century. 20th-century historians agree that the accounts from this period cannot be verified. The legend refers to &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot;, but Claudius I did not persecute Christians (minus the one mention by Suetonius of Jewish followers of &quot;Chrestus&quot; being expelled from Rome; &quot;see&quot; Suetonius on Christians), so people believe he was Claudius II even though this emperor spent most of his time warring outside his territory.

The legend was retold in later texts, and in the &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; of 1493, involved the Roman priest being martyred during a general persecution of Christians. The text states that St. Valentine was beaten with clubs and finally beheaded for giving aid to Christians in Rome. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of 1260 recounts how St. Valentine refused to deny Christ before the &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot; in 270 and as a result was beheaded. Since then, February 14 marks Valentine&#x27;s Day, a day set aside by the Christian church in memory of the Roman priest and physician.

<text>The Defenestrations of Prague (, , ) were three incidents in the history of Bohemia in which people were defenestrated (thrown out of a window). Though already existing in Middle French, the word &quot;defenestrate&quot; is believed to have first been used in English in reference to the episodes in Prague in 1618 when the disgruntled Protestant estates threw two royal governors and their secretary out of a window of the Hradčany Castle and wrote an extensive apologia explaining their action. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, defenestration was not uncommon—the act carried elements of lynching and mob violence in the form of murder committed together. 

The first governmental defenestration occurred in 1419, the second in 1483 and the third in 1618, although the term &quot;Defenestration of Prague&quot; more commonly refers to the third. Often, however, the 1483 event is not recognized as a &quot;significant defenestration&quot;, which leads to some ambiguity when the 1618 defenestration is referred to as the &quot;second Prague defenestration&quot;. The first and third defenestrations helped to trigger a prolonged religious conflict inside Bohemia (the Hussite Wars, 1st defenestration) or beyond (Thirty Years&#x27; War, 3rd defenestration), while the second helped establish a religious peace in the country for 31 years (Peace of Kutná Hora, 2nd defenestration).

==1419 Defenestration of Prague==
The First Defenestration of Prague involved the killing of several members of the city council by a crowd of Czech Hussites on 30 July 1419.

Jan Želivský, a Hussite priest at the church of the Virgin Mary of the Snows, led his congregation on a procession through the streets of Prague to the New Town Hall on Charles Square. The town council members had refused to exchange their Hussite prisoners. While they were marching, a stone was thrown at Želivský from the town hall and allegedly hit him. This enraged the mob and they stormed the town hall. Once inside the hall, the group defenestrated the judge, the burgomaster, and several members of the town council. They were all killed by the fall.

The procession was a result of the growing discontent at the contemporary direction of the Church and the inequality between the peasants, the Church&#x27;s prelates, and the nobility. This discontent combined with rising feelings of nationalism increased the influence of preachers such as Jan Želivský, influenced by John Wycliffe, who saw the state of the Catholic Church as corrupt.

The First Defenestration was thus the turning point between talk and action leading to the prolonged Hussite Wars. 

==1483 Defenestration of Prague==

This defenestration took place on 24 September 1483 during the storms of the Prague population during the reign of King Vladislaus II of Hungary. He was king of Bohemia at that time but he became the ruler of Moravia and Hungary only after Matthias Corvinus died in 1490. 

It was then that the party of the Communion under both kinds, fearing for their influence, carried out a violent coup in the Old and New towns and Lesser Town. The Old Town Burgomaster and the dead bodies of seven New Town councilors were defenestrated from the respective town halls. The coup in Prague contributed to the limitation of ruling power and prevented the resumption of pre-Hussite conditions. 

On October 6, 1483, three Prague municipalities signed a treaty on unity and common action, which brought the dominion of the Utraquism. The development then led to religious reconciliation and the declaration of equality of both churches at the Kutná Hora Assembly in 1485.

==1618 Defenestration of Prague==

This defenestration significantly influenced the history of Europe and led to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

=== Background ===
In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg had settled religious disputes in the Holy Roman Empire by enshrining the principle of &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;, allowing a prince to determine the religion of his subjects. The Kingdom of Bohemia since 1526 had been governed by Habsburg kings, who did not force their Catholic religion on their largely Protestant subjects. In 1609, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia (1576–1612), increased Protestant rights. He was increasingly viewed as unfit to govern, and other members of the Habsburg dynasty declared his younger brother, Matthias, to be family head in 1606. Matthias began to gradually wrest territory from Rudolf, beginning with Hungary. In 1609, to strengthen his hold on Bohemia, Rudolf issued the &quot;Letter of Majesty&quot;, which granted Bohemia&#x27;s largely Protestant estates the right to freely exercise their religion, essentially setting up a Protestant Bohemian state church controlled by the estates, &quot;dominated by the towns and rural nobility&quot;. Upon Rudolf&#x27;s death, Matthias succeeded in the rule of Bohemia (1612–1619) and extended his offer of more legal and religious concessions to Bohemia, relying mostly on the advice of his chancellor, Bishop Melchior Klesl.

Conflict was precipitated by two factors: Matthias, already aging, and without children, made his cousin, Ferdinand of Styria, his heir and had him elected king in 1617. Ferdinand was a proponent of the Catholic Counter-Reformation and not likely to be well-disposed to Protestantism or Bohemian freedoms. Bohemian Protestants opposed the royal government as they interpreted the Letter of Majesty to extend not only to the land controlled by the nobility or self-governing towns but also to the king&#x27;s own lands. Whereas Matthias and Klesl were prepared to appease these demands, Ferdinand was not; in 1618 he forced the Emperor to order the cessation of construction of some Protestant chapels on royal land. When the Bohemian estates protested against this order, Ferdinand had their assembly dissolved.

===Defenestration===

On 23 May 1618, four Catholic lords regent, Count Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice, Count Vilem Slavata of Chlum, Adam II von Sternberg (who was the supreme burgrave), and Matthew Leopold Popel Lobkowitz (who was the grand prior), arrived at the Bohemian Chancellery at 8:30 am. After preparing the meeting hall, members of the dissolved assembly of the three main Protestant estates gathered at 9:00 am, led by Count Thurn, who had been deprived of his post as castellan (burgrave) of Karlštejn Castle by the Emperor. The Protestant lords&#x27; agenda was to clarify whether the four regents present were responsible for persuading the Emperor to order the cessation of Protestant church construction on royal lands. According to the Count of Martinice himself:


Before the regents gave any answer, they requested that the Protestants give them the opportunity to confer with their superior, Adam von Waldstein, who was not present. If they were given the opportunity, the Protestants were to receive an official answer to their grievance by the next Friday (the encounter took place on the eve of Ascension Day, and they all had to observe the holy day). The Protestant lords, however, demanded an immediate answer. Two regents, Adam II von Sternberg and Matthew Leopold Popel Lobkowitz, were declared innocent by the Protestant Estate holders, deemed to be too pious to have any responsibility in the preparation of the Emperor&#x27;s letter. They were removed from the room; before leaving, Adam II von Sternberg made it clear that they &quot;did not advise anything that was contrary to the Letter of Majesty&quot;. This left Count Vilem Slavata of Chlum and Count Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice (who had replaced Thurn as castellan), both known Catholic hard-liners, and Philip Fabricius, the secretary to the regents. They eventually acknowledged responsibility for the letter and, presuming they would only be arrested, welcomed any punishment the Protestants had planned.

Count von Thurn turned to both Martinice and Slavata and said, &quot;You are enemies of us and of our religion, have desired to deprive us of our Letter of Majesty, have horribly plagued your Protestant subjects... and have tried to force them to adopt your religion against their wills or have had them expelled for this reason.&quot; Then to the crowd of Protestants, he continued, &quot;Were we to keep these men alive, then we would lose the Letter of Majesty and our religion... for there can be no justice to be gained from or by them&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the two regents and their secretary were defenestrated, but they survived the fall from the third floor. Catholics maintained the men were saved by angels or by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, who caught them; later Protestant pamphleteers asserted that they survived due to falling onto a dung heap, a story unknown to contemporaries and probably coined in response to divine intervention claims. Philip Fabricius was later ennobled by the Emperor and granted the title &quot;Baron von Hohenfall&quot; (literally &#x27;Baron of Highfall&#x27;).

===Aftermath===
Immediately after the defenestration, the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war. After the death of Matthias in 1619, Ferdinand II was elected Holy Roman Emperor. At the same time, the Bohemian estates deposed him as King of Bohemia and replaced him with Frederick V, Elector Palatine, a leading Calvinist and son-in-law of the Protestant James VI and I, King of Scotland, England and Ireland.

Because they had deposed a properly chosen king, who also happened to be emperor, the Protestants could not gather the international support they needed for war. Just two years after the defenestration, Ferdinand and the Catholics regained power in the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620. This became known as the first battle in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

There was plundering and pillaging in Prague for weeks following the battle. Several months later, twenty-seven nobles and citizens were tortured and executed in the Old Town Square. Twelve heads were impaled on iron hooks and hung from the Old Town Bridge Tower as a warning. This contributed to the resentment that gave rise to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Further defenestrations==
More events of defenestration have occurred in Prague during its history, but they are not usually called &quot;defenestrations of Prague&quot;.

Sometimes, the name &quot;the fourth&quot; or &quot;the third defenestration of Prague&quot; is used, although it has no standard meaning. For example, it has been used to describe the death of Jan Masaryk, who was found below the bathroom window of the building of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 10 March 1948. The official report listed the death as a suicide. However, it was widely believed he was murdered, either by the nascent communist government in which he served as a non-partisan foreign minister, or by the Soviet secret services. A Prague police report in 2004 concluded after forensic research that at least one other person was involved in Masaryk&#x27;s death. This report was seemingly corroborated in 2006 when a Russian journalist said that his mother knew the Russian intelligence officer who defenestrated Masaryk. However, a more recent investigation opened in 2019 again called those findings into question, with new research claiming that Masaryk fell not from the bathroom window, but from the adjacent exterior ledge. That investigation was shelved in 2021, with investigators citing a continuing lack of sufficient evidence to make conclusive determinations regarding the events of Masaryk&#x27;s death.

<doc id="44399" wikidata="Q152256" url="?curid=44399" title="Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Conrad II (, – 4 June 1039), also known as and , was the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four Salian emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad ruled the kingdoms of Germany (from 1024), Italy (from 1026) and Burgundy (from 1033).

The son of Franconian count Henry of Speyer (also Henry of Worms) and Adelaide of Metz of the &quot;Matfriding dynasty&quot;, that had ruled the Duchy of Lorraine from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of Speyer and Worms during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favour of the princes of the kingdom. When the imperial dynastic line was left without a successor after Emperor Henry II&#x27;s death in 1024, on 4 September an assembly of the imperial princes appointed the 34-year-old Conrad king (&quot;Rex romanorum&quot;).

Conrad II adopted many aspects of his Ottonian predecessor Henry II regarding the role and organisation of the Church as well as general rulership practices, which in turn had been associated with Charlemagne. While the emperor was not anti-monastic, he immediately abandoned the favouritism that had been shown to men of the Church under Henry II. In Italy, he initially relied on the bishops (mostly of German origin) to maintain imperial power. Beginning with his second Italian expedition in 1036, he changed his strategy and managed to win the support of the &quot;valvassores&quot; (lesser nobles) and the military elite, who challenged the power of the bishops. His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire. Upon the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Burgundy, conquered it with German and Italian troops, and incorporated it into the empire. The three kingdoms (Germany, Italy and Burgundy) formed the basis of the empire as the &quot;royal triad&quot; (&quot;regna tria&quot;).

==Early life==
===Family background===
The origins of the Salian dynasty can be traced back to Count Werner V of Worms, a Frankish nobleman from the Duchy of Franconia to the east of the Rhine. His son, Conrad the Red, succeeded him as Count in 941. King Otto I (the future Holy Roman Emperor) elevated him to Duke of Lorraine in 944. He subsequently married Liutgarde, one of Otto&#x27;s daughters, in 947 and rose to become one of the king&#x27;s closest allies. The relationship, however, deteriorated, when Otto refused to honour a peace treaty that Conrad, as Otto&#x27;s representative, had negotiated with Berengar II of Italy. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto&#x27;s brother Henry I of Bavaria, whom he regarded as a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king&#x27;s son Liudolf in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive Battle of Lechfeld in 955 that put an end to the Hungarian invasions into Europe. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son Otto of Worms, who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970, Otto of Worms&#x27; first son and Conrad II&#x27;s father Henry of Speyer was born, of whom only very little is known. He died at the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II&#x27;s mother was Adelaide of Metz. After Henry&#x27;s death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.

In 978 Emperor Otto II appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as Duke of Carinthia. He succeeded the rebellious Duke Henry I of Carinthia, who had been deposed after the War of the Three Henries. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop , emperor Otto II&#x27;s imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son Otto III succeeded him, with his mother Theophanu serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself &quot;Duke of Worms&quot; and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the March of Verona in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to Henry IV of Bavaria. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms&#x27; son Bruno as Pope Gregory V. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad&#x27;s grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as &quot;Henry II of Germany&quot;. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to Bishop Burchard of Worms, a long-time political rival.

After the early death of his uncle Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia, Conrad&#x27;s infant son, Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia the Younger, was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to Adalbero of Eppenstein due to Conrad the Younger&#x27;s infancy. Conrad the Younger was taken care of by his cousin Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor the Elder.

===Adulthood===
In 1016 Conrad married the twice-widowed duchess Gisela of Swabia, daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia who, in 1002, had unsuccessfully claimed the German throne upon Emperor Otto III&#x27;s death, and had lost the election to Emperor Henry II. Gisela had first been married to Count Bruno I of Brunswick the same year. Following Bruno&#x27;s death around 1010, Gisela married Ernest I of the House of Babenberg. Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the Duchy of Swabia upon the death of Gisela&#x27;s brother Duke Herman III of Swabia in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: Ernest II and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela&#x27;s new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of Archbishop Poppo of Trier in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial House of Otto and the Salian family.

Conrad II&#x27;s hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, Gerberga of Burgundy, was the daughter of reigning Burgundian king Conrad and granddaughter of the late Frankish king Louis IV. Gisela also claimed descent from Charlemagne through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of King Henry I – Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to canon law, marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad&#x27;s marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and Emperor Henry II relied on this violation of canon law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor Henry III, on 28 October 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II eventually reconciled and he returned to Germany.

==Reign as king==
===Royal election===
Emperor Henry II died childless in 1024, bringing an end to the Ottonian dynasty that had ruled Germany since 919. Without a clear successor to the German throne, Henry&#x27;s widow Cunigunde of Luxembourg ruled as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers Bishop Dietrich I of Metz and Duke Henry V of Bavaria. Archbishop Aribo of Mainz, the primate of Germany, also assisted Cunigunde.

On 4 September 1024, the German princes gathered at Kamba, a historical name for an area on the east banks of the Rhine opposite the modern German town of Oppenheim. Now the location of &quot;Kamba&quot; is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad&#x27;s chaplain, Wipo of Burgundy, attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin Conrad. Both were descendants of Emperor Otto I by their common grandfather Otto of Worms, son of Liutgarde, one of Otto&#x27;s daughters. Although further members of the Ottonian dynasty existed, none were seriously considered eligible. The Duchy of Saxony adopted a neutral strategy while the Duchy of Lorraine favoured the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favoured the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well. Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne, Duke Gothelo I of Lower Lorraine and Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine did not support him.

Conrad was crowned king of Germany by Archbishop Aribo in Mainz Cathedral on 8 September 1024 at the age of 34. To mark his election, Conrad commissioned the construction of Speyer Cathedral, near his ancestral home of Worms. Construction began in 1030. Archbishop Aribo, as archbishop of Mainz, was already the chancellor of Germany. Conrad wanted to reward the archbishop for his electoral support, so he made Aribo chancellor of Italy as well, making Aribo the second most powerful man in the Holy Roman Empire as the imperial chancellor.

Aribo refused to crown Conrad&#x27;s wife Gisela as queen as their marriage violated canon law. Conrad refused to accept Archbishop Aribo&#x27;s position. Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne saw the situation as an opportunity to restore his relationship with the king, after refusing to support Conrad&#x27;s election, and he crowned Gisela queen on 21 September 1024. The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.

===Early reign===
Conrad inherited a kingdom troubled by problems. The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At Augsburg Conrad received the support of Bishop Bruno and at Strasbourg he acquired the support of Bishop Werner. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to high office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at Aachen, where he, as a successor of the empire&#x27;s founder Charlemagne, announced that he would continue the tradition of claiming East Francia. The princes of the Duchy of Lorraine rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting abbesses Adelaide I of Quedlinburg and Sophia I of Gandersheim, daughters of Emperor Otto II. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind him. During Christmas at Minden, the Saxon nobles, led by Duke Bernard II, officially recognized him as sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honour the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the Duchy of Swabia, celebrating Easter at Augsburg and then proceeded on to the Duchy of Bavaria, spending the feast of Pentecost at Regensburg. The royal couple finally visited Zürich, where after ten months they ended their tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that, in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced the childless Burgundian King Rudolph III to name him as his heir.

Conrad needed to address the longstanding &quot;Gandersheim Conflict&quot;, as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controlled Gandersheim Abbey and its estates dated back to the reign of Emperor Otto III. Both the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Hildesheim claimed authority over the Abbey, including the right to invest and anoint the abbey&#x27;s nuns. Though Otto III had once eased tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. Archbishop Aribo of Mainz, the new Primate of Germany, counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a synod at Frankfurt to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim renounced his claims in favour of Aribo.

During his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin Conrad the Younger engaged in an argument, that, although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad&#x27;s demands of yet-unpaid compensation that Conrad II had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. The lack of conflict between them after September 1027 suggests that they reconciled by then.

===Unrest in Italy===
In Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from Northern Italy, led by Archbishop Aribert of Milan, crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad King. However, the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of Henry II. Amidst occasional riots, many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the Kingdom of Italy from the Holy Roman Empire. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish ultramontan protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not Conrad&#x27;s as a matter of right. The Lombard cities wanted to elect a king from the ranks of their own magnates, and when this motion failed, they tried to invite a prince from Aquitaine or other French realms. They offered the Italian crown to the Capetian king Robert II of France and his son Hugh Magnus. After the offer was rejected, they approached Duke William V of Aquitaine, who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected it as well.

When the news of Henry&#x27;s death spread, the citizens of Pavia revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, built during the 5th century. Though Pavia was no longer the seat of imperial administration in Italy since the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been perceived as a symbol of imperial authority in Italy and its mere presence within the city walls had been deemed intolerable. Pavia had—thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France—become an important commercial centre. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control. Schutz notes that Pavia disliked the financial burden they had to bear whenever the monarchs came to the citadel. The bishops protested the separatist movement though, as they fared better under imperial protection than under local princes.

In the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from Pavia travelled north to meet Conrad and asked for severance from the Empire. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his &quot;Constitutio de feudis&quot; (&quot;Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom&quot;) of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy. Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to Salian rule.

In February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armoured knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both Archbishop Aribo of Mainz and Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne. Conrad&#x27;s army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in Milan and was crowned with the Iron Crown of the Lombards by Archbishop Aribert of Milan as King of the Lombards. From Milan, Conrad travelled to Vercelli, where he celebrated Easter with the aged Bishop Leo of Vercelli, who had been a chief advisor to the late Emperor Otto III. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the Salian dynasty in Italy. With Conrad&#x27;s assistance, Aribert rose to the highest-ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad led his army to Ravenna, but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the Po Valley and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated Christmas at Ivrea. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad&#x27;s reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when Abbot Odilo of Cluny brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.

==Reign as emperor==
===Imperial coronation===
On 26 March 1027, Pope John XIX crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as emperor and empress, respectively, in Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad&#x27;s son and heir Henry; Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway; Rudolph III of Burgundy and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan and Ravenna. Rudolph of Burgundy&#x27;s attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the Holy Roman Empire. During the festivities, a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favour of Milan. Subsequently, Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive homage from the Southern Italian principalities of Capua and Salerno and the Duchy of Benevento.

After his coronation, Conrad issued decrees reorganising the monasteries and dioceses of Italy, with the explicit objective of bringing the Patriarchate of Venice under imperial control (see the &quot;Schism of the Three Chapters&quot;). On 6 April 1027, at a synod held in the Lateran Basilica with Pope John XIX, the emperor addressed the matter by declaring the Patriarchate of Aquileia superior to the Patriarchate of Grado, an ally of the Byzantine Empire. The Aquileian Poppo had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who had appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad&#x27;s action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo&#x27;s authority, securing Poppo&#x27;s loyalty by making him the Emperor&#x27;s top official in northern Italy. The synod also limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice&#x27;s privileged trading status.

In May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of Duke Henry V of Bavaria at Regensburg. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new Duke of Bavaria. He made the unprecedented decision of choosing his 10-year-old son Henry, ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.

The young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry&#x27;s appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and decreed that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the dowager empress Cunigunde of Luxembourg was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde&#x27;s &quot;wittum&quot; (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.

===Uprising in Swabia===
In 1025, Duke Ernest II of Swabia, Conrad&#x27;s stepson from his marriage to Gisela of Swabia, rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf II of Swabia continued. Conrad had named Bishop Bruno of Augsburg regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy. When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, however, he joined the rebels.

In 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at Augsburg, calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at Worms on 9 September 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at Giebichenstein Castle in Saxony. Gisela supported Conrad against her son but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother&#x27;s intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.

In 1028, after Conrad&#x27;s son Henry was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest&#x27;s behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore to Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor&#x27;s enemies there. Ernest&#x27;s refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him excommunicated. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to Falkenstein Castle, south of modern Schramberg in the Black Forest, were killed in a battle against a contingent of the Bishop of Constance. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest&#x27;s younger brother Herman as a new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.

===Conflict with Adalbero===
Conrad had to enforce his royal prerogatives in the Duchy of Carinthia and the Duchy of Swabia. Duke Adalbero of Carinthia had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad&#x27;s election as German king in 1024. At a synod in Frankfurt in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades-long &quot;Gandersheim Conflict&quot;. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad&#x27;s trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his duchy as an independent state.

In particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with King Stephen I of the Hungary. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry&#x27;s death in 1024, Stephen I adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero&#x27;s domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.

Conrad summoned Adalbero to court at Bamberg on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of treason for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes demurred and demanded that Conrad&#x27;s son Henry, Germany&#x27;s co-king and Conrad&#x27;s designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero&#x27;s deposition. Henry&#x27;s support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to exile. After attacking Conrad&#x27;s allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother&#x27;s estates in Ebersberg in the Duchy of Bavaria, where he remained until his death in 1039. The ducal seat of Carinthia remained unoccupied until 2 February 1035, when Conrad named his cousin Conrad the Younger as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).

Control of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the Ottonian dynasty, centralizing the Emperor&#x27;s authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favouring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as &quot;public enemies&quot; to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with Ernest II of Swabia and Adalbero. The nobles saw the use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favour of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.

===Policy towards the Church===
Conrad continued the Ottonian dynasty&#x27;s imperial church system—a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favoured Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire&#x27;s most important offices. Claiming &quot;divine right&quot; to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as protectors of the church and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials. In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles. As such, the Church officials reported exclusively to the Emperor, acting as his personal vassals. As the Emperor&#x27;s vassals, the Church officials were subject to the provision of two services: the &quot;servitium regis&quot; (royal service) and &quot;servitium militum&quot; (military service). Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperor&#x27;s army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.

In his biography of Conrad, the chronicler Wipo of Burgundy stated the promotion of the Church was of little value to the Emperor. Conrad and the other members of the Salian dynasty had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: Limburg Abbey which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025. The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five synods during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad&#x27;s decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife Gisela of Swabia. When Archbishop Aribo of Mainz, Primate of Germany, died in 1031, Conrad considered both Abbot Bardo of Hersfeld Abbey and the renowned theologian Wazo of Liège, then serving as the dean of the cathedral chapter for the Bishop of Liege. Though Conrad favoured Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.

===Relations with Poland===
====War with Mieszko Lambert====

Duke Bolesław I of Poland of the Piast dynasty repeatedly clashed with Emperor Henry II during the German–Polish Wars of 1002 to 1018. In January 1018, Henry II and Bolesław I signed the peace treaty of Bautzen, that settled the permanent coexistence of the Empire and Poland as Bolesław recognized Henry II as his nominal feudal lord. In return, Henry II generously invested Bolesław with territories on the Empire&#x27;s eastern border. In order to reinforce his dynastic bonds with the German nobility, Bolesław, a widower, married Oda of Meissen, daughter of the Saxon margrave Eckard I of Meissen. The Empire and Poland enjoyed peace for the remainder of Henry&#x27;s reign. However, Bolesław then seized the opportunity presented by Henry&#x27;s death in 1024 and the subsequent interregnum to consolidate his own power, crowning himself King on Easter, 25 April 1025. Bolesław was thus the first Polish king, as his predecessors only held the ducal title of the political entity, called Civitas Schinesghe at the time, that had only a few decades ago revealed itself to the world and the Holy See in Rome. Bolesław died within two months of his coronation, most likely due to an illness. His son, Mieszko II Lambert, succeeded him as King, crowned on Christmas, 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother Bezprym and his younger brother Otto Bolesławowic. Otto went west to seek Conrad II&#x27;s protection.

Conrad considered the assumption of the title &quot;king&quot; by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before dealing with Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to consolidate imperial authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, Duke Ernest II of Swabia, Conrad the Younger and Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine rebelled against his authority.

The rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted, promising to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could deploy his forces. In preparation for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with King Cnut of England and Denmark (whose kingdom lay beyond the Empire&#x27;s northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad at his imperial coronation in 1027, and Conrad granted Cnut authority over the March of Schleswig, the land bridge between Denmark and Germany.

Fearing the possibility of a joint German-Danish attack, in 1028 Mieszko took the initiative and invaded Lusatia in the eastern Empire and occupied the territories of the Lutician Federation, where West Slavic Polabian tribes had settled and represented the majority of the population since the 10th century after centuries of steady immigration. Slavs had long been the targets of imperial military campaigns, particularly for the punishment and subjugation of pagan tribes. Emperor Otto I&#x27;s lieutenants, Herman Billung and Gero, harassed Slavic settlers beginning in the 940s. As part of the Slavic revolt of 983, the Lutici rebelled against the Empire. In the ensuing war (983–995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the Billung March and Northern March from the Empire. Though Emperor Otto III allied with Duke Bolesław I of Poland to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III&#x27;s death ended the friendly relationship between Poland and the Empire. Instead, Bolesław competed with Otto III&#x27;s successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the Peace of Bautzen in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to retain the Margraviate of Meissen. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only kept the March of Lusatia. Mieszko&#x27;s 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad&#x27;s protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.

Conrad, seeking to relieve pressure on the Lutici, counter-invaded Poland in 1029 and besieged Bautzen in the Margraviate of Meissen. However, faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev, who captured Red Ruthenia, on Poland&#x27;s eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad again besieged Bautzen. Mieszko was crushed by the Holy Roman and Kievan invaders and his exiled brother Bezprym&#x27;s rebellion. He surrendered to Conrad in the fall of 1031. The Treaty of Merseburg provided that Mieszko return the Margraviate of Meissen and the March of Lusatia to the Empire.

====Treaty of Merseburg====
Soon after Mieszko had concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by Bezprym, who had been in exile in the Kievan Rus&#x27; since 1025. Bezprym, with Conrad&#x27;s approval, had persuaded the Kievan Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise to invade Poland and install Bezprym as sovereign. Mieszko fled to Bohemia where he was imprisoned and castrated by Duke Oldřich in retribution for Mieszko&#x27;s father Bolesław&#x27;s blinding of Duke Boleslaus III, Oldřich&#x27;s brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the Polish regalia to Conrad, officially renouncing the title &quot;king&quot; in favour of the traditional title &quot;duke&quot; and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland. The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II&#x27;s wife, Richeza of Lotharingia.

Bezprym&#x27;s reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother Otto Bolesławowic to conspire against him. Bezprym&#x27;s own men murdered him in the spring of 1032, which created a power vacuum in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a diet at Merseburg in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad&#x27;s wife, Empress Gisela of Swabia, interceded on Mieszko&#x27;s behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the Treaty of Merseburg, Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto and Detric, another half-brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title of Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. Now that the Empire had a strong central leader, the treaty significantly increased the Empire&#x27;s influence over Poland.

The regulation was short-lived as in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took over his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym&#x27;s renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a Pagan reaction in Poland erupted. Subsequently, his wife Richeza and son Casimir I fled to the Empire.

The Duchy of Bohemia was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the German–Polish Wars, that lasted from 1002 to 1018. Emperor Henry II installed Jaromír as Duke of Bohemia and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromír ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of Moravia, Silesia, Lesser Poland and Lusatia. In 1012, Jaromír was deposed by his brother Oldřich, who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldřich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when the Polish king Mieszko II surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldřich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko&#x27;s father, Bolesław I of Poland, inflicted upon Duke Boleslaus III, Oldřich&#x27;s brother, thirty years before.

Poland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko&#x27;s exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the Treaty of Merseburg which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldřich to appear at the assembly, but Oldřich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor; Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundian throne, charged his son Duke Henry of Bavaria with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry&#x27;s march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, as Henry deposed Oldřich and restored his brother Jaromír to the Bohemian throne. Oldřich&#x27;s son Bretislaus I was appointed as Count of Moravia. Oldřich himself was imprisoned in Bavaria, but in 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia. Oldřich deposed and blinded Jaromír, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son Bretislaus. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is assumed Bretislaus had supported Jaromír over his father. However, Oldřich died suddenly on 9 November 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromír was offered the throne, he declined in favour of his nephew. Bretislaus was then confirmed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad II.

====Hungary====
With emperor Otto III&#x27;s approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian king of Hungary on Christmas Day, 1000. Otto III&#x27;s successor, Emperor Henry II, was Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law by Stephen&#x27;s marriage to Henry&#x27;s sister Gisela, furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary. Under Conrad II, however, relations quickly turned hostile as Conrad pursued a more aggressive policy regarding eastern Europe. Conrad II expelled the Venetian doge Otto Orseolo, the husband of Stephen&#x27;s sister Grimelda of Hungary from Venice in 1026. Conrad also persuaded the Bavarians to accept his own infant son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen&#x27;s son, Emeric of Hungary, had a legitimate claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother.

Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. The bishop presented himself as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter the country in the autumn of 1027. Conrad&#x27;s biographer Wipo of Burgundy recorded that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common Imperial-Hungarian border in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries. In 1030, open conflict erupted. Conrad launched an invasion into Hungary but was forced to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used scorched earth tactics. Conrad departed to address the problem with his stepson Ernest II, the deposed Duke of Swabia, leaving matters in Hungary to his son Henry. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by bestowing titles to eastern Bavarian lands between the Lajta and Fischa rivers to the Hungarian nobility. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 to Henry&#x27;s own reign as Emperor in 1040.

===Conquest of Burgundy===
In 1016 King Rudolph III of Burgundy, ruler of the Kingdom of Burgundy, was left without a male heir, and so Henry II seized the opportunity and forced Rudolph to name him as successor. Henry II, the son of Rudolph&#x27;s sister Gisela of Burgundy, was his nephew and closest living male relative. However, Henry predeceased Rudolph in 1024. Soon, Henry&#x27;s successor Conrad II claimed to have acquired Henry&#x27;s rights to the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. Count Odo II of Blois, who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also claimed the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near Basel to settle the dispute. Henry II&#x27;s widowed wife, Empress Cunigunde of Luxembourg, mediated between the two parties. An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph&#x27;s death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.

Rudolph died on 6 September 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against Duke Mieszko II of Poland. Upon Mieszko&#x27;s surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad&#x27;s rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom&#x27;s western territories. On 2 February 1033, Conrad arrived at Vaud, where he held an assembly at the Abbey of Payerne and was crowned King of Burgundy. 

Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to Zürich in March. In April 1033 he negotiated a treaty of alliance with Henry I of France, which was completed at the end of May in a personal interview at Deville on the Meuse. Both monarchs had Odo for an enemy, since he had supported the claims of Henry I&#x27;s younger brother to the French crown. Conrad might therefore have been given a free hand by his ally to invade Odo&#x27;s French fiefs. In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo. On 1 August 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the Holy Roman Empire at a ceremony held in the Cathedral of Geneva.

Though Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son Henry as the kingdom&#x27;s future ruler. Crucially, the conquest of Burgundy augmented the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and could easily block foreign invasions.

==Politics==
Conrad formally confirmed the popular legal traditions of Saxony and issued new constitutions for Lombardy. In 1028 at Aachen, he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry married Gunhilda of Denmark, daughter of King Cnut the Great of England, Denmark and Norway by Emma of Normandy. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer. Henry, who would later become Emperor Henry III, became his father&#x27;s chief counselor.
When King Rudolph III of Burgundy died on 2 February 1032, Conrad claimed the kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded Burgundy to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provençal nobles paid homage to Conrad in Zürich in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the Kingdom of Arles from the 12th century, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comté and Dauphiné. It did not include the smaller Duchy of Burgundy to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian King of France. (Most of the former Kingdom of Burgundy/Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but &quot;King of Burgundy&quot; remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)

Conrad upheld the rights of the &quot;valvassores&quot; (knights and burghers of the cities) of Italy against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the bishop had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skilful diplomacy and luck.

==Late life==

===Securing the imperial succession===
On 14 January 1040, Conrad II&#x27;s heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as &quot;Rex romanorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Romans&quot;), thus effectively elevating the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. This was the exclusive method for claiming the office of Holy Roman Emperor.

===Second Italian expedition===

In 1038, Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over Capua with its Prince Pandulf, whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that Michael IV the Paphlagonian of the Byzantine Empire had received the same request, Conrad went to Southern Italy, to Salerno and Aversa. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of Monte Cassino, as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At Troia, he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf&#x27;s offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of Sant&#x27;Agata de&#x27; Goti. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of &quot;Prince&quot; on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under Rainulf Drengot, the Norman adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to Constantinople. Conrad thus left the &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; firmly in Guaimar&#x27;s hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.

===Death===

On the return to Germany, a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of Conrad&#x27;s troops; Conrad&#x27;s daughter-in-law and stepson also died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in Solothurn, Strasbourg and Goslar. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.

A year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of gout in Utrecht. His heart and bowels are buried at the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht. His body was transferred to Speyer via Cologne, Mainz and Worms, where the funeral procession made several stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, a cathedral which he himself founded and contains the resting place of all Salian emperors. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today.

A biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, &quot;Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris&quot;, was written by his chaplain Wipo of Burgundy, and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.

==Cultural depictions of Conrad II==
==Family and children==
Conrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia. They had three children:
* Henry III (1017–1056)
* Beatrix (1020–1036)
* Matilda (c.1027–1034)

<text>The [[Research Vessel]] &quot;Triton&quot; is a trimaran vessel owned by Gardline Marine Sciences Limited and a former prototype British warship demonstrator for the UK&#x27;s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (later QinetiQ). She was built as a technology demonstrator ship for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Future Surface Combatant, and has been used to both prove the viability of the hull-form and as a trials platform for other QinetiQ innovations. The ship was used by the Australian Border Force&#x27;s Marine Unit, and was for a time moored in the River Fal near the King Harry chain ferry. Up until July 2019 she was moored on the River Yare, Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England.

==Construction==
In August 1998, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) awarded a contract to Vosper Thornycroft to construct the trimaran, at a cost of £13.5m RV &quot;Triton&quot; was launched at Woolston in May 2000 and delivered in August 2000. &quot;Triton&quot; then began a two-year risk reduction trials programme for the UK MoD and the US Department of Defense.

The vessel&#x27;s three parallel hulls are reflected in her name which refers to the maritime god Triton who carried the three-pronged spear, the trident. The outriggers are thinner and much shorter than the dominant central hull.

==Operational history==

===DERA and QinetiQ===

&quot;Triton&quot; was designed as a demonstrator to prove that the trimaran concept would work successfully in a large warship. Following her launch in 2000, the ship began an extensive series of trials in 2001, which covered general ship handling, performance, sea-keeping behaviour, but also areas more specific to its design for which the Royal Navy had no experience. For example, a series of docking manoeuvres were undertaken by the pilot boats of HMNB Portsmouth to determine the problems of docking a large trimaran, and the ship underwent underway replenishment alongside and the tanker to ascertain the characteristics of a trimaran and a monohull replenishing at the same time. &quot;Triton&quot; also undertook the first helicopter take off and landing on a trimaran.

===Gardline Marine Sciences===
In January 2005, &quot;Triton&quot; was sold to Gardline Marine Sciences, a UK company based in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. &quot;Triton&quot; was used for hydrographic survey work for the civil hydrography programme (CHP) on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The vessel was fitted with a sensor suite which includes the Kongsberg Simrad EM1002 multibeam echo-sounder, a GPS attitude/heading system, surface navigation and ultra-short baseline sub-surface acoustic tracking system, Gardline Voyager5 integrated survey system and Caris post-processing system. The vessel was enhanced by Gardline by installing a bowthrust unit, additional accommodation and survey equipment facilities. In 2009, two new MTU engines were fitted; MTU 16v 4000 M40B. Output each.

===Australian Customs===
In December 2006, Gardline contracted &quot;Triton&quot; to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to patrol Australia&#x27;s northern waters as one of the service&#x27;s fleet of patrol vessels. Australian Customs Vessel &quot;Triton&quot; has been fitted with two .50 calibre heavy machine guns and carries up to 28 armed customs officers. The vessel is also equipped with two high-speed rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs). The ship arrived from the UK in mid-January 2007 and started operations immediately. Austere accommodation is provided for 100 embarked persons in addition to conventional accommodation for 45.

<doc id="44401" wikidata="Q101600" url="?curid=44401" title="Brown dwarf">
<text>Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that have more mass than the biggest gas giant planets, but less than the least massive main-sequence stars. Their mass is approximately 13 to 80 times that of Jupiter ()not big enough to sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen (1H) into helium in their cores, but massive enough to emit some light and heat from the fusion of deuterium (2H). The most massive ones (&gt; ) can fuse lithium (7Li).

Astronomers classify self-luminous objects by spectral type, a distinction intimately tied to the surface temperature, and brown dwarfs occupy types M, L, T, and Y. As brown dwarfs do not undergo stable hydrogen fusion, they cool down over time, progressively passing through later spectral types as they age.

Their name comes not from the color of light they emit but from their low luminosity, falling below that of a white dwarf star but above the level of a Gas giant. To the naked eye, brown dwarfs would appear in different colors depending on their temperature. The warmest ones are possibly orange or red, while cooler brown dwarfs would likely appear magenta or black to the human eye. Brown dwarfs may be fully convective, with no layers or chemical differentiation by depth.

Though their existence was initially theorized in the 1960s, it was not until 1994 that the first unambiguous brown dwarfs were discovered. As brown dwarfs have relatively low surface temperatures, they are not very bright at visible wavelengths, emitting most of their light in the infrared. However, with the advent of more capable infrared detecting devices, thousands of brown dwarfs have been identified. The nearest known brown dwarfs are located in the Luhman 16 system, a binary of L- and T-type brown dwarfs about from the Sun. Luhman 16 is the third closest system to the Sun after Alpha Centauri and Barnard&#x27;s Star.

== History ==
=== Early theorizing ===

The objects now called &quot;brown dwarfs&quot; were theorized by Shiv S. Kumar in the 1960s to exist and were originally called black dwarfs, a classification for dark substellar objects floating freely in space that were not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion. However, (a) the term black dwarf was already in use to refer to a cold white dwarf; (b) red dwarfs fuse hydrogen; and (c) these objects may be luminous at visible wavelengths early in their lives. Because of this, alternative names for these objects were proposed, including and substar. In 1975, Jill Tarter suggested the term &quot;brown dwarf&quot;, using &quot;brown&quot; as an approximate color.

The term &quot;black dwarf&quot; still refers to a white dwarf that has cooled to the point that it no longer emits significant amounts of light. However, the time required for even the lowest-mass white dwarf to cool to this temperature is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe; hence such objects are expected to not yet exist.

Early theories concerning the nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a population I object with a mass less than 0.07 solar masses () or a population II object less than would never go through normal stellar evolution and would become a completely degenerate star. The resulting brown dwarf star is sometimes called a failed star. The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.07 and 0.08 solar masses for population I objects.

=== Deuterium fusion ===
The discovery of deuterium burning down to () and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer atmospheres of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find because they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the infrared (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.

Since then, numerous searches by various methods have sought these objects. These methods included multi-color imaging surveys around field stars, imaging surveys for faint companions of main-sequence dwarfs and white dwarfs, surveys of young star clusters, and radial velocity monitoring for close companions.

=== GD 165B and class L ===
For many years, efforts to discover brown dwarfs were fruitless. In 1988, however, a faint companion to the white dwarf star GD 165 was found in an infrared search of white dwarfs. The spectrum of the companion GD 165B was very red and enigmatic, showing none of the features expected of a low-mass red dwarf. It became clear that GD 165B would need to be classified as a much cooler object than the latest M dwarfs then known. GD 165B remained unique for almost a decade until the advent of the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) in 1997, which discovered many objects with similar colors and spectral features.

Today, GD 165B is recognized as the prototype of a class of objects now called &quot;L dwarfs&quot;.

Although the discovery of the coolest dwarf was highly significant at the time, it was debated whether GD 165B would be classified as a brown dwarf or simply a very-low-mass star, because observationally it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.

Soon after the discovery of GD 165B, other brown-dwarf candidates were reported. Most failed to live up to their candidacy, however, because the absence of lithium showed them to be stellar objects. True stars burn their lithium within a little over 100 Myr, whereas brown dwarfs (which can, confusingly, have temperatures and luminosities similar to true stars) will not. Hence, the detection of lithium in the atmosphere of an object older than 100 Myr ensures that it is a brown dwarf.

=== Gliese 229B and class T ===
The first class &quot;T&quot; brown dwarf was discovered in 1994 by Caltech astronomers Shrinivas Kulkarni, Tadashi Nakajima, Keith Matthews and Rebecca Oppenheimer, and Johns Hopkins scientists Samuel T. Durrance and David Golimowski. It was confirmed in 1995 as a substellar companion to Gliese 229. Gliese 229b is one of the first two instances of clear evidence for a brown dwarf, along with Teide 1. Confirmed in 1995, both were identified by the presence of the 670.8 nm lithium line. The latter was found to have a temperature and luminosity well below the stellar range.

Its near-infrared spectrum clearly exhibited a methane absorption band at 2 micrometres, a feature that had previously only been observed in the atmospheres of giant planets and that of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Methane absorption is not expected at any temperature of a main-sequence star. This discovery helped to establish yet another spectral class even cooler than L dwarfs, known as &quot;T dwarfs&quot;, for which Gliese 229B is the prototype.

=== Teide 1 and class M ===
The first confirmed class &quot;M&quot; brown dwarf was discovered by Spanish astrophysicists Rafael Rebolo (head of the team), María Rosa Zapatero-Osorio, and Eduardo L. Martín in 1994. This object, found in the Pleiades open cluster, received the name Teide 1. The discovery article was submitted to &quot;Nature&quot; in May 1995, and published on 14 September 1995. &quot;Nature&quot; highlighted &quot;Brown dwarfs discovered, official&quot; on the front page of that issue.

Teide 1 was discovered in images collected by the IAC team on 6 January 1994 using the 80 cm telescope (IAC 80) at Teide Observatory, and its spectrum was first recorded in December 1994 using the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma). The distance, chemical composition, and age of Teide 1 could be established because of its membership in the young Pleiades star cluster. Using the most advanced stellar and substellar evolution models at that moment, the team estimated for Teide 1 a mass of , which is below the stellar-mass limit. The object became a reference in subsequent young brown dwarf related works.

In theory, a brown dwarf below is unable to burn lithium by thermonuclear fusion at any time during its evolution. This fact is one of the lithium test principles used to judge the substellar nature of low-luminosity and low-surface-temperature astronomical bodies.

High-quality spectral data acquired by the Keck 1 telescope in November 1995 showed that Teide 1 still had the initial lithium abundance of the original molecular cloud from which Pleiades stars formed, proving the lack of thermonuclear fusion in its core. These observations fully confirmed that Teide 1 is a brown dwarf, as well as the efficiency of the spectroscopic lithium test.

For some time, Teide 1 was the smallest known object outside the Solar System that had been identified by direct observation. Since then, over 1,800 brown dwarfs have been identified, even some very close to Earth, like Epsilon Indi Ba and Bb, a pair of brown dwarfs gravitationally bound to a Sun-like star 12 light-years from the Sun, and Luhman 16, a binary system of brown dwarfs at 6.5 light-years from the Sun.

== Theory ==
The standard mechanism for star birth is through the gravitational collapse of a cold interstellar cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud contracts, it heats due to the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism. Early in the process the contracting gas quickly radiates away much of the energy, allowing the collapse to continue. Eventually, the central region becomes sufficiently dense to trap radiation. Consequently, the central temperature and density of the collapsed cloud increase dramatically with time, slowing the contraction, until the conditions are hot and dense enough for thermonuclear reactions to occur in the core of the protostar. For a typical star, gas and radiation pressure generated by the thermonuclear fusion reactions within its core will support it against any further gravitational contraction. Hydrostatic equilibrium is reached, and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star.

If, however, the initial mass of the protostar is less than about , normal hydrogen thermonuclear fusion reactions will not ignite in the core. Gravitational contraction does not heat the small protostar very effectively, and before the temperature in the core can increase enough to trigger fusion, the density reaches the point where electrons become closely packed enough to create quantum electron degeneracy pressure. According to the brown dwarf interior models, typical conditions in the core for density, temperature and pressure are expected to be the following:
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3

This means that the protostar is not massive or dense enough ever to reach the conditions needed to sustain hydrogen fusion. The infalling matter is prevented, by electron degeneracy pressure, from reaching the densities and pressures needed.

Further gravitational contraction is prevented and the result is a brown dwarf that simply cools off by radiating away its internal thermal energy. Note that, in principle, it is possible for a brown dwarf to slowly accrete mass above the hydrogen burning limit without initiating hydrogen fusion. This could happen via mass transfer in a binary brown dwarf system.

=== High-mass brown dwarfs versus low-mass stars ===
Lithium is generally present in brown dwarfs and not in low-mass stars. Stars, which reach the high temperature necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. Fusion of lithium-7 and a proton occurs, producing two helium-4 nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below that necessary for hydrogen fusion. Convection in low-mass stars ensures that lithium in the whole volume of the star is eventually depleted. Therefore, the presence of the lithium spectral line in a candidate brown dwarf is a strong indicator that it is indeed a substellar object.

==== Lithium test ====
The use of lithium to distinguish candidate brown dwarfs from low-mass stars is commonly referred to as the lithium test, and was pioneered by Rafael Rebolo, Eduardo Martín and Antonio Magazzu. However, lithium is also seen in very young stars, which have not yet had enough time to burn it all.

Heavier stars, like the Sun, can also retain lithium in their outer layers, which never get hot enough to fuse lithium, and whose convective layer does not mix with the core where the lithium would be rapidly depleted. Those larger stars are easily distinguishable from brown dwarfs by their size and luminosity.

Conversely, brown dwarfs at the high end of their mass range can be hot enough to deplete their lithium when they are young. Dwarfs of mass greater than can burn their lithium by the time they are half a billion years old; thus the lithium test is not perfect.

==== Atmospheric methane ====
Unlike stars, older brown dwarfs are sometimes cool enough that, over very long periods of time, their atmospheres can gather observable quantities of methane, which cannot form in hotter objects. Dwarfs confirmed in this fashion include Gliese 229B.

==== Iron, silicate and sulfide clouds ====
Main-sequence stars cool, but eventually reach a minimum bolometric luminosity that they can sustain through steady fusion. This luminosity varies from star to star, but is generally at least 0.01% that of the Sun. Brown dwarfs cool and darken steadily over their lifetimes; sufficiently old brown dwarfs will be too faint to be detectable.

Clouds are used to explain the weakening of the iron hydride (FeH) spectral line in late L-dwarfs. Iron clouds deplete FeH in the upper atmosphere, and the cloud layer blocks the view to lower layers still containing FeH. The later strengthening of this chemical compound at cooler temperatures of mid- to late T-dwarfs is explained by disturbed clouds that allows a telescope to look into the deeper layers of the atmosphere that still contains FeH. Young L/T-dwarfs (L2-T4) show high variability, which could be explained with clouds, hot spots, magnetically driven aurorae or thermochemical instabilities. The clouds of these brown dwarfs are explained as either iron clouds with varying thickness or a lower thick iron cloud layer and an upper silicate cloud layer. This upper silicate cloud layer can consist out of quartz, enstatite, corundum and/or fosterite. It is however not clear if silicate clouds are always necessary for young objects. Silicate absorption can be directly observed in the mid-infrared at 8 to 12 μm. Observations with Spitzer IRS have shown that silicate absorption is common, but not ubiquitous, for L2-L8 dwarfs. Additionally, MIRI has observed silicate absorption in the planetary-mass companion VHS 1256b.

Iron rain as part of atmospheric convection processes is possible only in brown dwarfs, and not in small stars. The spectroscopy research into iron rain is still ongoing, but not all brown dwarfs will always have this atmospheric anomaly. In 2013, a heterogeneous iron-containing atmosphere was imaged around the B component in the nearby Luhman 16 system.

For late T-type brown dwarfs only a few variable searches were carried out. Thin cloud layers are predicted to form in late T-dwarfs from chromium and potassium chloride, as well as several sulfides. These sulfides are manganese sulfide, sodium sulfide and zinc sulfide. The variable T7 dwarf 2M0050–3322 is explained to have a top layer of potassium chloride clouds, a mid layer of sodium sulfide clouds and a lower layer of manganese sulfide clouds. Patchy clouds of the top two cloud layers could explain why the methane and water vapor bands are variable.

At the lowest temperatures of the Y-dwarf WISE 0855-0714 patchy cloud layers of sulfide and water ice clouds could cover 50% of the surface.

=== Low-mass brown dwarfs versus high-mass planets ===
Like stars, brown dwarfs form independently, but, unlike stars, they lack sufficient mass to &quot;ignite&quot; hydrogen fusion. Like all stars, they can occur singly or in close proximity to other stars. Some orbit stars and can, like planets, have eccentric orbits.

==== Size and fuel-burning ambiguities ====
Brown dwarfs are all roughly the same radius as Jupiter. At the high end of their mass range (), the volume of a brown dwarf is governed primarily by electron-degeneracy pressure, as it is in white dwarfs; at the low end of the range (), their volume is governed primarily by Coulomb pressure, as it is in planets. The net result is that the radii of brown dwarfs vary by only 10–15% over the range of possible masses. Moreover, the mass–radius relationship shows no change from about one Saturn mass to the onset of hydrogen burning (), suggesting that from this perspective brown dwarfs are simply high-mass Jovian planets. This can make distinguishing them from planets difficult.

In addition, many brown dwarfs undergo no fusion; even those at the high end of the mass range (over ) cool quickly enough that after 10 million years they no longer undergo fusion.

==== Heat spectrum ====
X-ray and infrared spectra are telltale signs of brown dwarfs. Some emit X-rays; and all &quot;warm&quot; dwarfs continue to glow tellingly in the red and infrared spectra until they cool to planet-like temperatures (under ).

Gas giants have some of the characteristics of brown dwarfs. Like the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are both made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is nearly as large as Jupiter, despite having only 30% the mass. Three of the giant planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) emit much more (up to about twice) heat than they receive from the Sun. All four giant planets have their own &quot;planetary&quot; systems, in the form of extensive moon systems.

==== Current IAU standard ====
Currently, the International Astronomical Union considers an object above (the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium) to be a brown dwarf, whereas an object under that mass (and orbiting a star or stellar remnant) is considered a planet. The minimum mass required to trigger sustained hydrogen burning (about ) forms the upper limit of the definition.

It is also debated whether brown dwarfs would be better defined by their formation process rather than by theoretical mass limits based on nuclear fusion reactions. Under this interpretation brown dwarfs are those objects that represent the lowest-mass products of the star formation process, while planets are objects formed in an accretion disk surrounding a star. The coolest free-floating objects discovered, such as WISE 0855, as well as the lowest-mass young objects known, like PSO J318.5−22, are thought to have masses below , and as a result are sometimes referred to as planetary-mass objects due to the ambiguity of whether they should be regarded as rogue planets or brown dwarfs. There are planetary-mass objects known to orbit brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b, 2MASS J044144b and Oph 98 B.

The 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than a quantity with precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13Jupiter-mass value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.

As of 2011 the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, &quot;The fact that there is no special feature around in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit&quot;. As of 2016, this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses, based on a study of mass–density relationships.

The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: &quot;The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity.&quot; The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass (or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses.

==== Sub-brown dwarf ====

Objects below , called sub-brown dwarfs or planetary-mass brown dwarfs, form in the same manner as stars and brown dwarfs (i.e. through the collapse of a gas cloud) but have a mass below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.

Some researchers call them free-floating planets, whereas others call them planetary-mass brown dwarfs.

=== Role of other physical properties in the mass estimate ===
While spectroscopic features can help to distinguish between low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, it is often necessary to estimate the mass to come to a conclusion. The theory behind the mass estimate is that brown dwarfs with a similar mass form in a similar way and are hot when they form. Some have spectral types that are similar to low-mass stars, such as 2M1101AB. As they cool down the brown dwarfs should retain a range of luminosities depending on the mass. Without the age and luminosity, a mass estimate is difficult; for example, an L-type brown dwarf could be an old brown dwarf with a high mass (possibly a low-mass star) or a young brown dwarf with a very low mass. For Y dwarfs this is less of a problem, as they remain low-mass objects near the sub-brown dwarf limit, even for relatively high age estimates. For L and T dwarfs it is still useful to have an accurate age estimate. The luminosity is here the less concerning property, as this can be estimated from the spectral energy distribution. The age estimate can be done in two ways. Either the brown dwarf is young and still has spectral features that are associated with youth, or the brown dwarf co-moves with a star or stellar group (star cluster or association), where age estimates are easier to obtain. A very young brown dwarf that was further studied with this method is 2M1207 and the companion 2M1207b. Based on the location, proper motion and spectral signature, this object was determined to belong to the ~8-million-year-old TW Hydrae association, and the mass of the secondary was determined to be 8 ± 2 , below the deuterium burning limit. An example of a very old age obtained by the co-movement method is the brown dwarf + white dwarf binary COCONUTS-1, with the white dwarf estimated to be billion years old. In this case the mass was not estimated with the derived age, but the co-movement provided an accurate distance estimate, using Gaia parallax. Using this measurement the authors estimated the radius, which was then used to estimate the mass for the brown dwarf as .

=== Classification of brown dwarfs ===

==== Spectral class M ====

These are brown dwarfs with a spectral class of M5.5 or later; they are also called late-M dwarfs. Some scientists regard them as red dwarfs. All brown dwarfs with spectral type M are young objects, such as Teide 1, which is the first M-type brown dwarf discovered, and LP 944-20, the closest M-type brown dwarf.

==== Spectral class L ====

The defining characteristic of spectral class M, the coolest type in the long-standing classical stellar sequence, is an optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and vanadium(II) oxide (VO) molecules. However, GD 165B, the cool companion to the white dwarf GD 165, had none of the hallmark TiO features of M dwarfs. The subsequent identification of many objects like GD 165B ultimately led to the definition of a new spectral class, the L dwarfs, defined in the red optical region of the spectrum not by metal-oxide absorption bands (TiO, VO), but by metal hydride emission bands (FeH, CrH, MgH, CaH) and prominent atomic lines of alkali metals (Na, K, Rb, Cs). , over 900 L dwarfs had been identified, most by wide-field surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), the Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky (DENIS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This spectral class also contains the coolest main-sequence stars (&gt; 80 &quot;M&quot;J), which have spectral classes L2 to L6.

==== Spectral class T ====

As GD 165B is the prototype of the L dwarfs, Gliese 229B is the prototype of a second new spectral class, the T dwarfs. T dwarfs are pinkish-magenta. Whereas near-infrared (NIR) spectra of L dwarfs show strong absorption bands of H2O and carbon monoxide (CO), the NIR spectrum of Gliese 229B is dominated by absorption bands from methane (CH4), a feature which in the Solar System is found only in the giant planets and Titan. CH4, H2O, and molecular hydrogen (H2) collision-induced absorption (CIA) give Gliese 229B blue near-infrared colors. Its steeply sloped red optical spectrum also lacks the FeH and CrH bands that characterize L dwarfs and instead is influenced by exceptionally broad absorption features from the alkali metals Na and K. These differences led J. Davy Kirkpatrick to propose the T spectral class for objects exhibiting H- and K-band CH4 absorption. , 355 T dwarfs were known. NIR classification schemes for T dwarfs have recently been developed by Adam Burgasser and Tom Geballe. Theory suggests that L dwarfs are a mixture of very-low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs), whereas the T dwarf class is composed entirely of brown dwarfs. Because of the absorption of sodium and potassium in the green part of the spectrum of T dwarfs, the actual appearance of T dwarfs to human visual perception is estimated to be not brown, but magenta. Early observations limited how distant T-dwarfs could be observed. T-class brown dwarfs, such as WISE 0316+4307, have been detected more than 100 light-years from the Sun. Observations with JWST have detected T-dwarfs such as UNCOVER-BD-1 up to 4500 parsec distant from the sun.

==== Spectral class Y ====

In 2009, the coolest-known brown dwarfs had estimated effective temperatures between , and have been assigned the spectral class T9. Three examples are the brown dwarfs CFBDS J005910.90–011401.3, ULAS J133553.45+113005.2 and ULAS J003402.77−005206.7. The spectra of these objects have absorption peaks around 1.55 micrometres. Delorme et al. have suggested that this feature is due to absorption from ammonia and that this should be taken as indicating the T–Y transition, making these objects of type Y0. However, the feature is difficult to distinguish from absorption by water and methane, and other authors have stated that the assignment of class Y0 is premature.

The first JWST spectral energy distribution of a Y-dwarf was able to observe several bands of molecules in the atmosphere of the Y0-dwarf WISE 0359−5401. The observations covered spectroscopy from 1 to 12 μm and photometry at 15, 18 and 21 μm. The molecules water (H2O), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3) were detected in WISE 0359−5401. Many of these features have been observed before in this Y-dwarf and warmer T-dwarfs by other observatories, but JWST was able to observe them in a single spectrum. Methane is the main reservoir of carbon in the atmosphere of WISE 0359−5401, but there is still enough carbon left to form detectable carbon monoxide (at 4.5–5.0 μm) and carbon dioxide (at 4.2–4.35 μm) in the Y-dwarf. Ammonia was difficult to detect before JWST, as it blends in with the absorption feature of water in the near-infrared, as well at 5.5–7.1 μm. At longer wavelengths of 8.5–12 μm the spectrum of WISE 0359−5401 is dominated by the absorption of ammonia. At 3 μm there is an additional newly detected ammonia feature.

==== Role of vertical mixing ====

In the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere of brown dwarfs a chemical equilibrium between carbon monoxide and methane exists. Carbon monoxide reacts with hydrogen molecules and forms methane and hydroxyl in this reaction. The hydroxyl radical might later react with hydrogen and form water molecules. In the other direction of the reaction, methane reacts with hydroxyl and forms carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The chemical reaction is tilted towards carbon monoxide at higher temperatures (L-dwarfs) and lower pressure. At lower temperatures (T-dwarfs) and higher pressure the reaction is tilted towards methane, and methane predominates at the T/Y-boundary. However, vertical mixing of the atmosphere can cause methane to sink into lower layers of the atmosphere and carbon monoxide to rise from these lower and hotter layers. The carbon monoxide is slow to react back into methane because of an energy barrier that prevents the breakdown of the C-O bonds. This forces the observable atmosphere of a brown dwarf to be in a chemical disequilibrium. The L/T transition is mainly defined with the transition from a carbon-monoxide-dominated atmosphere in L-dwarfs to a methane-dominated atmosphere in T-dwarfs. The amount of vertical mixing can therefore push the L/T-transition to lower or higher temperatures. This becomes important for objects with modest surface gravity and extended atmospheres, such as giant exoplanets. This pushes the L/T transition to lower temperatures for giant exoplanets. For brown dwarfs this transition occurs at around 1200 K. The exoplanet HR 8799c, on the other hand, does not show any methane, while having a temperature of 1100K.

The transition between T- and Y-dwarfs is often defined as 500 K because of the lack of spectral observations of these cold and faint objects. Future observations with JWST and the ELTs might improve the sample of Y-dwarfs with observed spectra. Y-dwarfs are dominated by deep spectral features of methane, water vapor and possibly absorption features of ammonia and water ice. Vertical mixing, clouds, metallicity, photochemistry, lightning, impact shocks and metallic catalysts might influence the temperature at which the L/T and T/Y transition occurs.

==== Secondary features ====

Young brown dwarfs have low surface gravities because they have larger radii and lower masses than the field stars of similar spectral type. These sources are noted by a letter &quot;beta&quot; (β) for intermediate surface gravity or &quot;gamma&quot; (γ) for low surface gravity. Indicators of low surface gravity include weak CaH, K I and Na I lines, as well as a strong VO line. &quot;Alpha&quot; (α) denotes normal surface gravity and is usually dropped. Sometimes an extremely low surface gravity is denoted by a delta (δ). The suffix &quot;pec&quot; stands for &quot;peculiar&quot;; this suffix is still used for other features that are unusual, and summarizes different properties, indicating low surface gravity, subdwarfs and unresolved binaries. The prefix sd stands for subdwarf and only includes cool subdwarfs. This prefix indicates a low metallicity and kinematic properties that are more similar to halo stars than to disk stars. Subdwarfs appear bluer than disk objects. The red suffix describes objects with red color, but an older age. This is not interpreted as low surface gravity, but as a high dust content. The blue suffix describes objects with blue near-infrared colors that cannot be explained with low metallicity. Some are explained as L+T binaries, others are not binaries, such as 2MASS J11263991−5003550 and are explained with thin and/or large-grained clouds.

=== Spectral and atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs ===

The majority of flux emitted by L and T dwarfs is in the 1- to 2.5-micrometre near-infrared range. Low and decreasing temperatures through the late-M, -L, and -T dwarf sequence result in a rich near-infrared spectrum containing a wide variety of features, from relatively narrow lines of neutral atomic species to broad molecular bands, all of which have different dependencies on temperature, gravity, and metallicity. Furthermore, these low temperature conditions favor condensation out of the gas state and the formation of grains.

Typical atmospheres of known brown dwarfs range in temperature from 2200 down to . Compared to stars, which warm themselves with steady internal fusion, brown dwarfs cool quickly over time; more massive dwarfs cool more slowly than less massive ones. There is some evidence that the cooling of brown dwarfs slows down at the transition between spectral classes L and T (about 1000 K).

Observations of known brown dwarf candidates have revealed a pattern of brightening and dimming of infrared emissions that suggests relatively cool, opaque cloud patterns obscuring a hot interior that is stirred by extreme winds. The weather on such bodies is thought to be extremely strong, comparable to but far exceeding Jupiter&#x27;s famous storms.

On January 8, 2013, astronomers using NASA&#x27;s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes probed the stormy atmosphere of a brown dwarf named 2MASS J22282889–4310262, creating the most detailed &quot;weather map&quot; of a brown dwarf thus far. It shows wind-driven, planet-sized clouds. The new research is a stepping stone toward a better understanding not only brown dwarfs, but also of the atmospheres of planets beyond the Solar System.

In April 2020 scientists reported measuring wind speeds of (up to 1,450 miles per hour) on the nearby brown dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. To calculate the measurements, scientists compared the rotational movement of atmospheric features, as ascertained by brightness changes, against the electromagnetic rotation generated by the brown dwarf&#x27;s interior. The results confirmed previous predictions that brown dwarfs would have high winds. Scientists are hopeful that this comparison method can be used to explore the atmospheric dynamics of other brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets.

=== Observational techniques ===
Coronagraphs have recently been used to detect faint objects orbiting bright visible stars, including Gliese 229B.

Sensitive telescopes equipped with charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have been used to search distant star clusters for faint objects, including Teide 1.

Wide-field searches have identified individual faint objects, such as Kelu-1 (30 light-years away).

Brown dwarfs are often discovered in surveys to discover exoplanets. Methods of detecting exoplanets work for brown dwarfs as well, although brown dwarfs are much easier to detect.

Brown dwarfs can be powerful emitters of radio emission due to their strong magnetic fields. Observing programs at the Arecibo Observatory and the Very Large Array have detected over a dozen such objects, which are also called ultracool dwarfs because they share common magnetic properties with other objects in this class. The detection of radio emission from brown dwarfs permits their magnetic field strengths to be measured directly.

=== Brown dwarfs X-ray sources ===
X-ray flares detected from brown dwarfs since 1999 suggest changing magnetic fields within them, similar to those in very-low-mass stars. Although they do not fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores like stars, energy from the fusion of deuterium and gravitational contraction keep their interiors warm and generate strong magnetic fields. The interior of a brown dwarf is in a rapidly boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, convection sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The magnetic fields that generated the flare observed by Chandra from LP 944-20 has its origin in the turbulent magnetized plasma beneath the brown dwarf&#x27;s &quot;surface&quot;.

Using NASA&#x27;s Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists have detected X-rays from a low-mass brown dwarf in a multiple star system. This is the first time that a brown dwarf this close to its parent star(s) (Sun-like stars TWA 5A) has been resolved in X-rays. &quot;Our Chandra data show that the X-rays originate from the brown dwarf&#x27;s coronal plasma which is some 3 million degrees Celsius&quot;, said Yohko Tsuboi of Chuo University in Tokyo. &quot;This brown dwarf is as bright as the Sun today in X-ray light, while it is fifty times less massive than the Sun&quot;, said Tsuboi. &quot;This observation, thus, raises the possibility that even massive planets might emit X-rays by themselves during their youth!&quot;

=== Brown dwarfs as radio sources ===

The first brown dwarf that was discovered to emit radio signals was LP 944-20, which was observed since it is also a source of X-ray emission, and both types of emission are signatures of coronae. Approximately 5–10% of brown dwarfs appear to have strong magnetic fields and emit radio waves, and there may be as many as 40 magnetic brown dwarfs within 25 pc of the Sun based on Monte Carlo modeling and their average spatial density. The power of the radio emissions of brown dwarfs is roughly constant despite variations in their temperatures. Brown dwarfs may maintain magnetic fields of up to 6 kG in strength. Astronomers have estimated brown dwarf magnetospheres to span an altitude of approximately 107 m given properties of their radio emissions. It is unknown whether the radio emissions from brown dwarfs more closely resemble those from planets or stars. Some brown dwarfs emit regular radio pulses, which are sometimes interpreted as radio emission beamed from the poles but may also be beamed from active regions. The regular, periodic reversal of radio wave orientation may indicate that brown dwarf magnetic fields periodically reverse polarity. These reversals may be the result of a brown dwarf magnetic activity cycle, similar to the solar cycle.

The first brown dwarf of spectral class M found to emit radio waves was LP 944-20, detected in 2001. The first brown dwarf of spectral class L found to emit radio waves was 2MASS J0036159+182110, detected in 2008. The first brown dwarf of spectral class T found to emit radio waves was 2MASS J10475385+2124234. This last discovery was significant since it revealed that brown dwarfs with temperatures similar to exoplanets could host strong &gt;1.7 kG magnetic fields. Although a sensitive search for radio emission from Y dwarfs was conducted at the Arecibo Observatory in 2010, no emission was detected.

=== Recent developments ===

Estimates of brown dwarf populations in the solar neighbourhood suggest that there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf. A more recent estimate from 2017 using the young massive star cluster RCW 38 concluded that the Milky Way galaxy contains between 25 and 100 billion brown dwarfs. (Compare these numbers to the estimates of the number of stars in the Milky Way; 100 to 400 billion.)

In a study published in Aug 2017 NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope monitored infrared brightness variations in brown dwarfs caused by cloud cover of variable thickness. The observations revealed large-scale waves propagating in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs (similarly to the atmosphere of Neptune and other Solar System giant planets). These atmospheric waves modulate the thickness of the clouds and propagate with different velocities (probably due to differential rotation).

In August 2020, astronomers discovered 95 brown dwarfs near the Sun through the project Backyard Worlds: Planet 9.

In 2024 the James Webb Space Telescope provided the most detailed weather report yet on two brown dwarfs, revealing &quot;stormy&quot; conditions. These brown dwarfs, part of a binary star system named Luhman 16 discovered in 2013, are only 6.5 light-years away from Earth and are the closest brown dwarfs to our sun. Researchers discovered that they have turbulent clouds, likely made of silicate grains, with temperatures ranging from to . This indicates that hot sand is being blown by winds on the brown dwarfs. Additionally, absorption signatures of carbon monoxide, methane, and water vapor were detected.

== Binary brown dwarfs ==

=== Brown dwarf–brown dwarf binaries ===

Brown dwarfs binaries of type M, L, and T are less common with a lower mass of the primary. L-dwarfs have a binary fraction of about % and the binary fraction for late T, early Y-dwarfs (T5-Y0) is about .

Brown dwarf binaries have a higher companion-to-host ratio formula_4 for lower mass binaries. Binaries with a M-type star as a primary have for example a broad distribution of &quot;q&quot; with a preference of &quot;q&quot; ≥ 0.4. Brown dwarfs on the other hand show a strong preference for &quot;q&quot; ≥ 0.7. The separation is decreasing with mass: M-type stars have a separation peaking at 3–30 astronomical units (au), M-L-type brown dwarfs have a projected separation peaking at 5–8 au and T5–Y0 objects have a projected separation that follows a lognormal distribution with a peak separation of about 2.9 au.

An example is the closest brown dwarf binary Luhman 16 AB with a primary L7.5 dwarf and a separation of 3.5 au and &quot;q&quot; = 0.85. The separation is on the lower end of the expected separation for M-L-type brown dwarfs, but the mass ratio is typical.

It is not known if the same trend continues with Y-dwarfs, because their sample size is so small. The Y+Y dwarf binaries should have a high mass ratio q and a low separation, reaching scales of less than one au. In 2023, the Y+Y dwarf WISE J0336-0143 was confirmed as a binary with JWST, with a mass ratio of q=0.62±0.05 and a separation of 0.97 astronomical units. The researchers point out that the sample size of low-mass binary brown dwarfs is too small to determine if WISE J0336-0143 is a typical representative of low-mass binaries or a peculiar system.

Observations of the orbit of binary systems containing brown dwarfs can be used to measure the mass of the brown dwarf. In the case of 2MASSW J0746425+2000321, the secondary weighs 6% of the solar mass. This measurement is called a dynamical mass. The brown dwarf system closest to the Solar System is the binary Luhman 16. It was attempted to search for planets around this system with a similar method, but none were found.

=== Unusual brown dwarf binaries ===

The wide binary system 2M1101AB was the first binary with a separation greater than . The discovery of the system gave definitive insights to the formation of brown dwarfs. It was previously thought that wide binary brown dwarfs are not formed or at least are disrupted at ages of 1–10 Myr. The existence of this system is also inconsistent with the ejection hypothesis. The ejection hypothesis was a proposed hypothesis in which brown dwarfs form in a multiple system, but are ejected before they gain enough mass to burn hydrogen.

More recently the wide binary W2150AB was discovered. It has a similar mass ratio and binding energy as 2M1101AB, but a greater age and is located in a different region of the galaxy. While 2M1101AB is in a closely crowded region, the binary W2150AB is in a sparsely-separated field. It must have survived any dynamical interactions in its natal star cluster. The binary belongs also to a few L+T binaries that can be easily resolved by ground-based observatories. The other two are SDSS J1416+13AB and Luhman 16.

There are other interesting binary systems such as the eclipsing binary brown dwarf system 2MASS J05352184–0546085. Photometric studies of this system have revealed that the less massive brown dwarf in the system is hotter than its higher-mass companion.

=== Brown dwarfs around stars ===

Brown dwarfs and massive planets in a close orbit (less than 5 au) around stars are rare and this is sometimes described as the brown dwarf desert. Less than 1% of stars with the mass of the sun have a brown dwarf within 3–5 au.

An example for a star–brown dwarf binary is the first discovered T-dwarf Gliese 229 B, which orbits around the main-sequence star Gliese 229 A, a red dwarf. Brown dwarfs orbiting subgiants are also known, such as TOI-1994b which orbits its star every 4.03 days.

There is also disagreement if some low-mass brown dwarfs should be considered planets. The NASA Exoplanet archive includes brown dwarfs with a minimum mass less or equal to 30 Jupiter masses as planets as long as there are other criteria fulfilled (e.g. orbiting a star). The Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the IAU on the other hand only considers planets with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses.

=== White dwarf–brown dwarf binaries ===

Brown dwarfs around white dwarfs are quite rare. GD 165 B, the prototype of the L dwarfs, is one such system. Such systems can be useful in determining the age of the system and the mass of the brown dwarf. Other white dwarf-brown dwarf binaries are COCONUTS-1 AB (7 billion years old), and LSPM J0055+5948 AB (10 billion years old), SDSS J22255+0016 AB (2 billion years old) WD 0806−661 AB (1.5–2.7 billion years old).

Systems with close, tidally locked brown dwarfs orbiting around white dwarfs belong to the post common envelope binaries or PCEBs. Only eight confirmed PCEBs containing a white dwarf with a brown dwarf companion are known, including WD 0137-349 AB. In the past history of these close white dwarf–brown dwarf binaries, the brown dwarf is engulfed by the star in the red giant phase. Brown dwarfs with a mass lower than 20 Jupiter masses would evaporate during the engulfment. The dearth of brown dwarfs orbiting close to white dwarfs can be compared with similar observations of brown dwarfs around main-sequence stars, described as the brown-dwarf desert. The PCEB might evolve into a cataclysmic variable star (CV*) with the brown dwarf as the donor. Simulations have shown that highly evolved CV* are mostly associated with substellar donors (up to 80%). A type of CV*, called WZ Sge-type dwarf nova often show donors with a mass near the borderline of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The binary BW Sculptoris is such a dwarf nova with a brown dwarf donor. This brown dwarf likely formed when a donor star lost enough mass to become a brown dwarf. The mass loss comes with a loss of the orbital period until it reaches a minimum of 70–80 minutes at which the period increases again. This gives this evolutionary stage the name period bouncer. There could also exist brown dwarfs that merged with white dwarfs. The nova CK Vulpeculae might be a result of such a white dwarf–brown dwarf merger.

== Formation and evolution ==
The earliest stage of brown dwarf formation is called proto- or pre-brown dwarf. Proto-brown dwarfs are low-mass equivalents of protostars (class 0/I objects). Additionally Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) that have Lint ≤0.1-0.2 are often proto-brown dwarfs. They are found in nearby star-forming clouds. Around 67 promising proto-brown dwarfs and 26 pre-brown dwarfs are known as of 2024. As of 2017 there is only one known proto-brown dwarf that is connected with a large Herbig–Haro object. This is the brown dwarf Mayrit 1701117, which is surrounded by a pseudo-disk and a Keplerian disk. Mayrit 1701117 launches the 0.7-light-year-long jet HH 1165, mostly seen in ionized sulfur.

Brown dwarfs form similarly to stars and are surrounded by protoplanetary disks, such as Cha 110913−773444. Disks around brown dwarfs have been found to have many of the same features as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs. Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants. If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across our line of sight, then, because they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a large signal for detection by transit. The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.
In 2020, the closest brown dwarf with an associated primordial disk (class II disk)—WISEA J120037.79-784508.3 (W1200-7845)—was discovered by the Disk Detective project when classification volunteers noted its infrared excess. It was vetted and analyzed by the science team who found that W1200-7845 had a 99.8% probability of being a member of the ε Chamaeleontis (ε Cha) young moving group association. Its parallax (using Gaia DR2 data) puts it at a distance of 102 parsecs (or 333 lightyears) from Earth—which is within the local Solar neighborhood.
A paper from 2021 studied circumstellar discs around brown dwarfs in stellar associations that are a few million years old and 140 to 200 parsecs away. The researchers found that these disks are not massive enough to form planets in the future. There is evidence in these disks that might indicate that planet formation begins at earlier stages and that planets are already present in these disks. The evidence for disk evolution includes a decreasing disk mass over time, dust grain growth and dust settling. Two brown dwarf disks were also found in absorption and at least 4 disks are photoevaporating from external UV-ratiation in the Orion Nebula. Such objects are also called proplyds. Proplyd 181−247, which is a brown dwarf or low-mass star, is surrounded by a disk with a radius of 30 astronomical units and the disk has a mass of 6.2±1.0 . Disks around brown dwarfs usually have a radius smaller than 40 astronomical units, but three disks in the more distant Taurus molecular cloud have a radius larger than 70 au and were resolved with ALMA. These larger disks are able to form rocky planets with a mass &gt;1 . There are also brown dwarfs with disks in associations older than a few million years, which might be evidence that disks around brown dwarfs need more time to dissipate. Especially old disks (&gt;20 Myrs) are sometimes called Peter Pan disks. Currently 2MASS J02265658-5327032 is the only known brown dwarf that has a Peter Pan disk.

The brown dwarf Cha 110913−773444, located 500 light-years away in the constellation Chamaeleon, may be in the process of forming a miniature planetary system. Astronomers from Pennsylvania State University have detected what they believe to be a disk of gas and dust similar to the one hypothesized to have formed the Solar System. Cha 110913−773444 is the smallest brown dwarf found to date (), and if it formed a planetary system, it would be the smallest-known object to have one.

== Planets around brown dwarfs ==

According to the IAU working definition (from August 2018) an exoplanet can orbit a brown dwarf. It requires a mass below 13 and a mass ratio of &quot;M&quot;/&quot;M&quot;central&lt;2/(25+√621). This means that an object with a mass up to 3.2  around a brown dwarf with a mass of 80  is considered a planet. It also means that an object with a mass up to 0.52  around a brown dwarf with a mass of 13  is considered a planet.

The super-Jupiter planetary-mass objects 2M1207b, 2MASS J044144 and Oph 98 B that are orbiting brown dwarfs at large orbital distances may have formed by cloud collapse rather than accretion and so may be sub-brown dwarfs rather than planets, which is inferred from relatively large masses and large orbits. The first discovery of a low-mass companion orbiting a brown dwarf (ChaHα8) at a small orbital distance using the radial velocity technique paved the way for the detection of planets around brown dwarfs on orbits of a few AU or smaller. However, with a mass ratio between the companion and primary in ChaHα8 of about 0.3, this system rather resembles a binary star. Then, in 2008, the first planetary-mass companion in a relatively small orbit (MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb) was discovered orbiting a brown dwarf.
Planets around brown dwarfs are likely to be carbon planets depleted of water.

A 2017 study, based upon observations with Spitzer estimates that 175 brown dwarfs need to be monitored in order to guarantee (95%) at least one detection of a below earth-sized planet via the transiting method. JWST could potentially detect smaller planets. The orbits of planets and moons in the solar system often align with the orientation of the host star/planet they orbit. Assuming the orbit of a planet is aligned with the rotational axis of a brown dwarf or planetary-mass object, the geometric transit probability of an object similar to Io can be calculated with the formula cos(79.5°)/cos(inclination). The inclination was estimated for several brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. SIMP 0136 for example has an estimated inclination of 80°±12. Assuming the lower bound of i≥68° for SIMP 0136, this results in a transit probability of ≥48.6% for close-in planets. It is however not known how common close-in planets are around brown dwarfs and they might be more common for lower-mass objects, as disk sizes seem to decrease with mass.

=== Habitability ===

Habitability for hypothetical planets orbiting brown dwarfs has been studied. Computer models suggesting conditions for these bodies to have habitable planets are very stringent, the habitable zone being narrow, close (T dwarf 0.005 au) and decreasing with time, due to the cooling of the brown dwarf (they fuse for at most 10 million years). The orbits there would have to be of extremely low eccentricity (on the order of 10 to the minus 6) to avoid strong tidal forces that would trigger a runaway greenhouse effect on the planets, rendering them uninhabitable. There would also be no moons.

== Superlative brown dwarfs ==

In 1984, it was postulated by some astronomers that the Sun may be orbited by an undetected brown dwarf (sometimes referred to as Nemesis) that could interact with the Oort cloud just as passing stars can. However, this hypothesis has fallen out of favor.

<text>The United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing, more commonly known as the Shakers, are a millenarian restorationist Christian sect founded in England and then organized in the United States in the 1780s. They were initially known as &quot;Shaking Quakers&quot; because of their ecstatic behavior during worship services.

Espousing egalitarian ideals, the Shakers practice a celibate and communal utopian lifestyle, pacifism, uniform charismatic worship, and their model of equality of the sexes, which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. They are also known for their simple living, architecture, technological innovation, music, and furniture. Women took on spiritual leadership roles alongside men, including founding leaders such as Jane Wardley, Ann Lee, and Lucy Wright. The Shakers emigrated from England and settled in Revolutionary colonial America, with an initial settlement at Watervliet, New York (present-day Colonie), in 1774.

During the mid-19th century, an Era of Manifestations resulted in a period of dances, gift drawings, and gift songs inspired by spiritual revelations. At its peak in the mid-19th century, there were 2,000–4,000 Shaker believers living in 18 major communities and numerous smaller, often short-lived communities. External and internal societal changes in the mid- and late-19th century resulted in the thinning of the Shaker community as members left or died with few converts to the faith to replace them.

By 1920, there were only 12 Shaker communities remaining in the United States. , there is only one active Shaker village: Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, in Maine. Consequently, many of the other Shaker settlements are now museums.

==History==
===Origins===
The Shakers were one of a few religious groups which were formed during the 18th century in the northwest of England; originating out of the Wardley Society. James and Jane Wardley and others broke off from the Quakers in 1747 at a time when the Quakers were weaning themselves away from frenetic spiritual expression. The Wardleys formed the Wardley Society, which was also known as the &quot;Shaking Quakers&quot;.

Future leader Ann Lee and her parents were early members of the sect. This group of &quot;charismatic&quot; Christians became the United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing (USBCSA). Their beliefs were based upon spiritualism and included the notion that they received messages from the Holy Spirit which were expressed during religious revivals. They also experienced what they interpreted as messages from God during silent meditations and became known as &quot;Shaking Quakers&quot; because of the ecstatic nature of their worship services. They believed in the renunciation of sinful acts and that the end of the world was near.

Meetings were first held in Bolton, England, where the articulate preacher, Jane Wardley, urged her followers to:

Other meetings were then held in Manchester, Meretown (also spelled Mayortown), Chester and other places near Manchester. As their numbers grew, members began to be persecuted, mobbed, and stoned; Lee was imprisoned in Manchester. The members looked to women for leadership, believing that the second coming of Christ would be through a woman. In 1770, Ann Lee was revealed in &quot;manifestation of Divine light&quot; to be the second coming of Christ and was called Mother Ann.

===Mother Ann Lee===

Ann Lee joined the Shakers by 1758, then became the leader of the small community. &quot;Mother Ann&quot;, as her followers later called her, claimed numerous revelations regarding the fall of Adam and Eve and its relationship to sexual intercourse. A powerful preacher, she called her followers to confess their sins, give up all their worldly goods, and take up the cross of celibacy and forsake marriage, as part of the renunciation of all &quot;lustful gratifications&quot;.

She said:

Having supposedly received a revelation, on May 19, 1774, Ann Lee and eight of her followers sailed from Liverpool for colonial America. Ann and her husband Abraham Stanley, brother William Lee, niece Nancy Lee, James Whittaker, father and son John Hocknell and Richard Hocknell, James Shephard, and Mary Partington traveled to colonial America and landed in New York City. Abraham Stanley abandoned Ann Lee shortly thereafter and remarried. The remaining Shakers settled in Watervliet, New York, in 1776. Mother Ann&#x27;s hope for the Shakers in America was represented in a vision: &quot;I saw a large tree, every leaf of which shone with such brightness as made it appear like a burning torch, representing the Church of Christ, which will yet be established in this land.&quot; Unable to swear an Oath of Allegiance, as it was against their faith, the members were imprisoned for about six months. Since they were only imprisoned because of their faith, this raised sympathy of citizens and thus helped to spread their religious beliefs. Mother Ann, revealed as the &quot;second coming&quot; of Christ, traveled throughout the eastern states, preaching her gospel views.

===Joseph Meacham and communalism===
After Ann Lee and James Whittaker died, Joseph Meacham (1742–1796) became the leader of the Shakers in 1787, establishing its New Lebanon headquarters. He had been a New Light Baptist minister in Enfield, Connecticut, and was reputed to have, second only to Mother Ann, the spiritual gift of revelation.

Joseph Meacham brought Lucy Wright (1760–1821) into the Ministry to serve with him and together they developed the Shaker form of communal living (religious communism). By 1793 property had been made a &quot;consecrated whole&quot; in each Shaker community.

Shakers developed written covenants in the 1790s. Those who signed the covenant had to confess their sins, consecrate their property and their labor to the society, and live as celibates. If they were married before joining the society, their marriages ended when they joined. A few less-committed Believers lived in &quot;noncommunal orders&quot; as Shaker sympathizers who preferred to remain with their families. The Shakers never forbade marriage for such individuals, but considered it less perfect than the celibate state.

In the 5 years between 1787 and 1792, the Shakers gathered into eight more communities in addition to the Watervliet and New Lebanon villages: Hancock, Harvard, Shirley, and Tyringham Shaker Villages in Massachusetts; Enfield Shaker Village in Connecticut; Canterbury and Enfield in New Hampshire; and Sabbathday Lake and Alfred Shaker Village in Maine.

===Lucy Wright and westward expansion===

After Joseph Meacham died, Lucy Wright continued Ann Lee&#x27;s missionary tradition. Shaker missionaries proselytized at revivals, not only in New England and New York but also farther west. Missionaries such as Issachar Bates and Benjamin Seth Youngs (older brother of Isaac Newton Youngs) gathered hundreds of proselytes into the faith.

On April 12, of 1805 Benjamin Youngs, and two companions, held the first ceremony west of the Allegheny Mountains. It was held at the cabin of James Beedle, East of Lebanon, Ohio. In 2019, the cabin was relocated, by the Warren County Historical Society, to its current site next to Harmon Museum in Lebanon, Ohio.

Mother Lucy Wright introduced new hymns and dances to make sermons more lively. She also helped write Benjamin S. Youngs&#x27; book &quot;The Testimony of Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing&quot; (1808).

Shaker missionaries entered Kentucky and Ohio after the Cane Ridge, Kentucky revival of 1801–1803, which was an outgrowth of the Logan County, Kentucky, Revival of 1800. From 1805 to 1807, they founded Shaker societies at Union Village, Ohio; South Union, Logan County, Kentucky; and Pleasant Hill, Kentucky (in Mercer County, Kentucky). In 1806, a Shaker village, named Watervliet, after the New York town that was the site of the first Shaker settlement, was established in what is today Kettering, Ohio, surviving until 1900 when its remaining adherents joined the Union Village Shaker settlement. In 1824, the Whitewater Shaker Settlement was established in southwestern Ohio. The westernmost Shaker community was located at West Union (called Busro because it was on Busseron Creek) on the Wabash River a few miles north of Vincennes in Knox County, Indiana.

===Era of Manifestations===
The Shaker movement was at its height between 1820 and 1860. It was at this time that the sect had the most members, and the period was considered its &quot;golden age&quot;. It had expanded from New England to the Midwestern states of Indiana and Ohio and Southern state of Kentucky. It was during this period that it became known for its furniture design and craftsmanship. In the late 1830s a spiritual revivalism, the Era of Manifestations was born. It was also known as the &quot;period of Mother&#x27;s work&quot;, for the spiritual revelations that were passed from the late Mother Ann Lee.

The expression of &quot;spirit gifts&quot; or messages were realized in &quot;gift drawings&quot; made by Hannah Cohoon, Polly Reed, Polly Collins, and other Shaker sisters. A number of those drawings remain as important artifacts of Shaker folk art.

Isaac N. Youngs, the scribe and historian for the New Lebanon, New York, Church Family of Shakers, preserved a great deal of information on the era of manifestations, which Shakers referred to as Mother Ann&#x27;s Work, in his Domestic Journal, his diary, Sketches of Visions, and his history, A Concise View of the Church of God.

In addition, Shakers preserved thousands of spirit communications still extant in collections now held by the Berkshire Athenaeum, Fruitlands Museums Library, Hamilton College Library, Hancock Shaker Village, Library of Congress, New York Public Library, New York State Library, the Shaker Library at Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, Shaker Museum Mount Lebanon, Western Reserve Historical Society, Williams College Archives, Winterthur Museum Library, and other repositories.

===American Civil War period===
As pacifists, the Shakers did not believe that it was acceptable to kill or harm others, even in time of war. During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate soldiers found their way to the Shaker communities. Shakers tended to sympathize with the Union but they did feed and care for both Union and Confederate soldiers. President Lincoln exempted Shaker males from military service, and they became some of the first conscientious objectors in American history.

The end of the Civil War brought large changes to the Shaker communities. One of the most important changes was the postwar economy. The Shakers had a hard time competing in the industrialized economy that followed the Civil War. With prosperity falling, converts were hard to find.

===20th century to the present===
By the early 20th century, the once numerous Shaker communities were failing and closing. By mid-century, new federal laws were passed denying control of adoption to religious groups. Today, in the 21st century, the Shaker community that still exists—The Sabbathday Lake Shaker Community—denies that Shakerism was a failed utopian experiment.

Their message, surviving over two centuries in the United States, reads in part as follows:
Shakerism is not, as many would claim, an anachronism; nor can it be dismissed as the final sad flowering of 19th century liberal utopian fervor. Shakerism has a message for this present age–a message as valid today as when it was first expressed. It teaches above all else that God is Love and that our most solemn duty is to show forth that God who is love in the World.

In 1992, Canterbury Shaker Village closed, leaving only Sabbathday Lake open. Eldress Bertha of the Canterbury Village closed their official membership book in 1957, not recognizing the younger people living in other Shaker Communities as members.

On January 2, 2017, Sister Frances Carr died aged 89 at the Sabbathday community, leaving only two remaining Shakers: Brother Arnold Hadd, age 58, and Sister June Carpenter, 77. A profile of the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in September 2024, described Brother Arnold, aged 67 and Sister June, aged 86, preparing to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Ann Lee&#x27;s arrival in New York. Brother Arnold said: “We’ve survived 250 years. We are looking forward as much as our ancestors did to the next — whatever that involves. All we have to do is be ready.”

The Shakers at Sabbathday Lake &quot;stressed the autonomy of each local community&quot; and therefore do accept new converts to Shakerism into their community. This Sabbathday Lake Shaker Community receives around two enquiries every week.

# Mother Lucy Wright (1796–1821)

After 1821, there was no one single leader, but rather a small nucleus of Ministry elders and eldresses with authority over all the Shaker villages, each with their own teams of elders and eldresses who were subordinate to the Ministry.

The Shaker Ministry continued to build the society after Lucy Wright died in 1821:
* Elder Ebenezer Bishop (1768–1849), Elder Rufus Bishop (1774–1852), Eldress Ruth Landon (1775–1850), Eldress Asenath Clark (1821–1857).

Subsequent members of the Shaker Ministry included:
* Elder Daniel Boler (1804–1892), Elder Giles Avery (1815–1890), Eldress Betsy Bates (1798–1869), and Eldress Eliza Ann Taylor (1811–1897).
* Eldress Polly Reed (1818–1881) was also known as an artist who created Shaker gift drawings such as &quot;A present from Mother Lucy to Eliza Ann Taylor&quot;, 1851 (above) in the 1840s and 1850s.
* Eldress Harriet Bullard (1824–1916)
* Elder Frederick William Evans (1858–?)
* Eldress Frances Hall (1947–1957)
* Eldress Emma King (1957–?)
* Eldress Gertrude Soule and Eldress Bertha Lindsay (?–early 1990s)
* Elder Arnold Hadd &amp; Eldress June Carpenter (? – present)

==Theology==

===Dualism===
Shaker theology is based on the idea of the dualism of God as male and female: &quot;So God created him; male and female he created them&quot; (Genesis 1:27). This passage was interpreted as showing the dual nature of the Creator.

===First and second coming===
Shakers believed that Jesus, born of a woman, the son of a Jewish carpenter, was the male manifestation of Christ and the first Christian Church; and that Mother Ann, daughter of an English blacksmith, was the female manifestation of Christ and the second Christian Church (which the Shakers believed themselves to be). She was seen as the Bride made ready for the Bridegroom, and in her, the promises of the Second Coming were fulfilled.

===Nature of God===
Because of the adoptionist view of Christ only becoming divine during his baptism and the dualist idea that God was to be expressed in male and female genders, Shakers are sometimes viewed as being nontrinitarian. However, modern-day Shakers profess the divinity of Christ and claim that Shaker dualism is because &quot;God has no sex in our human understanding of the term; yet being pure spirit He may best be thought of by man with his limited power of comprehension as having the attributes of both maleness and femaleness&quot;. The Trinity is not viewed as being false. Instead, Shakers argue that the Trinity has been misinterpreted for being completely masculine. Ann Lee&#x27;s embodiment of Christ thus completed the Trinity by fulfilling the female aspect of God.

===Ethics===

Adam&#x27;s sin was understood to be sex, which was considered to be an act of impurity. Therefore, marriage was abolished within the body of the Believers in the Second Appearance, which was patterned after the Kingdom of God, in which there would be no marriage or giving in marriage. The four highest Shaker virtues were virgin purity, communalism, confession of sin – without which one could not become a Believer – and separation from the world.

Ann Lee&#x27;s doctrine was simple: confession of sins was the door to the spiritual regeneration, and absolute celibacy was the rule of life. Shakers were so chaste that men and women could not shake hands or pass one another on the stairs.

===Equality===
Enshrined in Shaker doctrine is a belief in racial equality and gender equality.

===Celibacy and children===
Shakers were celibate; procreation was forbidden after they joined the society (except for women who were already pregnant at admission). Children were added to their communities through indenture, adoption, or conversion. Occasionally a foundling was anonymously left on a Shaker doorstep. They welcomed all, often taking in orphans and the homeless. For children, Shaker life was structured, safe and predictable, with no shortage of adults who cared about their young charges.

When Shaker youths, girls and boys, reached the age of 21, they were free to leave or to remain with the Shakers. Unwilling to remain celibate, many chose to leave; today there are thousands of descendants of Shaker-raised seceders.

===Gender roles===

Shaker religion valued women and men equally in religious leadership. The church was hierarchical, and at each level women and men shared authority. This was reflective of the Shaker belief that God was both female and male. They believed men and women were equal in the sight of God, and should be treated equally on earth, too. Thus two Elders and two Eldresses formed the Ministry at the top of the administrative structure. Two lower-ranking Elders and two Eldresses led each family, women overseeing women and men overseeing men. This allowed the continuation of church leadership when there was a shortage of men.

In their labor, Shakers followed traditional gender work-related roles. Their homes were segregated by sex, as were women and men&#x27;s work areas. Women worked indoors spinning, weaving, cooking, sewing, cleaning, washing, and making or packaging goods for sale. In good weather, groups of Shaker women were outdoors, gardening and gathering wild herbs for sale or home consumption. Men worked in the fields doing farm work and in their shops at crafts and trades.
===Worship===

Shakers worshipped in meetinghouses painted white and unadorned; pulpits and decorations were eschewed as worldly things. In meeting, they marched, sang, danced, and sometimes turned, twitched, jerked, or shouted. The earliest Shaker worship services were unstructured, loud, chaotic and emotional. However, Shakers later developed precisely choreographed dances and orderly marches accompanied by symbolic gestures. Many outsiders disapproved of or mocked Shakers&#x27; mode of worship without understanding the symbolism of their movements or the content of their songs.

==Shaker communities==
The Shakers built more than twenty communities in the United States. Women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the first and second Great Awakenings, the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: &quot;The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.&quot; The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.

==Economics==


The communality of the Believers was an economic success, and their cleanliness, honesty and frugality received the highest praise. All Shaker villages ran farms, using the latest scientific methods in agriculture. They raised most of their own food, so farming, and preserving the produce required to feed them through the winter, had to be priorities. Their livestock were fat and healthy, and their barns were commended for convenience and efficiency.
When not doing farm work, Shaker brethren pursued a variety of trades and hand crafts, many documented by Isaac N. Youngs. When not doing housework, Shaker sisters did likewise, spinning, weaving, sewing, and making sale goods—baskets, brushes, bonnets, brooms, fancy goods, and homespun fabric that was known for high quality, but were more famous for their medicinal herbs, garden seeds of the Shaker Seed Company, apple sauce, and knitted garments (Canterbury). Some communities, especially those in New England, produced maple syrup for sale as well.

Shakers ran a variety of businesses to support their communities; many Shaker villages had their own tanneries. The Shaker goal in their labor was perfection. Ann Lee&#x27;s followers preserved her admonitions about work:

Mother Ann also cautioned them against getting into debt.

Shaker craftsmen were known for a style of Shaker furniture that was plain in style, durable, and functional. Shaker chairs were usually mass-produced because a great number of them were needed to seat all the Shakers in a community.

Around the time of the American Civil War, the Shakers at Mount Lebanon, New York, increased their production and marketing of Shaker chairs. They were so successful that several furniture companies produced their own versions of &quot;Shaker&quot; chairs. Because of the quality of their craftsmanship, original Shaker furniture is costly. Shakers won respect and admiration for their productive farms and orderly communities. Their industry brought about many inventions like Babbitt metal, the rotary harrow, the circular saw, the clothespin, the Shaker peg, the flat broom, the wheel-driven washing machine, a machine for setting teeth in textile cards, a threshing machine, metal pens, a new type of fire engine, a machine for matching boards, numerous innovations in waterworks, planing machinery, a hernia truss, silk reeling machinery, small looms for weaving palm leaf, machines for processing broom corn, ball-and-socket tilters for chair legs, and a number of other useful inventions. Even prolific Shaker inventors like Tabitha Babbit did not patent their inventions before or after putting them into practice, which has complicated subsequent efforts by 20th century historians to assign priority.

Shakers were the first large producers of medicinal herbs in the United States, and pioneers in the sale of seeds in paper packets. Brethren grew the crops, but sisters picked, sorted, and packaged their products for sale, so those industries were built on a foundation of women&#x27;s labor in the Shaker partnership between the sexes.
The Shakers believed in the value of hard work and kept comfortably busy. Mother Ann said: &quot;Labor to make the way of God your own; let it be your inheritance, your treasure, your occupation, your daily calling&quot;.

==Architecture and furnishings==
The Shakers&#x27; dedication to hard work and perfection has resulted in a unique range of architecture, furniture and handicraft styles. They designed their furniture with care, believing that making something well was in itself an act of prayer. Before the late 18th century, they rarely fashioned items with elaborate details or extra decoration, but only made things for their intended uses. The ladder-back chair was a popular piece of furniture. Shaker craftsmen made most things out of pine or other inexpensive woods and hence their furniture was light in color and weight.

The earliest Shaker buildings (late 18th – early 19th century) in the northeast were timber or stone buildings built in a plain but elegant New England colonial style. Early 19th-century Shaker interiors are characterized by an austerity and simplicity. For example, they had a &quot;peg rail&quot;, a continuous wooden device like a pelmet with hooks running all along it near the lintel level. They used the pegs to hang up clothes, hats, and very light furniture pieces such as chairs when not in use. The simple architecture of their homes, meeting houses, and barns has had a lasting influence on American architecture and design. There is a collection of furniture and utensils at Hancock Shaker Village outside of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, that is famous for its elegance and practicality.
At the end of the 19th century, however, Shakers adopted some aspects of Victorian decor, such as ornate carved furniture, patterned linoleum, and cabbage-rose wallpaper. Examples are on display in the Hancock Shaker Village Trustees&#x27; Office, a formerly spare, plain building &quot;improved&quot; with ornate additions such as fish-scale siding, bay windows, porches, and a tower.

==Culture==

===Artifacts===
By the middle of the 20th century, as the Shaker communities themselves were disappearing, some American collectors whose visual tastes were formed by the stark aspects of the modernist movement found themselves drawn to the spare artifacts of Shaker culture, in which &quot;form follows function&quot; was also clearly expressed. Kaare Klint, an architect and furniture designer, used styles from Shaker furniture in his work.

Other artifacts of Shaker culture are their spirit drawings, dances, and songs, which are important genres of Shaker folk art. Doris Humphrey, an innovator in technique, choreography, and theory of dance movement, made a full theatrical art with her dance entitled Dance of The Chosen, which depicted Shaker religious fervor.

The largest collection of Shaker artifacts is the Robert and Virginia Jones Shaker collection at Harmon Museum, in Lebanon, Ohio.

===Music===
The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a spiritual &quot;gift&quot; could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred.

Scribes, many of whom had no formal musical training, used a form of music notation called the letteral system. This method used letters of the alphabet, often not positioned on a staff, along with a simple notation of conventional rhythmic values, and has a curious, and coincidental, similarity to some ancient Greek music notation.

Many of the lyrics to Shaker tunes consist of syllables and words from unknown tongues, the musical equivalent of glossolalia. It has been surmised that many of them were imitated from the sounds of Native American languages, as well as from the songs of African slaves, especially in the southernmost of the Shaker communities, but in fact the melodic material is derived from European scales and modes.

Most early Shaker music is monodic, that is to say, composed of a single melodic line with no harmonization. The tunes and scales recall the folksongs of the British Isles, but since the music was written down and carefully preserved, it is &quot;art&quot; music of a special kind rather than folklore. Many melodies are of extraordinary grace and beauty, and the Shaker song repertoire, though still relatively little known, is an important part of the American cultural heritage and of world religious music in general.

Shakers&#x27; earliest hymns were shared by word of mouth and letters circulated among their villages. Many Believers wrote out the lyrics in their own manuscript hymnals. In 1813, they published &quot;Millennial Praises,&quot; a hymnal containing only lyrics.

After the Civil War, the Shakers published hymnbooks with both lyrics and music in conventional four-part harmonies. These works are less strikingly original than the earlier, monodic repertoire. The songs, hymns, and anthems were sung by the Shakers usually at the beginning of their Sunday worship. Their last hymnbook was published in 1908 at Canterbury, New Hampshire.

The surviving Shakers sing songs drawn from both the earlier repertoire and the four part songbooks. They perform all of these unaccompanied, in single-line unison singing. The many recent, harmonized arrangements of older Shaker songs for choirs and instrumental groups mark a departure from traditional Shaker practice.

&quot;Simple Gifts&quot; was composed in 1848 by Elder Joseph Brackett, on or about the time he moved to the Shaker community at Alfred, Maine. English poet and songwriter Sydney Carter used the song as the basis for a hymn in 1963 &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, also referenced as &quot;I Am the Dance&quot;.

Some scholars, such as Daniel W. Patterson and Roger Lee Hall, have compiled books of Shaker songs, and groups have been formed to sing the songs and perform the dances.

The most extensive recordings of the Shakers singing their own music were made between 1960 and 1980 and released on a 2-CD set with illustrated booklet, &quot;Let Zion Move: Music of the Shakers&quot;. Other recordings are available of Shaker songs, both documentation of singing by the Shakers themselves, as well as songs recorded by other groups (see external links). Two widely distributed commercial recordings by The Boston Camerata, &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Golden Harvest&quot; (2000), were recorded at the Shaker community of Sabbathday Lake, Maine, with active cooperation from the surviving Shakers, whose singing can be heard at several points on both recordings.

Aaron Copland&#x27;s 1944 ballet score &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;, written for Martha Graham, uses the Shaker tune &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; as the basis of its finale. Given to Graham with the working title &quot;Ballet for Martha&quot;, it was named by her for the scenario she had in mind, though Copland often said he was thinking of neither Appalachia nor a spring while he wrote it. Shakers did, in fact, worship on Holy Mount in the Appalachians.

&quot;Laboring Songs,&quot; a piece composed by Dan Welcher in 1997 for large wind ensemble, is based upon traditional shaker tunes including &quot;Turn to the Right&quot; and &quot;Come Life, Shaker Life&quot;.

===Works inspired by Shaker culture===

For a Shaker Seminar held in Massachusetts in 1981, composer Roger Lee Hall wrote a pageant of original Shaker poetry and music titled, &quot;The Humble Heart&quot;, featuring singing and dancing by &quot;The New English Song and Daunce Companie&quot;.

Shaker lifestyle and tradition is celebrated in Arlene Hutton&#x27;s play &quot;As It Is in Heaven&quot;, which is a re-creation of a decisive time in the history of the Shakers. The play is written by Arlene Hutton, the pen name of actor/director Beth Lincks. Born in Louisiana and raised in Florida, Lincks was inspired to write the play after visiting the Pleasant Hills Shaker village in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, a restored community that the Shakers occupied for more than a century, before abandoning it in 1927 because of the inability of the sect to attract new converts.

In the early 1960s, American folklorist Robin Evanchuk, after trips to Shaker communities including Sabbathday Lake, created a stage reproduction of a Shaker worship service. It included both the a cappella songs and also the dance-like movements traditionally used in the Shaker worship service. It was performed by the Westwind Dance Ensemble of Los Angeles, the AMAN Folk Ensemble of Los Angeles, and her own dance group, The Liberty Assembly. Performances by the AMAN Folk Ensemble continued until at least 1989, when the Shaker service was included in a concert tour of the AMAN Folk Ensemble that included concerts in the American mid-west, east, and New York City.

Robert Newton Peck&#x27;s 1972 book, &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;, depicts a family that lives by the &quot;Book of Shaker&quot;. They are clearly not traditional Shakers, however, as they live in a family unit separate from others, strive for individual success, and have children.

Novelist John Fowles wrote in 1985 &quot;A Maggot&quot;, a postmodern historical novel culminating in the birth of Ann Lee, and describing early Shakers in England.

Janice Holt Giles depicted a Shaker Community in her novel &quot;The Believers&quot;.

In 2004 the Finnish choreographer Tero Saarinen and Boston Camerata music director Joel Cohen created a live performance work with dance and music entitled &quot;Borrowed Light&quot;. While all the music is Shaker song performed in a largely traditional manner, the dance intermingles only certain elements of Shaker practice and belief with Saarinen&#x27;s original choreographic ideas, and with distinctive costumes and lighting. &quot;Borrowed Light&quot; has been given over 60 performances since 2004 in eight countries, recently (early 2008) in Australia and New Zealand, and most recently (2011) in France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In addition to Doris Humphrey, Martha Graham and Tero Saarinen cited above, choreographers Twyla Tharp (&quot;Sweet Fields&quot;, 1996) and Martha Clarke (&quot;Angel Reapers&quot;, 2011) also set movement to Shaker hymns. Playwright Alfred Uhry collaborated with Martha Clarke on &quot;Angel Reapers&quot; and used Shaker texts as source material. The music of &quot;Angel Reapers&quot; was successfully and uniquely arranged by Music Director Arthur Solari.

In 2009, Toronto-based, American-born poet Damian Rogers released her first volume of poetry, &quot;Paper Radio&quot;. The lifestyle and philosophy of the Shakers and their matriarch Ann Lee are recurring themes in her work.

==Education==

New Lebanon, New York, Shakers began keeping school in 1815. Certified as a public school by the state of New York beginning in 1817, the teachers operated on the Lancasterian system, which was considered advanced for its time. Boys attended class during the winter and the girls in the summer. The first Shaker schools taught reading, spelling, oration, arithmetic and manners, but later diversified their coursework to include music, algebra, astronomy, and agricultural chemistry.

Non-Shaker parents respected the Shakers&#x27; schooling so much that they often took advantage of schools that the Shaker villages provided, sending their children there for an education. State inspectors and other outsiders visited the schools and made favorable comments on teachers and students.

==Modern-day Shakers==

Turnover was high; the group reached maximum size of about 5,000 full members in 1840, and 6,000 believers at the peak of the Shaker movement. The Shaker communities continued to lose members, partly through attrition, since believers did not give birth to children, and also due to economics; products hand-made by Shakers could not compete with mass-produced products and individuals moved to the cities for better livelihoods. There were only 12 Shaker communities left by 1920.

In 1957, after &quot;months of prayer&quot;, Eldresses Gertrude, Emma, and Ida, leaders of the United Society of Believers in Canterbury Shaker Village, voted to close the Shaker Covenant, the document which all new members need to sign to become members of the Shakers in Canterbury Shaker Village.

In 1988, speaking about the three men and women in their 20s and 30s who had become Shakers and were living in the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, Eldress Bertha Lindsay of the other community, the Canterbury Shaker Village, disputed their membership in the society: &quot;To become a Shaker you have to sign a legal document taking the necessary vows and that document, the official covenant, is locked up in our safe. Membership is closed forever.&quot;

However, Shaker covenants lack a &quot;sunset clause&quot; and today&#x27;s Shakers of Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village welcome sincere new converts to Shakerism into the society:

On January 2, 2017, Sister Frances Carr died aged 89 at the Sabbathday community, leaving only two remaining Shakers: Brother Arnold Hadd, age 58, and Sister June Carpenter, 77. In the Spring/Summer 2019 issue of the Shaker newsletter &quot;The Clarion&quot;, the current membership was given as Brother Arnold, Sister June, and Brother Andrew. These remaining Shakers still hope that sincere newcomers will join them. If one wishes to join, they can learn more and watch sermons on their website, maineshakers.com. In September 2024, the New York Times published an article about the last two remaining members of the community.

<doc id="44406" wikidata="Q35811" url="?curid=44406" title="Zoroaster">
<text>Zarathushtra Spitama, more commonly known as Zoroaster or Zarathustra, was an Iranian religious reformer who challenged the tenets of the contemporary Ancient Iranian religion, becoming the spiritual founder of Zoroastrianism. Variously described as a sage or a wonderworker; in the oldest Zoroastrian scriptures, the Gathas, which he is believed to have authored, he is described as a preacher and a poet-prophet. He also had an impact on Heraclitus, Plato, Pythagoras, and the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

He spoke an Eastern Iranian language, named Avestan by scholars after the corpus of Zoroastrian religious texts written in that language. Based on this, it is tentative to place his homeland somewhere in the eastern regions of Greater Iran (perhaps in modern-day Afghanistan or Tajikistan), but his exact birthplace is uncertain.

His life is traditionally dated to sometime around the 7th and 6th centuries BC, making him a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, though most scholars, using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence, suggest a dating to somewhere in the second millennium BC. Zoroastrianism eventually became Iran&#x27;s most prominent religion from around the 6th century BC, enjoying official sanction during the time of the Sassanid Empire, until the 7th century AD, when the religion itself began to decline following the Arab-Muslim conquest of Iran. Zoroaster is credited with authorship of the Gathas as well as the , a series of hymns composed in Old Avestan that cover the core of Zoroastrian thinking. Little is known about Zoroaster; most of his life is known only from these scant texts. By any modern standard of historiography, no evidence can place him into a fixed period and the historicization surrounding him may be a part of a trend from before the 10th century AD that historicizes legends and myths.

==Name and etymology==
Zoroaster&#x27;s name in his native language, Avestan, was probably . His translated name, &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, derives from a later (5th century BC) Greek transcription, (), as used in Xanthus&#x27;s (Fragment 32) and in Plato&#x27;s &quot;First Alcibiades&quot; (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin , and, in later Greek orthographies, as . The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan with the Greek (literally &#x27;undiluted&#x27;) and the BMAC substrate with .

In Avestan, is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ; The element half of the name () is thought to be the Indo-Iranian root for &#x27;camel&#x27;, with the entire name meaning &#x27;he who can manage camels&#x27;. Reconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the Middle Persian (300 BC) , which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts—suggest that might be a zero-grade form of . Subject then to whether derives from or from , several interpretations have been proposed.

If is the original form, it may mean &#x27;with old/aging camels&#x27;, related to Avestic (&quot;cf.&quot; Pashto and Ossetian , &#x27;old&#x27;; Middle Persian , &#x27;old&#x27;):
* &#x27;with angry/furious camels&#x27;: from Avestan , &#x27;angry, furious&#x27;.
* &#x27;who is driving camels&#x27; or &#x27;who is fostering/cherishing camels&#x27;: related to Avestan , &#x27;to drag&#x27;.
* Mayrhofer (1977) proposed an etymology of &#x27;who is desiring camels&#x27; or &#x27;longing for camels&#x27; and related to Vedic Sanskrit , &#x27;to like&#x27;, and perhaps (though ambiguous) also to Avestan .
* &#x27;with yellow camels&#x27;: parallel to Younger Avestan .

The interpretation of the () in the Avestan was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the is an irregular development: as a rule, (a first element that ends in a dental consonant) should have Avestan or as a development from it. Why this is not so for has not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan with its was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis. All present-day Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the Middle Iranian variants of , which, in turn, all reflect Avestan&#x27;s fricative .

In Middle Persian, the name is , in Parthian , in Manichaean Middle Persian , in Early New Persian , and in modern (New Persian), the name is .

The name is attested in Classical Armenian sources as (often with the variant ). The most important of these testimonies were provided by the Armenian authors Eznik of Kolb, Elishe, and Movses Khorenatsi. The spelling was formed through an older form which started with , a fact which the German Iranologist Friedrich Carl Andreas (1846–1930) used as evidence for a Middle Persian spoken form . Based on this assumption, Andreas even went so far to form conclusions from this also for the Avestan form of the name. However, the modern Iranologist Rüdiger Schmitt rejects Andreas&#x27;s assumption, and states that the older form which started with was just influenced by Armenian (&#x27;wrong, unjust, idle&#x27;), which therefore means that &quot;the name must have been reinterpreted in an anti-Zoroastrian sense by the Armenian Christians&quot;. Furthermore, Schmitt adds: &quot;it cannot be excluded, that the (Parthian or) Middle Persian form, which the Armenians took over ( or the like), was merely metathesized to . &quot;.

==Date==

There is no consensus on the dating of Zoroaster. The Avesta gives no direct information about it, while historical sources are conflicting. Some scholars base their date reconstruction on the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, while others use internal evidence. While many scholars today consider a date around 1000 BC to be the most likely, others still consider a range of dates between 1500 and 500 BC to be possible.

===Classical scholarship===
Classical scholarship in the 6th to 4th century BC believed he existed 6,000 years before Xerxes I&#x27;s invasion of Greece in 480 BC (Xanthus, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Hermippus), which is a possible misunderstanding of the Zoroastrian four cycles of 3,000 years (i.e. 12,000 years). This belief is recorded by Diogenes Laërtius, and variant readings could place it 600 years before Xerxes I, somewhere before 1000 BC. However, Diogenes also mentions Hermodorus&#x27;s belief that Zoroaster lived 5,000 years before the Trojan War, which would mean he lived around 6200 BC. The 10th-century Suda provides a date of 500 years before the Trojan War. Pliny the Elder cited Eudoxus which placed his death 6,000 years before Plato, . Other pseudo-historical constructions are those of Aristoxenus who recorded Zaratas the Chaldeaean to have taught Pythagoras in Babylon, or lived at the time of mythological Ninus and Semiramis. According to Pliny the Elder, there were two Zoroasters. The first lived thousands of years ago, while the second accompanied Xerxes I in the invasion of Greece in 480 BC. Some scholars propose that the chronological calculation for Zoroaster was developed by Persian magi in the 4th century BC, and as the early Greeks learned about him from the Achaemenids, this indicates they did not regard him as a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, but as a remote figure.

===Zoroastrian and Muslim scholarship===
Some later pseudo-historical and Zoroastrian sources (the , which references a date &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot;) place Zoroaster in the 6th century BC, which coincided with the accounts by Ammianus Marcellinus from the 4th century AD. The traditional Zoroastrian date originates in the period immediately following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC. The Seleucid rulers who gained power following Alexander&#x27;s death instituted an &quot;Age of Alexander&quot; as the new calendrical epoch. This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an &quot;Age of Zoroaster&quot;. To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by (erroneously, according to Mary Boyce some even identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa) counting back the length of successive generations, until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot;. This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century Arabic and Pahlavi texts of Zoroastrian tradition, like the 10th century Al-Masudi who cited a prophecy from a lost Avestan book in which Zoroaster foretold the Empire&#x27;s destruction in 300 years, but the religion would last for 1,000 years.

===Modern scholarship===
In modern scholarship, two main approaches can be distinguished: a late dating to the 7th and 6th centuries BC, based on the indigenous Zoroastrian tradition, and an early dating, which places his life more generally in the 15th to 9th centuries BC.

====Late date====
Some scholars propose a period between 7th and 6th century BC, for example, or 559–522 BC. The latest possible date is the mid 6th century BC, at the time of Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s Darius I, or his predecessor Cyrus the Great. This date gains credence mainly from attempts to connect figures in Zoroastrian texts to historical personages; thus some have postulated that the mythical Vishtaspa who appears in an account of Zoroaster&#x27;s life was Darius I&#x27;s father, also named Vishtaspa (or Hystaspes in Greek). However, if this was true, it seems unlikely that the Avesta would not mention that Vishtaspa&#x27;s son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, or that this key fact about Darius&#x27;s father would not be mentioned in the Behistun Inscription. It is also possible that Darius I&#x27;s father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by Arsames.

====Early date====
Scholars such as Mary Boyce (who dated Zoroaster to somewhere between 1700 and 1000 BC) used linguistic and socio-cultural evidence to place Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BC (or 1200 and 900 BC). The basis of this theory is primarily proposed on linguistic similarities between the Old Avestan language of the Zoroastrian Gathas and the Sanskrit of the Rigveda (–1100 BC), a collection of early Vedic hymns. Both texts are considered to have a common archaic Indo-Iranian origin. The Gathas portray an ancient Stone-Bronze Age bipartite society of warrior-herdsmen and priests (compared to Bronze tripartite society; some conjecture that it depicts the Yaz culture), and that it is thus implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could have been composed more than a few centuries apart. These scholars suggest that Zoroaster lived in an isolated tribe or composed the Gathas before the 1200–1000 BC migration by the Iranians from the steppe to the Iranian Plateau. The shortfall of the argument is the vague comparison, and the archaic language of Gathas does not necessarily indicate time difference.

It has been suggested by Silk Road Seattle, using its own interpretations of Victor H. Mair&#x27;s writings on the topic that Zoroaster could have been born in the 2nd millennium BC. 

Almut Hintze, the British Library, and the European Research Council have dated Zoroaster to roughly 3,500 years ago, in the 2nd millennium BC.

==Place==

The birthplace of Zoroaster is also unknown, and the language of the Gathas is not similar to the proposed north-western and north-eastern regional dialects of Persia. It is also suggested that he was born in one of the two areas and later lived in the other area.

 9 and 17 cite the Ditya River in Airyanem Vaējah (Middle Persian ) as Zoroaster&#x27;s home and the scene of his first appearance. The Avesta (both Old and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian tribes such as the Medes, Persians, or even Parthians. The refers to some Iranian peoples that are unknown in the Greek and Achaemenid sources about the 6th and 5th century BC Eastern Iran. The contain 17 regional names, most of which are located in north-eastern and eastern Iran.

However, in 59.18, the , or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood, is said to reside in &#x27;Ragha&#x27; (Badakhshan). In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, this &#x27;Ragha&#x27; and with many other places appear as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is Arachosia), the , or &quot;Primordial Creation&quot;, (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in Media (medieval Rai). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning &#x27;plain, hillside.&#x27;

Apart from these indications in Middle Persian sources that are open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zoroaster. There are many Greek accounts of Zoroaster, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median Zoroaster; Ctesias located him in Bactria, Diodorus Siculus placed him among Ariaspai (in Sistan), Cephalion and Justin suggest east of greater Iran whereas Pliny and Origen suggest west of Iran as his birthplace. Moreover, they have the suggestion that there has been more than one Zoroaster.

On the other hand, in post-Islamic sources Shahrastani (1086–1153), an Iranian writer originally from Shahristān, in present-day Turkmenistan, proposed that Zoroaster&#x27;s father was from Atropatene (also in Medea) and his mother was from Rey. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow to the various regions which all claimed that Zoroaster originated from homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there. Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical Persia also consider Azerbaijan as the birthplace of Zarathustra.

By the late 20th century, most scholars had settled on an origin in eastern Greater Iran. Gnoli proposed Sistan, Baluchistan (though in a much wider scope than the present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for Bactria and Chorasmia; Khlopin suggests the Tedzen Delta in present-day Turkmenistan. Sarianidi considered the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex region as &quot;the native land of the Zoroastrians and, probably, of Zoroaster himself.&quot; Boyce includes the steppes to the west from the Volga. The medieval &quot;from Media&quot; hypothesis is no longer taken seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and others.

The 2005 &quot;Encyclopedia Iranica&quot; article on the history of Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with &quot;while there is general agreement that he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative&quot;.

==Life==
Zoroaster is recorded as the son of Pourushaspa of the Spitama family, and Dugdōw, while his great-grandfather was Haēčataspa. All the names appear appropriate to the nomadic tradition. His father&#x27;s name means &#x27;possessing gray horses&#x27; (with the word meaning &#x27;horse&#x27;), while his mother&#x27;s means &#x27;milkmaid&#x27;. According to the tradition, he had four brothers, two older and two younger, whose names are given in much later Pahlavi work.

Zoroaster&#x27;s training for priesthood probably started very early around seven years of age. He became a priest probably around the age of 15, and according to Gathas, gaining knowledge from other teachers and personal experience from traveling when he left his parents at age 20. By the age of 30, Zoroaster experienced a revelation during a spring festival; on the river bank he saw a shining being, who revealed himself as (Good Purpose) and taught him about (Wise Lord) and five other radiant figures. Zoroaster soon became aware of the existence of two primal spirits, the second being (Destructive Spirit), with opposing concepts of (order) and (deception). Thus he decided to spend his life teaching people to seek . He received further revelations and saw a vision of the seven , and his teachings were collected in the and the .

Eventually, at the age of about 42, Zoroaster received the patronage of queen Hutaosa and a ruler named Vishtaspa, an early adherent of Zoroastrianism (possibly from Bactria according to the Shahnameh).

According to the tradition, he lived for many years after Vishtaspa&#x27;s conversion, managed to establish a faithful community, and married three times. His first two wives bore him three sons, Isat Vâstra, Urvatat Nara, and Hvare Chithra, and three daughters, Freni, Thriti, and Pouruchista. His third wife, Hvōvi, was childless. Zoroaster died when he was 77 years and 40 days old. There are conflicting traditions on Zoroaster&#x27;s manner of death. The most common is that he was murdered by a (priest of the old religion) named Brādrēs, while performing at an altar. The , and the epic , ascribe his death to a Turanian soldier named Baraturish, potentially a spin on the same figure, while other traditions combine both accounts or hold that he died of old age.

=== Cypress of Kashmar ===
The Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today&#x27;s Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King Vishtaspa to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya al-Qazwini, King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his (&#x27;The Wonders of Creatures and the Marvels of Creation&#x27;), he further describes how the Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 AD) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very great sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkic soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.

==Influences==
===In Christianity===
Athanasius Kircher identified Zoroaster with Ham. The French figurist Jesuit missionary to China Joachim Bouvet thought that Zoroaster, the Chinese cultural hero Fuxi and Hermes Trismegistus were actually the Biblical patriarch Enoch.

===In Islam===

The &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; claims that the stories of Zoroaster&#x27;s life were attributed to him by quoting stories from Christianity and Judaism, but the most quotations were from Islam after the entry of Muslims into Persia, as it was a means for the Zoroastrian clergy to strengthen their religion.

The orientalist Arthur Christensen in his book &quot;&quot;Iran During The Sassanid Era&quot;&quot;, mentioned that the sources dating back to the era of the Sasanian state in ancient Persian that refer to the Zoroastrian doctrine do not match the sources that appeared after the collapse of the state, such as the Pahlavi source and others. The reason is that because of the fall of the Sasanian state, the Zoroastrian clerics tried to save their religion from extinction through modifying it to resemble the religion of Muslims to retain followers in the Zoroastrian religion.

The Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies comments that the Islamic conquest of Persia caused a huge impact on the Zoroastrian doctrine.

This provides an explanation of why a number of parallels have been drawn between Zoroastrian teachings and Islam. Such parallels include the evident similarities between Amesha Spenta and the archangel Gabriel, praying five times a day, covering one&#x27;s head during prayer, and the mention of Thamud and Iram of the Pillars in the Quran.

The Sabians, who believed in free will coincident with Zoroastrians, are also mentioned in the Quran 22:17.

====Muslim scholastic views====

Like the Greeks of classical antiquity, Islamic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic , collective ). The 11th-century Cordoban Ibn Hazm (Zahiri school) contends that the designation &quot;[follower] of the Scripture [of God]&quot; cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. Citing the authority of the 8th-century al-Kalbi, the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian al-Tabari (I, 648) reports that Zaradusht bin Isfiman (an Arabic adaptation of &quot;Zarathushtra Spitama&quot;) was an inhabitant of Israel and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet Jeremiah. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. Elisha&#x27;s servant Gehazi in Jewish scripture). According to Ibn Kathir, Zoroaster came into conflict with Jeremiah which resulted in angry Jeremiah cast a curse upon Zoroaster, causing him to suffer Leprosy, and exiling him. Zoroaster later moved to a place of modern-day Azerbaijan which ruled by Bashtaasib (Vishtaspa), governor of Nebuchadnezzar, and spread his teaching of Zoroastrianism there. Bashtaasib then followed his teaching, forces the inhabitants of Persia to convert to Zoroastrianism and killed those who refused.

Ibn Kathir has quoted the original narrative was borrowed from Tabari&#x27;s record of the &quot;History of Jerusalem&quot;. He also mentioned that Zoroastrian was synonymous with Majus.

Sibt ibn al-Jawzi instead stated that some older narration said that Zoroaster was a former disciple of Uzair.

Al-Tabari (I, 681–683) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage&#x27;s Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been ) to the Magian religion.

The 12th-century heresiographer al-Shahrastani describes the Majusiya into three sects, the (an otherwise undocumented sect that – per Sharastani – seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman&#x27;s &quot;non-reality&quot;), the and the , among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: &quot;They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform.&quot; (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5–7. 50–54)

====Ahmadiyya view====
The Ahmadiyya Community views Zoroaster as a Prophet and describe the expressions of the all-good Ahura Mazda and evil Ahriman as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will.

===In Manichaeism===

Manichaeism considered Zoroaster to be a figure in a line of prophets of which Mani (216–276) was the culmination. Zoroaster&#x27;s ethical dualism is—to an extent—incorporated in Manichaeism&#x27;s doctrine which, unlike Mani&#x27;s thoughts, viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster&#x27;s own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.

===In the Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
Zoroaster appears in the Bahá&#x27;í Faith as a &quot;Manifestation of God&quot;, one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity. Zoroaster thus shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and the founder of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, saw Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh as the fulfillment of a post-Sassanid Zoroastrian prophecy that saw a return of Sassanid emperor Bahram; Effendi also stated that Zoroaster lived roughly 1000 years before Jesus.

==Philosophy==
In the , Zoroaster sees the human condition as the mental struggle between and . The cardinal concept of —which is highly nuanced and difficult to translate—is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of (who is ), creation (that is ), existence (that is ), and as the condition for free will.

The purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain and align itself to . For humankind, this occurs through active ethical participation in life, ritual, and the exercise of constructive/good thoughts, words, and deeds.

Elements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on Judaism and Platonism and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy. Among the classic Greek philosophers, Heraclitus is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster&#x27;s thinking.

In 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zoroaster as first in the chronology of philosophers. Zoroaster&#x27;s impact lingers today due in part to the system of religious ethics he founded called . The word is Avestan and is translated as &#x27;Worship of Wisdom/Mazda&#x27; in English. The encyclopedia Natural History (Pliny) claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with Pythagoras, used a similar term, philosophy, or &quot;love of wisdom&quot; to describe the search for ultimate truth.

Zoroaster emphasized the freedom of the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one&#x27;s deeds. This personal choice to accept and shun is one&#x27;s own decision and not a dictate of . For Zoroaster, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy, doing good works, or conducting good rituals) one increases in the world and in themselves, celebrating the divine order, and coming a step closer on the everlasting road to . Thus, mankind are not the slaves or servants of , but can make a personal choice to be co-workers, thereby perfecting the world as saoshyants (&quot;world-perfecters&quot;) and eventually achieving the status of an (&quot;master of &quot;).

==Iconography==
Although a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show him performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely present him in white vestments (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a collection of unbound rods or twigs, known as a (Avestan; Middle Persian ), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the Avesta. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the —usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull&#x27;s head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point. Alternatively, this could be an Islamic influence, drawing parallels between both religions&#x27; conception of the oneness of God.

Zoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of Jesus.
Many modern depictions of Zoroaster derive from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving at Taq-e Bostan. In this depiction, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of either Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a in hand and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly thought to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra.

==Western references to Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism==
===In classical antiquity===
The Greeks—in the Hellenistic sense of the term—had an understanding of Zoroaster as expressed by Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Agathias that saw him, at the core, to be the &quot;prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples,&quot; Beck notes that &quot;the rest was mostly fantasy&quot;. Zoroaster was set in the ancient past, six to seven millennia before the Common Era, and was described as a king of Bactria or a Babylonian (or teacher of Babylonians), and with a biography typical of a Neopythagorean sage, i.e. having a mission preceded by ascetic withdrawal and enlightenment. However, at first mentioned in the context of dualism, in Moralia, Plutarch presents Zoroaster as &quot;Zaratras,&quot; not realizing the two to be the same, and he is described as a &quot;teacher of Pythagoras&quot;.

Zoroaster has also been described as a sorcerer-astrologerthe creator of both magic and astrology. Deriving from that image, and reinforcing it, was a &quot;mass of literature&quot; attributed to him and that circulated the Mediterranean world from the 3rd century BC to the end of antiquity and beyond.

The language of that literature was predominantly Greek, though at one stage or another various parts of it passed through Aramaic, Syriac, Coptic, or Latin. Its ethos and cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and &quot;the ascription of literature to sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid for authority and a fount of legitimizing &quot;alien wisdom&quot;. Zoroaster and the magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it.&quot; The attributions to &quot;exotic&quot; names (not restricted to magians) conferred an &quot;authority of a remote and revelatory wisdom.&quot;

Among the named works attributed to &quot;Zoroaster&quot; is a treatise &quot;On Nature&quot; (), which appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The framework is a retelling of Plato&#x27;s Myth of Er, with Zoroaster taking the place of the original hero. While Porphyry imagined Pythagoras listening to Zoroaster&#x27;s discourse, &quot;On Nature&quot; has the Sun in middle position, which was how it was understood in the 3rd century. In contrast, Plato&#x27;s 4th-century BC version had the Sun in second place above the Moon. Colotes accused Plato of plagiarizing Zoroaster, and Heraclides Ponticus wrote a text titled &quot;Zoroaster&quot; based on his perception of &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; philosophy, in order to express his disagreement with Plato on natural philosophy. With respect to substance and content in &quot;On Nature&quot; only two facts are known: that it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that Necessity (&quot;Ananké&quot;) was mentioned by name and that she was in the air.

Pliny the Elder names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (&quot;Natural History&quot; 30.2.3). &quot;However, a principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds.&quot; That &quot;dubious honor&quot; went to the &quot;fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.&quot; Although Pliny calls him the inventor of magic, the Roman does not provide a &quot;magician&#x27;s persona&quot; for him. Moreover, the little &quot;magical&quot; teaching that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest example being from the 14th century.

Association with astrology according to Roger Beck, were based on his Babylonian origin, and Zoroaster&#x27;s Greek name was identified at first with star-worshiping (, &#x27;star sacrificer&quot;) and, with the , even as the &#x27;living&#x27; star. Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living () flux () of fire from the star () which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him.

The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratras or Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos. Pythagoreans considered the mathematicians to have studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia. Lydus, in &quot;On the Months&quot;, attributes the creation of the seven-day week to &quot;the Babylonians in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes,&quot; and who did so because there were seven planets. Lucian of Samosata, in &quot;Mennipus&quot; 6, reports deciding to journey to Babylon &quot;to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster&#x27;s disciples and successors,&quot; for their opinion.

While the division along the lines of Zoroaster/astrology and Ostanes/magic is an &quot;oversimplification, the descriptions do at least indicate what the works are &quot;; they were not expressions of Zoroastrian doctrine, they were not even expressions of what the Greeks and Romans &quot; the doctrines of Zoroastrianism to have been&quot;. The assembled fragments do not even show noticeable commonality of outlook and teaching among the several authors who wrote under each name.

Almost all Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is now lost, and of the attested texts—with only one exception—only fragments have survived. Pliny&#x27;s 2nd- or 3rd-century attribution of &quot;two million lines&quot; to Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the Library of Alexandria. This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because no one before Pliny refers to literature by &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, and on the authority of the 2nd-century Galen of Pergamon and from a 6th-century commentator on Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient authors.

The exception to the fragmentary evidence (i.e. reiteration of passages in works of other authors) is a complete Coptic tractate titled (after the first-person narrator) discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945. A three-line cryptogram in the colophones following the 131-page treatise identify the work as &quot;words of truth of Zostrianos. God of Truth []. Words of Zoroaster.&quot; Invoking a &quot;God of Truth&quot; might seem Zoroastrian, but there is otherwise &quot;nothing noticeably Zoroastrian&quot; about the text and &quot;in content, style, ethos and intention, its affinities are entirely with the congeners among the Gnostic tractates.&quot;

Another work circulating under the name of &quot;Zoroaster&quot; was the (or ), and which ran to five volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The title and fragments suggest that it was an astrological handbook, &quot;albeit a very varied one, for the making of predictions.&quot; A third text attributed to Zoroaster is &quot;On Virtue of Stones&quot; (), of which nothing is known other than its extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster &#x27;sang&#x27; it (from which Cumont and Bidez conclude that it was in verse). Numerous other fragments preserved in the works of other authors are attributed to &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, but the titles of those books are not mentioned.

These pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas. The &quot;Oracles of Hystaspes&quot;, by &quot;Hystaspes&quot;, another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources. Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place, Pliny had sworn in the name of Hercules that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth. This notion of Zoroaster&#x27;s laughter also appears in the 9th– to 11th-century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition, and for a time it was assumed that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources. Pliny also records that Zoroaster&#x27;s head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom. The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers, and the provenance of other descriptions are clear. For instance, Plutarch&#x27;s description of its dualistic theologies reads thus: &quot;Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy. He used to call the one Horomazes and the other Areimanius&quot;.

===In the modern era===

An early reference to Zoroaster in English literature occur in the writings of the physician-philosopher Sir Thomas Browne who asserted in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643):

In E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s novel &quot;Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober&quot; (1819), the mage Prosper Alpanus states that Professor Zoroaster was his teacher.

In his seminal work &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; (1885), the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche uses the native Iranian name Zarathustra, which has a significant meaning as he had used the familiar Greek-Latin name in his earlier works. It is believed that Nietzsche invents a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche&#x27;s own ideas about morality. By choosing the name of &#x27;Zarathustra&#x27; as prophet of his philosophy, as he has expressed clearly, he followed the paradoxical aim of paying homage to the original Iranian prophet and reversing his teachings at the same time. The original Zoroastrian world view interprets being essentially on a moralistic basis and depicts the world as an arena for the struggle of the two fundamentals of being, Good and Evil, represented in two antagonistic divine figures. On the contrary, Nietzsche wants his philosophy to be &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;.

== Notable influence on modern Western culture ==
The German composer Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone-poem (1896) was inspired by Nietzsche&#x27;s book.
A sculpture of Zoroaster by Edward Clark Potter, representing ancient Persian judicial wisdom and dating to 1896, towers over the Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. A sculpture of Zoroaster is included among other prominent religious figures in a procession representing major faith traditions on the south side of Rockefeller Memorial Chapel at the University of Chicago. It features figures from Abraham to the Reformation, illustrating a historical continuum of religious thought that includes the likes of Zoroaster, Moses, Plato and others.

<doc id="44408" wikidata="Q907293" url="?curid=44408" title="Microphone array">
<text>A microphone array is any number of microphones operating in tandem. There are many applications:

* Systems for extracting voice input from ambient noise (notably telephones, speech recognition systems, hearing aids)
* Surround sound and related technologies
* Binaural recording
* Locating objects by sound: acoustic source localization, e.g., military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.
* High fidelity original recordings
* Environmental noise monitoring
* Robotic navigation (acoustic SLAM)

Typically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones, directional microphones, or a mix of omnidirectional and directional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form. Arrays may also be formed using numbers of very closely spaced microphones. Given a fixed physical relationship in space between the different individual microphone transducer array elements, simultaneous DSP (digital signal processor) processing of the signals from each of the individual microphone array elements can create one or more &quot;virtual&quot; microphones. Different algorithms permit the creation of virtual microphones with extremely complex virtual polar patterns and even the possibility to steer the individual lobes of the virtual microphones patterns so as to home-in-on, or to reject, particular sources of sound. The application of these algorithms can produce varying levels of accuracy when calculating source level and location, and as such, care should be taken when deciding how the individual lobes of the virtual microphones are derived.

In case the array consists of omnidirectional microphones they accept sound from all directions, so electrical signals of the microphones contain the information about the sounds coming from all directions. Joint processing of these sounds allows selecting the sound signal coming from the given direction. 
An array of 1020 microphones, the largest in the world until August 21, 2014, was built by researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Currently the largest microphone array in the world was constructed by DLR, the German Aerospace Center, in 2024. Their array consists of 7200 microphones with an aperture of 8 m x 6 m.

== Soundfield microphone ==
The soundfield microphone system is a well-established example of the use of a microphone array in professional sound recording.

<text>Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye or Madras eye, is inflammation of the conjunctiva and the inner surface of the eyelid. It makes the eye appear pink or reddish. Pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness may occur. The affected eye may have increased tears or be &quot;stuck shut&quot; in the morning. Swelling of the sclera may also occur. Itching is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes. 

The most common infectious causes in adults are viral, whereas in children bacterial causes predominate. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold. Both viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people. Allergies to pollen or animal hair are also a common cause. Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally, a sample of the discharge is sent for culture.
Prevention is partly by handwashing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment. Most cases due to a bacterial infection also resolve without treatment; however, antibiotics can shorten the illness. People who wear contact lenses and those whose infection is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia should be treated. Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamines or mast cell inhibitor drops.

About 3 to 6 million people get acute conjunctivitis each year in the United States. Typically, people get better in one or two weeks. If visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light or signs of herpes occur, or if symptoms do not improve after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required. Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as neonatal conjunctivitis, may also require specific treatment.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Red eye, swelling of the conjunctiva, and watering of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. However, the pupils should be normally reactive, and the visual acuity normal.

Conjunctivitis is identified by inflammation of the conjunctiva, manifested by irritation and redness. Examination using a slit lamp (biomicroscope) may improve diagnostic accuracy. Examination of the palpebral conjunctiva, that overlying the inner aspects of the eyelids, is usually more diagnostic than examination of the bulbal conjunctiva, that overlying the sclera.

=== Viral ===

Approximately 80% of cases of conjunctivitis in adults and less than 20% in children are due to viruses, with 65% to 90% of these cases being attributed to adenoviruses.
Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, or a sore throat. Other associated signs may include pre-auricular lymph node swelling and contact with another person with a red eye. Eye pain may be present if the cornea is also involved. Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching. The discharge in viral conjunctivitis is usually (but not always) watery in nature. The infection usually begins in one eye but may spread easily to the other eye.

Viral conjunctivitis manifests as a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva which may be mistaken for iritis, but corroborative signs on microscopy, particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, and sometimes a punctate keratitis are seen.

=== Allergic ===

Allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy. The specific allergens may differ among patients. Symptoms result from the release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells, and consist of redness (mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels), swelling of the conjunctiva, itching, and increased production of tears.

=== Bacterial ===
Bacteria are responsible for approximately 70% of conjunctivitis in children and less than 20% of cases in adults. Common bacteria responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis are &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; including Staph aureus, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; such as strep pneumoniae, &quot;Haemophilus&quot; species and Moraxella catarrhalis. Less commonly, &quot;Chlamydia&quot; spp. and Niesseria species (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis) may be the cause. Infection with &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; may also cause conjunctivitis, particularly in the neonatal subtype ophthalmia neonatorum. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually causes a rapid onset of conjunctival redness, swelling of the eyelid, and a sticky discharge. Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days. Conjunctivitis due to common pus-producing bacteria causes marked grittiness or irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish discharge that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep. Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. The gritty or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough that patients may insist that they have a foreign body in the eye.

Bacteria such as &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; or &quot;Moraxella&quot; spp. can cause a nonexudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva. Pseudomembranes consist of a combination of inflammatory cells and exudates and adhere loosely to the conjunctiva, while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away. Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, β-hemolytic streptococci, and &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;. &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of unimmunized children.

=== Chemical ===
Chemical eye injury may result when an acidic or alkaline substance gets in the eye. Alkali burns are typically worse than acidic burns. Mild burns produce conjunctivitis, while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white. Litmus paper may be used to test for chemical causes. When a chemical cause has been confirmed, the eye or eyes should be flushed until the pH is in the range 6–8. Anaesthetic eye drops can be used to decrease the pain.

Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is primarily marked by redness. If due to a chemical splash, it is often present in only the lower conjunctival sac. With some chemicals, above all with caustic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, necrosis of the conjunctiva marked by a deceptively white eye due to vascular closure may occur, followed by sloughing off of the dead epithelium. A slit lamp examination is likely to show evidence of anterior uveitis.

=== Biomarkers ===
Omics technologies have been used to identify biomarkers that inform on the emergence and progression of conjunctivitis. For example, in chronic inflammatory cicatrizing conjunctivitis, active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations, from which potential biomarkers linked to inflammatory processes were identified.

=== Other ===
Inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn is a conjunctivitis that may be caused by the bacterium &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;, and may lead to acute, purulent conjunctivitis. However, it is usually self-healing.

== Causes ==
Infective conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a virus. Bacterial infections, allergies, other irritants, and dryness are also common causes. Both bacterial and viral infections are contagious, passing from person to person or spread through contaminated objects or water. Contact with contaminated fingers is a common cause of conjunctivitis. Bacteria may also reach the conjunctiva from the edges of the eyelids and the surrounding skin, from the nasopharynx, from infected eye drops or contact lenses, from the genitals or the bloodstream. Infection by human adenovirus accounts for 65% to 90% of cases of viral conjunctivitis.

=== Viral ===
Adenoviruses are the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis, caused by herpes simplex viruses, can be serious and requires treatment with aciclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.

=== Bacterial ===
The most common causes of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Though very rare, hyperacute cases are usually caused by &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; or &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;. Chronic cases of bacterial conjunctivitis are those lasting longer than 3 weeks, and are typically caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot;, &quot;Moraxella lacunata&quot;, or Gram-negative enteric flora.

=== Allergic ===
Conjunctivitis may also be caused by allergens such as pollen, perfumes, cosmetics, smoke, dust mites, Balsam of Peru, or eye drops. The most frequent cause of conjunctivitis is allergic conjunctivitis and it affects 15% to 40% of the population. Allergic conjunctivitis accounts for 15% of eye related primary care consultations; most including seasonal exposures in the spring and summer or perpetual conditions.

=== Other ===
* Computer vision syndrome
* Dry eye syndrome
* Reactive arthritis: Conjunctivitis is part of the triad of reactive arthritis, which is thought to be caused by autoimmune cross-reactivity following certain bacterial infections. Reactive arthritis is highly associated with HLA-B27. Conjunctivitis is associated with the autoimmune disease relapsing polychondritis.

== Diagnosis ==
Cultures are not often taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, but no response to topical antibiotics is seen, swabs for bacterial culture should be taken and tested. Viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters.

A patch test is used to identify the causative allergen in allergic conjunctivitis.

Although conjunctival scrapes for cytology can be useful in detecting chlamydial and fungal infections, allergies, and dysplasia, they are rarely done because of the cost and the general dearth of laboratory staff experienced in handling ocular specimens. Conjunctival incisional biopsy is occasionally done when granulomatous diseases (&quot;e.g.&quot;, sarcoidosis) or dysplasia are suspected.

=== Classification ===
Conjunctivitis may be classified either by cause or by extent of the inflamed area.

==== Causes ====
* Allergy
* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Chemicals
* Autoimmune

Neonatal conjunctivitis is often grouped separately from bacterial conjunctivitis because it is caused by different bacteria than the more common cases of bacterial conjunctivitis.

==== By extent of involvement ====
Blepharoconjunctivitis is the dual combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids).

Keratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis and keratitis (corneal inflammation).

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Some more serious conditions can present with a red eye, such as infectious keratitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or iritis. These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist. Signs of such conditions include decreased vision, significantly increased sensitivity to light, inability to keep the eye open, a pupil that does not respond to light, or a severe headache with nausea. Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge. Mild photophobia is common. However, if any of these symptoms is prominent, considering other diseases such as glaucoma, uveitis, keratitis, and even meningitis or carotico-cavernous fistula is important.

A more comprehensive differential diagnosis for the red or painful eye includes:
* Corneal abrasion
* Subconjunctival hemorrhage
* Pinguecula
* Blepharitis
* Dacryocystitis
* Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye)
* Keratitis
* Herpes simplex
* Herpes zoster
* Episcleritis – an inflammatory condition that produces a similar appearance to conjunctivitis, but without discharge or tearing
* Uveitis
* Acute angle-closure glaucoma
* Endophthalmitis
* Orbital cellulitis

== Prevention ==
The most effective prevention is good hygiene, especially avoiding rubbing the eyes with infected hands. Vaccination against some of the causative pathogens such as &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, pneumococcus, and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; is also effective.

Povidone-iodine eye solution has been found to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis. It is becoming more commonly used globally because of its low cost.

== Management ==
Conjunctivitis resolves in 65% of cases without treatment, within 2–5 days. The prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases.

=== Viral ===
Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own and does not require any specific treatment. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn) may be used to help with the symptoms. Povidone-iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008, evidence to support it was poor.

=== Allergic ===
For allergic conjunctivitis, cool water poured over the face with the head inclined downward constricts capillaries, and artificial tears sometimes relieve discomfort in mild cases. In more severe cases, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and antihistamines may be prescribed. Persistent allergic conjunctivitis may also require topical steroid drops.

=== Bacterial ===
Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves without treatment. Topical antibiotics may be needed only if no improvement is observed after 3 days. No serious effects were noted either with or without treatment. Because antibiotics do speed healing in bacterial conjunctivitis, their use may be considered. Antibiotics are also recommended for those who wear contact lenses, are immunocompromised, have disease which is thought to be due to chlamydia or gonorrhea, have a fair bit of pain, or have copious discharge. Gonorrheal or chlamydial infections require both oral and topical antibiotics.

The choice of antibiotic varies based on the strain or suspected strain of bacteria causing the infection. Fluoroquinolones, sodium sulfacetamide, or trimethoprim/polymyxin may be used, typically for 7–10 days. Cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin, as long as the strain is sensitive to penicillin.

When investigated as a treatment, povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution has also been observed to have some effectiveness against bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis, with a possible role suggested in locations where topical antibiotics are unavailable or costly.

=== Chemical ===
Conjunctivitis due to chemicals is treated via irrigation with Ringer&#x27;s lactate or saline solution. Chemical injuries, particularly alkali burns, are medical emergencies, as they can lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage. People with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes to avoid spreading the chemical.

== Epidemiology ==
Conjunctivitis is the most common eye disease. Rates of disease is related to the underlying cause which varies by the age as well as the time of year. Acute conjunctivitis is most frequently found in infants, school-age children and the elderly. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral conjunctivitis.

It is estimated that acute conjunctivitis affects 6 million people annually in the United States.

Some seasonal trends have been observed for the occurrence of different forms of conjunctivitis. In the northern hemisphere, the occurrence of bacterial conjunctivitis peaks from December to April, viral conjunctivitis peaks in the summer months and allergic conjunctivitis is more prevalent throughout the spring and summer.

== History ==
An adenovirus was first isolated by Rowe et al. in 1953. Two years later, Jawetz et al. published on epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. &quot;Madras eye&quot; is a colloquial term that has been used in India for the disease.

===Outbreak in Pakistan===
In September 2023, a significant outbreak of conjunctivitis occurred in Pakistan. The outbreak began in Karachi and quickly spread to Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad. By the end of the month, over 86,133 cases had been reported in Punjab alone. The rapid spread of the disease led to the temporary closure of schools in the region. This event marked one of the largest outbreaks of Pink Eye in the country&#x27;s recent history.

==Society and culture==
Conjunctivitis imposes economic and social burdens. The cost of treating bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States was estimated to be $377 million to $857 million per year. Approximately 1% of all primary care office visits in the United States are related to conjunctivitis. Approximately 70% of all people with acute conjunctivitis present to primary care and urgent care.
