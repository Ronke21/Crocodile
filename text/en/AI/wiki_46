<text>Automatic Link Establishment, commonly known as ALE, is the worldwide de facto standard for digitally initiating and sustaining HF radio communications. ALE is a feature in an HF communications radio transceiver system that enables the radio station to make contact, or initiate a circuit, between itself and another HF radio station or network of stations. The purpose is to provide a reliable rapid method of calling and connecting during constantly changing HF ionospheric propagation, reception interference, and shared spectrum use of busy or congested HF channels.

== Mechanism ==

A standalone ALE radio combines an HF SSB radio transceiver with an internal microprocessor and MFSK modem. It is programmed with a unique ALE address, similar to a phone number (or on newer generations, a username). When not actively in contact with another station, the HF SSB transceiver constantly scans through a list of HF frequencies called &quot;channels&quot;, listening for any ALE signals transmitted by other radio stations. It decodes calls and soundings sent by other stations and uses the bit error rate to store a quality score for that frequency and sender-address.

To reach a specific station, the caller enters the ALE Address. On many ALE radios this is similar to dialing a phone number. The ALE controller selects the best available idle channel for that destination address. After confirming the channel is indeed idle, it then sends a brief selective calling signal identifying the intended recipient. When the distant scanning station detects ALE activity, it stops scanning and stays on that channel until it can confirm whether or not the call is for it. The two stations&#x27; ALE controllers automatically handshake to confirm that a link of sufficient quality has been established, then notify the operators that the link is up. If the callee fails to respond or the handshaking fails, the originating ALE node usually selects another frequency either at random or by making a guess of varying sophistication.

Upon successful linking, the receiving station generally emits an audible alarm and shows a visual alert to the operator, thus indicating the incoming call. It also indicates the callsign or other identifying information of the linked station, similar to Caller ID. The operator then un-mutes the radio and answers the call then can talk in a regular conversation or negotiates a data link using voice or the ALE built-in short text message format. Alternatively, digital data can be exchanged via a built-in or external modem (such as a STANAG 5066 or MIL-STD-188-110B serial tone modem) depending on needs and availability. The ALE built-in text messaging facility can be used to transfer short text messages as an &quot;orderwire&quot; to allow operators to coordinate external equipment such as phone patches or non-embedded digital links, or for short tactical messages. 

== Common applications ==
An ALE radio system enables connection for voice conversation, alerting, data exchange, texting, instant messaging, email, file transfer, image, geo-position tracking, or telemetry. With a radio operator initiating a call, the process normally takes a few minutes for the ALE to pick an HF frequency that is optimum for both sides of the communication link. It signals the operators audibly and visually on both ends, so they can begin communicating with each other immediately. In this respect, the longstanding need in HF radio for repetitive calling on pre-determined time schedules or tedious monitoring static is eliminated. It is useful as a tool for finding optimum channels to communicate between stations in real-time. In modern HF communications, ALE has largely replaced HF prediction charts, propagation beacons, chirp sounders, propagation prediction software, and traditional radio operator educated guesswork. ALE is most commonly used for hooking up operators for voice contacts on SSB (single-sideband modulation), HF internet connectivity for email, SMS phone texting or text messaging, real-time chat via HF text, Geo Position Reporting, and file transfer. High Frequency Internet Protocol or HFIP may be used with ALE for internet access via HF.

== Techniques ==
The essence of ALE techniques is the use of automatic channel selection, scanning receivers, selective calling, handshaking, and robust burst modems. An ALE node decodes all received ALE signals heard on the channel(s) it monitors. It uses the fact that all ALE messages use forward error correction (FEC) redundancy. By noting how much error-correction occurred in each received and decoded message, an ALE node can detect the &quot;quality&quot; of the path between the sending station and itself. This information is coupled with the ALE address of the sending node and the channel the message was received on, and stored in the node&#x27;s Link Quality Analysis (LQA) memory. When a call is initiated, the LQA lookup table is searched for matches involving the target ALE address and the best historic channel is used to call the target station. This reduces the likelihood that the call has to be repeated on alternate frequencies. Once the target station has heard the call and responded, a bell or other signalling device will notify both operators that a link has been established. At this point, the operators may coordinate further communication via orderwire text messages, voice, or other means. If further digital communication is desired, it may take place via external data modems or via optional modems built into the ALE terminal.

This unusual usage of FEC redundancy is the primary innovation that differentiates ALE from previous selective calling systems which either decoded a call or failed to decode due to noise or interference. A binary outcome of &quot;Good enough&quot; or not gave no way of automatically choosing between two channels, both of which are currently good enough for minimum communications. The redundancy-based scoring inherent in ALE thus allows for selecting the &quot;best&quot; available channel and (in more advanced ALE nodes) using all decoded traffic over some time window to sort channels into a list of decreasing probability-to-contact, significantly reducing co-channel interference to other users as well as dramatically decreasing the time needed to successfully link with the target node.

Techniques used in the ALE standard include automatic signaling, automatic station identification (sounding), polling, message store-and-forward, linking protection and anti-spoofing to prevent hostile denial of service by ending the channel scanning process. Optional ALE functions include polling and the exchange of orderwire commands and messages. The orderwire message, known as AMD (Automatic Message Display), is the most commonly used text transfer method of ALE, and the only universal method that all ALE controllers have in common for displaying text. It is common for vendors to offer extensions to AMD for various non-standard features, although dependency on these extensions undermines interoperability. As in all interoperability scenarios, care should be taken to determine if this is acceptable before using such extensions.

== History and precedents ==
ALE evolved from older HF radio selective calling technology. It combined existing channel-scanning selective calling concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers. The first ALE-family controller units were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.

Various methods and proprietary digital signaling protocols were used by different manufacturers in first generation ALE, leading to incompatibility. Later, a cooperative effort among manufacturers and the US government resulted in a second generation of ALE that included the features of first generation systems, while improving performance. The second generation 2G ALE system standard in 1986, MIL-STD-188-141A, was adopted in FED-STD-1045 for US federal entities. In the 1980s, military and other entities of the US government began installing early ALE units, using ALE controller products built primarily by US companies. The primary application during the first 10 years of ALE use was government and military radio systems, and the limited customer base combined with the necessity to adhere to MILSPEC standards kept prices extremely high. Over time, demand for ALE capabilities spread and by the late 1990s, most new government HF radios purchased were designed to meet at least the minimum ALE interoperability standard, making them eligible for use with standard ALE node gear. Radios implementing at least minimum ALE node functionality as an option internal to the radio became more common and significantly more affordable. As the standards were adopted by other governments worldwide, more manufacturers produced competitively priced HF radios to meet this demand. The need to interoperate with government organizations prompted many non-government organizations (NGOs) to at least partially adopt ALE standards for communication. As non-military experience spread and prices came down, other civilian entities started using 2G ALE. By the year 2000, there were enough civilian and government organizations worldwide using ALE that it became a de facto HF interoperability standard for situations where a priori channel and address coordination is possible.

In the late 1990s, a third generation 3G ALE with significantly improved capability and performance was included in MIL-STD-188-141B, retaining backward compatibility with 2G ALE, and was adopted in NATO STANAG 4538. Civilian and non-government adoption rates are much lower than 2G ALE due to the extreme cost as compared to surplus or entry-level 2G gear as well as the significantly increased system and planning complexity necessary to realize the benefits inherent in the 3G specification. For many militaries, whose needs for maximized intra-organizational capability and capacity always strain existing systems, the additional cost and complexity of 3G are less problematic.

=== Reliability ===
ALE enables rapid unscheduled communication and message passing without requiring complex message centers, multiple radios and antennas, or highly trained operators. With the removal of these potential sources of failure, the tactical communication process becomes much more robust and reliable. The effects extend beyond mere force multiplication of existing communications methods; units such as helicopters, when outfitted with ALE radios, can now reliably communicate in situations where the crew are too busy to operate a traditional non-line of sight radio. This ability to enable tactical communication in conditions where dedicated trained operators and hardware are inappropriate is often considered to be the true improvement offered by ALE.

ALE is a critical path toward increased interoperability between organizations. By enabling a station to participate nearly simultaneously in many different HF networks, ALE allows for convenient cross-organization message passing and monitoring without requiring dedicated separate equipment and operators for each partner organization. This dramatically reduces staffing and equipment considerations, while enabling small mobile or portable stations to participate in multiple networks and subnetworks. The result is increased resilience, decreased fragility, increased ability to communicate information effectively, and the ability to rapidly add to or replace communication points as the situation demands.

When combined with Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) techniques and sufficient channels spread across the spectrum, an ALE node can provide greater than 95% success linking on the first call, nearly on par with SATCOM systems. This is significantly more reliable than cellphone infrastructure during disasters or wars yet is mostly immune to such considerations itself.

== Standards and protocols ==
Global standards for ALE are based on the original US MIL-STD 188-141A and FED-1045, known as 2nd Generation (2G) ALE. 2G ALE uses non-synchronised scanning of channels, and it takes several seconds to half a minute to repeatedly scan through an entire list of channels looking for calls. Thus it requires sufficient duration of transmission time for calls to connect or link with another station that is unsynchronised with its calling signal. The vast majority of ALE systems in use in the world at the present time are 2G ALE.

=== 2G technical characteristics ===
The more common 2G ALE signal waveform is designed to be compatible with standard 3 kHz SSB narrowband voice channel transceivers. The modulation method is 8ary Frequency Shift Keying or 8FSK, also sometimes called Multi Frequency Shift Keying MFSK, with eight orthogonal tones between 750 and 2500 Hz. Each tone is 8 ms long, resulting in a transmitted over-the-air symbol rate of 125 baud or 125 symbols per second, with a raw data rate of 375 bits per second. The ALE data is formatted in 24-bit frames, which consist of a 3-bit preamble followed by three ASCII characters, each seven bits long. The received signal is usually decoded using digital signal processing techniques that are capable of recovering the 8FSK signal at a negative decibel signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., the signal may be recovered even when it is below the noise level). The over-the-air layers of the protocol involve the use of forward error correction, redundancy, and handshaking transponding similar to those used in ARQ techniques.

=== 3G technical characteristics ===
Newer standards of ALE, called 3rd Generation or 3G ALE, use accurate time synchronization (via a defined time-synch protocol as well as the option of GPS-locked clocks) to achieve faster and more dependable linking. Through synchronization, the calling time to achieve a link may be reduced to less than 10 seconds. The 3G ALE modem signal also provides better robustness and can work in channel conditions that are less favorable than 2G ALE. Dwell groups, limited callsigns, and shorter burst transmissions enable more rapid intervals of scanning. All stations in the same group scan and receive each channel at precisely the same time window. Although 3G ALE is more reliable and has significantly enhanced channel-time efficiency, the existence of a large installed base of 2G ALE radio systems and the wide availability of moderately priced (often military surplus) equipment, has made 2G the baseline standard for global interoperability.

== Basis for HF interoperability communications ==
Interoperability is a critical issue for the disparate entities which use radiocommunications to fulfill the needs of organizations. Largely due to the ubiquity of 2G ALE, it became the primary method for providing interoperability on HF between governmental and non-governmental disaster relief and emergency communications entities, and amateur radio volunteers. With digital techniques increasingly employed in communications equipment, a universal digital calling standard was needed, and ALE filled the gap. Nearly every major HF radio manufacturer in the world builds ALE radios to the 2G standard to meet the high demand that new installations of HF radio systems conform to this standard protocol. Disparate entities that historically used incompatible radio methods were then able to call and converse with each other using the common 2G ALE platform. Some manufacturers and organizations have used the AMD feature of ALE to expand the performance and connectivity. In some cases, this has been successful, and in other cases, the use of proprietary preamble or embedded commands has led to interoperability problems.

=== Tactical communication and resource management ===
ALE serves as a convenient method of beyond line of sight communication. Originally developed to support military requirements, ALE is useful to many organizations who find themselves managing widely located units. United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement and United States Coast Guard are two members of the Customs Over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN), a MIL-STD 188-141A ALE network. All U.S. armed forces operate multiple similar networks. Similarly, shortwave utility listeners have documented frequency and callsign lists for many nations&#x27; military and guard units, as well as networks operated by oil exploration and production companies and public utilities in many countries.

=== Emergency / disaster relief or extraordinary situation response communications ===
ALE radio communication systems for both HF regional area networks and HF interoperability communications are in service among emergency and disaster relief agencies as well as military and guard forces. Extraordinary response agencies and organizations use ALE to respond to situations in the world where conventional communications may have been temporarily overloaded or damaged. In many cases, it is in place as alternative back-channel for organizations that may have to respond to situations or scenarios involving the loss of conventional communications. Earthquakes, storms, volcanic eruptions, and power or communication infrastructure failures are typical situations in which organizations may deem ALE necessary to operations. ALE networks are common among organizations engaged in extraordinary situation response such as: natural and man-made disasters, transportation, power, or telecommunication network failures, war, peacekeeping, or stability operations. Organizations known to use ALE for Emergency management, disaster relief, ordinary communication or extraordinary situation response include: Red Cross, FEMA, Disaster Medical Assistance Teams, NATO, Federal Bureau of Investigation, United Nations, AT&amp;T, Civil Air Patrol, SHARES, State of California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA), other US States&#x27; Offices of Emergency Services or Emergency Management Agencies, and Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES).

=== International HF telecommunications for disaster relief ===
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in response to the need for interoperation in international disaster response spurred largely by humanitarian relief, included ALE in its Telecommunications for Disaster Relief recommendations. The increasing need for instant connectivity for logistical and tactical disaster relief response communications, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami led to ITU actions of encouragement to countries around the world toward loosening restrictions on such communications and equipment border transit during catastrophic disasters. The IARU Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conferences (GAREC) and IARU Global Simulated Emergency Tests have included ALE.

== Use in amateur radio ==
Amateur radio operators began sporadic ALE operation on a limited basis in the early to mid-1990s, with commercial ALE radios and ALE controllers. In 2000, the first widely available software ALE controller for the Personal Computer, &quot;PCALE&quot;, became available, and hams started to set up stations based on it. In 2001, the first organized and coordinated global ALE nets for International Amateur Radio began. In August 2005, ham radio operators supporting communications for emergency Red Cross shelters used ALE for Disaster Relief operations during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. After the event, hams developed more permanent ALE emergency/disaster relief networks, including internet connectivity, with a focus on interoperation between organizations. The amateur radio HFLink Automatic Link Establishment system uses an open net protocol to enable all amateur radio operators and amateur radio nets worldwide to participate in ALE and share the same ALE channels legally and interoperably. Amateur radio operators may use it to call each other for voice or data communications.

=== Amateur radio interoperability adaptations ===
Amateur radio operators commonly provide local, regional, national, and international emergency / disaster relief communications. The need for interoperability on HF led to the adoption of ALE open networks by hams. Amateur radio adapted 2G ALE techniques, by using the common denominators of the 2G ALE protocol, with a limited subset of features found in the majority of all ALE radios and controllers. Each amateur radio ALE station uses the operator&#x27;s call sign as the address, also known as the ALE Address, in the ALE radio controller. The lowest common denominator technique enables any manufacturer&#x27;s ALE radios or software to be used for HF interoperability communications and networking. Known as Ham-Friendly ALE, the amateur radio ALE standard is used to establish radio communications, through a combination of active ALE on internationally recognized automatic data frequencies, and passive ALE scanning on voice channels. In this technique, active ALE frequencies include pseudorandom periodic polite station identification, while passive ALE frequencies are silently scanned for selective calling. ALE systems include Listen Before Transmit as a standard function, and in most cases this feature provides better busy channel detection of voice and data signals than the human ear. Ham-Friendly ALE technique is also known as 2.5G ALE, because it maintains 2G ALE compatibility while employing some of the adaptive channel management features of 3G ALE, but without the accurate GPS time synchronization of 3G ALE.

=== Disaster relief HF network ===
Hot standby ALE nets are in constant operation 24/7/365 for International Emergency and Disaster Relief communications. The Ham Radio Global ALE High Frequency Network, which began service in June 2007, is the world&#x27;s largest intentionally open ALE network. It is a free open network staffed by volunteers, and used by amateur radio operators supporting disaster relief organizations.

=== International coordination ===
International amateur radio ALE High Frequency channels are frequency coordinated with all Regions of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU entity of ITU), for international, regional, national, and local use in the Amateur Radio Service. All Amateur Radio ALE channels use &quot;USB&quot; Upper Sideband standard. Different rules, regulations, and bandplans of the region and local country of operation apply to use of various channels. Some channels may not be available in every country. Primary or global channels are in common with most countries and regions.

<text>In telecommunications, automatic sounding is the testing of selected channels for quality by providing a very brief identifying transmission that may be used by other stations to evaluate connectivity, and availability, and to identify known working channels for immediate or later use for communications or calling. They are often used to maintain connectivity in digital communications high frequency radio networks.

Automatic soundings are primarily intended to increase the efficiency of the automatic link establishment (ALE) function, thereby increasing system throughput. 

In ALE, the sounding information consists of a heavily error-corrected short message identifying the sender. Recipients decode it and use the bit error rate to calculate and store a (channel, node, quality) tuple. As ionospheric conditions and mobile-node locations change, these quality tuples will shift. The stored data can be used to maximize the chance that the best channel to link with a given partner will be chosen first.

<doc id="40758" wikidata="Q4827311" url="?curid=40758" title="Auxiliary power">
<text>Auxiliary power is electric power that is provided by an alternate source and that serves as backup for the primary power source at the station main bus or prescribed sub-bus.

An offline unit provides electrical isolation between the primary power source and the critical technical load whereas an online unit does not.

A Class A power source is a primary power source, i.e., a source that assures an essentially continuous supply of power.

Types of auxiliary power services include Class B, a standby power plant to cover extended outages of the order of days; Class C, a 10-to-60-second quick-start unit to cover short-term outages of the order of hours; and Class D, an uninterruptible non-break unit using stored energy to provide continuous power within specified voltage and frequency tolerances.

== History ==

== Uses/Implementations ==
Many uses and implementations of auxiliary power are experimented with to increase its efficiency. One such experimentation was to find a better way to operate a diesel engine with fuel cell based auxiliary power units.  The method of which is to separate hydrogen-rich gas from the diesel fuel to generate electricity separately in an auxiliary power unit.  With this process, an effective reduction in emissions can be achieved by lowering the consumed volume of gas per hour. However, upon  power demands reaching 60% a sharp decrease in performance occurs, which can be solved by using a diesel or kerosine fuel with a maximum CO concentration of 1.5%.

There are a variety of other implementations of auxiliary power units in energy systems. This explains for how a significant portion of emissions come from commercial vehicles.  Diesel engines operating within densely populated areas, running within an ineffective range in order to power their auxiliary systems, such as refrigeration, are contributors to a large portion of the emissions from automobiles.  Using a model with a diesel powered four-stroke engine on a truck with 100% load capacity driving a combination of typical urban and city road cycles, emissions and auxiliary power demand were recorded. Then by using the calculated auxiliary power demand, a source was developed to support the demand for the auxiliary systems in the form of a PEM fuel cell.  The end product of the PEM fuel cell was able to support the auxiliary systems of the truck using a maximum of 5 kW of power. This input was able to sustain the cooling chamber, cabin air-conditioning, radio unit, etc. The introduction of this fuel cell also contributed to a 9% reduction in diesel fuel consumption and 9.6% reduction in emissions.

== Legal Requirements for Industries ==
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set out rules and guidelines for how auxiliary and supplemental power sources (ASPS) that provide secondary power to wastewater treatment plants in case of a blackout.  ASPS should be able to supply enough power to run the plant effectively, and be available for start-up in a short period of time in case of emergency. Types of ASPS necessary for adequate power generation include: internal combustion engines, microturbines, solar cells, fuel cells, and wind turbines.  ASPS technology is required to be reliable enough to start up quickly, and run for extended periods of time, (i.e. 48 hours or more) with sufficient fuel.

== Efficiency ==
As previously affirmed, auxiliary power units are commonly used to improve the efficiency of electrical system. The use of auxiliary power units for range extended electric automobiles has been shown to improve the control of energy flow and distribution throughout the system, improving its overall efficiency.

For closed systems with extreme power consumption such as tankers and other vessels at sea, the use and quality of auxiliary power systems have a great impact on the efficiency of the overall system.  The different uses of auxiliary power for an array of ships and ship activities and how these different power schemes change the overall efficiency and/emissions of the ship&#x27;s system. Studies have indicated that while ships travel between ports within the same bay, total ship exhaust emissions are due to primarily their auxiliary boiler and auxiliary engine power systems, due to the time and speed required to transit the port waters with the large berth of the vessel.  Findings also lead to the conclusion that the power output capabilities of auxiliary engines at a certain point do not increase with the size of the vessel, or the vessel&#x27;s installed main engine power. There are a great many factors such as machinery variables, power schemes, and size and power of vessels, that there are too many factors to take into account in order to portray an accurate representation of the ratio between main power and auxiliary power output. More surveys and studies should be done in order to achieve this more accurate result.

<doc id="40760" wikidata="Q384871" url="?curid=40760" title="Availability">
<text>In reliability engineering, the term availability has the following meanings:

* The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, &quot;i.e.&quot; a random, time.
* The probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment.

Normally high availability systems might be specified as 99.98%, 99.999% or 99.9996%. The converse, unavailability, is 1 minus the availability.

==Representation==
The simplest representation of availability (&quot;A&quot;) is a ratio of the expected value of the uptime of a system to the aggregate of the expected values of up and down time (that results in the &quot;total amount of time&quot; &quot;C&quot; of the observation window)

: formula_1

Another equation for availability (&quot;A&quot;) is a ratio of the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), or

: formula_2

If we define the status function formula_3 as

: formula_4

therefore, the availability &quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at time &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0 is represented by

: formula_5

Average availability must be defined on an interval of the real line. If we consider an arbitrary constant formula_6, then average availability is represented as

: formula_7

Limiting (or steady-state) availability is represented by
: formula_8

Limiting average availability is also defined on an interval formula_9 as,

: formula_10

Availability is the probability that an item will be in an operable and committable state at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at a random time, and is generally defined as uptime divided by total time (uptime plus downtime).

=== Series vs Parallel components ===


Let&#x27;s say a series component is composed of components A, B and C. Then following formula applies: 

Availability of series component = (availability of component A) x (availability of component B) x (availability of component C) 

Therefore, combined availability of multiple components in a series is always lower than the availability of individual components. 

On the other hand, following formula applies to parallel components:

Availability of parallel components = 1 - (1 - availability of component A) X (1 - availability of component B) X (1 - availability of component C) 

In corollary, if you have N parallel components each having X availability, then:

Availability of parallel components = 1 - (1 - X)^ N 

Using parallel components can exponentially increase the availability of overall system. For example if each of your hosts has only 50% availability, by using 10 of hosts in parallel, you can achieve 99.9023% availability. 

Note that redundancy doesn’t always lead to higher availability. In fact, redundancy increases complexity which in turn reduces availability. According to Marc Brooker, to take advantage of redundancy, ensure that:

# You achieve a net-positive improvement in the overall availability of your system
# Your redundant components fail independently
# Your system can reliably detect healthy redundant components
# Your system can reliably scale out and scale-in redundant components.

=== Methods and techniques to model availability ===

Reliability Block Diagrams or Fault Tree Analysis are developed to calculate availability of a system or a functional failure condition within a system including many factors like:

* Reliability models
* Maintainability models
* Maintenance concepts
* Redundancy
* Common cause failure
* Diagnostics
* Level of repair
* Repair status
* Dormant failures
* Test coverage
* Active operational times / missions / sub system states
* Logistical aspects like; spare part (stocking) levels at different depots, transport times, repair times at different repair lines, manpower availability and more.
* Uncertainty in parameters

Furthermore, these methods are capable to identify the most critical items and failure modes or events that impact availability.

=== Definitions within systems engineering ===
Availability, inherent (Ai) 
The probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment. It excludes logistics time, waiting or administrative downtime, and preventive maintenance downtime. It includes corrective maintenance downtime. 
Inherent availability is generally derived from analysis of an engineering design:
# The impact of a repairable-element (refurbishing/remanufacture isn&#x27;t repair, but rather replacement) on the availability of the system, in which it operates, equals mean time between failures MTBF/(MTBF+ mean time to repair MTTR).
# The impact of a one-off/non-repairable element (could be refurbished/remanufactured) on the availability of the system, in which it operates, equals the mean time to failure (MTTF)/(MTTF + the mean time to repair MTTR).
It is based on quantities under control of the designer.

Availability, achieved (Aa) 
The probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given 
point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment (i.e., that personnel, tools, spares, etc. are instantaneously available). It excludes logistics time and waiting or administrative downtime. 
It includes active preventive and corrective maintenance downtime.

Availability, operational (Ao) 
The probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used in an actual or realistic operating and support environment. It includes logistics time, ready time, and waiting or administrative downtime, and both preventive and corrective maintenance downtime. This value is equal to the mean time between failure (MTBF) divided by the mean time between failure plus the mean downtime (MDT). This measure extends the definition of availability to elements controlled by the logisticians and mission planners such as quantity and proximity of spares, tools and manpower to the hardware item.

Refer to Systems engineering for more details

=== Basic example===
If we are using equipment which has a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 81.5 years and mean time to repair (MTTR) of 1 hour:

: MTTF in hours = (This is a reliability parameter and often has a high level of uncertainty!)

: Inherent availability (Ai) 

: Inherent unavailability 

Outage due to equipment in hours per year = 1/rate = 1/MTTF = 0.01235 hours per year.
==Literature==
Availability is well established in the literature of stochastic modeling and optimal maintenance. Barlow and Proschan [1975] define availability of a repairable system as &quot;the probability that the system is operating at a specified time t.&quot; Blanchard [1998] gives a qualitative definition of availability as &quot;a measure of the degree of a system which is in the operable and committable state at the start of mission when the mission is called for at an unknown random point in time.&quot; This definition comes from the MIL-STD-721. Lie, Hwang, and Tillman [1977] developed a complete survey along with a systematic classification of availability.

Availability measures are classified by either the time interval of interest or the mechanisms for the system downtime. If the time interval of interest is the primary concern, we consider instantaneous, limiting, average, and limiting average availability. The aforementioned definitions are developed in Barlow and Proschan [1975], Lie, Hwang, and Tillman [1977], and Nachlas [1998]. The second primary classification for availability is contingent on the various mechanisms for downtime such as the inherent availability, achieved availability, and operational availability. (Blanchard [1998], Lie, Hwang, and Tillman [1977]). Mi [1998] gives some comparison results of availability considering inherent availability.

Availability considered in maintenance modeling can be found in Barlow and Proschan [1975] for replacement models, Fawzi and Hawkes [1991] for an R-out-of-N system with spares and repairs, Fawzi and Hawkes [1990] for a series system with replacement and repair, Iyer [1992] for imperfect repair models, Murdock [1995] for age replacement preventive maintenance models, Nachlas [1998, 1989] for preventive maintenance models, and Wang and Pham [1996] for imperfect maintenance models. A very comprehensive recent book is by Trivedi and Bobbio [2017].

==Applications==
Availability factor is used extensively in power plant engineering. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation implemented the Generating Availability Data System in 1982.

<text>A back-to-back connection is the direct connection of the output of one device to the input of a similar or related device.

==Telecommunications==
In telecommunications, a back-to-back connection can be formed by connecting a transmitter directly to a receiver without a transmission line in between. This is used for equipment measurements and testing purposes. The back-to-back connection eliminates the effects of the transmission medium.

In some cases, the output of a receiving device is instead connected to the input of a transmitting device.

== Power transmission ==
A back-to-back connection for electric power transmission is a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) system with both ends in the same switchyard. This is used to couple asynchronously operated power grids or for connecting power grids of different frequencies where no DC transmission line is necessary.

== Electronics ==
In electronics, a back-to-back connection is the connection of two identical or similar components in series with the opposite polarity. This is used to convert polarised components to non-polar use. Common examples include:
* electrolytic capacitors
* zener diodes

<text>In a data transmission circuit a backward channel is the channel that passes data in a direction opposite to that of its associated forward channel. The backward channel is usually used for transmission of request, supervisory, acknowledgement, or error-control signals. The direction of flow of these signals is opposite to that in which user information is being transferred. The backward-channel bandwidth is usually less than that of the primary channel, that is, the forward (user information) channel. For example, ADSL&#x27;s upstream channel, considered a backward channel for some types of analysis, typically has a bandwidth less than one-fourth of the downstream channel.

In data transmission, it is a secondary channel in which the direction of transmission is constrained to be opposite to that of the primary, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the forward (user-information) channel. The direction of transmission in the backward channel is restricted by the control interchange circuit that controls the direction of transmission in the primary channel.

<doc id="40767" wikidata="Q2708162" url="?curid=40767" title="Balanced line">
<text>In telecommunications and professional audio, a balanced line or balanced signal pair is an electrical circuit consisting of two conductors of the same type, both of which have equal impedances along their lengths, to ground, and to other circuits. The primary advantage of the balanced line format is good rejection of common-mode noise and interference when fed to a differential device such as a transformer or differential amplifier.

As prevalent in sound recording and reproduction, balanced lines are referred to as balanced audio.

A common form of balanced line is twin-lead, used for radio frequency communications. Also common is twisted pair, used for traditional telephone, professional audio, or for data communications. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such as coaxial cable, which is designed to have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground (see earth-return telegraph). Balanced and unbalanced circuits can be interfaced using a device called a balun.

Circuits driving balanced lines must themselves be balanced to maintain the benefits of balance. This may be achieved by transformer coupling (repeating coils) or by merely balancing the impedance in each conductor.

Lines carrying symmetric signals (those with equal amplitudes but opposite polarities on each leg) are often incorrectly referred to as &quot;balanced&quot;, but this is actually differential signalling. Balanced lines and differential signalling are often used together, but they are not the same thing. Differential signalling does not make a line balanced, nor does noise rejection in balanced cables require differential signalling.

== Explanation ==


Transmission of a signal over a balanced line reduces the influence of noise or interference due to external stray electric fields. Any external signal sources tend to induce only a common-mode signal on the line, and the balanced impedances to ground minimizes differential pickup due to stray electric fields. The conductors are sometimes twisted together to ensure that each conductor is equally exposed to any external magnetic fields that could induce unwanted noise.

Some balanced lines also have electrostatic shielding to reduce the amount of noise introduced. The cable is often wrapped in foil, copper wire, or a copper braid. This shield provides immunity to RF interference but does not provide immunity to magnetic fields.

Some balanced lines use 4-conductor star quad cable to provide immunity to magnetic fields. The geometry of the cable ensures that magnetic fields will cause equal interference of both legs of the balanced circuit. This balanced interference is a common-mode signal that can easily be removed by a transformer or balanced differential receiver.

A balanced line allows a differential receiver to reduce the noise on a connection by rejecting common-mode interference. The lines have the same impedance to ground, so the interfering fields or currents induce the same voltage in both wires. Since the receiver responds only to the difference between the wires, it is not influenced by the induced noise voltage. If a balanced line is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise. Examples of twisted pairs include category 5 cable.

Compared to unbalanced lines, balanced lines reduce the amount of noise per distance, allowing a longer cable run to be practical. This is because electromagnetic interference will affect both signals the same way. Similarities between the two signals are automatically removed at the end of the transmission path when one signal is subtracted from the other.

==Telephone systems==
The first application for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) could be very disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two single-wire unbalanced telegraph lines and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, with the growth of electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than open wires to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was twisted pair; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30 km. Open wires, on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances—the longest was the 1500 km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. Loading coils were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912. Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for local loops, the lines that connect each subscriber&#x27;s premises to their respective exchange.

Telephone trunk lines, and especially frequency division multiplexing carrier systems, are usually 4-wire circuits rather than 2-wire circuits (or at least they were before fibre-optic became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and return circuits themselves. The most common cable format is star quad, where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common-mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM (Dieselhorst-Martin) quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.

== Audio systems ==
An example of balanced lines is the connection of microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in the large majority of modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as star quad) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.

Typical professional audio sources, such as microphones, have three-pin XLR connectors. One connects to the shield or chassis ground, while the other two are for the signal conductors. The signal wires can carry two copies of the same signal with opposite polarity (differential signalling) but need not do so. They are often termed &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold,&quot; and the AES14-1992(r2004) Standard [and EIA Standard RS-297-A] suggest that the pin that carries the positive signal that results from a positive air pressure on a transducer will be deemed &#x27;hot&#x27;. Pin 2 has been designated as the &#x27;hot&#x27; pin, and that designation serves useful for keeping a consistent polarity in the rest of the system. Since these conductors travel the same path from source to destination, the assumption is that any interference is induced upon both conductors equally. The appliance receiving the signals compares the difference between the two signals (often with disregard to electrical ground) allowing the appliance to ignore any induced electrical noise. Any induced noise would be present in equal amounts and in identical polarity on each of the balanced signal conductors, so the two signals’ difference from each other would be unchanged. The successful rejection of induced noise from the desired signal depends in part on the balanced signal conductors receiving the same amount and type of interference. This typically leads to twisted, braided, or co-jacketed cables for use in balanced signal transmission.

== Balanced and differential ==

Many explanations of balanced lines assume symmetric signals (i.e. signals equal in magnitude but of opposite polarity) but this can lead to confusion of the two concepts—signal symmetry and balanced lines are quite independent of each other. Essential in a balanced line is identical impedances in the two conductors in the driver, line and receiver (impedance balancing). These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the line equally and thus appears as a common-mode signal that is rejected by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance balancing between the legs but do &quot;not&quot; provide symmetric signals. Symmetric differential signals concern headroom and are not necessary for interference rejection.

== Baluns ==

Interfacing balanced and unbalanced lines requires a balun. For example, baluns can be used to send line level audio or E-carrier level 1 signals over coaxial cable (which is unbalanced) through of balanced category 5 cable by using a pair of baluns at each end of the CAT5 run. As the signal travels through the balanced line, noise is induced and added to the signal. As the CAT5 line is carefully impedance balanced, the noise induces equal (common-mode) voltages in both conductors. At the receiving end, the balun responds only to the difference in voltage between the two conductors, thus rejecting the noise picked up along the way and leaving the original signal intact.

A once common application of a radio frequency balun was found at the antenna terminals of a television receiver. Typically a 300-ohm balanced twin lead antenna input could only be connected to a coaxial cable from a cable TV system through a balun.

== Characteristic impedance ==
The characteristic impedance formula_1 of a transmission line is an important parameter at higher frequencies of operation. For a parallel 2-wire transmission line,

:formula_2

where formula_3 is half the distance between the wire centres, formula_4 is the wire radius and formula_5, formula_6 are respectively the permeability and permittivity of the surrounding medium. A commonly used approximation that is valid when the wire separation is much larger than the wire radius and in the absence of magnetic materials is

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the relative permittivity of the surrounding medium.

== Electric power lines ==
In electric power transmission, the three conductors used for three-phase power transmission are referred to as a balanced line since the instantaneous sum of the three line voltages is nominally zero. However, &quot;balance&quot; in this field is referring to the symmetry of the source and load: it has nothing to do with the impedance balance of the line itself, the sense of the meaning in telecommunications.

For the transmission of single-phase electric power as used for railway electrification, two conductors are used to carry in-phase and out-of-phase voltages such that the line is balanced.

Bipolar HVDC lines at which each pole is operated with the same voltage toward ground are also balanced lines.

<text>In telecommunications, the term bandwidth compression has the following meanings: 
*The reduction of the bandwidth needed to transmit a given amount of data in a given time.
*The reduction of the time needed to transmit a given amount of data in a given bandwidth.

Bandwidth compression implies a reduction in normal bandwidth of an information-carrying signal without reducing the information content of the signal. This can be accomplished with lossless data compression techniques. For more information read the Increasing speeds section in the Modem article. Bandwidth Compression is a core feature of WAN Optimization appliances to improve bandwidth efficiency.

<doc id="40772" wikidata="Q4863202" url="?curid=40772" title="Barrage jamming">
<text>Barrage jamming is an electronic warfare technique that attempts to blind (&quot;jam&quot;) radar systems by filling the display with noise, rendering the broadcaster&#x27;s &quot;blip&quot; invisible on the display, and often those in the nearby area as well. &quot;Barrage&quot; refers to systems that send signals in many bands of frequencies compared to the bandwidth of any single radar. This allows the jammer to jam multiple radars at once, and reduces or eliminates the need for adjustments to respond to any single radar.

Early radar systems typically operated on a single frequency, and could only change that frequency by changing internal electronics. Against these radars, it was possible to use conventional radio sets to send out signals on the same band, causing the radar display to be filled with noise whenever the antenna was pointed in the general direction of the jammer. However, given that each individual radar would be operating on different frequencies, this &quot;spot jamming&quot; technique required multiple radio sets in order to jam more than one radar at a time, and true wide-band barrage jamming was very difficult.

Early barrage jammers in World War II used photomultiplier tubes to amplify a wideband noise source, An improved approach appeared with the introduction of the carcinotron in the early 1950s, a vacuum tube that generates microwaves whose frequency can be adjusted across a very wide band simply by changing the input voltage. A single carcinotron could be swept through the entire bandwidth of any potential radar network, jamming all of the radars in such rapid sequence that it appeared to be constant noise on all frequencies at all times. A downside to this approach is that the signal only spends a brief period of time at any one radar&#x27;s frequency; depending on the scanning rate, the radar may only be jammed during certain periods, but if the rate is increased to offset this, the amount of noise in any one pulse period is reduced. More complex jammers can scan only the bands it sees being used, improving its effectiveness.

Barrage jamming was extremely effective against 1950s radars, to the point where there was some belief that the carcinotron might render ground-based radars useless, especially in the early warning radar role. By the 1960s a number of techniques had been introduced to combat barrage jamming. Frequency agile radars, which change their frequency from pulse to pulse, force the jammer spread its signal across the entire bandwidth, ensuring the signal is diluted. Combining this with extremely powerful signals and highly focused antennas allowed new radars to overpower the jammers, &quot;burning through&quot; the jamming. Simple techniques, like turning off the receivers when the antenna was pointed close to the jammer, allowed the radar to continue tracking other targets. The use of phased array antennas and signal processing techniques that reduced sidelobes also improved performance.

Barrage jammers also have the disadvantage that they are very easy to detect using a wideband receiver. This can be used to track the jammer using a variety of techniques. A well developed instance of this was deployed by the RAF in their RX12874 network, which could track jammer-carrying aircraft with accuracy equal to a radar. More generally, a barrage jammer&#x27;s signal is so easy to receive that it makes an excellent early warning signal on its own.

<text>In telecommunications and signal processing, baseband is the range of frequencies occupied by a signal that has not been modulated to higher frequencies. Baseband signals typically originate from transducers, converting some other variable into an electrical signal. For example, the electronic output of a microphone is a baseband signal that is analogous to the applied voice audio. In conventional analog radio broadcasting, the baseband audio signal is used to modulate an RF carrier signal of a much higher frequency.

A baseband signal may have frequency components going all the way down to the DC bias, or at least it will have a high ratio bandwidth. A modulated baseband signal is called a passband signal. This occupies a higher range of frequencies and has a lower ratio and fractional bandwidth.

== Various uses ==

=== Baseband signal ===
A &quot;baseband signal&quot; or &quot;lowpass signal&quot; is a signal that can include frequencies that are very near zero, by comparison with its highest frequency (for example, a sound waveform can be considered as a baseband signal, whereas a radio signal or any other modulated signal is not).

A &quot;baseband bandwidth&quot; is equal to the highest frequency of a signal or system, or an upper bound on such frequencies, for example the upper cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter. By contrast, passband bandwidth is the difference between a highest frequency and a nonzero lowest frequency.

=== Baseband channel ===
A &quot;baseband channel&quot; or &quot;lowpass channel&quot; (or &quot;system&quot;, or &quot;network&quot;) is a communication channel that can transfer frequencies that are very near zero. Examples are serial cables and local area networks (LANs), as opposed to passband channels such as radio frequency channels and passband filtered wires of the analog telephone network. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) allows an analog telephone wire to carry a baseband telephone call, concurrently as one or several carrier-modulated telephone calls.

=== Digital baseband transmission ===
Digital baseband transmission, also known as line coding, aims at transferring a digital bit stream over baseband channel, typically an unfiltered wire, contrary to passband transmission, also known as &quot;carrier-modulated&quot; transmission. Passband transmission makes communication possible over a bandpass filtered channel, such as the telephone network local-loop or a band-limited wireless channel.

==== Baseband transmission in Ethernet ====
The word &quot;BASE&quot; in Ethernet physical layer standards, for example 10BASE5, 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-SX, implies baseband digital transmission (i.e. that a line code and an unfiltered wire are used).

=== Baseband processor ===
A baseband processor also known as BP or BBP is used to process the down-converted digital signal to retrieve essential data for a wireless digital system. The baseband processing block in GNSS receivers is responsible for providing observable data: that is, code pseudo-ranges and carrier phase measurements, as well as navigation data.

=== Equivalent baseband signal ===
An &quot;equivalent baseband signal&quot; or &quot;equivalent lowpass signal&quot; is a complex valued representation of the modulated physical signal (the so-called passband signal or RF signal). It is a concept within analog and digital modulation methods for (passband) signals with constant or varying carrier frequency (for example ASK, PSK QAM, and FSK). The equivalent baseband signal is formula_1 where formula_2 is the inphase signal, formula_3 the quadrature phase signal, and formula_4 the imaginary unit. This signal is sometimes called &quot;IQ data&quot;. In a digital modulation method, the formula_2 and formula_3 signals of each modulation symbol are evident from the constellation diagram. The frequency spectrum of this signal includes negative as well as positive frequencies. The physical passband signal corresponds to 
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the carrier angular frequency in rad/s.

== Modulation ==
A signal at baseband is often used to modulate a higher frequency carrier signal in order that it may be transmitted via radio. Modulation results in shifting the signal up to much higher frequencies (radio frequencies, or RF) than it originally spanned. A key consequence of the usual double-sideband amplitude modulation (AM) is that the range of frequencies the signal spans (its spectral bandwidth) is doubled. Thus, the RF bandwidth of a signal (measured from the lowest frequency as opposed to 0 Hz) is twice its baseband bandwidth. Steps may be taken to reduce this effect, such as single-sideband modulation. Conversely, some transmission schemes such as frequency modulation use even more bandwidth.

The figure below shows AM modulation:

<doc id="40779" wikidata="Q795705" url="?curid=40779" title="BCH code">
<text>In coding theory, the Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem codes (BCH codes) form a class of cyclic error-correcting codes that are constructed using polynomials over a finite field (also called a &quot;Galois field&quot;). BCH codes were invented in 1959 by French mathematician Alexis Hocquenghem, and independently in 1960 by Raj Chandra Bose and D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri. The name &quot;Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem&quot; (and the acronym &quot;BCH&quot;) arises from the initials of the inventors&#x27; surnames (mistakenly, in the case of Ray-Chaudhuri).

One of the key features of BCH codes is that during code design, there is a precise control over the number of symbol errors correctable by the code. In particular, it is possible to design binary BCH codes that can correct multiple bit errors. Another advantage of BCH codes is the ease with which they can be decoded, namely, via an algebraic method known as syndrome decoding. This simplifies the design of the decoder for these codes, using small low-power electronic hardware.

BCH codes are used in applications such as satellite communications, compact disc players, DVDs, disk drives, USB flash drives, solid-state drives, and two-dimensional bar codes.

== Definition and illustration ==

=== Primitive narrow-sense BCH codes ===
Given a prime number and prime power with positive integers and such that , a primitive narrow-sense BCH code over the finite field (or Galois field) with code length and distance at least is constructed by the following method.

Let be a primitive element of .
For any positive integer , let be the minimal polynomial with coefficients in of .
The generator polynomial of the BCH code is defined as the least common multiple .
It can be seen that is a polynomial with coefficients in and divides .
Therefore, the polynomial code defined by is a cyclic code.

==== Example ====
Let and (therefore ). We will consider different values of for based on the reducing polynomial , using primitive element . There are fourteen minimum polynomials with coefficients in satisfying
:formula_1

The minimal polynomials are
:formula_2

The BCH code with formula_3 has the generator polynomial
:formula_4

It has minimal Hamming distance at least 3 and corrects up to one error. Since the generator polynomial is of degree 4, this code has 11 data bits and 4 checksum bits. It is also denoted as: (15, 11) BCH code.

The BCH code with formula_5 has the generator polynomial
:formula_6

It has minimal Hamming distance at least 5 and corrects up to two errors. Since the generator polynomial is of degree 8, this code has 7 data bits and 8 checksum bits. It is also denoted as: (15, 7) BCH code.

The BCH code with formula_7 has the generator polynomial
:formula_8

It has minimal Hamming distance at least 7 and corrects up to three errors. Since the generator polynomial is of degree 10, this code has 5 data bits and 10 checksum bits. It is also denoted as: (15, 5) BCH code. (This particular generator polynomial has a real-world application, in the &quot;format information&quot; of the QR code.)

The BCH code with formula_9 and higher has the generator polynomial
:formula_10

This code has minimal Hamming distance 15 and corrects 7 errors. It has 1 data bit and 14 checksum bits. It is also denoted as: (15, 1) BCH code. In fact, this code has only two codewords: 000000000000000 and 111111111111111 (a trivial repetition code).

=== General BCH codes ===
General BCH codes differ from primitive narrow-sense BCH codes in two respects.

First, the requirement that formula_11 be a primitive element of formula_12 can be relaxed. By relaxing this requirement, the code length changes from formula_13 to formula_14 the order of the element formula_15

Second, the consecutive roots of the generator polynomial may run from formula_16 instead of formula_17

Definition. Fix a finite field formula_18 where formula_19 is a prime power. Choose positive integers formula_20 such that formula_21 formula_22 and formula_23 is the multiplicative order of formula_19 modulo formula_25

As before, let formula_11 be a primitive formula_27th root of unity in formula_28 and let formula_29 be the minimal polynomial over formula_30 of formula_31 for all formula_32
The generator polynomial of the BCH code is defined as the least common multiple formula_33

Note: if formula_34 as in the simplified definition, then formula_35 is 1, and the order of formula_19 modulo formula_27 is formula_38
Therefore, the simplified definition is indeed a special case of the general one.

=== Special cases ===
* A BCH code with formula_39 is called a &quot;narrow-sense BCH code&quot;.
* A BCH code with formula_34 is called &quot;primitive&quot;.

The generator polynomial formula_41 of a BCH code has coefficients from formula_42
In general, a cyclic code over formula_43 with formula_41 as the generator polynomial is called a BCH code over formula_45
The BCH code over formula_12 and generator polynomial formula_41 with successive powers of formula_11 as roots is one type of Reed–Solomon code where the decoder (syndromes) alphabet is the same as the channel (data and generator polynomial) alphabet, all elements of formula_12 . The other type of Reed Solomon code is an original view Reed Solomon code which is not a BCH code.

== Properties ==
The generator polynomial of a BCH code has degree at most formula_50. Moreover, if formula_51 and formula_39, the generator polynomial has degree at most formula_53.

Each minimal polynomial formula_29 has degree at most formula_23. Therefore, the least common multiple of formula_56 of them has degree at most formula_50. Moreover, if formula_58 then formula_59 for all formula_60. Therefore, formula_41 is the least common multiple of at most formula_62 minimal polynomials formula_29 for odd indices formula_64 each of degree at most formula_23.
A BCH code has minimal Hamming distance at least formula_66.

Suppose that formula_67 is a code word with fewer than formula_66 non-zero terms. Then

: formula_69

Recall that formula_16 are roots of formula_71 hence of formula_67. This implies that formula_73 satisfy the following equations, for each formula_74:

: formula_75

In matrix form, we have
: formula_76

The determinant of this matrix equals
:formula_77

The matrix formula_78 is seen to be a Vandermonde matrix, and its determinant is
:formula_79
which is non-zero. It therefore follows that formula_80 hence formula_81
A BCH code is cyclic.

A polynomial code of length formula_27 is cyclic if and only if its generator polynomial divides formula_83 Since formula_41 is the minimal polynomial with roots formula_85 it suffices to check that each of formula_16 is a root of formula_83 This follows immediately from the fact that formula_11 is, by definition, an formula_27th root of unity.
== Encoding ==
Because any polynomial that is a multiple of the generator polynomial is a valid BCH codeword, BCH encoding is merely the process of finding some polynomial that has the generator as a factor.

The BCH code itself is not prescriptive about the meaning of the coefficients of the polynomial; conceptually, a BCH decoding algorithm&#x27;s sole concern is to find the valid codeword with the minimal Hamming distance to the received codeword. Therefore, the BCH code may be implemented either as a systematic code or not, depending on how the implementor chooses to embed the message in the encoded polynomial.

=== Non-systematic encoding: The message as a factor ===
The most straightforward way to find a polynomial that is a multiple of the generator is to compute the product of some arbitrary polynomial and the generator. In this case, the arbitrary polynomial can be chosen using the symbols of the message as coefficients.

:formula_90

As an example, consider the generator polynomial formula_91, chosen for use in the (31, 21) binary BCH code used by POCSAG and others. To encode the 21-bit message {101101110111101111101}, we first represent it as a polynomial over formula_92:
:formula_93
Then, compute (also over formula_92):
:formula_95
Thus, the transmitted codeword is {1100111010010111101011101110101}.

The receiver can use these bits as coefficients in formula_96 and, after error-correction to ensure a valid codeword, can recompute formula_97

=== Systematic encoding: The message as a prefix ===
A systematic code is one in which the message appears verbatim somewhere within the codeword. Therefore, systematic BCH encoding involves first embedding the message polynomial within the codeword polynomial, and then adjusting the coefficients of the remaining (non-message) terms to ensure that formula_96 is divisible by formula_41.

This encoding method leverages the fact that subtracting the remainder from a dividend results in a multiple of the divisor. Hence, if we take our message polynomial formula_67 as before and multiply it by formula_101 (to &quot;shift&quot; the message out of the way of the remainder), we can then use Euclidean division of polynomials to yield:
:formula_102

Here, we see that formula_103 is a valid codeword. As formula_104 is always of degree less than formula_105 (which is the degree of formula_41), we can safely subtract it from formula_107 without altering any of the message coefficients, hence we have our formula_96 as
:formula_109

Over formula_92 (i.e. with binary BCH codes), this process is indistinguishable from appending a cyclic redundancy check, and if a systematic binary BCH code is used only for error-detection purposes, we see that BCH codes are just a generalization of the mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks.

The advantage to the systematic coding is that the receiver can recover the original message by discarding everything after the first formula_111 coefficients, after performing error correction.

== Decoding ==
There are many algorithms for decoding BCH codes. The most common ones follow this general outline:
# Calculate the syndromes &quot;sj&quot; for the received vector 
# Determine the number of errors &quot;t&quot; and the error locator polynomial &quot;Λ(x)&quot; from the syndromes 
# Calculate the roots of the error location polynomial to find the error locations &quot;Xi&quot;
# Calculate the error values &quot;Yi&quot; at those error locations 
# Correct the errors

During some of these steps, the decoding algorithm may determine that the received vector has too many errors and cannot be corrected. For example, if an appropriate value of &quot;t&quot; is not found, then the correction would fail. In a truncated (not primitive) code, an error location may be out of range. If the received vector has more errors than the code can correct, the decoder may unknowingly produce an apparently valid message that is not the one that was sent.

===Calculate the syndromes===
The received vector formula_112 is the sum of the correct codeword formula_113 and an unknown error vector formula_114 The syndrome values are formed by considering formula_112 as a polynomial and evaluating it at formula_116 Thus the syndromes are
:formula_117

for formula_118 to formula_119

Since formula_120 are the zeros of formula_71 of which formula_122 is a multiple, formula_123 Examining the syndrome values thus isolates the error vector so one can begin to solve for it.

If there is no error, formula_124 for all formula_125 If the syndromes are all zero, then the decoding is done.

===Calculate the error location polynomial===
If there are nonzero syndromes, then there are errors. The decoder needs to figure out how many errors and the location of those errors.

If there is a single error, write this as formula_126 where formula_60 is the location of the error and formula_128 is its magnitude. Then the first two syndromes are
:formula_129
so together they allow us to calculate formula_128 and provide some information about formula_60 (completely determining it in the case of Reed–Solomon codes).

If there are two or more errors,
:formula_132

It is not immediately obvious how to begin solving the resulting syndromes for the unknowns formula_133 and formula_134

The first step is finding, compatible with computed syndromes and with minimal possible formula_135 locator polynomial:
:formula_136

Three popular algorithms for this task are:
# Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler algorithm
# Berlekamp–Massey algorithm
# Sugiyama Euclidean algorithm

====Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler algorithm====

Peterson&#x27;s algorithm is the step 2 of the generalized BCH decoding procedure. Peterson&#x27;s algorithm is used to calculate the error locator polynomial coefficients formula_137 of a polynomial

: formula_138

Now the procedure of the Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler algorithm. Expect we have at least 2&quot;t&quot; syndromes &quot;s&quot;&quot;c&quot;, …, &quot;s&quot;&quot;c&quot;+2&quot;t&quot;−1. Let &quot;v&quot; = &quot;t&quot;.
===Factor error locator polynomial===
Now that you have the formula_139 polynomial, its roots can be found in the form formula_140 by brute force for example using the Chien search algorithm. The exponential
powers of the primitive element formula_11 will yield the positions where errors occur in the received word; hence the name &#x27;error locator&#x27; polynomial.

The zeros of Λ(&quot;x&quot;) are &quot;α&quot;−&quot;i&quot;1, …, &quot;α&quot;−&quot;i&quot;&quot;v&quot;.

===Calculate error values===
Once the error locations are known, the next step is to determine the error values at those locations. The error values are then used to correct the received values at those locations to recover the original codeword.

For the case of binary BCH, (with all characters readable) this is trivial; just flip the bits for the received word at these positions, and we have the corrected code word. In the more general case, the error weights formula_142 can be determined by solving the linear system
: formula_143

==== Forney algorithm ====
However, there is a more efficient method known as the Forney algorithm.

Let
:formula_144
:formula_145

And the error evaluator polynomial
:formula_146

Finally:
:formula_147

where
:formula_148

Than if syndromes could be explained by an error word, which could be nonzero only on positions formula_149, then error values are
:formula_150

For narrow-sense BCH codes, &quot;c&quot; = 1, so the expression simplifies to:
:formula_151

==== Explanation of Forney algorithm computation ====
It is based on Lagrange interpolation and techniques of generating functions.

Consider formula_152 and for the sake of simplicity suppose formula_153 for formula_154 and formula_155 for formula_156 Then

:formula_157

:formula_158

We want to compute unknowns formula_159 and we could simplify the context by removing the formula_160 terms. This leads to the error evaluator polynomial
:formula_161

Thanks to formula_162 we have
:formula_163

Thanks to formula_164 (the Lagrange interpolation trick) the sum degenerates to only one summand for formula_165

:formula_166

To get formula_133 we just should get rid of the product. We could compute the product directly from already computed roots formula_168 of formula_169 but we could use simpler form.

As formal derivative
:formula_170

we get again only one summand in
:formula_171

So finally
:formula_172

This formula is advantageous when one computes the formal derivative of formula_164 form
:formula_174

yielding:
:formula_147

where
:formula_176

=== Decoding based on extended Euclidean algorithm ===
An alternate process of finding both the polynomial Λ and the error locator polynomial is based on Yasuo Sugiyama&#x27;s adaptation of the Extended Euclidean algorithm. Correction of unreadable characters could be incorporated to the algorithm easily as well.

Let formula_177 be positions of unreadable characters. One creates polynomial localising these positions formula_178
Set values on unreadable positions to 0 and compute the syndromes.

As we have already defined for the Forney formula let formula_179

Let us run extended Euclidean algorithm for locating least common divisor of polynomials formula_180 and formula_181
The goal is not to find the least common divisor, but a polynomial formula_104 of degree at most formula_183 and polynomials formula_184 such that formula_185
Low degree of formula_104 guarantees, that formula_187 would satisfy extended (by formula_188) defining conditions for formula_189

Defining formula_190 and using formula_191 on the place of formula_139 in the Fourney formula will give us error values.

The main advantage of the algorithm is that it meanwhile computes formula_193 required in the Forney formula.

==== Explanation of the decoding process ====
The goal is to find a codeword which differs from the received word minimally as possible on readable positions. When expressing the received word as a sum of nearest codeword and error word, we are trying to find error word with minimal number of non-zeros on readable positions. Syndrom formula_194 restricts error word by condition

:formula_195

We could write these conditions separately or we could create polynomial

:formula_196

and compare coefficients near powers formula_197 to formula_198

:formula_199

Suppose there is unreadable letter on position formula_200 we could replace set of syndromes formula_201 by set of syndromes formula_202 defined by equation formula_203 Suppose for an error word all restrictions by original set formula_201 of syndromes hold,
than

:formula_205

New set of syndromes restricts error vector

:formula_206

the same way the original set of syndromes restricted the error vector formula_207 Except the coordinate formula_200 where we have formula_209 an formula_210 is zero, if formula_211 For the goal of locating error positions we could change the set of syndromes in the similar way to reflect all unreadable characters. This shortens the set of syndromes by formula_212

In polynomial formulation, the replacement of syndromes set formula_201 by syndromes set formula_202 leads to

:formula_215

Therefore,

:formula_216

After replacement of formula_217 by formula_180, one would require equation for coefficients near powers formula_219

One could consider looking for error positions from the point of view of eliminating influence of given positions similarly as for unreadable characters. If we found formula_220 positions such that eliminating their influence leads to obtaining set of syndromes consisting of all zeros, than there exists error vector with errors only on these coordinates.
If formula_139 denotes the polynomial eliminating the influence of these coordinates, we obtain

:formula_222

In Euclidean algorithm, we try to correct at most formula_223 errors (on readable positions), because with bigger error count there could be more codewords in the same distance from the received word. Therefore, for formula_139 we are looking for, the equation must hold for coefficients near powers starting from

:formula_225

In Forney formula, formula_139 could be multiplied by a scalar giving the same result.

It could happen that the Euclidean algorithm finds formula_139 of degree higher than formula_223 having number of different roots equal to its degree, where the Fourney formula would be able to correct errors in all its roots, anyway correcting such many errors could be risky (especially with no other restrictions on received word). Usually after getting formula_139 of higher degree, we decide not to correct the errors. Correction could fail in the case formula_139 has roots with higher multiplicity or the number of roots is smaller than its degree. Fail could be detected as well by Forney formula returning error outside the transmitted alphabet.

===Correct the errors===
Using the error values and error location, correct the errors and form a corrected code vector by subtracting error values at error locations.

===Decoding examples===

==== Decoding of binary code without unreadable characters ====
Consider a BCH code in GF(24) with formula_231 and formula_232. (This is used in QR codes.) Let the message to be transmitted be [1 1 0 1 1], or in polynomial notation, formula_233
The &quot;checksum&quot; symbols are calculated by dividing formula_234 by formula_41 and taking the remainder, resulting in formula_236 or [ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]. These are appended to the message, so the transmitted codeword is [ 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ].

Now, imagine that there are two bit-errors in the transmission, so the received codeword is [ 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]. In polynomial notation:
:formula_237
In order to correct the errors, first calculate the syndromes. Taking formula_238 we have formula_239 formula_240 formula_241 formula_242 formula_243 and formula_244
Next, apply the Peterson procedure by row-reducing the following augmented matrix.
:formula_245
Due to the zero row, is singular, which is no surprise since only two errors were introduced into the codeword.
However, the upper-left corner of the matrix is identical to , which gives rise to the solution formula_246 formula_247
The resulting error locator polynomial is formula_248 which has zeros at formula_249 and formula_250
The exponents of formula_11 correspond to the error locations.
There is no need to calculate the error values in this example, as the only possible value is 1.

==== Decoding with unreadable characters ====
Suppose the same scenario, but the received word has two unreadable characters [ 1 0 ? 1 1 ? 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]. We replace the unreadable characters by zeros while creating the polynomial reflecting their positions formula_252 We compute the syndromes formula_253 and formula_254 (Using log notation which is independent on GF(24) isomorphisms. For computation checking we can use the same representation for addition as was used in previous example. Hexadecimal description of the powers of formula_11 are consecutively 1,2,4,8,3,6,C,B,5,A,7,E,F,D,9 with the addition based on bitwise xor.)

Let us make syndrome polynomial

:formula_256

compute

:formula_257

Run the extended Euclidean algorithm:

:formula_258

We have reached polynomial of degree at most 3, and as

:formula_259

we get

:formula_260

Therefore,

:formula_261

Let formula_262 Don&#x27;t worry that formula_263 Find by brute force a root of formula_189 The roots are formula_265 and formula_266 (after finding for example formula_267 we can divide formula_164 by corresponding monom formula_269 and the root of resulting monom could be found easily).

Let

:formula_270

Let us look for error values using formula

:formula_271

where formula_168 are roots of formula_273 formula_274 We get

:formula_275

<text>The beam diameter or beam width of an electromagnetic beam is the diameter along any specified line that is perpendicular to the beam axis and intersects it. Since beams typically do not have sharp edges, the diameter can be defined in many different ways. Five definitions of the beam width are in common use: D4σ, 10/90 or 20/80 knife-edge, 1/e2, FWHM, and D86. The beam width can be measured in units of length at a particular plane perpendicular to the beam axis, but it can also refer to the angular width, which is the angle subtended by the beam at the source. The angular width is also called the beam divergence.

Beam diameter is usually used to characterize electromagnetic beams in the optical regime, and occasionally in the microwave regime, that is, cases in which the aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the wavelength.

Beam diameter usually refers to a beam of circular cross section, but not necessarily so. A beam may, for example, have an elliptical cross section, in which case the orientation of the beam diameter must be specified, for example with respect to the major or minor axis of the elliptical cross section. The term &quot;beam width&quot; may be preferred in applications where the beam does not have circular symmetry.

==Definitions==

===Rayleigh beamwidth===
The angle between the maximum peak of radiated power and the first null (no power radiated in this direction) is called the Rayleigh beamwidth.

===Full width at half maximum===

The simplest way to define the width of a beam is to choose two diametrically opposite points at which the irradiance is a specified fraction of the beam&#x27;s peak irradiance, and take the distance between them as a measure of the beam&#x27;s width. An obvious choice for this fraction is (−3 dB), in which case the diameter obtained is the full width of the beam at half its maximum intensity (FWHM). This is also called the &quot;half-power beam width&quot; (HPBW).

=== 1/e2 width ===
The 1/e2 width is equal to the distance between the two points on the marginal distribution that are 1/e2 = 0.135 times the maximum value. In many cases, it makes more sense to take the distance between points where the intensity falls to 1/e2 = 0.135 times the maximum value. If there are more than two points that are 1/e2 times the maximum value, then the two points closest to the maximum are chosen. The 1/e2 width is important in the mathematics of Gaussian beams, in which the intensity profile is described by formula_1.

The American National Standard Z136.1-2007 for Safe Use of Lasers (p. 6) defines the beam diameter as the distance between diametrically opposed points in that cross-section of a beam where the power per unit area is 1/e (0.368) times that of the peak power per unit area. This is the beam diameter definition that is used for computing the maximum permissible exposure to a laser beam. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration also uses the 1/e definition for laser safety calculations in FAA Order JO 7400.2, Para. 29-1-5d.

Measurements of the 1/e2 width only depend on three points on the marginal distribution, unlike D4σ and knife-edge widths that depend on the integral of the marginal distribution. 1/e2 width measurements are noisier than D4σ width measurements. For multimodal marginal distributions (a beam profile with multiple peaks), the 1/e2 width usually does not yield a meaningful value and can grossly underestimate the inherent width of the beam. For multimodal distributions, the D4σ width is a better choice. For an ideal single-mode Gaussian beam, the D4σ, D86 and 1/e2 width measurements would give the same value.

For a Gaussian beam, the relationship between the 1/e2 width and the full width at half maximum is formula_2, where formula_3 is the full width of the beam at 1/e2.

=== D4σ or second-moment width ===
The D4σ width of a beam in the horizontal or vertical direction is 4 times σ, where σ is the standard deviation of the horizontal or vertical marginal distribution respectively. Mathematically, the D4σ beam width in the &quot;x&quot; dimension for the beam profile formula_4 is expressed as

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

is the centroid of the beam profile in the &quot;x&quot; direction.

When a beam is measured with a laser beam profiler, the wings of the beam profile influence the D4σ value more than the center of the profile, since the wings are weighted by the square of its distance, &quot;x&quot;2, from the center of the beam. If the beam does not fill more than a third of the beam profiler&#x27;s sensor area, then there will be a significant number of pixels at the edges of the sensor that register a small baseline value (the background value). If the baseline value is large or if it is not subtracted out of the image, then the computed D4σ value will be larger than the actual value because the baseline value near the edges of the sensor are weighted in the D4σ integral by &quot;x&quot;2. Therefore, baseline subtraction is necessary for accurate D4σ measurements. The baseline is easily measured by recording the average value for each pixel when the sensor is not illuminated. The D4σ width, unlike the FWHM and 1/e2 widths, is meaningful for multimodal marginal distributions — that is, beam profiles with multiple peaks — but requires careful subtraction of the baseline for accurate results. The D4σ is the ISO international standard definition for beam width.

=== Knife-edge width ===
Before the advent of the CCD beam profiler, the beam width was estimated using the knife-edge technique: slice a laser beam with a razor and measure the power of the clipped beam as a function of the razor position. The measured curve is the integral of the marginal distribution, and starts at the total beam power and decreases monotonically to zero power. The width of the beam is defined as the distance between the points of the measured curve that are 10% and 90% (or 20% and 80%) of the maximum value. If the baseline value is small or subtracted out, the knife-edge beam width always corresponds to 60%, in the case of 20/80, or 80%, in the case of 10/90, of the total beam power no matter what the beam profile. On the other hand, the D4σ, 1/e2, and FWHM widths encompass fractions of power that are beam-shape dependent. Therefore, the 10/90 or 20/80 knife-edge width is a useful metric when the user wishes to be sure that the width encompasses a fixed fraction of total beam power. Most CCD beam profiler&#x27;s software can compute the knife-edge width numerically.

=== Fusing knife-edge method with imaging ===
The main drawback of the knife-edge technique is that the measured value is displayed only on the scanning direction, minimizing the amount of relevant beam information. To overcome this drawback, an innovative technology offered commercially allows multiple directions beam scanning to create an image like beam representation.

By mechanically moving the knife edge across the beam, the amount of energy impinging the detector area is determined by the obstruction. The profile is then measured from the knife-edge velocity and its relation to the detector&#x27;s energy reading. Unlike other systems, a unique scanning technique uses several different oriented knife-edges to sweep across the beam. By using tomographic reconstruction, mathematical processes reconstruct the laser beam size in different orientations to an image similar to the one produced by CCD cameras. The main advantage of this scanning method is that it is free from pixel size limitations (as in CCD cameras) and allows beam reconstructions with wavelengths not usable with existing CCD technology. Reconstruction is possible for beams in deep UV to far IR.

=== D86 width ===
The D86 width is defined as the diameter of the circle that is centered at the centroid of the beam profile and contains 86% of the beam power. The solution for D86 is found by computing the area of increasingly larger circles around the centroid until the area contains 0.86 of the total power. Unlike the previous beam width definitions, the D86 width is not derived from marginal distributions. The percentage of 86, rather than 50, 80, or 90, is chosen because a circular Gaussian beam profile integrated down to 1/e2 of its peak value contains 86% of its total power. The D86 width is often used in applications that are concerned with knowing exactly how much power is in a given area. For example, applications of high-energy laser weapons and lidars require precise knowledge of how much transmitted power actually illuminates the target.

==== ISO11146 beam width for elliptic beams ====

The definition given before holds for stigmatic (circular symmetric) beams only. For astigmatic beams, however, a more rigorous definition of the beam width has to be used:
:formula_7
and
:formula_8
This definition also incorporates information about &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; correlation formula_9, but for circular symmetric beams, both definitions are the same.

Some new symbols appeared within the formulas, which are the first- and second-order moments:
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14
the beam power 
:formula_15
and 
:formula_16

Using this general definition, also the beam azimuthal angle formula_17 can be expressed. It is the angle between the beam directions of minimal and maximal elongations, known as principal axes, and the laboratory system, being the formula_18 and formula_19 axes of the detector and given by 
:formula_20

==Measurement==
International standard ISO 11146-1:2005 specifies methods for measuring beam widths (diameters), divergence angles and beam propagation ratios of laser beams (if the beam is stigmatic) and for general astigmatic beams ISO 11146-2 is applicable. The D4σ beam width is the ISO standard definition and the measurement of the M2 beam quality parameter requires the measurement of the D4σ widths.

The other definitions provide complementary information to the D4σ. The D4σ and knife-edge widths are sensitive to the baseline value, whereas the 1/e2 and FWHM widths are not. The fraction of total beam power encompassed by the beam width depends on which definition is used.

The width of laser beams can be measured by capturing an image on a camera, or by using a laser beam profiler.

<doc id="40781" wikidata="Q1230543" url="?curid=40781" title="Beam divergence">
<text>In electromagnetics, especially in optics, beam divergence is an angular measure of the increase in beam diameter or radius with distance from the optical aperture or antenna aperture from which the beam emerges. The term is relevant only in the &quot;far field&quot;, away from any focus of the beam. Practically speaking, however, the far field can commence physically close to the radiating aperture, depending on aperture diameter and the operating wavelength.

Beam divergence is often used to characterize electromagnetic beams in the optical regime, for cases in which the aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the wavelength. However, it is also used in the radio frequency (RF) band for cases in which the antenna is very large relative to a wavelength.

Beam divergence usually refers to a beam of circular cross section, but not necessarily so. A beam may, for example, have an elliptical cross section, in which case the orientation of the beam divergence must be specified, for example with respect to the major or minor axis of the elliptical cross section.

The divergence of a beam can be calculated if one knows the beam diameter at two separate points far from any focus (&quot;Di&quot;, &quot;Df&quot;), and the distance (&quot;l&quot;) between these points. The beam divergence, formula_1, is given by 
:formula_2

If a collimated beam is focused with a lens, the diameter formula_3 of the beam in the rear focal plane of the lens is related to the divergence of the initial beam by 
:formula_4
where &quot;f&quot; is the focal length of the lens. Note that this measurement is valid only when the beam size is measured at the rear focal plane of the lens, i.e. where the focus would lie for a truly collimated beam, and not at the actual focus of the beam, which would occur behind the rear focal plane for a divergent beam.

Like all electromagnetic beams, lasers are subject to divergence, which is measured in milliradians (mrad) or degrees. For many applications, a lower-divergence beam is preferable. Neglecting divergence due to poor beam quality, the divergence of a laser beam is proportional to its wavelength and inversely proportional to the diameter of the beam at its narrowest point. For example, an ultraviolet laser that emits at a wavelength of 308 nm will have a lower divergence than an infrared laser at 808 nm, if both have the same minimum beam diameter. The divergence of good-quality laser beams is modeled using the mathematics of Gaussian beams.

Gaussian laser beams are said to be diffraction limited when their radial beam divergence formula_5 is close to the minimum possible value, which is given by 

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the laser wavelength and formula_8 is the radius of the beam at its narrowest point, which is called the &quot;beam waist&quot;. This type of beam divergence is observed from optimized laser cavities. Information on the diffraction-limited divergence of a coherent beam is inherently given by the N-slit interferometric equation.

<text>Beam steering is a technique for changing the direction of the main lobe of a radiation pattern.

In radio and radar systems, beam steering may be accomplished by switching the antenna elements or by changing the relative phases of the RF signals driving the elements. As a result, this directs the transmit signal towards an intended receiver. In recent days, beam steering is playing a significant role in 5G communication because of quasi-optic nature of 5G frequencies.

In acoustics, beam steering is used to direct the audio from loudspeakers to a specific location in the listening area. This is done by changing the magnitude and phase of two or more loudspeakers installed in a column where the combined sound is added and cancelled at the required position. Commercially, this type of loudspeaker arrangement is known as a line array. This technique has been around for many years but since the emergence of modern digital signal processing (DSP) technology there are now many commercially available products on the market. Beam steering and directivity Control using DSP was pioneered in the early 1990s by Duran Audio who launched a technology called DDC (Digital Directivity Control).

In optical systems, beam steering may be accomplished by changing the refractive index of the medium through which the beam is transmitted or by the use of mirrors, prisms, lenses, or rotating diffraction gratings. Examples of optical beam steering approaches include mechanical mirror-based gimbals or beam-director units, galvanometer mechanisms that rotate mirrors, Risley prisms, phased-array optics, and microelectromechanical systems using micro-mirrors.

== Beam Steering Applications and Emerging Techniques ==
The scope of beam-steering technologies has broadened significantly with innovations that serve both traditional applications and emerging demands in fields such as satellite communication, radar, and 5G networks. Traditional methods like parabolic reflectors and phased arrays are now complemented by Reflectarray (RA) and Transmitarray (TA) antennas. These designs serve as high-gain, planar alternatives with advantages in cost, efficiency, and scalability, meeting modern requirements for compact and lightweight systems. One of the latest approaches in beam steering involves Near-Field Meta-Steering (NFMS), which uses phase-gradient metasurfaces placed in close proximity to a feed antenna. This method achieves 3D beam steering by employing compact structures that allow wide-angle control over both elevation and azimuth, proving highly effective for systems where space and profile height are restricted. 

Beam steering has also found essential applications in high-speed, interference-free communication for defense and civilian markets. Satellite-based communication systems, for example, require dual-band beam-steering capabilities to handle uplink and downlink data streams simultaneously. The development of beam-steering antennas for Satellite Communication on the Move (SOTM) systems highlights the need for antennas that are not only efficient but also lightweight, low-profile, and cost-effective. Challenges remain, including addressing cost constraints and achieving higher scanning speeds and wider bandwidths.

<doc id="40786" wikidata="Q742736" url="?curid=40786" title="Bias">
<text>Bias is a disproportionate weight &quot;in favor of&quot; or &quot;against&quot; an idea or thing, usually in a way that is inaccurate, closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair. Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. In science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error. Statistical bias results from an unfair sampling of a population, or from an estimation process that does not give accurate results on average.

==Etymology==
The word appears to derive from Old Provençal into Old French &quot;biais&quot;, &quot;sideways, askance, against the grain&quot;. Whence comes French &quot;biais&quot;, &quot;a slant, a slope, an oblique&quot;.

It seems to have entered English via the game of bowls, where it referred to balls made with a greater weight on one side. Which expanded to the figurative use, &quot;a one-sided tendency of the mind&quot;, and, at first especially in law, &quot;undue propensity or prejudice&quot;. or ballast, used to lower the centre of gravity of a ship to increase stability and to keep the ship from one side.

==Types==

===Cognitive biases===

A cognitive bias is a repeating or basic misstep in thinking, assessing, recollecting, or other cognitive processes. That is, a pattern of deviation from standards in judgment, whereby inferences may be created unreasonably. People create their own &quot;subjective social reality&quot; from their own perceptions, their view of the world may dictate their behaviour. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality. However some cognitive biases are taken to be adaptive, and thus may lead to success in the appropriate situation. Furthermore, cognitive biases as an example through education may allow faster choice selection when speedier outcomes for a task are more valuable than precision. Other cognitive biases are a &quot;by-product&quot; of human processing limitations, coming about because of an absence of appropriate mental mechanisms, or just from human limitations in information processing.

====Anchoring====

Anchoring is a psychological heuristic that describes the propensity to rely on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions. According to this heuristic, individuals begin with an implicitly suggested reference point (the &quot;anchor&quot;) and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate. For example, the initial price offered for a used car sets the standard for the rest of the negotiations, so that prices lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is worth.

====Apophenia====

Apophenia, also known as patternicity, or agenticity, is the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data. Apophenia is well documented as a rationalization for gambling. Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers which appear in lotteries, card games, or roulette wheels. One manifestation of this is known as the &quot;gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot;.

Pareidolia is the visual or auditory form of apophenia. It has been suggested that pareidolia combined with hierophany may have helped ancient societies organize chaos and make the world intelligible.

====Attribution bias====

An attribution bias can happen when individuals assess or attempt to discover explanations behind their own and others&#x27; behaviors. People make attributions about the causes of their own and others&#x27; behaviors; but these attributions do not necessarily precisely reflect reality. Rather than operating as objective perceivers, individuals are inclined to perceptual slips that prompt biased understandings of their social world. When judging others we tend to assume their actions are the result of internal factors such as personality, whereas we tend to assume our own actions arise because of the necessity of external circumstances. There are a wide range of sorts of attribution biases, such as the ultimate attribution error, fundamental attribution error, actor-observer bias, and self-serving bias.

Examples of attribution bias:

====Confirmation bias====


Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one&#x27;s beliefs or hypotheses while giving disproportionately less attention to information that contradicts it. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations). Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor decisions due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.

====Framing====
Framing involves the social construction of social phenomena by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, and so on. It is an influence over how people organize, perceive, and communicate about reality. It can be positive or negative, depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand. As understood in social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. People use filters to make sense of the world, the choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.

Cultural bias is the related phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one&#x27;s own culture. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, location of body parts, mate selection, concepts of justice, linguistic and logical validity, acceptability of evidence, and taboos. Ordinary people may tend to imagine other people as basically the same, not significantly more or less valuable, probably attached emotionally to different groups and different land.

====Halo effect and horn effect====

The halo effect and the horn effect are when an observer&#x27;s overall impression of a person, organization, brand, or product influences their feelings about specifics of that entity&#x27;s character or properties.

The name halo effect is based on the concept of the saint&#x27;s halo, and is a specific type of confirmation bias, wherein positive sentiments in one area cause questionable or unknown characteristics to be seen positively. If the observer likes one aspect of something, they will have a positive predisposition toward everything about it. A person&#x27;s appearance has been found to produce a halo effect. The halo effect is also present in the field of brand marketing, affecting perception of companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The opposite of the halo is the horn effect, when &quot;individuals believe (that negative) traits are inter-connected.&quot; The term horn effect refers to Devil&#x27;s horns. It works in a negative direction: if the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition towards other aspects.

====Self-serving bias====

Self-serving bias is the tendency for cognitive or perceptual processes to be distorted by the individual&#x27;s need to maintain and enhance self-esteem. It is the propensity to credit accomplishment to our own capacities and endeavors, yet attribute failure to outside factors, to dismiss the legitimacy of negative criticism, concentrate on positive qualities and accomplishments yet disregard flaws and failures. Studies have demonstrated that this bias can affect behavior in the workplace, in interpersonal relationships, playing sports, and in consumer decisions.

====Status quo bias====

Status quo bias is an emotional bias; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the status quo ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.

===Conflicts of interest===

A conflict of interest is when a person or association has intersecting interests (financial, personal, etc.) which could potentially corrupt. The potential conflict is autonomous of actual improper actions, it can be found and intentionally defused before corruption, or the appearance of corruption, happens. &quot;A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.&quot; It exists if the circumstances are sensibly accepted to present a hazard that choices made may be unduly affected by auxiliary interests.

====Corruption====
A conflict of interest arises when a decision-maker participates in a corrupt act that seeks to influence the outcome in favor of a specific individual, organization, or entity in a decision-making process. For example, attempts to solicit a bribe or kickback in exchange for favoring a party creates a conflict of interest. A perceived conflict of interest may also arise in an individual who is offered such a payment, even if it is declined, particularly in situations where the attempt to bribe is not reported.

Laws restricting monetary transaction is appropriate can differ between jurisdictions based upon their criminal laws. For example, some nations criminalize the receipt of political campaign contributions in the form of cash, while other nations permit cash donations provided that donors otherwise adhere to election law.

====Favoritism====

Favoritism, sometimes known as in-group favoritism, or in-group bias, refers to a pattern of favoring members of one&#x27;s in-group over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways. This has been researched by psychologists, especially social psychologists, and linked to group conflict and prejudice. Cronyism is favoritism of long-standing friends, especially by appointing them to positions of authority, regardless of their qualifications. Nepotism is favoritism granted to relatives.

====Lobbying====

Lobbying is the attempt to influence choices made by administrators, frequently lawmakers or individuals from administrative agencies. Lobbyists may be among a legislator&#x27;s constituencies, or not; they may engage in lobbying as a business, or not. Lobbying is often spoken of with contempt, the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a duty to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents&#x27; interests or more broadly the common good, stand to benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, there is a conflict of interest. This can lead to all sides in a debate looking to sway the issue by means of lobbyists.

====Regulatory issues====

Self-regulation is the process whereby an organization monitors its own adherence to legal, ethical, or safety standards, rather than have an outside, independent agency such as a third party entity monitor and enforce those standards. Self-regulation of any group can create a conflict of interest. If any organization, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself.

Regulatory capture is a form of political corruption that can occur when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating. Regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether. Regulatory capture is a risk to which a regulatory agency is exposed by its very nature.

====Shilling====

Shilling is deliberately giving spectators the feeling that one is an energetic autonomous client of a vendor for whom one is working. The effectiveness of shilling relies on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shilling is illegal in some places, but legal in others. An example of shilling is paid reviews that give the impression of being autonomous opinions.

===Statistical biases===

Statistical bias is a systematic tendency in the process of data collection, which results in lopsided, misleading results. This can occur in any of a number of ways, in the way the sample is selected, or in the way data are collected. It is a property of a statistical technique or of its results whereby the expected value of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative parameter being estimated.

====Forecast bias====

A forecast bias is when there are consistent differences between results and the forecasts of those quantities; that is: forecasts may have an overall tendency to be too high or too low.

====Observer-expectancy effect====

The observer-expectancy effect is when a researcher&#x27;s expectations cause them to subconsciously influence the people participating in an experiment. It is usually controlled using a double-blind system, and was an important reason for the development of double-blind experiments.

====Reporting bias and social desirability bias====

In epidemiology and empirical research, reporting bias is defined as &quot;selective revealing or suppression of information&quot; of undesirable behavior by subjects or researchers.
It refers to a tendency to under-report unexpected or undesirable experimental results, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results. This can propagate, as each instance reinforces the status quo, and later experimenters justify their own reporting bias by observing that previous experimenters reported different results.

Social desirability bias is a bias within social science research where survey respondents can tend to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed positively by others. It can take the form of over-reporting laudable behavior, or under-reporting undesirable behavior. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences. The inclination represents a major issue with self-report questionnaires; of special concern are self-reports of abilities, personalities, sexual behavior, and drug use.

====Selection bias====
Selection bias is the conscious or unconscious bias introduced into a study by the way individuals, groups or data are selected for analysis, if such a way means that true randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. This results in a sample that may be significantly different from the overall population.

===Prejudices===

Bias and prejudice are usually considered to be closely related. Prejudice is prejudgment, or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case. The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of gender, political opinion, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race/ethnicity, language, nationality, or other personal characteristics. Prejudice can also refer to unfounded beliefs and may include &quot;any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence&quot;.

====Ageism====

Ageism is the stereotyping and/or discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. It can be used in reference to prejudicial attitudes towards older people, or towards younger people.

====Classism====

Classism is discrimination on the basis of social class. It includes attitudes that benefit the upper class at the expense of the lower class, or vice versa.

====Lookism====

Lookism is stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination on the basis of physical attractiveness, or more generally to people whose appearance matches cultural preferences. Many people make automatic judgments of others based on their physical appearance that influence how they respond to those people.

====Racism====

Racism consists of ideologies based on a desire to dominate or a belief in the inferiority of another race. It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently.

====Sexism====
==Contextual biases==

===Biases in academia===
====Academic bias====

Academic bias is the bias or perceived bias of scholars allowing their beliefs to shape their research and the scientific community. Claims of bias are often linked to claims by conservatives of pervasive bias against political conservatives and religious Christians. Some have argued that these claims are based upon anecdotal evidence which would not reliably indicate systematic bias, and have suggested that this divide is due to self-selection of conservatives choosing not to pursue academic careers.
There is some evidence that perception of classroom bias may be rooted in issues of sexuality, race, class and sex as much or more than in religion.

====Experimenter bias====

In science research, experimenter bias occurs when experimenter expectancies regarding study results bias the research outcome. Examples of experimenter bias include conscious or unconscious influences on subject behavior including creation of demand characteristics that influence subjects, and altered or selective recording of experimental results themselves. It can also involve asking leading probes and not neutrally redirecting the subject back to the task when they ask for validation or questions.

====Funding bias====

Funding bias refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study&#x27;s financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. It can be caused by any or all of: a conscious or subconscious sense of obligation of researchers towards their employers, misconduct or malpractice, publication bias, or reporting bias.

====Full text on net bias====

Full text on net (or FUTON) bias is a tendency of scholars to cite academic journals with open access—that is, journals that make their full text available on the internet without charge—in their own writing as compared with toll access publications. Scholars can more easily discover and access articles that have their full text on the internet, which increases authors&#x27; likelihood of reading, quoting, and citing these articles, this may increase the impact factor of open access journals relative to journals without open access.

The related bias, no abstract available bias (NAA bias) is scholars&#x27; tendency to cite journal articles that have an abstract available online more readily than articles that do not.

====Publication bias====

Publication bias is a type of bias with regard to what academic research is likely to be published because of a tendency among researchers and journal editors to prefer some outcomes rather than others (e.g., results showing a significant finding), which leads to a problematic bias in the published literature. This can propagate further as literature reviews of claims about support for a hypothesis will themselves be biased if the original literature is contaminated by publication bias. Studies with significant results often do not appear to be superior to studies with a null result with respect to quality of design. However, statistically significant results have been shown to be three times more likely to be published compared to papers with null results.

===Biases in law enforcement===
====Driving while black====

Driving while black refers to the racial profiling of African American drivers. The phrase implies that a motorist might be pulled over by a police officer, questioned, and searched, because of a racial bias.

====Racial profiling====

Racial profiling, or ethnic profiling, is the act of suspecting or targeting a person of a certain race on the basis of racially observed characteristics or behavior, rather than on individual suspicion. Racial profiling is commonly referred to regarding its use by law enforcement, and its leading to discrimination against minorities.

====Victim blaming====

Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a wrongful act is held at fault for the harm that befell them. The study of victimology seeks to mitigate the perception of victims as responsible.

===Biases in media===
Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of journalists and news producers within the mass media in the selection of events, the stories that are reported, and how they are covered. The term generally implies a pervasive or widespread bias violating the standards of journalism, rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. The level of media bias in different nations is debated. There are also watchdog groups that report on media bias.

Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative, government influence including overt and covert censorship, the influence of the owners of the news source, concentration of media ownership, the selection of staff, the preferences of an intended audience, and pressure from advertisers.

Bias has been a feature of the mass media since its birth with the invention of the printing press. The expense of early printing equipment restricted media production to a limited number of people. Historians have found that publishers often served the interests of powerful social groups.

====Agenda setting====

Agenda setting describes the capacity of the media to focus on particular stories, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important. That is, its salience will increase.

====Gatekeeping====

Gatekeeping is the way in which information and news are filtered to the public, by each person or corporation along the way. It is the &quot;process of culling and crafting countless bits of information into the limited number of messages that reach people every day, and it is the center of the media&#x27;s role in modern public life. [...] This process determines not only which information is selected, but also what the content and nature of the messages, such as news, will be.&quot;

====Sensationalism====

Sensationalism is when events and topics in news stories and pieces are overhyped to present skewed impressions of events, which may cause a misrepresentation of the truth of a story. Sensationalism may involve reporting about insignificant matters and events, or the presentation of newsworthy topics in a trivial or tabloid manner contrary to the standards of professional journalism.

===Other contexts===
====Educational bias====

Bias in education refers to real or perceived bias in the educational system. The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term &quot;whitewashing&quot; is used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment. Religious bias in textbooks is observed in countries where religion plays a dominant role. There can be many forms of educational bias. Some overlooked aspects, occurring especially with the pedagogical circles of public and private schools—sources that are unrelated to fiduciary or mercantile impoverishment which may be unduly magnified—include teacher bias as well as a general bias against women who are going into STEM research.

====Inductive bias====

Inductive bias occurs within the field of machine learning. In machine learning one seeks to develop algorithms that are able to &quot;learn&quot; to anticipate a particular output. To accomplish this, the learning algorithm is given training cases that show the expected connection. Then the learner is tested with new examples. Without further assumptions, this problem cannot be solved exactly as unknown situations may not be predictable. The inductive bias of the learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered. It may bias the learner towards the correct solution, the incorrect, or be correct some of the time. A classical example of an inductive bias is Occam&#x27;s Razor, which assumes that the simplest consistent hypothesis is the best.

====Insider trading====

Insider trading is the trading of a public company&#x27;s stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to non-public information about the company. In various countries, trading based on insider information is illegal because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information as the investor with insider information could potentially make far larger profits that a typical investor could make.

====Match fixing====

In organized sports, match fixing occurs when a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. There is a variety of reasons for this, but the most common is in exchange for a payoff from gamblers. Players might also intentionally perform poorly to get an advantage in the future (such as a better draft pick, or an easier opponent in a playoff), or to rig a handicap system. Match-fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another form of match-fixing, known as spot-fixing, involves fixing small events within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the final result of the game.

===Implicit bias===
An implicit bias, or implicit stereotype, is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group.

Implicit stereotypes are shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individuals&#x27; perceptions and behaviors can be influenced by the implicit stereotypes they hold, even if they are unaware/unintentionally hold such stereotypes. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes operate without conscious intention. For example, researchers may have implicit bias when designing survey questions and as a result, the questions do not produce accurate results or fail to encourage survey participation. The existence of implicit bias is supported by a variety of scientific articles in psychological literature. Implicit stereotype was first defined by psychologists Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald in 1995.

<text>In telecommunications, a bipolar signal is a signal which may assume either of two polarities, neither of which is zero. 

A bipolar signal may have a two-state non-return-to-zero (NRZ) or a three-state return-to-zero (RZ) binary coding scheme. 

A bipolar signal is usually symmetrical with respect to zero amplitude, &quot;i.e.&quot; the absolute values of the positive and negative signal states are nominally equal. Contrast with unipolar encoding where one state is zero amplitude.

<doc id="40794" wikidata="Q840922" url="?curid=40794" title="Bit error rate">
<text>In digital transmission, the number of bit errors is the number of received bits of a data stream over a communication channel that have been altered due to noise, interference, distortion or bit synchronization errors.

The bit error rate (BER) is the number of bit errors per unit time. The bit error ratio (also BER) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. Bit error ratio is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a percentage.

The bit error probability &quot;pe&quot; is the expected value of the bit error ratio. The bit error ratio can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability. This estimate is accurate for a long time interval and a high number of bit errors.

==Example==
As an example, assume this transmitted bit sequence:

1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 

and the following received bit sequence:

0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1,

The number of bit errors (the underlined bits) is, in this case, 3. The BER is 3 incorrect bits divided by 9 transferred bits, resulting in a BER of 0.333 or 33.3%.

==Packet error ratio==
The packet error ratio (PER) is the number of incorrectly received data packets divided by the total number of received packets. A packet is declared incorrect if at least one bit is erroneous. The expectation value of the PER is denoted packet error probability &quot;pp&quot;, which for a data packet length of &quot;N&quot; bits can be expressed as

:formula_1,

assuming that the bit errors are independent of each other. For small bit error probabilities and large data packets, this is approximately

:formula_2

Similar measurements can be carried out for the transmission of frames, blocks, or symbols.

The above expression can be rearranged to express the corresponding BER (&quot;pe&quot;) as a function of the PER (&quot;pp&quot;) and the data packet length &quot;N&quot; in bits:

:formula_3

==Factors affecting the BER==
In a communication system, the receiver side BER may be affected by transmission channel noise, interference, distortion, bit synchronization problems, attenuation, wireless multipath fading, etc.

The BER may be improved by choosing a strong signal strength (unless this causes cross-talk and more bit errors), by choosing a slow and robust modulation scheme or line coding scheme, and by applying channel coding schemes such as redundant forward error correction codes.

The &quot;transmission BER&quot; is the number of detected bits that are incorrect before error correction, divided by the total number of transferred bits (including redundant error codes). The &quot;information BER&quot;, approximately equal to the decoding error probability, is the number of decoded bits that remain incorrect after the error correction, divided by the total number of decoded bits (the useful information). Normally the transmission BER is larger than the information BER. The information BER is affected by the strength of the forward error correction code.

==Analysis of the BER==
The BER may be evaluated using stochastic (Monte Carlo) computer simulations. If a simple transmission channel model and data source model is assumed, the BER may also be calculated analytically. An example of such a data source model is the Bernoulli source.

Examples of simple channel models used in information theory are:
* Binary symmetric channel (used in analysis of decoding error probability in case of non-bursty bit errors on the transmission channel)
* Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel without fading.

A worst-case scenario is a completely random channel, where noise totally dominates over the useful signal. This results in a transmission BER of 50% (provided that a Bernoulli binary data source and a binary symmetrical channel are assumed, see below).


In a noisy channel, the BER is often expressed as a function of the normalized carrier-to-noise ratio measure denoted Eb/N0, (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio), or Es/N0 (energy per modulation symbol to noise spectral density).

For example, in the case of BPSK modulation and AWGN channel, the BER as function of the Eb/N0 is given by:

formula_4,

where
formula_5. 

People usually plot the BER curves to describe the performance of a digital communication system. In optical communication, BER(dB) vs. Received Power(dBm) is usually used; while in wireless communication, BER(dB) vs. SNR(dB) is used.

Measuring the bit error ratio helps people choose the appropriate forward error correction codes. Since most such codes correct only bit-flips, but not bit-insertions or bit-deletions, the Hamming distance metric is the appropriate way to measure the number of bit errors. Many FEC coders also continuously measure the current BER.

A more general way of measuring the number of bit errors is the Levenshtein distance.
The Levenshtein distance measurement is more appropriate for measuring raw channel performance before frame synchronization, and when using error correction codes designed to correct bit-insertions and bit-deletions, such as Marker Codes and Watermark Codes.

==Mathematical draft==
The BER is the likelihood of a bit misinterpretation due to electrical noise formula_6. Considering a bipolar NRZ transmission, we have

formula_7 for a &quot;1&quot; and formula_8 for a &quot;0&quot;. Each of formula_9 and formula_10 has a period of formula_11.

Knowing that the noise has a bilateral spectral density formula_12,

formula_9 is formula_14

and formula_10 is formula_16.

Returning to BER, we have the likelihood of a bit misinterpretation formula_17.

formula_18 and formula_19

where formula_20 is the threshold of decision, set to 0 when formula_21.

We can use the average energy of the signal formula_22 to find the final expression :

formula_23

==Bit error rate test==
BERT or bit error rate test is a testing method for digital communication circuits that uses predetermined stress patterns consisting of a sequence of logical ones and zeros generated by a test pattern generator.

A BERT typically consists of a test pattern generator and a receiver that can be set to the same pattern. They can be used in pairs, with one at either end of a transmission link, or singularly at one end with a loopback at the remote end. BERTs are typically stand-alone specialised instruments, but can be personal computer–based. In use, the number of errors, if any, are counted and presented as a ratio such as 1 in 1,000,000, or 1 in 1e06.

===Common types of BERT stress patterns===
*PRBS (pseudorandom binary sequence) – A pseudorandom binary sequencer of N Bits. These pattern sequences are used to measure jitter and eye mask of TX-Data in electrical and optical data links.
*QRSS (quasi random signal source) – A pseudorandom binary sequencer which generates every combination of a 20-bit word, repeats every 1,048,575 words, and suppresses consecutive zeros to no more than 14. It contains high-density sequences, low-density sequences, and sequences that change from low to high and vice versa. This pattern is also the standard pattern used to measure jitter.
*3 in 24 – Pattern contains the longest string of consecutive zeros (15) with the lowest ones density (12.5%). This pattern simultaneously stresses minimum ones density and the maximum number of consecutive zeros. The D4 frame format of 3 in 24 may cause a D4 yellow alarm for frame circuits depending on the alignment of one bits to a frame.
*1:7 – Also referred to as &quot;1 in 8&quot;. It has only a single one in an eight-bit repeating sequence. This pattern stresses the minimum ones density of 12.5% and should be used when testing facilities set for B8ZS coding as the 3 in 24 pattern increases to 29.5% when converted to B8ZS.
*Min/max – Pattern rapid sequence changes from low density to high density. Most useful when stressing the repeater&#x27;s ALBO feature.
*All ones (or mark) – A pattern composed of ones only. This pattern causes the repeater to consume the maximum amount of power. If DC to the repeater is regulated properly, the repeater will have no trouble transmitting the long ones sequence. This pattern should be used when measuring span power regulation. An unframed all ones pattern is used to indicate an AIS (also known as a &quot;blue alarm&quot;).
*All zeros – A pattern composed of zeros only. It is effective in finding equipment misoptioned for AMI, such as fiber/radio multiplex low-speed inputs.
*Alternating 0s and 1s - A pattern composed of alternating ones and zeroes.
*2 in 8 – Pattern contains a maximum of four consecutive zeros. It will not invoke a B8ZS sequence because eight consecutive zeros are required to cause a B8ZS substitution. The pattern is effective in finding equipment misoptioned for B8ZS.
*Bridgetap - Bridge taps within a span can be detected by employing a number of test patterns with a variety of ones and zeros densities. This test generates 21 test patterns and runs for 15 minutes. If a signal error occurs, the span may have one or more bridge taps. This pattern is only effective for T1 spans that transmit the signal raw. Modulation used in HDSL spans negates the bridgetap patterns&#x27; ability to uncover bridge taps.
*Multipat - This test generates five commonly used test patterns to allow DS1 span testing without having to select each test pattern individually. Patterns are: all ones, 1:7, 2 in 8, 3 in 24, and QRSS.
*T1-DALY and 55 OCTET - Each of these patterns contain fifty-five (55), eight bit octets of data in a sequence that changes rapidly between low and high density. These patterns are used primarily to stress the ALBO and equalizer circuitry but they will also stress timing recovery. 55 OCTET has fifteen (15) consecutive zeroes and can only be used unframed without violating one&#x27;s density requirements. For framed signals, the T1-DALY pattern should be used. Both patterns will force a B8ZS code in circuits optioned for B8ZS.

==Bit error rate tester==
A bit error rate tester (BERT), also known as a &quot;bit error ratio tester&quot; or &quot;bit error rate test solution&quot; (BERTs) is electronic test equipment used to test the quality of signal transmission of single components or complete systems.

The main building blocks of a BERT are:
* Pattern generator, which transmits a defined test pattern to the DUT or test system
* Error detector connected to the DUT or test system, to count the errors generated by the DUT or test system
* Clock signal generator to synchronize the pattern generator and the error detector
* Digital communication analyser is optional to display the transmitted or received signal
* Electrical-optical converter and optical-electrical converter for testing optical communication signals

<text>In telecommunications, bit-sequence independence is a characteristic of some digital data transmission as well as &quot;digital transmission&quot; systems that impose no restrictions on, or modification of, the transmitted bit sequence.

Bit-sequence-independent protocols are in contrast to protocols that reserve certain bit sequences for special meanings, such as the flag sequence, 01111110, for HDLC, SDLC, and ADCCP protocols.

Bit-sequence-independence allows only line codes that have the same number of transitions per bit, otherwise, the line code is dependent on the bit sequence and, therefore, bit-sequence dependent.

<doc id="40799" wikidata="Q878881" url="?curid=40799" title="Bit slip">
<text>In digital transmission, bit slip is the loss or gain of a bit or bits, caused by clock driftvariations in the respective clock rates of the transmitting and receiving devices.

One cause of bit slip is overflow of a receive buffer that occurs when the transmitter&#x27;s clock rate exceeds that of the receiver. This causes one or more bits to be dropped for lack of storage capacity.

One way to maintain timing between transmitting and receiving devices is to employ an asynchronous protocol such as start-stop. Alternatively, bit slip can be prevented by using a self-clocking signal (such as a signal modulated using OQPSK) or using a line coding such as Manchester encoding.

Another cause is &quot;losing count&quot;, as on a hard drive: if a hard drive encounters a long string of 0s, without any 1s (or a string of 1s without 0s), it may lose track of the frame between fields, and suffer bit slip. When a pulse of N consecutive zero bits are sent, clock drift may cause the hardware to apparently detect N-1 zero bits or N+1 zero bitsboth kinds of errors are called bit slip. Thus one prevents long strings without change via such devices as run length limited codes.

Many communication systems use linear-feedback shift register scrambling to prevent long strings of 0s (or other symbol),
including VSAT, 1000BASE-T, , etc.
While a scrambler makes the &quot;losing count&quot; type of bit slip error occur far less often,
when bit slip errors do occur (perhaps for other reasons), 
scramblers have the property of expanding small errors that add or lose a single bit into a much longer burst of errors.

The optimized cipher feedback mode (OCFB), the statistical self-synchronization mode, and the &quot;one-bit CFB mode&quot; also expand small bit-slip errors into a longer burst of errors, but eventually recover and produce the correct decrypted plaintext.
A bit-slip error when using any other block cipher mode of operation generally results in complete corruption of the rest of the message.

<doc id="40802" wikidata="Q878887" url="?curid=40802" title="Bit stuffing">
<text>In data transmission and telecommunications, bit stuffing (also known—uncommonly—as positive justification) is the insertion of non-information bits into data. Stuffed bits should not be confused with overhead bits.

Bit stuffing is used for various purposes, such as for bringing bit streams that do not necessarily have the same or rationally related bit rates up to a common rate, or to fill buffers or frames. The location of the stuffing bits is communicated to the receiving end of the data link, where these extra bits are removed to return the bit streams to their original bit rates or form. Bit stuffing may be used to synchronize several channels before multiplexing or to rate-match two single channels to each other.

Another use of bit stuffing is for run length limited coding: to limit the number of consecutive bits of the same value in the data to be transmitted. A bit of the opposite value is inserted after the maximum allowed number of consecutive bits. Since this is a general rule the receiver doesn&#x27;t need extra information about the location of the stuffing bits in order to do the de-stuffing. This is done to create additional signal transitions to ensure reliable reception or to escape special reserved code words such as frame sync sequences when the data happens to contain them.
Bit stuffing does not ensure that the payload is intact (&quot;i.e.&quot; not corrupted by transmission errors); it is merely a way of attempting to ensure that the transmission starts and ends at the correct places. Error detection and correction techniques are used to check the frame for corruption after its delivery and, if necessary, the frame will be re-sent.

==Zero-bit insertion==
The NRZI coding scheme transmits a 0 bit as a signal transition, and a 1 bit as no change. In this case, bit stuffing is most easily described as the insertion of a 0 bit after a long run of 1 bits.

It was popularized by IBM&#x27;s SDLC (later renamed HDLC), and is also used in Low- and full-speed USB. 

After a long sequence of 1 bits there would be no transitions in the transmitted data, and it would be possible for the transmitter and receiver clocks to lose synchronisation. By inserting a 0 after five (SDLC) or six (USB) consecutive 1 bits the transmitter guarantees a maximum of six (SDLC) or seven (USB) bit times between transitions. The receiver can synchronise its clock against the transitions to ensure proper data recovery.

In SDLC the transmitted bit sequence &quot;01111110&quot; containing six adjacent 1 bits is the Flag byte. Bit stuffing ensures that this pattern can never occur in normal data, so it can be used as a marker for the beginning and end of the frame without any possibility of being confused with normal data.

The main disadvantage of bit-stuffing is that the code rate is unpredictable; it depends on the data being transmitted.

<text>Bit-synchronous operation is a type of digital communication in which the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), data terminal equipment (DTE), and transmitting circuits are all operated in bit synchronism with a clock signal.

In bit-synchronous operation, clock timing is usually delivered at twice the modulation rate, and one bit is transmitted or received during each clock cycle.

Bit-synchronous operation is sometimes erroneously referred to as digital synchronization.

<text>A blind transmission, in telecommunications, is a transmission made without obtaining a receipt, or acknowledgment of reception, from the intended receiving station. Blind transmissions may occur or be necessary when security constraints, such as radio silence, are imposed, when technical difficulties with a sender&#x27;s receiver or receiver&#x27;s transmitter occur, or when lack of time precludes the delay caused by waiting for receipts.

==Examples==
*In aviation it is common to &quot;transmit in the blind&quot; when an aircraft is approaching a non-towered airport. The pilot will broadcast his position and intentions over a common frequency. If no other aircraft are in the traffic pattern, the pilot continues to transmit his position in the blind in case another aircraft is in the area but unable to respond.
*If air traffic control is attempting to establish communication with a presumed NORDO aircraft, or aircraft on the incorrect frequency, it would be appropriate phraseology to issue a transmission that includes the blind preamble, e.g., &quot;New York Center in the blind, N1234, if you copy this transmission, squawk ident.&quot;
*The less common reason would be a ground control station not being able to transmit (due to transmitter failure) or not wanting to transmit any acknowledgment (to avoid giving away further information and putting a military mission at risk).

<text>In telecommunications, a block check character (BCC) is a character added to a transmission block to facilitate error detection.

In longitudinal redundancy checking and cyclic redundancy checking, block check characters are computed for, and added to, each message block transmitted. This block check character is compared with a second block check character computed by the receiver to determine whether the transmission is error free.</text><links>

<text>A branch, also called a ramus in botany, is a stem that grows off from another stem, or when structures like veins in leaves are divided into smaller veins.

== History and etymology ==
In Old English, there are numerous words for branch, including , , , and .
There are also numerous descriptive words, such as (that is, something that has bled, or &#x27;bloomed&#x27;, out), (literally &#x27;little bough&#x27;), (literally &#x27;on growth&#x27;), and (literally &#x27;offspringing&#x27;). Numerous other words for twigs and boughs abound, including , which still survives as the &quot;-toe&quot; in &quot;mistletoe&quot;.

Latin words for branch are or . The latter term is an affix found in other modern words such as &quot;cladodont&quot; (prehistoric sharks with branched teeth), &quot;cladode&quot; (flattened leaf-like branches), or &quot;cladogram&quot; (a branched diagram showing relations among organisms).

==Woody branches==
Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs. The term &quot;twig&quot; usually refers to a , while &quot;bough&quot; refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk.

Due to a broad range of species of trees, branches and twigs can be found in many different shapes and sizes. While branches can be nearly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches. A number of mathematical properties are associated with tree branchings; they are natural examples of fractal patterns in nature, and, as observed by Leonardo da Vinci, their cross-sectional areas closely follow the da Vinci branching rule.

===Specific terms===
A bough can also be called a limb or arm, and though these are arguably metaphors, both are widely accepted synonyms for bough. A crotch or fork is an area where a trunk splits into two or more boughs. A twig is frequently referred to as a sprig as well, especially when it has been plucked. Other words for twig include branchlet, spray, and surcle, as well as the technical terms surculus and ramulus. Branches found under larger branches can be called underbranches.

Some branches from specific trees have their own names, such as osiers and withes or withies, which come from willows. Often trees have certain words which, in English, are naturally collocated, such as holly and mistletoe, which usually employ the phrase &quot;sprig of&quot; (as in, a &quot;sprig of mistletoe&quot;). Similarly, the branch of a cherry tree is generally referred to as a &quot;cherry branch&quot;, while other such formations (i.e., &quot;acacia branch&quot; or &quot;orange branch&quot;) carry no such alliance. A good example of this versatility is oak, which could be referred to as variously an &quot;oak branch&quot;, an &quot;oaken branch&quot;, a &quot;branch of oak&quot;, or the &quot;branch of an oak tree&quot;.

Once a branch has been cut or in any other way removed from its source, it is most commonly referred to as a stick, and a stick employed for some purpose (such as walking, spanking, or beating) is often called a rod. Thin, flexible sticks are called switches, wands, shrags, or vimina (singular vimen).

<doc id="40815" wikidata="Q662790" url="?curid=40815" title="Brewster's angle">
<text>Brewster&#x27;s angle (also known as the polarization angle) is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with &quot;no reflection&quot;. When &quot;unpolarized&quot; light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarized. The angle is named after the Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster (1781–1868).

==Explanation==
When light encounters a boundary between two media with different refractive indices, some of it is usually reflected as shown in the figure above. The fraction that is reflected is described by the Fresnel equations, and depends on the incoming light&#x27;s polarization and angle of incidence.

The Fresnel equations predict that light with the &quot;p&quot; polarization (electric field polarized in the same plane as the incident ray and the surface normal at the point of incidence) will not be reflected if the angle of incidence is 
:formula_1
where &quot;n&quot;1 is the refractive index of the initial medium through which the light propagates (the &quot;incident medium&quot;), and &quot;n&quot;2 is the index of the other medium. This equation is known as Brewster&#x27;s law, and the angle defined by it is Brewster&#x27;s angle.

The physical mechanism for this can be qualitatively understood from the manner in which electric dipoles in the media respond to &quot;p&quot;-polarized light. One can imagine that light incident on the surface is absorbed, and then re-radiated by oscillating electric dipoles at the interface between the two media. The polarization of freely propagating light is always perpendicular to the direction in which the light is travelling. The dipoles that produce the transmitted (refracted) light oscillate in the polarization direction of that light. These same oscillating dipoles also generate the reflected light. However, dipoles do not radiate any energy in the direction of the dipole moment. If the refracted light is &quot;p&quot;-polarized and propagates exactly perpendicular to the direction in which the light is predicted to be specularly reflected, the dipoles point along the specular reflection direction and therefore no light can be reflected. (See diagram, above)

With simple geometry this condition can be expressed as
:formula_2
where &quot;θ&quot;1 is the angle of reflection (or incidence) and &quot;θ&quot;2 is the angle of refraction.

Using Snell&#x27;s law,
:formula_3
one can calculate the incident angle at which no light is reflected:
:formula_4

Solving for &quot;θ&quot;B gives
:formula_5
The physical explanation of why the transmitted ray should be at formula_6 to the reflected ray can be difficult to grasp, but the Brewster angle result also follows simply from the Fresnel equations for reflectivity, which state that for p-polarized light
:formula_7
The reflection goes to zero when 
:formula_8
We can now use Snell&#x27;s Law to eliminate formula_9 as follows: we multiply Snell by formula_10 and square both sides; multiply the zero-reflection condition just obtained by formula_11 and square both sides; and add the equations. This produces
:formula_12
We finally divide both sides by formula_13, collect terms and rearrange to produce formula_14, from which the desired result follows (which then allows reverse proof that formula_15).

For a glass medium () in air (), Brewster&#x27;s angle for visible light is approximately 56°, while for an air-water interface (), it is approximately 53°. Since the refractive index for a given medium changes depending on the wavelength of light, Brewster&#x27;s angle will also vary with wavelength.

The phenomenon of light being polarized by reflection from a surface at a particular angle was first observed by Étienne-Louis Malus in 1808. He attempted to relate the polarizing angle to the refractive index of the material, but was frustrated by the inconsistent quality of glasses available at that time. In 1815, Brewster experimented with higher-quality materials and showed that this angle was a function of the refractive index, defining Brewster&#x27;s law.

Brewster&#x27;s angle is often referred to as the &quot;polarizing angle&quot;, because light that reflects from a surface at this angle is entirely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence (&quot;&quot;s&quot;-polarized&quot;). A glass plate or a stack of plates placed at Brewster&#x27;s angle in a light beam can, thus, be used as a polarizer. The concept of a polarizing angle can be extended to the concept of a Brewster wavenumber to cover planar interfaces between two linear bianisotropic materials. In the case of reflection at Brewster&#x27;s angle, the reflected and refracted rays are mutually perpendicular.

For magnetic materials, Brewster&#x27;s angle can exist for only one of the incident wave polarizations, as determined by the relative strengths of the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. This has implications for the existence of generalized Brewster angles for dielectric metasurfaces.

== Applications ==
While at the Brewster angle there is &quot;no&quot; reflection of the &quot;p&quot; polarization, at yet greater angles the reflection coefficient of the &quot;p&quot; polarization is always less than that of the &quot;s&quot; polarization, almost up to 90° incidence where the reflectivity of each rises towards unity. Thus reflected light from horizontal surfaces (such as the surface of a road) at a distance much greater than one&#x27;s height (so that the incidence angle of specularly reflected light is near, or usually well beyond the Brewster angle) is strongly &quot;s&quot;-polarized. Polarized sunglasses use a sheet of polarizing material to block horizontally-polarized light and thus reduce glare in such situations. These are most effective with smooth surfaces where specular reflection (thus from light whose angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection defined by the angle observed from) is dominant, but even diffuse reflections from roads for instance, are also significantly reduced.

Photographers also use polarizing filters to remove reflections from water so that they can photograph objects beneath the surface. Using a polarizing camera attachment which can be rotated, such a filter can be adjusted to reduce reflections from objects other than horizontal surfaces, such as seen in the accompanying photograph (right) where the &quot;s&quot; polarization (approximately vertical) has been eliminated using such a filter.

When recording a classical hologram, the bright reference beam is typically arranged to strike the film in the &quot;p&quot; polarization at Brewster&#x27;s angle. By thus eliminating reflection of the reference beam at the transparent back surface of the holographic film, unwanted interference effects in the resulting hologram are avoided.

Entrance windows or prisms with their surfaces at the Brewster angle are commonly used in optics and laser physics in particular. The polarized laser light enters the prism at Brewster&#x27;s angle without any reflective losses.

In surface science, Brewster angle microscopes are used to image layers of particles or molecules at air-liquid interfaces. Using illumination by a laser at Brewster&#x27;s angle to the interface and observation at the angle of reflection, the uniform liquid does not reflect, appearing black in the image. However any molecular layers or artifacts at the surface, whose refractive index or physical structure contrasts with the liquid, allows for some reflection against that black background which is captured by a camera.

===Brewster windows=== 

Gas lasers using an external cavity (reflection by one or both mirrors &quot;outside&quot; the gain medium) generally seal the tube using windows tilted at Brewster&#x27;s angle. This prevents light in the intended polarization from being lost through reflection (and reducing the round-trip gain of the laser) which is critical in lasers having a low round-trip gain. On the other hand, it &quot;does&quot; remove &quot;s&quot; polarized light, increasing the round trip loss for that polarization, and ensuring the laser only oscillates in one linear polarization, as is usually desired. And many sealed-tube lasers (which do not even need windows) have a glass plate inserted within the tube at the Brewster angle, simply for the purpose of allowing lasing in only one polarization.

== Pseudo-Brewster&#x27;s angle ==
When the reflecting surface is absorbing, reflectivity at parallel polarization (&quot;p&quot;) goes through a non-zero minimum at the so-called pseudo-Brewster&#x27;s angle.

<text>Bridging loss is the loss, at a given frequency, that results when an impedance is connected across a transmission line. It is expressed as the ratio, in decibels, of the signal power delivered to a given point in a system downstream from the bridging point prior to bridging, to the signal power delivered to the given point after bridging. The term is introduced because return loss is not applicable to the high-impedance input conditions. The term is also used in telephone practice and is synonymous with the insertion loss that results from bridging an impedance across a circuit.

<doc id="40818" wikidata="Q221656" url="?curid=40818" title="Brightness">
<text>Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. The perception is not linear to luminance, and relies on the context of the viewing environment (for example, see White&#x27;s illusion).

Brightness is a subjective sensation of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of many color appearance models, typically denoted as formula_1. Brightness refers to how much light &quot;appears to shine&quot; from something. This is a different perception than lightness, which is how light something appears &quot;compared to&quot; a similarly lit white object.

The adjective &quot;bright&quot; derives from an Old English &quot;beorht&quot; with the same meaning via metathesis giving Middle English &quot;briht&quot;. The word is from a Proto-Germanic &#x27;, ultimately from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] root with a closely related meaning, *&#x27; &quot;white, bright&quot;.
&quot;Brightness&quot; was formerly used as a synonym for the photometric term &quot;luminance&quot; and (incorrectly) for the radiometric term &quot;radiance&quot;. As defined by the US &quot;Federal Glossary of Telecommunication Terms&quot; (FS-1037C), &quot;brightness&quot; should now be used only for non-quantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light.
Brightness is an antonym of &quot;dimness&quot; or &quot;dullness&quot;.

With regard to stars, brightness is quantified as apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude.

Two pictograms resembling the Sun with rays are used to represent the settings of luminance in display devices. They have been encoded in Unicode since version 6.0 (October 2010) in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block under U+1505 as &quot;low brightness symbol&quot; (🔅) and U+1F506 as &quot;high brightness symbol&quot; (🔆).

The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has assigned an unconventional meaning to brightness when applied to lamps. When appearing on light bulb packages, brightness means luminous flux, while in other contexts it means luminance. Luminous flux is the total amount of light coming from a source, such as a lighting device. Luminance, the original meaning of brightness, is the amount of light per solid angle coming from an area, such as the sky. The table below shows the standard ways of indicating the amount of light.

<text>In a packet switched network, burst switching is a capability in which each network switch extracts routing instructions from an incoming packet header to establish and maintain the appropriate switch connection for the duration of the packet, following which the connection is automatically released. 

In concept, burst switching is similar to connectionless mode transmission, but differs in that burst switching implies an intent to establish the switch connection in near real time, so that only minimum buffering is required at the node switch.

A variant of burst switching used in optical networks is optical burst switching.

== Applications ==

Examples of technology using burst switching include:
* EtherLoop, used after the late-1990s to facilitate telephone company offerings to compete with the high-speed local data access that was then beginning to be offered by cable TV providers as an internet service offering.
* Intra-vehicle communication: Tesla Cybertruck in 2023 began using a gigabit Ethernet loop with burst switching for near real-time, redundant control of all motor vehicle subsystems, including steer-by-wire, motor controls, all vehicle controllers, plus vehicle audio with active road-noise cancellation.

<text>In telecommunications, a burst transmission or data burst is the broadcast of a relatively high-bandwidth transmission over a short period. 

Burst transmission can be intentional, broadcasting a compressed message at a very high data signaling rate within a very short transmission time.

In the 1980s, the term &quot;data burst&quot; (and &quot;info burst&quot;) was used for a technique used by some United Kingdom and South African TV programmes to transmit large amounts of primarily textual information. They would display multiple pages of text in rapid succession, usually at the end of the programme; viewers would videotape it and then read it later by playing it back using the pause button after each page.

Data bursts can occur naturally, such as when the download of data from the internet briefly experiences higher speeds. It can also occur in a computer network where data transmission is interrupted at intervals. Burst transmission enables communications between data terminal equipment (DTEs) and a data network operating at dissimilar data signaling rates.

<doc id="40830" wikidata="Q5021612" url="?curid=40830" title="Call collision">
<text>In the field of telecommunications, a call collision, commonly referred to as a glare, can occur in two situations:

# Terminal and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (DCE) Contention: This type of call collision arises when both a terminal and a data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) simultaneously designate the same communication channel to initiate a call request and handle an incoming call. In such cases, the DCE prioritizes the call request and proceeds with it, resulting in the cancellation of the incoming call.
# Trunk or Channel Seizure at Both Ends: The second scenario involves a call collision when a trunk or channel is seized simultaneously at both ends. This situation can lead to conflicts and disruptions in the communication flow.

Glare can sometimes be experienced when attempting to make an outgoing call on a private branch exchange (PBX) system but getting connected to an incoming call instead. This occurrence can also happen in residential settings if an outgoing call is initiated at the precise moment when an incoming call is about to start ringing.

To mitigate the risk of glare, Multi-line hunting techniques are employed. These techniques involve selecting circuits in the opposite preference order, ensuring that the highest numbered line, which is typically the last choice for incoming calls, becomes the first choice for outgoing calls. The following example illustrates the sequence:

With PRI circuits, the channel selection sequence is specified when the circuit is provisioned. Common practice is to have the PBX use descending channel selection, and the carrier to use ascending. Glare is not common on PRI circuits because the signaling is so fast, however it is not impossible (especially if there are subtle differences in the timers at either end, and the circuit is being used at near-capacity). The users will not experience a connection to an unexpected call (as would be the case with analog circuits), because glare causes protocol errors that generally prevent any sort of successful connection. Instead, one or both of the call attempts might fail, and ideally an error would appear in the logs (this depends on the logging capabilities of the systems at either end of the circuit). Glare is quite rare on PRI circuits, and can be difficult to troubleshoot.

For old, analog PBX trunks, glare can be reduced by using ground start signaling, which offers a better answer and disconnect supervision. IE: Nortel BSP discouraged using loop start trunks for this and other reasons. Long Distance exchanges in the 1950s and 60s incorporated Glare Detectors to alleviate the problem.

<text>In telecommunications, a call-second is a unit used to measure communications traffic density, equivalent to one call with a duration of one second. 

Traffic is measured independent of users. For example, one user making two 75-second calls is equivalent to two users each making one 75-second call, as each case produces 150 call-seconds of traffic. 

A CCS (centacall-second) is often used to describe 100 call-seconds, so 3600 call-seconds = 36 CCS = 1 call-hour. 

In a communication network, a trunk (link) can carry numerous concurrent calls by means of multiplexing. Hence a particular number of call-seconds can be carried in infinitely many ways as calls are established and cleared over time. For example, one call-hour could be one call for an hour or two (possibly concurrent) calls for half an hour each. Call-seconds give a measure of the average number of concurrent calls.

Offered load is defined as the traffic density per unit time, measured in erlangs. An erlang is defined as one call-hour per hour, or 3,600 call-seconds per hour.

Hence, if one CCS is measured over a one-hour period, the offered load is 1/36 erlangs.

<doc id="40843" wikidata="Q444167" url="?curid=40843" title="Capacitive coupling">
<text>Capacitive [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] is the transfer of energy within an electrical network or between distant networks by means of displacement current between circuit(s) nodes, induced by the electric field. This coupling can have an intentional or accidental effect.

In its simplest implementation, capacitive coupling is achieved by placing a capacitor between two nodes. Where analysis of many points in a circuit is carried out, the capacitance at each point and between points can be described in a matrix form.

==Use in analog circuits==

In analog circuits, a coupling capacitor is used to connect two circuits such that only the AC signal from the first circuit can pass through to the next while DC is blocked. This technique helps to isolate the DC bias settings of the two coupled circuits. Capacitive coupling is also known as &quot;AC coupling&quot; and the capacitor used for the purpose is also known as a &quot;DC-blocking capacitor&quot;.

A coupling capacitor&#x27;s ability to prevent a DC load from interfering with an AC source is particularly useful in Class A amplifier circuits by preventing a 0 volt input being passed to a transistor with additional resistor biasing; creating continuous amplification.

Capacitive coupling decreases the low frequency gain of a system containing capacitively coupled units. Each coupling capacitor along with the input electrical impedance of the next stage forms a high-pass filter and the sequence of filters results in a cumulative filter with a cutoff frequency that may be higher than those of each individual filter.

Coupling capacitors can also introduce nonlinear distortion at low frequencies. This is not an issue at high frequencies because the voltage across the capacitor stays very close to zero. However, if a signal passing through the coupling capacitance has a frequency that is low relative to the RC cutoff frequency, voltages can develop across the capacitor, which for some capacitor types results in changes of capacitance, leading to distortion. This is avoided by choosing capacitor types that have low &quot;voltage coefficient&quot;, and by using large values that put the cutoff frequency far lower than the frequencies of the signal.

==Use in digital circuits==

AC coupling is also widely used in digital circuits to transmit digital signals with a zero DC component, known as DC-balanced signals. DC-balanced waveforms are useful in communications systems, since they can be used over AC-coupled electrical connections to avoid voltage imbalance problems and charge accumulation between connected systems or components.

For this reason, most modern line codes are designed to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC-balanced line codes are constant-weight codes and paired-disparity codes.

==Gimmick loop==

A gimmick loop is a simple type of capacitive coupler: two closely spaced strands of wire. It provides capacitive coupling of a few picofarads between two nodes. Usually the wires are twisted together.

==Parasitic capacitive coupling==

Capacitive coupling is often unintended, such as the capacitance between two wires or PCB traces that are next to each other. One signal may capacitively couple with another and cause what appears to be noise. To reduce coupling, wires or traces are often separated as much as possible, or ground lines or ground planes are run in between signals that might affect each other, so that the lines capacitively couple to ground rather than each other. Prototypes of high-frequency (tens of megahertz) or high-gain analog circuits often use circuits that are built over a ground plane to control unwanted coupling. If a high-gain amplifier&#x27;s output capacitively couples to its input it may become an electronic oscillator.

<doc id="40844" wikidata="Q5036976" url="?curid=40844" title="Capture effect">
<text>In a radio receiver, the capture effect is a phenomenon associated with reception in which only the stronger of two or more signals received within the bandwidth of the receiver passband will be demodulated. The Capture effect therefore enables frequency reuse of the same frequency by imposing a sufficient distance separation, e.g. used in AM communication in the AM(R)S (Aeronautical mobile (R) service), or between FM-BC transmitter for the capture take effect. Alternatively the capture effect enables two frequency ILS-Localizer (ILS-LOC) and ILS-Glide-Path (ILS-GP) to operate at airports in presence of strong reflections, e.g. due to terrain and buildings. 

== FM phenomenon ==
The capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the receiver&#x27;s limiter (if present) where the weaker signal is not amplified, but attenuated. When both signals are nearly equal in strength or are fading independently, the receiver may rapidly switch from one to another and exhibit flutter.

The capture effect can occur at the signal limiter, or in the demodulation stage for circuits that do not require a signal limiter. Some types of radio receiver circuits have a stronger capture effect than others. The measurement of how well a receiver rejects a second signal on the same frequency is called its capture ratio. It is measured as the lowest ratio of the power of two signals that will result in the suppression of the weaker signal. 

The capture effect phenomenon was first documented in 1938 by General Electric engineers conducting test transmissions. Two experimental FM stations, located 15 miles (24 km) apart in Albany and Schenectady, New York, were configured to transmit on the same frequency, in order to study how this would affect reception. It was determined that, for most of the path between the two stations, only one of the signals could be heard, with the complete elimination of the other. It was concluded that this effect occurred whenever the stronger signal was about twice as strong as the weaker one. This was significantly different than the case with amplitude modulation signals, where the general standard for broadcasting stations was that to avoid objectionable interference the stronger signal had to be about twenty times that of the weaker one. The capture effect thus allowed co-channel FM broadcasting stations to be located somewhat closer to each other than AM ones, without causing mutual interference.

== AM capture effect use ==
When AM (Amplitude Modulation) transmitter share the same center frequency, the weaker signal will introduce distortions in form of beat frequencies or both signals interfere completely with each other. If only a carrier devoid of modulation is received or added in a receiver, e.g. using a BFO (Beat Frequency Oscillatior), a tone with the frequency offset between the two carrier frequencies will be heard. 

By introducing a frequency offset between the carrier frequencies in the magnitude of at least the sum of the highest modulation frequencies employed by both transmitter, will eliminate generation of beat frequencies, e.g. highest modulation frequency is 2.4 kHz therefore the min. frequency offset between both carrier is 4.8 kHz (=2 x 2.4 kHz). 

The capture effect is actively employed in Europe for aeronautical VHF-communication in the band 118 MHz to 137 MHz to provide coverage for aircraft flying under ATC (Air Traffic Control) in large ATC sectors that cannot be covered by a single transmitter site. For ATC large sectors up to five transmitter sites are required to provide continuous coverage within the area of a large ATC sector. Transmitter are strategically placed therefore ensuring that not all transmitter will be received at any point in space simultaneously.

Operation of ILS-Localizer and ILS-Glide-Path at airports is often impossible due to strong reflections, e.g. on terrain and buildings. The solution lead to the development of two frequency ILS-LOC and ILS-GP. Two frequency ILS systems use an additional carrier frequencies with a frequency offset of at least 6 kHz (2 x 3kHz as the highest voice modulation frequency), two separate antenna pattern that overlapp only in part and a higher EIRP for the ILS-localizer course signal for a range of up to 25 NM and a lower EIRP for the ILS-Localizer clearance signal for a range between10 NM to 17 NM. For difficult terrain and weather impact 2f ILS-GP are employed. Two frequency ILS-LOC and ILS-GP are an ICAO standard precision approach system and are standardized for worldwide use in ICAO Annex 10.

AM receiver will demodulate any carriers and their side bands that are strong enough for demodulation within the receiver passband resulting in an audio mix, if their carrier frequencies are not separated by the sum of the highest modulation frequencies of employed in both transmitter. If only a carrier devoid of modulation is received or added in a receiver, e.g. using a BFO (Beat Frequency Oscillator) the resulting tone is the frequency offset between the two carrier frequencies. 

== Digital modulation ==
For digital modulation schemes it has been shown that for properly implemented on-off keying/amplitude-shift keying systems, co-channel rejection can be better than for frequency-shift keying systems.

<doc id="40846" wikidata="Q944633" url="?curid=40846" title="Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance">
<text>Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in computer networking, is a network multiple access method in which carrier sensing is used, but nodes attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only after the channel is sensed to be &quot;idle&quot;. When they do transmit, nodes transmit their packet data in its entirety.

It is particularly important for wireless networks, where the alternative with collision detection CSMA/CD, is not possible due to wireless transmitters desensing (turning off) their receivers during packet transmission.

CSMA/CA is unreliable due to the hidden node problem.

CSMA/CA is a protocol that operates in the data link layer.
==Details==
Collision avoidance is used to improve the performance of the CSMA method by attempting to divide the channel somewhat equally among all transmitting nodes within the collision domain.

# Carrier Sense: prior to transmitting, a node first listens to the shared medium (such as listening for wireless signals in a wireless network) to determine whether another node is transmitting or not. Note that the hidden node problem means another node may be transmitting which goes undetected at this stage.
# Collision Avoidance: if another node was heard, we wait for a period of time (usually random) for the node to stop transmitting before listening again for a free communications channel.
::* Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) may optionally be used at this point to mediate access to the shared medium. This goes some way to alleviating the problem of hidden nodes because, for instance, in a wireless network, the Access Point only issues a &quot;Clear to Send&quot; to one node at a time. However, wireless 802.11 implementations do not typically implement RTS/CTS for all transmissions; they may turn it off completely, or at least not use it for small packets (the overhead of RTS, CTS and transmission is too great for small data transfers).
::* Transmission: if the medium was identified as being clear &quot;or&quot; the node received a CTS to explicitly indicate it can send, it sends the frame in its entirety. Unlike CSMA/CD, it is very challenging for a wireless node to listen at the same time as it transmits (its transmission will dwarf any attempt to listen). Continuing the wireless example, the node awaits receipt of an acknowledgement packet from the Access Point to indicate the packet was received and checksummed correctly. If such acknowledgement does not arrive in a timely manner, it assumes the packet collided with some other transmission, causing the node to enter a period of binary exponential backoff prior to attempting to re-transmit.

Although CSMA/CA has been used in a variety of wired communication systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to &#x27;hear&#x27; another station&#x27;s broadcast. This is the so-called &#x27;hidden node&#x27;, or &#x27;hidden station&#x27; problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point coordination function), although they do not do so by default. By default they use a Carrier sensing mechanism called &quot;exponential backoff&quot; (or Distributed coordination function), that relies upon a station attempting to &#x27;listen&#x27; for another station&#x27;s broadcast before sending. CA, or PCF relies upon the AP (or the &#x27;receiver&#x27; for Ad hoc networks) granting a station the exclusive right to transmit for a given period of time after requesting it (Request to Send / Clear to Send).

CSMA-CA requires a determination of whether a channel is &#x27;idle&#x27;, even when incompatible standards and overlapping transmission frequencies are used. Per the standards, for 802.11/Wi-Fi transmitters on the same channel, transmitters must take turns to transmit if they can detect each other even 3 dB above the noise floor (the thermal noise floor is around -101 dBm for 20 MHz channels). On the other hand, transmitters will ignore transmitters with incompatible standards or on overlapping channels if the received signal strength from them is below a threshold Pth which, for non Wi-Fi 6 systems, is between -76 and -80 dBm.

==IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS Exchange==
CSMA/CA can optionally be supplemented by the exchange of a Request to Send (RTS) packet sent by the sender S, and a Clear to Send (CTS) packet sent by the intended receiver R. Thus alerting all nodes within range of the sender, receiver or both, to not transmit for the duration of the main transmission. This is known as the IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS exchange. Implementation of RTS/CTS helps to partially solve the hidden node problem that is often found in wireless networking.

==Performance==
CSMA/CA performance is based largely upon the modulation technique used to transmit the data between nodes. Studies show that under ideal propagation conditions (simulations), direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) provides the highest throughput for all nodes on a network when used in conjunction with CSMA/CA and the IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS exchange under light network load conditions. Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) follows distantly behind DSSS with regard to throughput with a greater throughput once network load becomes substantially heavy. However, the throughput is generally the same under real world conditions due to radio propagation factors.

==Usage==
* GNET – an early proprietary LAN protocol
* Apple&#x27;s LocalTalk implemented CSMA/CA on an electrical bus using a three-byte jamming signal.
* 802.11 RTS/CTS implements virtual carrier sensing using short request to send and clear to send messages for WLANs (802.11 mainly relies on physical carrier sensing though).
* IEEE 802.15.4 (Wireless PAN) uses CSMA/CA
* NCR WaveLAN – an early proprietary wireless network protocol
* HomePNA
* The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), uses CSMA/CA as a channel access method for flows that do not require guaranteed quality of service, specifically the CSMA/CARP variant.

<text>Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is a medium access control (MAC) method used most notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking. It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting. This is used in combination with collision detection in which a transmitting station detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations while it is transmitting a frame. When this collision condition is detected, the station stops transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and then waits for a random time interval before trying to resend the frame.

CSMA/CD is a modification of pure carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). CSMA/CD is used to improve CSMA performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected, thus shortening the time required before a retry can be attempted.

With the growing popularity of Ethernet switches in the 1990s, IEEE 802.3 deprecated Ethernet repeaters in 2011, making CSMA/CD and half-duplex operation less common and less important.

==Procedure==
The following procedure is used to initiate a transmission. The procedure is complete when the frame is transmitted successfully or a collision is detected during transmission.
# Is a frame ready for transmission? If not, wait for a frame.
# Is medium idle? If not, wait until it becomes ready.
# Start transmitting and monitor for collision during transmission.
# Did a collision occur? If so, go to collision detected procedure.
# Reset retransmission counters and complete frame transmission.

The following procedure is used to resolve a detected collision. The procedure is complete when retransmission is initiated or the retransmission is aborted due to numerous collisions.
# Continue transmission (with a jam signal instead of frame header/data/CRC) until minimum packet time is reached to ensure that all receivers detect the collision.
# Increment retransmission counter.
# Was the maximum number of transmission attempts reached? If so, abort transmission.
# Calculate and wait the random backoff period based on number of collisions.
# Re-enter main procedure at stage 1.

Methods for collision detection are media dependent. On a shared, electrical bus such as 10BASE5 or 10BASE2, collisions can be detected by comparing transmitted data with received data or by recognizing a higher than normal signal amplitude on the bus. On all other media, a carrier sensed on the receive channel while transmitting triggers a collision event. Repeaters or hubs detect collisions on their own and propagate jam signals.

The collision recovery procedure can be likened to what happens at a dinner party, where all the guests talk to each other through a common medium (the air). Before speaking, each guest politely waits for the current speaker to finish. If two guests start speaking at the same time, both stop and wait for short, random periods of time (in Ethernet, this time is measured in microseconds). The hope is that by each choosing a random period of time, both guests will not choose the same time to try to speak again, thus avoiding another collision.

==Jam signal==
The jam signal or jamming signal is a signal that carries a 32-bit binary pattern sent by a data station to inform the other transmitting stations of the collision and that they must not transmit.

The maximum jam-time is calculated as follows: The maximum allowed diameter of an Ethernet installation is limited to 232 bits. This makes a round-trip-time of 464 bits. As the slot time in Ethernet is 512 bits, the difference between slot time and round-trip-time is 48 bits (6 bytes), which is the maximum &quot;jam-time&quot;.

This in turn means: A station noting a collision has occurred is sending a 4 to 6 byte long pattern composed of 16 1-0 bit combinations.

The purpose of this is to ensure that any other node which may currently be receiving a frame will receive the jam signal in place of the correct 32-bit MAC CRC; this causes the other receivers to discard the frame due to a CRC error.

==Late collision==
A late collision is a type of collision that happens further into the packet than is allowed for by the protocol standard in question. In 10-megabit-per-second shared-medium Ethernet, if a collision error occurs after the first 512 bits of data are transmitted by the transmitting station, a late collision is said to have occurred. Importantly, late collisions are not re-sent by the NIC, unlike collisions occurring before the first 64 octets; it is left for the upper layers of the protocol stack to determine that there was loss of data.

As a correctly set up CSMA/CD network link should not have late collisions, the usual possible causes are full-duplex/half-duplex mismatch, exceeded Ethernet cable length limits, or defective hardware such as incorrect cabling, non-compliant number of hubs in the network, or a bad NIC.

==Local collision==
A local collision is a collision that occurs at the NIC, as opposed to on the wire. A NIC cannot detect local collisions without attempting to send information.

On UTP cable, a local collision is detected on the local segment only when a station detects a signal on the RX pair at the same time it is sending on the TX pair. Since the two signals are on different pairs, there is no characteristic change in the signal. Collisions are only recognized on UTP when the station is operating in half-duplex. The only functional difference between half and full-duplex operation in this regard is whether or not the transmit and receive pairs are permitted to be used simultaneously.

==Remote collision==
A remote collision, in CSMA/CD computer networks over half-duplex media (10BASE5 or 10BASE2), is a collision that occurs when a frame shorter than the minimum length is transmitted. This frame may cause a collision at the remote end which cannot be detected by the transmitter, so the frame is not resent on the physical layer. Due to interference on the medium, its data is corrupted and frame check sequence fails, requiring recovery at a higher layer, if possible.

==Channel capture effect==
The channel capture effect is a phenomenon where one user of a shared medium &quot;captures&quot; the medium for a significant time. During this period (usually 16 frames), other users are denied use of the medium. This effect was first seen in networks using CSMA/CD on Ethernet. Because of this effect, the most data-intense connection dominates the multiple-access wireless channel. This happens in Ethernet links because of the way nodes &quot;back off&quot; from the link and attempt to re-access it. In the Ethernet protocol, when a communication collision happens (when two users of the medium try to send at the same time), each user waits for a random period of time before re-accessing the link. However, a user will wait (&quot;back off&quot;) for a random amount of time proportional to the number of times it has successively tried to access the link. The channel capture effect happens when one user continues to &quot;win&quot; the link.

For example, user A and user B both try to access a quiet link at the same time. Since they detect a collision, user A waits for a random time between 0 and 1 time units and so does user B. Let&#x27;s say user A chooses a lower back-off time. User A then begins to use the link and B allows it to finish sending its frame. If user A still has more to send, then user A and user B will cause another data collision. A will once again choose a random back-off time between 0 and 1, but user B will choose a back-off time between 0 and 3 – because this is B&#x27;s second time colliding in a row. Chances are A will &quot;win&quot; this one again. If this continues, A will most likely win all the collision battles, and after 16 collisions (the number of tries before a user backs down for an extended period of time), user A will have &quot;captured&quot; the channel.

The ability of one node to capture the entire medium is decreased as the number of nodes increases. This is because as the number of nodes increases, there is a higher probability that one of the &quot;other&quot; nodes will have a lower back-off time than the capturing node.

The channel capture effect creates a situation where one station is able to transmit while others are continually backing off, thus leading to a situation of short-term unfairness. Yet, the situation is long-term fair because every station has the opportunity to &quot;capture&quot; the medium once one station is done transmitting. The efficiency of the channel is increased when one node has captured the channel.

A negative side effect of the capture effect would be the idle time created due to stations backing off. Once one station is finished transmitting on the medium, large idle times are present because all other stations were continually backing off. In some instances, back-off can occur for so long that some stations actually discard packets because maximum attempt limits have been reached.

==Applications==
CSMA/CD was used in now-obsolete shared-medium Ethernet variants (10BASE5, 10BASE2), and in the early versions of twisted-pair Ethernet, which used repeater hubs. Modern Ethernet networks, built with switches and full-duplex connections, no longer need to use CSMA/CD, because each Ethernet segment, or collision domain, is now isolated. CSMA/CD is still supported for backwards compatibility and for half-duplex connections. The IEEE 802.3 standard, which defines all Ethernet variants, for historical reasons still bore the title &quot;Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications&quot; until 802.3-2008, which uses new name &quot;IEEE Standard for Ethernet&quot;.

<text>A carrier system is a communications system that transmits information, such as the voice signals of a telephone call and the video signals of television, by modulation of one or multiple carrier signals above the principal voice frequency or data rate.

Carrier systems typically transmit multiple channels of communication simultaneously over the shared medium using various forms of multiplexing. Prominent multiplexing methods of the carrier signal are time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). A cable television system is an example of frequency-division multiplexing. Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency. Multiple layers of multiplexing may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal. For example, in the public switched telephone network, many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time-division multiplexing. For long-distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by frequency-division multiplexing. At a given receiving node, specific channels may be demultiplexed individually.

== History ==
The purpose of carrier systems is to save money by carrying more traffic on less infrastructure. 19th century telephone systems, operating at baseband, could only carry one telephone call on each wire, hence routes with heavy traffic needed many wires.

In the 1920s, frequency-division multiplexing could carry several circuits on the same balanced wires, and by the 1930s L-carrier and similar systems carried hundreds of calls at a time on coaxial cables.

Capacity of these systems increased in the middle of the century, while in the 1950s researchers began to take seriously the possibility of saving money on the terminal equipment by using time-division multiplexing. This work led to T-carrier and similar digital systems for local use.

Due to the shorter repeater spacings required by digital systems, long-distance still used FDM until the late 1970s when optical fiber was improved to the point that digital connections became the cheapest ones for all distances, short and long. By the end of the century, analog connections between and within telephone exchanges became rare.

<doc id="40851" wikidata="Q3179309" url="?curid=40851" title="Carson bandwidth rule">
<text>In telecommunications, the Carson&#x27;s bandwidth rule defines the approximate bandwidth requirements of communications system components for a carrier signal that is frequency modulated by a continuous or broad spectrum of frequencies rather than a single frequency. Carson&#x27;s rule does not apply well when the modulating signal contains discontinuities, such as a square wave. Carson&#x27;s rule originates from John Renshaw Carson&#x27;s 1922 paper.

Carson&#x27;s bandwidth rule is expressed by the relation:
:formula_1
:where:
::formula_2 is the bandwidth requirement;
::formula_3 is the peak frequency deviation;
::formula_4 is the highest frequency in the modulating signal.

For example, a typical VHF/UHF two-way radio signal using FM mode, with 5 kHz peak deviation, and a maximum audio frequency of 3 kHz, would require an approximate bandwidth of = .

Standard broadcast stereo FM, with a peak deviation of 75 kHz, has a highest modulating frequency (which combines and ) of 53 kHz. Most of the energy therefore falls within an approximate bandwidth of = . (Geographically close FM broadcast transmitters are almost always assigned nominal center frequencies at least 400 kHz apart).

Carson&#x27;s bandwidth rule is often applied to transmitters, antennas, optical sources, receivers, photodetectors, and other communications system components.

Any frequency modulated signal will have an &quot;infinite&quot; number of sidebands and hence an infinite bandwidth but, in practice, all significant sideband energy (98% or more) is concentrated within the bandwidth defined by Carson&#x27;s rule. It is a useful approximation, but setting the arbitrary definition of occupied bandwidth at 98% of the power still means that the power outside the band is about formula_5 less than the carrier inside, therefore Carson&#x27;s Rule is of little use in spectrum planning.

<doc id="40853" wikidata="Q5979730" url="?curid=40853" title="Cassegrain antenna">
<text>In telecommunications and radar, a Cassegrain antenna is a parabolic antenna in which the feed antenna is mounted at or behind the surface of the concave main parabolic reflector dish and is aimed at a smaller convex secondary reflector suspended in front of the primary reflector. The beam of radio waves from the feed illuminates the secondary reflector, which reflects it back to the main reflector dish, which reflects it forward again to form the desired . The Cassegrain design is widely used in parabolic antennas, particularly in large antennas such as those in satellite ground stations, radio telescopes, and communication satellites.

==Geometry==
The primary reflector is a paraboloid, while the shape of the convex secondary reflector is a hyperboloid. The geometrical condition for radiating a collimated, plane wave beam is that the feed antenna is located at the far focus of the hyperboloid, while the focus of the primary reflector coincides with the near focus of the hyperboloid. Usually the secondary reflector and the feed antenna are located on the central axis of the dish. However, in &quot;offset Cassegrain&quot; configurations, the primary dish reflector is asymmetric, and its focus, and the secondary reflector, are located to one side of the dish, so that the secondary reflector does not partially obstruct the beam.

==Advantages==
This design is an alternative to the most common parabolic antenna design, called &quot;front feed&quot; or &quot;prime focus&quot;, in which the feed antenna itself is mounted suspended in front of the dish at the focus, pointed back toward the dish. The Cassegrain is a more complex design, but in certain applications it has advantages over front feed that can justify its increased complexity:
* The feed antennas and associated waveguides and &quot;front end&quot; electronics can be located on or behind the dish, rather than suspended in front where they block part of the outgoing beam. Therefore, this design is used for antennas with bulky or complicated feeds, such as satellite communication ground antennas, radio telescopes, and the antennas on some communication satellites.
* Another advantage, important in satellite ground antennas and radio telescopes, is that because the feed antenna is directed forward, rather than backward toward the dish as in a front-fed antenna, the spillover sidelobes caused by portions of the beam that miss the secondary reflector are directed upwards toward the cold sky rather than downwards towards the warm earth. In receiving antennas this reduces reception of ground noise, resulting in a lower antenna noise temperature.
* &quot;Dual reflector shaping&quot;: The presence of a second reflecting surface in the signal path allows additional opportunities for tailoring the radiation pattern for maximum performance. For example, the gain of ordinary parabolic antennas is reduced because the radiation of the feed antenna falls off toward the outer parts of the dish, resulting in lower &quot;illumination&quot; of those parts. In &quot;dual reflector shaping&quot; the shape of the secondary reflector is altered to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, resulting in more uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central &quot;hole&quot; to reduce feed shadowing.
* Another reason for using the Cassegrain design is to increase the focal length of the antenna, to reduce sidelobes, among other advantages. Parabolic reflectors used in dish antennas have a large curvature and short focal length; the focal point is located near the mouth of the dish, to reduce the length of the supports required to hold the feed structure or secondary reflector. The focal ratio (f-number, the ratio of the focal length to the dish diameter) of typical parabolic antennas is 0.25–0.8, compared to 3–8 for parabolic mirrors used in optical systems such as telescopes. In a front-fed antenna, a &quot;flatter&quot; parabolic dish with a long focal length would require an impractically elaborate support structure to hold the feed rigid with respect to the dish. However, the drawback of this small focal ratio is that the antenna is sensitive to small deviations from the focal point: the angular width that it can effectively focus is small. Modern parabolic antennas in radio telescopes and communications satellites often use arrays of feedhorns clustered around the focal point, to create a particular beam pattern. These require the good off-axis focusing characteristics of a large focal ratio, and because the convex secondary reflector of the Cassegrain antenna increases it significantly, these antennas typically use a Cassegrain design.
* The longer focal length also improves crosspolarization discrimination of off-axis feeds, important in satellite antennas that use the two orthogonal polarization modes to transmit separate channels of information.


A disadvantage of the Cassegrain is that the feed horn(s) must have a narrower beamwidth (higher gain) to focus its radiation on the smaller secondary reflector, instead of the wider primary reflector as in front-fed dishes. The angular width the secondary reflector subtends at the feed horn is typically 10–15°, as opposed to 120–180° the main reflector subtends in a front-fed dish. Therefore, the feed horn must be longer for a given wavelength.

==Beam waveguide antenna==
A beam waveguide antenna is a type of complicated Cassegrain antenna with a long radio wave path to allow the feed electronics to be located at ground level. It is used in very large steerable radio telescopes and satellite ground antennas, where the feed electronics are too complicated and bulky, or requires too much maintenance and alterations, to locate on the dish; for example those using cryogenically cooled amplifiers. The beam of incoming radio waves from the secondary reflector is reflected by additional mirrors in a long twisting path through the axes of the altazimuth mount, so the antenna can be steered without interrupting the beam, and then down through the antenna tower to a feed building at ground level.

==History==
The Cassegrain antenna design was adapted from the Cassegrain telescope, a type of reflecting telescope developed around 1672 and attributed to French Province England priest Laurent Cassegrain. The first Cassegrain antenna was invented and patented by Cochrane and Whitehead at Elliot Bros in Borehamwood, England, in 1952. The patent, British Patent Number 700868, was subsequently challenged in court, but prevailed. The Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 is, , 24.6 billion kilometers from Earth, the furthest manmade object in space, and it&#x27;s 3.7 meter S and X-band Cassegrain antenna &quot;(picture below)&quot; is still able to communicate with ground stations.

<text>In computer networking, cell relay refers to a method of statistically multiplexing small fixed-length packets, called &quot;cells&quot;, to transport data between computers or kinds of network equipment. It is a reliable, connection-oriented packet switched data communications protocol.

==Transmission Rates==
Cell relay transmission rates usually are between 56 kbit/s and several gigabits per second. ATM, a particularly popular form of cell relay, is most commonly used for home DSL connections, which often runs between 128 kbit/s and 1.544 Mbit/s (DS1), and for high-speed backbone connections (OC-3 and faster).

Cell relay protocols have neither flow control nor error correction capability, are information-content independent, and correspond only to layers one and two of the OSI Reference Model.

Cell relay can be used for delay- and jitter-sensitive traffic such as voice and video.

===How Cell Relay Works===
Cell relay systems break variable-length user packets into groups of fixed-length cells, that add addressing and verification information. Frame length is fixed in networking hardware, based on time delay and user packet-length considerations. One user data message may be segmented over many cells.

Cell relay systems may also carry bitstream-based data such as PDH traffic, by breaking it into streams of cells, with a lightweight synchronization and clock recovery shim. Thus cell relay systems may potentially carry any combination of stream-based and packet-based data. This is a form of statistical time division multiplexing.

Cell relay is an implementation of fast packet-switching technology that is used in connection-oriented broadband integrated services digital networks (B-ISDN, and its better-known supporting technology ATM) and connectionless IEEE 802.6 switched multi-megabit data service (SMDS).

At any time there is information to be transmitted; the switch basically sends the data units. Connections don&#x27;t have to be negotiated like circuit switching. Channels don&#x27;t have to be allocated because channels do not exist in ATM, and on condition that there is an adequate amount of bandwidth to maintain it, there can be indefinite transmissions over the same facility.

Cell relay utilizes data cells of a persistent size. Frames are comparable to data packets; however they contrast from cells in that they may fluctuate in size based on circumstances. This type of technology is not secure for the reason that its procedures do not support error handling or data recovery. Per se, all delicate and significant transmissions may perhaps be transported faster via fixed-sized cells, which are simpler to transmit compared to variable-sized frames or packets.

===Reliability===
Cell relay is extremely reliable for transporting vital data. Switching devices give the precise method to cells as each endpoint address embedded in a cell. An example of cell relay is ATM, a prevalent form utilized to transfer a cell with a fixed size of 53 bytes.

<doc id="40858" wikidata="Q5017052" url="?curid=40858" title="Caesium standard">
<text>The caesium standard is a primary frequency standard in which the photon absorption by transitions between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium-133 atoms is used to control the output frequency. The first caesium clock was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK and promoted worldwide by Gernot M. R. Winkler of the United States Naval Observatory.

Caesium atomic clocks are one of the most accurate time and frequency standards, and serve as the primary standard for the definition of the second in the International System of Units (SI), the modern metric system. By definition, radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium-133 (in the absence of external influences such as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field) has a frequency, , of exactly . That value was chosen so that the caesium second equaled, to the limit of measuring ability in 1960 when it was adopted, the existing standard ephemeris second based on the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. Because no other measurement involving time had been as precise, the effect of the change was less than the experimental uncertainty of all existing measurements.

While the second is the only base unit to be explicitly defined in terms of the caesium standard, the majority of SI units have definitions that mention either the second, or other units defined using the second. Consequently, every base unit except the mole and every named derived unit except the coulomb, ohm, siemens, gray, sievert, radian, and steradian have values that are implicitly defined by the properties of the caesium-133 hyperfine transition radiation. And of these, all but the mole, the coulomb, and the dimensionless radian and steradian are implicitly defined by the general properties of electromagnetic radiation.

== Technical details ==
The official definition of the second was first given by the BIPM at the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1967 as: &quot;&quot;The second is the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.&quot; At its 1997 meeting the BIPM added to the previous definition the following specification: &quot;This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K.&quot;

The BIPM restated this definition in its 26th conference (2018), &quot;The second is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆Cs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.&quot;&quot;

The meaning of the preceding definition is as follows. The caesium atom has a ground state electron state with configuration [Xe] 6s1 and, consequently, atomic term symbol 2S1/2. This means that there is one unpaired electron and the total electron spin of the atom is 1/2. Moreover, the nucleus of caesium-133 has a nuclear spin equal to 7/2. The simultaneous presence of electron spin and nuclear spin leads, by a mechanism called hyperfine interaction, to a (small) splitting of all energy levels into two sub-levels. One of the sub-levels corresponds to the electron and nuclear spin being parallel (i.e., pointing in the same direction), leading to a total spin &quot;F&quot; equal to ; the other sub-level corresponds to anti-parallel electron and nuclear spin (i.e., pointing in opposite directions), leading to a total spin . In the caesium atom it so happens that the sub-level lowest in energy is the one with , while the sub-level lies energetically slightly above. When the atom is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation having an energy corresponding to the energetic difference between the two sub-levels the radiation is absorbed and the atom is excited, going from the sub-level to the one. After a small fraction of a second the atom will re-emit the radiation and return to its ground state. From the definition of the second it follows that the radiation in question has a frequency of exactly , corresponding to a wavelength of about 3.26 cm and therefore belonging to the microwave range.

Note that a common confusion involves the conversion from angular frequency (formula_1) to frequency (formula_2), or vice versa. Angular frequencies are conventionally given as s–1 in scientific literature, but here the units implicitly mean &quot;radians&quot; per second. In contrast, the unit Hz should be interpreted as &quot;cycles&quot; per second. The conversion formula is formula_3, which implies that 1 Hz corresponds to an angular frequency of approximately 6.28 radians per second (or 6.28 s–1 where radians is omitted for brevity by convention).

== Parameters and significance in the second and other SI units ==
Suppose the caesium standard has the parameters:
* Velocity: &quot;c&quot;
* Energy/frequency: &quot;h&quot;
* Time period: 
* Frequency: 
* Wavelength: 
* Photon energy: 
* Photon mass equivalent: 

=== Time and frequency ===

The first set of units defined using the caesium standard were those relating to time, with the second being defined in 1967 as &quot;the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom&quot; meaning that:
* 1 second, s, = 9,192,631,770 
* 1 hertz, Hz, = 1/s = 
* 1 becquerel, Bq, = 1 nuclear decay/s = nuclear decays/

This also linked the definitions of the derived units relating to force and energy (see below) and of the ampere, whose definition at the time made reference to the newton, to the caesium standard. Before 1967 the SI units of time and frequency were defined using the tropical year and before 1960 by the length of the mean solar day

=== Length ===

In 1983, the meter was, indirectly, defined in terms of the caesium standard with the formal definition &quot;The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. This implied:
* 1 metre, m, = = &quot;c&quot; = 
* 1 radian, rad, = 1 m/m = / = 1 (dimensionless unit of angle)
* 1 steradian, sr, = 1 m2/m2 = 2/2 = 1 (dimensionless unit of solid angle)

Between 1960 and 1983, the metre had been defined by the wavelength of a different transition frequency associated with the krypton-86 atom. This had a much higher frequency and shorter wavelength than the caesium standard, falling inside the visible spectrum. The first definition, used between 1889 and 1960, was by the international prototype meter.

=== Mass, energy, and force ===

Following the 2019 revision of the SI, electromagnetic radiation, in general, was explicitly defined to have the exact parameters:
* &quot;c&quot; = 299,792,458 m/s
* &quot;h&quot; = J s

The caesium-133 hyperfine transition radiation was explicitly defined to have frequency:
* = 9,192,631,770 Hz

Though the above values for &quot;c&quot; and were already obviously implicit in the definitions of the metre and second. Together they imply:
* = &quot;c&quot; = m
* = &quot;h&quot; = 9,192,631,770 Hz × J s = J
* = = = kg

Notably, the wavelength has a fairly human-sized value of about 3.26 centimetres and the photon energy is surprisingly close to the average molecular kinetic energy per degree of freedom per kelvin. From these it follows that:
* 1 kilogram, kg, = 
* 1 joule, J, = 
* 1 watt, W, = 1 J/s = 
* 1 newton, N, = 1 J/m = /
* 1 pascal, Pa, = 1 N/m2 = /3
* 1 gray, Gy, = 1 J/kg = / = 
* 1 sievert, Sv, = the ionizing radiation dose equivalent to 1 gray of gamma rays

Prior to the revision, between 1889 and 2019, the family of metric (and later SI) units relating to mass, force, and energy were somewhat notoriously defined by the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), a specific object stored at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris, meaning that any change to the mass of that object would have resulted in a change to the size of the kilogram and of the many other units whose value at the time depended on that of the kilogram.

=== Temperature ===

From 1954 to 2019, the SI temperature scales were defined using the triple point of water and absolute zero. The 2019 revision replaced these with an assigned value for the Boltzmann constant, &quot;k&quot;, of J/K, implying:
* 1 kelvin, K, = J/2 per degree of freedom = per degree of freedom = per degree of freedom
* Temperature in degrees Celsius, °C, = temperature in kelvins - 273.15 = 

=== Amount of substance ===

The mole is an extremely large number of &quot;elementary entities&quot; (i.e. atoms, molecules, ions, etc). From 1969 to 2019, this number was 0.012 × the mass ratio between the IPK and a carbon 12 atom. The 2019 revision simplified this by assigning the Avogadro constant the exact value elementary entities per mole, thus, uniquely among the base units, the mole maintained its independence from the caesium standard:
* 1 mole, mol, = elementary entities
* 1 katal, kat, = 1 mol/s = elementary entities/

=== Electromagnetic units ===

Prior to the revision, the ampere was defined as the current needed to produce a force between 2 parallel wires 1 m apart of 0.2 μN per meter. The 2019 revision replaced this definition by giving the charge on the electron, &quot;e&quot;, the exact value coulombs. Somewhat incongruously, the coulomb is still considered a derived unit and the ampere a base unit, rather than vice versa. In any case, this convention entailed the following exact relationships between the SI electromagnetic units, elementary charge, and the caesium-133 hyperfine transition radiation:
* 1 coulomb, C, = &quot;e&quot;
* 1 ampere, or amp, A, = 1 C/s = &quot;e&quot; 
* 1 volt, V, = 1 J/C = /&quot;e&quot;
* 1 farad, F, = 1 C/V = &quot;e&quot;2/
* 1 ohm, Ω, = 1 V/A = / &quot;e&quot;2 = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;e&quot;2
* 1 siemens, S, = 1/Ω = &quot;e&quot;2/&quot;h&quot;
* 1 weber, Wb, = 1 V s = /&quot;e&quot; = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;e&quot;
* 1 tesla, T, = 1 Wb/m2 = /&quot;e&quot; 2 = &quot;E&quot;/&quot;e c&quot; 
* 1 henry, H, = Ω s = &quot;h&quot; /&quot;e&quot;2

=== Optical units ===
From 1967 to 1979 the SI optical units, lumen, lux, and candela are defined using the Incandescent glow of platinum at its melting point. After 1979, the candela was defined as the luminous intensity of a monochromatic visible light source of frequency 540 THz (i.e that of the caesium standard) and radiant intensity watts per steradian. This linked the definition of the candela to the caesium standard and, until 2019, to the IPK. Unlike the units relating to mass, energy, temperature, amount of substance, and electromagnetism, the optical units were &quot;not&quot; massively redefined in 2019, though they were indirectly affected since their values depend on that of the watt, and hence of the kilogram. The frequency used to define the optical units has the parameters:
* Frequency: 540 THz
* Time period: fs
* Wavelength: μm
* Photon energy: Hz × J s = J
* luminous efficacy, &quot;K&quot;CD, = 683 lm/W
* Luminous energy per photon, formula_4, = J × 683 lm/W = lm s

This implies:
* 1 lumen, lm, = formula_4 
* 1 candela, cd, = 1 lm/sr = formula_4 /sr
* 1 Lux, lx, = 1 lm/m2 = formula_4 /2

=== Summary ===

The parameters of the caesium 133 hyperfine transition radiation expressed exactly in SI units are:
* Frequency = 9,192,631,770 Hz
* Time period = s
* Wavelength = m
* Photon energy = J
* Photon mass equivalent = kg

If the seven base units of the SI are expressed explicitly in terms of the SI defining constants, they are:
* 1 second = 
* 1 metre = &quot;c&quot;/
* 1 kilogram = &quot;h&quot; /&quot;c&quot;2
* 1 ampere = &quot;e&quot; 
* 1 kelvin = &quot;h&quot; /&quot;k&quot;
* 1 mole = elementary entities
* 1 candela = &quot;h&quot; 2 &quot;K&quot;CD/sr

Ultimately, 6 of the 7 base units notably have values that depend on that of , which appears far more often than any of the other defining constants.

<text>In telecommunications, a channel service unit (CSU) is a line bridging device for use with T-carrier, which
*is used to perform loopback testing;
*may perform bit stuffing;
*may also provide a framing and formatting pattern compatible with the network;
*provides a barrier for electrical interference from either side of the unit; and
*is the last signal regeneration point, on the loop side, coming from the central office, before the regenerated signal reaches a multiplexer or data terminal equipment (DTE).

== Common varieties ==
CSUs can be categorized by the class of service they support (DS1, DS3, DDS, etc.) and by the capabilities within that class. For example, basic DS1 (T1) CSUs support loopback of each interface and will produce alarm indication signal to the provider&#x27;s network interface device (NID) in the event of loss of signal from the customer-premises equipment (CPE). More advanced units will include internal monitors of the performance of the carrier in both directions and may have test pattern generation and monitor capabilities.

== Common practice ==
CSUs are required by PSTN providers at digital interfaces that terminate in a DSU on the customer side. They are not used when the service terminates in a modem, such as the DSL family of service. The maintenance capabilities of the CSU provide important guidance as to whether the provider needs to dispatch a repairman to the customer location.

<doc id="40866" wikidata="Q1164612" url="?curid=40866" title="Characteristic impedance">
<text>The characteristic impedance or surge impedance (usually written Z0) of a uniform transmission line is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a wave travelling in one direction along the line in the absence of reflections in the other direction. Equivalently, it can be defined as the input impedance of a transmission line when its length is infinite. Characteristic impedance is determined by the geometry and materials of the transmission line and, for a uniform line, is not dependent on its length. The SI unit of characteristic impedance is the ohm.

The characteristic impedance of a lossless transmission line is purely real, with no reactive component (see below). Energy supplied by a source at one end of such a line is transmitted through the line without being dissipated in the line itself. A transmission line of finite length (lossless or lossy) that is terminated at one end with an impedance equal to the characteristic impedance appears to the source like an infinitely long transmission line and produces no reflections.

== Transmission line model ==
The characteristic impedance formula_1 of an infinite transmission line at a given angular frequency formula_2 is the ratio of the voltage and current of a pure sinusoidal wave of the same frequency travelling along the line. This relation is also the case for finite transmission lines until the wave reaches the end of the line. Generally, a wave is reflected back along the line in the opposite direction. When the reflected wave reaches the source, it is reflected yet again, adding to the transmitted wave and changing the ratio of the voltage and current at the input, causing the voltage-current ratio to no longer equal the characteristic impedance. This new ratio including the reflected energy is called the input impedance of that particular transmission line and load.

The input impedance of an infinite line is equal to the characteristic impedance since the transmitted wave is never reflected back from the end. Equivalently: &quot;The characteristic impedance of a line is that impedance which, when terminating an arbitrary length of line at its output, produces an input impedance of equal value&quot;. This is so because there is no reflection on a line terminated in its own characteristic impedance.
Applying the transmission line model based on the telegrapher&#x27;s equations as derived below, the general expression for the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is:
formula_3
where

This expression extends to DC by letting formula_2 tend to 0.

A surge of energy on a finite transmission line will see an impedance of formula_5 prior to any reflections returning; hence &quot;surge impedance&quot; is an alternative name for &quot;characteristic impedance&quot;.
Although an infinite line is assumed, since all quantities are per unit length, the “per length” parts of all the units cancel, and the characteristic impedance is independent of the length of the transmission line.

The voltage and current phasors on the line are related by the characteristic impedance as:
formula_6
where the subscripts (+) and (−) mark the separate constants for the waves traveling forward (+) and backward (−). The rightmost expression has a negative sign because the current in the backward wave has the opposite direction to current in the forward wave.

== Derivation ==

=== Using the telegrapher&#x27;s equation ===
The differential equations describing the dependence of the voltage and current on time and space are linear, so that a linear combination of solutions is again a solution. This means that we can consider solutions with a time dependence formula_7 doing so is functionally equivalent of solving for the Fourier coefficients for voltage and current amplitudes, at some fixed angular frequency formula_8 Doing so causes the time dependence to factor out, leaving an ordinary differential equation for the coefficients, which will be phasors, dependent on position (space) only. Moreover, the parameters can be generalized to be frequency-dependent.

Let
formula_9
and
formula_10

Take the positive direction for formula_11 and formula_12 in the loop to be clockwise.

We find that
formula_13
and
formula_14
or
formula_15
where
formula_16

These two first-order equations are easily uncoupled by a second differentiation, with the results:
formula_17
and
formula_18

Notice that both formula_11 and formula_12 satisfy the same equation.

Since formula_21 is independent of formula_22 and formula_23 it can be represented by a single constant formula_24 (The minus sign is included for later convenience.) That is:
formula_25
so
formula_26

We can write the above equation as
formula_27
which is correct for any transmission line in general. And for typical transmission lines, that are carefully built from wire with low loss resistance formula_28 and small insulation leakage conductance formula_29 further, used for high frequencies, the inductive reactance formula_30 and the capacitive admittance formula_31 will both be large, so the constant formula_32 is very close to being a real number:
formula_33

With this definition of formula_34 the position- or part will appear as formula_35 in the exponential solutions of the equation, similar to the time-dependent part formula_36 so the solution reads
formula_37
where formula_38 and formula_39 are the constants of integration for the forward moving (+) and backward moving (−) waves, as in the prior section. When we recombine the time-dependent part we obtain the full solution:
formula_40

Since the equation for formula_12 is the same form, it has a solution of the same form:
formula_42
where formula_43 and formula_44 are again constants of integration.

The above equations are the wave solution for formula_45 and formula_46. In order to be compatible, they must still satisfy the original differential equations, one of which is
formula_47

Substituting the solutions for formula_11 and formula_12 into the above equation, we get
formula_50
or
formula_51

Isolating distinct powers of formula_52 and combining identical powers, we see that in order for the above equation to hold for all possible values of formula_22 we must have:

: For the co-efficients of formula_54: formula_55
: For the co-efficients of formula_56: formula_57

Since formula_58
formula_59
hence, for valid solutions require
formula_60

It can be seen that the constant formula_61 defined in the above equations has the dimensions of impedance (ratio of voltage to current) and is a function of primary constants of the line and operating frequency. It is called the “characteristic impedance” of the transmission line, and conventionally denoted by formula_62
formula_63
which holds generally, for any transmission line. For well-functioning transmission lines, with either formula_28 and formula_65 both very small, or with formula_66 very high, or all of the above, we get
formula_67
hence the characteristic impedance is typically very close to being a real number. Manufacturers make commercial cables to approximate this condition very closely over a wide range of frequencies.

=== As a limiting case of infinite ladder networks ===

==== Intuition ====


Consider an infinite ladder network consisting of a series impedance formula_68 and a shunt admittance formula_69 Let its input impedance be formula_70 If a new pair of impedance formula_68 and admittance formula_72 is added in front of the network, its input impedance formula_73 remains unchanged since the network is infinite. Thus, it can be reduced to a finite network with one series impedance formula_68 and two parallel impedances formula_75 and formula_76 Its input impedance is given by the expression

:formula_77

which is also known as its iterative impedance. Its solution is:

:formula_78

For a transmission line, it can be seen as a limiting case of an infinite ladder network with infinitesimal impedance and admittance at a constant ratio. Taking the positive root, this equation simplifies to:

:formula_79

==== Derivation ====

Using this insight, many similar derivations exist in several books and are applicable to both lossless and lossy lines.

Here, we follow an approach posted by Tim Healy. The line is modeled by a series of differential segments with differential series elements formula_80 and shunt elements formula_81 (as shown in the figure at the beginning of the article). The characteristic impedance is defined as the ratio of the input voltage to the input current of a semi-infinite length of line. We call this impedance formula_62 That is, the impedance looking into the line on the left is formula_62 But, of course, if we go down the line one differential length formula_84 the impedance into the line is still formula_62 Hence we can say that the impedance looking into the line on the far left is equal to formula_86 in parallel with formula_87 and formula_88 all of which is in series with formula_89 and formula_90 Hence:
formula_91

The added formula_86 terms cancel, leaving
formula_93

The first-power formula_94 terms are the highest remaining order. Dividing out the common factor of formula_84 and dividing through by the factor formula_96 we get
formula_97

In comparison to the factors whose formula_94 divided out, the last term, which still carries a remaining factor formula_84 is infinitesimal relative to the other, now finite terms, so we can drop it. That leads to
formula_100

Reversing the sign applied to the square root has the effect of reversing the direction of the flow of current.

== Lossless line ==
The analysis of lossless lines provides an accurate approximation for real transmission lines that simplifies the mathematics considered in modeling transmission lines. A lossless line is defined as a transmission line that has no line resistance and no dielectric loss. This would imply that the conductors act like perfect conductors and the dielectric acts like a perfect dielectric. For a lossless line, and are both zero, so the equation for characteristic impedance derived above reduces to:
formula_101

In particular, formula_5 does not depend any more upon the frequency. The above expression is wholly real, since the imaginary term has canceled out, implying that formula_5 is purely resistive. For a lossless line terminated in formula_5, there is no loss of current across the line, and so the voltage remains the same along the line. The lossless line model is a useful approximation for many practical cases, such as low-loss transmission lines and transmission lines with high frequency. For both of these cases, and are much smaller than and , respectively, and can thus be ignored.

The solutions to the long line transmission equations include incident and reflected portions of the voltage and current:
formula_105
When the line is terminated with its characteristic impedance, the reflected portions of these equations are reduced to 0 and the solutions to the voltage and current along the transmission line are wholly incident. Without a reflection of the wave, the load that is being supplied by the line effectively blends into the line making it appear to be an infinite line. In a lossless line this implies that the voltage and current remain the same everywhere along the transmission line. Their magnitudes remain constant along the length of the line and are only rotated by a phase angle.

== Surge impedance loading ==
In electric power transmission, the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is expressed in terms of the surge impedance loading (SIL), or natural loading, being the power loading at which reactive power is neither produced nor absorbed:
formula_106
in which formula_107 is the RMS line-to-line voltage in volts.

Loaded below its SIL, the voltage at the load will be greater than the system voltage. Above it, the load voltage is depressed. The Ferranti effect describes the voltage gain towards the remote end of a very lightly loaded (or open ended) transmission line. Underground cables normally have a very low characteristic impedance, resulting in an SIL that is typically in excess of the thermal limit of the cable.

== Practical examples ==
The characteristic impedance of coaxial cables (coax) is commonly chosen to be for RF and microwave applications. Coax for video applications is usually for its lower loss.

<doc id="40874" wikidata="Q506273" url="?curid=40874" title="Circuit switching">
<text>Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications network in which two network nodes establish a dedicated communications channel (circuit) through the network before the nodes may communicate. The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the communication session. The circuit functions as if the nodes were physically connected as with an electrical circuit.

Circuit switching originated in analog telephone networks where the network created a dedicated circuit between two telephones for the duration of a telephone call. It contrasts with message switching and packet switching used in modern digital networks in which the trunklines between switching centres carry data between many different nodes in the form of data packets without dedicated circuits.

== Description ==
The defining example of a circuit-switched network is the early analogue telephone network. When a call is made from one telephone to another, switches within the telephone exchanges create a continuous wire circuit between the two telephones, for as long as the call lasts.

In circuit switching, the bit delay is constant during a connection (as opposed to packet switching, where packet queues may cause varying and potentially indefinitely long packet transfer delays). No circuit can be degraded by competing users because it is protected from use by other callers until the circuit is released and a new connection is set up. Even if no actual communication is taking place, the channel remains reserved and protected from competing users.

While circuit switching is commonly used for connecting voice circuits, the concept of a dedicated path persisting between two communicating parties or nodes can be extended to signal content other than voice. The advantage of using circuit switching is that it provides for continuous transfer without the overhead associated with packets, making maximal use of available bandwidth for that communication. One disadvantage is that it can be relatively inefficient because unused capacity guaranteed to a connection cannot be used by other connections on the same network. In addition, calls cannot be established or will be dropped if the circuit is broken.

==The call==
For call setup and control (and other administrative purposes), it is possible to use a separate dedicated signalling channel from the end node to the network. ISDN is one such service that uses a separate signalling channel while plain old telephone service (POTS) does not.

The method of establishing the connection and monitoring its progress and termination through the network may also utilize a separate control channel as in the case of links between telephone exchanges which use CCS7 packet-switched signalling protocol to communicate the call setup and control information and use TDM to transport the actual circuit data.

Early telephone exchanges were a suitable example of circuit switching. The subscriber would ask the operator to connect to another subscriber, whether on the same exchange or via an inter-exchange link and another operator. The result was a physical electrical connection between the two subscribers&#x27; telephones for the duration of the call. The copper wire used for the connection could not be used to carry other calls at the same time, even if the subscribers were in fact not talking and the line was silent.

==Alternatives==
In circuit switching, a route and its associated bandwidth is reserved from source to destination, making circuit switching relatively inefficient since capacity is reserved whether or not the connection is in continuous use. Circuit switching contrasts with message switching and packet switching. Both of these methods can make better use of available network bandwidth between multiple communication sessions under typical conditions in data communication networks.

Message switching routes messages in their entirety, one hop at a time, that is, store and forward of the entire message. Packet switching divides the data to be transmitted into packets transmitted through the network independently. Instead of being dedicated to one communication session at a time, network links are shared by packets from multiple competing communication sessions, resulting in the loss of the quality of service guarantees that are provided by circuit switching.

Packet switching can be based on connection-oriented communication or connection-less communication. That is, based on virtual circuits or datagrams.

Virtual circuits use packet switching technology that emulates circuit switching, in the sense that the connection is established before any packets are transferred, and packets are delivered in order.

Connection-less packet switching divides the data to be transmitted into packets, called datagrams, transmitted through the network independently. Each datagram is labelled with its destination and a sequence number for ordering related packets, precluding the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination. Each datagram is dispatched independently and each may be routed via a different path. At the destination, the original message is reordered based on the packet number to reproduce the original message. As a result, datagram packet switching networks do not require a circuit to be established and allow many pairs of nodes to communicate concurrently over the same channel.

Multiplexing multiple telecommunications connections over the same physical conductor has been possible for a long time, but each channel on the multiplexed link was either dedicated to one call at a time, or it was idle between calls.

<text>In electrodynamics, circular polarization of an electromagnetic wave is a polarization state in which, at each point, the electromagnetic field of the wave has a constant magnitude and is rotating at a constant rate in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the wave.

In electrodynamics, the strength and direction of an electric field is defined by its electric field vector. In the case of a circularly polarized wave, the tip of the electric field vector, at a given point in space, relates to the phase of the light as it travels through time and space. At any instant of time, the electric field vector of the wave indicates a point on a helix oriented along the direction of propagation. A circularly polarized wave can rotate in one of two possible senses: &quot;right-handed circular polarization (RHCP)&quot; in which the electric field vector rotates in a right-hand sense with respect to the direction of propagation, and &quot;left-handed circular polarization (LHCP)&quot; in which the vector rotates in a left-hand sense.

&quot;Circular polarization&quot; is a limiting case of &quot;elliptical polarization&quot;. The other special case is the easier-to-understand &quot;linear polarization&quot;. All three terms were coined by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, in a memoir read to the French Academy of Sciences on 9 December 1822. Fresnel had first described the case of circular polarization, without yet naming it, in 1821.

The phenomenon of polarization arises as a consequence of the fact that light behaves as a two-dimensional transverse wave.

Circular polarization occurs when the two orthogonal electric field component vectors are of equal magnitude and are out of phase by exactly 90°, or one-quarter wavelength.

== Characteristics ==
In a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, the individual electric field vectors, as well as their combined vector, have a constant magnitude, and with changing phase angle. Given that this is a plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the optical axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this dynamic. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave, each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.

Circular polarization is often encountered in the field of optics and, in this section, the electromagnetic wave will be simply referred to as light.

The nature of circular polarization and its relationship to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two components that are perpendicular to each other. The vertical component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in blue, while the horizontal component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in green. Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component leads the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength, a 90° phase difference. It is this quadrature phase relationship that creates the helix and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the horizontal component, and vice versa. The result of this alignment are select vectors, corresponding to the helix, which exactly match the maxima of the vertical and horizontal components.

To appreciate how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates while maintaining a constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative to the center of the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.
The next pair of illustrations is that of left-handed, counterclockwise circularly polarized light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component is now &quot;lagging&quot; the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength, rather than leading it.

===Reversal of handedness===

====Waveplate====
To convert circularly polarized light to the other handedness, one can use a half-waveplate. A half-waveplate shifts a given linear component of light one half of a wavelength relative to its orthogonal linear component.

====Reflection====
The handedness of polarized light is reversed reflected off a surface at normal incidence. Upon such reflection, the rotation of the plane of polarization of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However, with propagation now in the &quot;opposite&quot; direction, the same rotation direction that would be described as &quot;right-handed&quot; for the incident beam, is &quot;left-handed&quot; for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a birefringent surface).

Note that this principle only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right-handed, but elliptically polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may be solved by decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; respectively. The reflected components in the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, where there is no distinction between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.

===Conversion to linear polarization===
Circularly polarized light can be converted into linearly polarized light by passing it through a quarter-waveplate. Passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-waveplate with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to circular polarization. In fact, this is the most common way of producing circular polarization in practice. Note that passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-waveplate at an angle &quot;other&quot; than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.

== Handedness conventions ==
 

Circular polarization may be referred to as right-handed or left-handed, and clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates. Unfortunately, two opposing historical conventions exist.

=== From the point of view of the source ===

Using this convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the source. When using this convention, left- or right-handedness is determined by pointing one&#x27;s left or right thumb from the source, in the direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one&#x27;s fingers to the direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while looking from the source and in the direction of the wave&#x27;s propagation, one observes the direction of the field&#x27;s temporal rotation.

Using this convention, the electric field vector of a left-handed circularly polarized wave is as follows:
formula_1

As a specific example, refer to the circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention, that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one&#x27;s right thumb in the same direction of the wave&#x27;s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field&#x27;s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because, from the point of view of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave&#x27;s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light, using this same convention.

This convention is in conformity with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard and, as a result, it is generally used in the engineering community.

Quantum physicists also use this convention of handedness because it is consistent with their convention of handedness for a particle&#x27;s spin.

Radio astronomers also use this convention in accordance with an International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution made in 1973.

=== From the point of view of the receiver ===

In this alternative convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the receiver. Using this convention, left- or right-handedness is determined by pointing one&#x27;s left or right thumb the source, the direction of propagation, and then matching the curling of one&#x27;s fingers to the temporal rotation of the field.

When using this convention, in contrast to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one&#x27;s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction of progression for the helix, given the sense of rotation. Note that, in the context of the nature of all screws and helices, it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.

When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the receiver and, while looking the source, the direction of propagation, one observes the direction of the field&#x27;s temporal rotation.

Just as in the other convention, right-handedness corresponds to a clockwise rotation, and left-handedness corresponds to an anti-clockwise rotation.

Many optics textbooks use this second convention. It is also used by SPIE as well as the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

=== Uses of the two conventions ===

As stated earlier, there is significant confusion with regards to these two conventions. As a general rule, the engineering, quantum physics, and radio astronomy communities use the first convention, in which the wave is observed from the point of view of the source. In many physics textbooks dealing with optics, the second convention is used, in which the light is observed from the point of view of the receiver.

To avoid confusion, it is good practice to specify &quot;as defined from the point of view of the source&quot; or &quot;as defined from the point of view of the receiver&quot; when discussing polarization matters.

The archive of the US Federal Standard 1037C proposes two contradictory conventions of handedness.

Note that the IEEE defines RHCP and LHCP the opposite as those used by physicists. The IEEE 1979 Antenna Standard will show RHCP on the South Pole of the Poincare Sphere. The IEEE defines RHCP using the right hand with thumb pointing in the direction of transmit, and the fingers showing the direction of rotation of the E field with time. The rationale for the opposite conventions used by Physicists and Engineers is that Astronomical Observations are always done with the incoming wave traveling toward the observer, where as for most engineers, they are assumed to be standing behind the transmitter watching the wave traveling away from them. This article is not using the IEEE 1979 Antenna Standard and is not using the +t convention typically used in IEEE work.

== FM radio ==

FM broadcast radio stations sometimes employ circular polarization to improve signal penetration into buildings and vehicles. It is one example of what the International Telecommunication Union refers to as &quot;mixed polarization&quot;, i.e. radio emissions that include both horizontally- and vertically-polarized components. In the United States, Federal Communications Commission regulations state that horizontal polarization is the standard for FM broadcasting, but that &quot;circular or elliptical polarization may be employed if desired&quot;.

==Dichroism==

Circular dichroism (CD) is the differential absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. Circular dichroism is the basis of a form of spectroscopy that can be used to determine the optical isomerism and secondary structure of molecules.

In general, this phenomenon will be exhibited in absorption bands of any optically active molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, because of the dextrorotary (e.g., some sugars) and levorotary (e.g., some amino acids) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the alpha helix, beta sheet and random coil regions of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.

Also, under the right conditions, even non-chiral molecules will exhibit magnetic circular dichroism — that is, circular dichroism induced by a magnetic field.

==Luminescence==
&quot;Circularly polarized luminescence&quot; (CPL) can occur when either a luminophore or an ensemble of luminophores is chiral. The extent to which emissions are polarized is quantified in the same way it is for circular dichroism, in terms of the &quot;dissymmetry factor&quot;, also sometimes referred to as the &quot;anisotropy factor&quot;. This value is given by:

:formula_2

where formula_3 corresponds to the quantum yield of left-handed circularly polarized light, and formula_4 to that of right-handed light. The maximum absolute value of &quot;g&quot;em, corresponding to purely left- or right-handed circular polarization, is therefore 2. Meanwhile, the smallest absolute value that &quot;g&quot;em can achieve, corresponding to linearly polarized or unpolarized light, is zero.

==Mathematical description==
The classical sinusoidal plane wave solution of the electromagnetic wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields is:
:formula_5

where k is the wavenumber;
:formula_6

is the angular frequency of the wave; formula_7 is an orthogonal formula_8 matrix whose columns span the transverse x-y plane; and formula_9 is the speed of light.

Here,
:formula_10

is the amplitude of the field, and
:formula_11

is the normalized Jones vector in the x-y plane.

If formula_12 is rotated by formula_13 radians with respect to formula_14 and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude, the wave is circularly polarized. The Jones vector is:
:formula_15

where the plus sign indicates left circular polarization, and the minus sign indicates right circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane.

If basis vectors are defined such that:
:formula_16

and:
:formula_17

then the polarization state can be written in the &quot;R-L basis&quot; as:
:formula_18

where:
:formula_19

and:

:formula_20

==Antennas==

A number of different types of antenna elements can be used to produce circularly polarized (or nearly so) radiation; following Balanis, one can use &quot;dipole elements&quot;:
&quot;... two crossed dipoles provide the two orthogonal field components... If the two dipoles are identical, the field intensity of each along zenith ... would be of the same intensity. Also, if the two dipoles were fed with a 90° degree time-phase difference (phase quadrature), the polarization along zenith would be circular... One way to obtain the 90° time-phase difference between the two orthogonal field components, radiated respectively by the two dipoles, is by feeding one of the two dipoles with a transmission line which is 1/4 wavelength longer or shorter than that of the other,&quot; p.80;
or &quot;helical elements&quot;:
&quot;To achieve circular polarization [in axial or end-fire mode] ... the circumference &quot;C&quot; of the helix must be ... with &quot;C&quot;/wavelength = 1 near optimum, and the spacing about &quot;S&quot; = wavelength/4,&quot; p.571;
or &quot;patch elements&quot;:
&quot;... circular and elliptical polarizations can be obtained using various feed arrangements or slight modifications made to the elements... Circular polarization can be obtained if two orthogonal modes are excited with a 90° time-phase difference between them. This can be accomplished by adjusting the physical dimensions of the patch... For a square patch element, the easiest way to excite ideally circular polarization is to feed the element at two adjacent edges... The quadrature phase difference is obtained by feeding the element with a 90° power divider,&quot; p.859.

==In quantum mechanics==

In the quantum mechanical view, light is composed of photons. Polarization is a manifestation of the spin angular momentum of light. More specifically, in quantum mechanics, the direction of spin of a photon is tied to the handedness of the circularly polarized light, and the spin of a beam of photons is similar to the spin of a beam of particles, such as electrons.

==In nature==
Only a few mechanisms in nature are known to systematically produce circularly polarized light. In 1911, Albert Abraham Michelson discovered that light reflected from the golden scarab beetle &quot;Chrysina resplendens&quot; is preferentially left-polarized. Since then, circular polarization has been measured in several other scarab beetles such as &quot;Chrysina gloriosa&quot;, as well as some crustaceans such as the mantis shrimp. In these cases, the underlying mechanism is the molecular-level helicity of the chitinous cuticle.

The bioluminescence of the larvae of fireflies is also circularly polarized, as reported in 1980 for the species &quot;Photuris lucicrescens&quot; and &quot;Photuris versicolor&quot;. For fireflies, it is more difficult to find a microscopic explanation for the polarization, because the left and right lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a linear polarization due to inhomogeneities inside aligned photocytes, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly birefringent tissue.

Circular polarization has been detected in light reflected from leaves and photosynthetic microbes.

Water-air interfaces provide another source of circular polarization. Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then totally internally reflected back down, its vertical component undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, the faint light outside Snell&#x27;s window therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.

Weaker sources of circular polarization in nature include multiple scattering by linear polarizers, as in the circular polarization of starlight, and selective absorption by circularly dichroic media.

Radio emission from pulsars can be strongly circularly polarized.

Two species of mantis shrimp have been reported to be able to detect circular polarized light.

<text>In electrical engineering, a circulator is a passive, non-reciprocal three- or four-port device that only allows a microwave or radio-frequency (RF) signal to exit through the port directly after the one it entered. Optical circulators have similar behavior. Ports are where an external waveguide or transmission line, such as a microstrip line or a coaxial cable, connects to the device. For a three-port circulator, a signal applied to port 1 only comes out of port 2; a signal applied to port 2 only comes out of port 3; a signal applied to port 3 only comes out of port 1. An ideal three-port circulator thus has the following scattering matrix:

:formula_1

==Theory of operation==
Microwave circulators rely on the anisotropic and &quot;non-reciprocal&quot; properties of magnetized microwave ferrite material. Microwave electromagnetic waves propagating in magnetized ferrite interact with electron spins in the ferrite and are consequently influenced by the microwave magnetic permeability of the ferrite. This permeability is mathematically described by a linear vector operator, also known as a tensor. In the case of magnetized ferrite, the permeability tensor is the Polder tensor. The permeability is a function of the direction of microwave propagation relative to the direction of static magnetization of the ferrite material. Hence, microwave signals propagating in different directions in the ferrite experience different magnetic permeabilities.

In the CGS system, the Polder tensor is

:formula_2

where (neglecting damping)

:formula_3

:formula_4

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the Permeability of Free Space and formula_7 is the Absolute permittivity of the ferrite material. In a circulator, these propagation constants describe waves having Elliptical polarization that would propagate in the direction of the static magnetic bias field, which is through the thickness of the ferrite. The plus and minus subscripts of the propagation constants indicate opposite wave polarizations.

==Types==

Microwave circulators fall into two main classes: differential phase shift circulators and junction circulators, both of which are based on cancellation of waves propagating over two different paths in or near magnetized ferrite material. Waveguide circulators may be of either type, while more compact devices based on stripline are usually of the junction type. Two or more junction circulators can be combined in a single component to give four or more ports. Typically permanent magnets produce a static magnetic bias in the microwave ferrite material. Ferrimagnetic garnet crystal is used in optical circulators.

===Junction circulators===
====Stripline junction circulators====
A stripline junction circulator contains a resonator, which is located at the central junction of the striplines. This resonator may have any shape that has three-fold Rotational symmetry, such as a disk, hexagon, or triangle. An RF/microwave signal entering a circulator port is connected via a stripline to the resonator, where energy is coupled into two counter-rotating circular modes formed by the elliptically polarized waves. These circular modes have different phase velocities which can cause them to combine constructively or destructively at a given port. This produces an anti-node at one port (port 2 if the signal is incident upon port 1) and a node or null at another port (port 3 if the microwave energy is coupled from port 1 to port 2 and not reflected back into port 2).

If losses are neglected for simplification, the counter-rotating modes must differ in phase by an integer multiple of formula_8 for signal propagation from port 1 to port 2 (or from port 2 to port 3, or from port 3 to port 1):

:formula_9

and similarly, for the remaining port (port 3 if signal propagation is from port 1 to port 2) to be nulled,

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the path length between adjacent ports and formula_12 and formula_13 are integers. Solving the two preceding equations simultaneously, for proper circulation the necessary conditions are

:formula_14

and

:formula_15

Each of the two counter-rotating modes has its own resonant frequency. The two resonant frequencies are known as the split frequencies. The circulator operating frequency is set between the two split frequencies.

These circulator types operate based on faraday rotation. Wave cancellation occurs when waves propagate with and against the circulator&#x27;s direction of circulation. An incident wave arriving at any port is split equally into two waves. They propagate in each direction around the circulator with different phase velocities. When they arrive at the output port they have different phase relationships and thus combine accordingly. This combination of waves propagating at different phase velocities is how junction circulators fundamentally operate.

The geometry of a stripline junction circulator comprises two ferrite disks or triangles separated by a stripline center conductor and sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. A stripline circulator is essentially a stripline center conductor sandwich on ferrite, between ground planes. That is, there is one ferrite disk above the stripline circuit and one ferrite disk below the stripline circuit. Stripline circulators do not have to be constructed with disk- or triangle-shaped ferrites; the ferrites can have almost any shape that has three-way symmetry. This is also true of the resonator (the center junction portion of the center conductor)- it can be any shape that has three-way symmetry, although there are electrical considerations.

The ferrites are magnetized through their thicknesses, i.e., the static magnetic bias field is perpendicular to the plane of the device and the direction of signal propagation is transverse to the direction of the static magnetic field. Both ferrites are in the same static ad RF magnetic fields. The two ferrites can be thought of as one continuous ferrite with an embedded stripline center conductor. For practical manufacturing reasons, the center conductor is not generally embedded in ferrite, so two discrete ferrites are used. The static magnetic bias field is typically provided by permanent magnets that are located external to the circulator ground planes. Magnetic shielding incorporated into the circulator design prevents detuning or partial demagnetization of the circulator in the presence of external magnetic fields or ferrous materials, and protects nearby devices from the effects of the circulator&#x27;s static magnetic field.

====Waveguide junction circulators====
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
A waveguide junction circulator contains a magnetized ferrite resonator, which is located at the junction of three waveguides. In contrast with a stripline junction circulator, the ferrite itself is the resonator, rather than the metal central portion of a stripline center conductor. The ferrite resonator may have any shape that has three-fold Rotational symmetry, such as a cylinder or Triangular prism. The resonator is often just one ferrite, but it is sometimes composed of two or more ferrites, which may be coupled to each other, in various geometrical configurations. The geometry of the resonator is influenced by electrical and thermal performance considerations. Waveguide junction circulators function in much the same way as stripline junction circulators, and their basic theory of operation is the same.

The internal geometry of a waveguide junction circulator comprises a junction of three waveguides, the ferrite resonator, and impedance matching structures. Many of these circulators contain pedestals located in the central junction, on which the ferrite resonator is located. These pedestals effectively reduce the height of the waveguide, reducing its characteristic impedance in the resonator region to optimize electrical performance. The reduced-height waveguide sections leading from the resonator to the full-height waveguides serve as impedance transformers.

The ferrite resonator is magnetized through its height, i.e., the static magnetic bias field is perpendicular to the plane of the device and the direction of signal propagation is transverse to the direction of the static magnetic field. The static magnetic bias field is typically provided by permanent magnets that are external to the waveguide junction.


====Microstrip junction circulators====

The microstrip junction circulator is another widely-used form of circulator that utilizes the microstrip transmission line topology. A microstrip circulator consists primarily of a circuit pattern on a ferrite substrate. The circuit is typically formed using thick-film or thin-film metallization processes, often including photolithography. The ferrite substrate is sometimes bonded to a ferrous metal carrier, which serves to improve the efficiency of the magnetic circuit, increase the mechanical strength of the circulator, and protect the ferrite from thermal expansion mismatches between it and the surface to which the circulator is mounted. A permanent magnet that is bonded to the circuit face of the ferrite substrate provides the static magnetic bias to the ferrite. Microstrip circulators function in the same way as stripline junction circulators, and their basic theory of operation is the same. In comparison with stripline circulators, electrical performance of microstrip circulators is somewhat reduced because of radiation and dispersion effects.

The performance disadvantages of microstrip circulators are offset by their relative ease of integration with other planar circuitry. The electrical connections of these circulators to adjacent circuitry are typically made using wire bonds or ribbon bonds. Another advantage of microstrip circulators is their smaller size and correspondingly lower mass than stripline circulators. Despite this advantage, microstrip circulators are often the largest components in microwave modules.

====Self-biased junction circulators====

Self-biased junction circulators are unique in that they do not utilize permanent magnets that are separate from the microwave ferrite. The elimination of external magnets significantly reduces the size and weight of the circulator compared to electrically-equivalent microstrip junction circulators for similar applications.

Monolithic ferrites that are used for self-biased circulators are M-type uniaxial (single magnetic axis) hexagonal ferrites that have been optimized to have low microwave losses. In contrast with the magnetically soft (low-coercivity) ferrites used in other circulators, the hexagonal ferrites used for self-biased circulators are magnetically hard (high-coercivity) materials. These ferrites are essentially ceramic permanent magnets. In addition to their high magnetic remanence, these ferrites have very large magnetic anisotropy fields, enabling circulator operation up to high microwave frequencies.

Because of their thin, planar shape, self-biased circulators can be conveniently integrated with other planar circuitry. Integration of self-biased circulators with semiconductor wafers has been demonstrated at KA-band and V-band frequencies.

===Lumped-element circulators===


Lumped-element circulators are small-size devices that are typically used at frequencies in the HF through UHF bands. In a junction circulator, the size of the ferrite(s) is proportional to signal wavelength, but in a lumped-element circulator, the ferrite can be smaller because there is no such wavelength proportionality.

In a lumped-element circulator, conductors are wrapped around the ferrite, forming what is typically a woven mesh. The conductor strips are insulated from each other by thin dielectric layers. In some circulators, the mesh is in the form of traces on a printed wiring board with metallized vias to make connections between layers. The conductive strips can be thought of as non-reciprocally coupled inductors. Impedance matching circuitry and broad-banding circuitry in lumped-element circulators are often constructed using discrete ceramic capacitors and air-core inductors.

This class of circulator offers a considerable size reduction compared with the junction circulators. On the other hand, lumped-element circulators generally have lower RF power handling capacity than equivalent junction devices and are more complex from a mechanical perspective. The discrete lumped-element inductors and capacitors can be less stable when exposed to vibration or mechanical shocks than the simple distributed impedance transformers in a stripline junction circulator.

===Switching circulators===

Switching circulators are similar to other junction circulators, and their microwave theory of operation is the same, except that their direction of circulation can be electronically controlled.

Junction circulators use permanent magnets to provide the static magnetic bias for the ferrite(s). However, switching circulators typically rely on the remanent magnetization of the ferrite itself. The ferrites that are used in switching circulators have square magnetic hysteresis loops and often sub-Oersted coercivities. Such a ferrite material requires a relatively small magnetic field and low energy level to flip its magnetic polarity. This is distinctly advantageous for a switching circulator, but the absence of permanent magnets would be a disadvantage of a non-switching junction circulator that must retain its magnetic bias despite exposures to the potentially demagnetizing effects of stray magnetic fields, nearby ferrous materials, and temperature variations.

The magnetization polarity of the ferrite, and hence the direction of circulation of a switching circulator, is controlled using a magnetizing coil that loops through the ferrite. The coil is connected to electronic driver circuitry that sends current pulses of the correct polarity through the magnetizing coil to magnetize the ferrite in the polarity to provide the desired direction of circulation.

===Differential phase shift circulators===
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


Differential phase shift circulators are mainly used in high power microwave applications. They are usually built from rectangular waveguide components. These circulators are 4-port devices having circulation in the sequence 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1, with ports numbered as shown in the schematic. There are various feasible circulator architectures, the most common of which utilizes a magic tee hybrid coupler, a quadrature hybrid coupler, and two oppositely-magnetized differential phase shifters.

A differential phase shifter provides &quot;non-reciprocal&quot; transmission phase shift. That is, the forward phase shift is different from the phase shift in the reverse transmission direction. It is this difference in phase shifts that enables the non-reciprocal behavior of the circulator. A differential phase shifter consists of one or more ferrite slabs, usually positioned on the broad wall(s) of the waveguide. Permanent magnets located outside the waveguide provide static magnetic bias field to the ferrite(s). The ferrite-loaded waveguide is another example of a &quot;transverse-field&quot; device as described in . Different microwave propagation constants corresponding to different directions of signal propagation give rise to different phase velocities and hence, different transmission phase shifts.

Depending on which circulator port an incident signal enters, phase shift relationships in the hybrid couplers and the differential phase shifts cause signals to combine at one other port and cancel at each of the remaining two ports. Differential phase shift circulators are often used as 3-port circulators by connecting one circulator port to a reflectionless termination, or they can be used as isolators by terminating two circulator ports.

&lt;br&gt;
==Non-ferrite circulators==
Though ferrite circulators can provide good &quot;forward&quot; signal circulation while suppressing greatly the &quot;reverse&quot; circulation, their major shortcomings, especially at low frequencies, are the bulky sizes and the narrow bandwidths.

Early work on non-ferrite circulators includes active circulators using transistors that are non-reciprocal in nature. In contrast to ferrite circulators which are passive devices, active circulators require power. Major issues associated with transistor-based active circulators are the power limitation and the signal-to-noise degradation, which are critical when it is used as a duplexer for sustaining the strong transmit power and clean reception of the signal from the antenna.

Varactors offer one solution. One study employed a structure similar to a time-varying transmission line with the effective nonreciprocity triggered by a one-direction propagating carrier pump. This is like an AC-powered active circulator. The research claimed to be able to achieve positive gain and low noise for receiving path and broadband nonreciprocity. Another study used resonance with nonreciprocity triggered by angular-momentum biasing, which more closely mimics the way that signals passively circulate in a ferrite circulator.

In 1964, Mohr presented and experimentally demonstrated a circulator based on transmission lines and switches. In April, 2016 a research team significantly extended this concept, presenting an integrated circuit circulator based on N-path filter concepts. It offers the potential for full-duplex communication (transmitting and receiving at the same time with a single shared antenna over a single frequency). The device uses capacitors and a clock and is much smaller than conventional devices.

==Applications==

===Isolator===
When one port of a three-port circulator is terminated in a matched load, it can be used as an &quot;isolator&quot;, since a signal can travel in only one direction between the remaining ports. An isolator is used to shield equipment on its input side from the effects of conditions on its output side; for example, to prevent a microwave source being detuned by a mismatched load.

===Duplexer===
In radar, circulators are used as a type of duplexer, to route signals from the transmitter to the antenna and from the antenna to the receiver, without allowing signals to pass directly from transmitter to receiver. The alternative type of duplexer is a &quot;transmit-receive switch&quot; (&quot;TR switch&quot;) that alternates between connecting the antenna to the transmitter and to the receiver. The use of chirped pulses and a high dynamic range may lead to temporal overlap of the sent and received pulses, however, requiring a circulator for this function.

===Reflection amplifier===

A reflection amplifier is a type of microwave amplifier circuit utilizing negative differential resistance diodes such as tunnel diodes and Gunn diodes. Negative differential resistance diodes can amplify signals, and often perform better at microwave frequencies than two-port devices. However, since the diode is a one-port (two terminal) device, a nonreciprocal component is needed to separate the outgoing amplified signal from the incoming input signal. By using a 3-port circulator with the signal input connected to one port, the biased diode connected to a second, and the output load connected to the third, the output and input can be uncoupled.

<doc id="40881" wikidata="Q15530887" url="?curid=40881" title="Thomas L. Cleave">
<text>Thomas Latimer (Peter) Cleave (1906–1983) was a surgeon captain who researched the negative health effects of consuming refined carbohydrate (notably sugar and white flour) which would not have been available during early human evolution. Known as &#x27;Peter&#x27; to his friends and colleagues, Cleave was born in Exeter in 1906, and educated at Clifton College. Between 1922 and 1927, he attended medical schools at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, where he was an academic prodigy winning prize after prize and qualifying at the early age of 21, having passed his primary FRCS examination at the age of 18 and ultimately achieving MRCS and LRCP.

At Bristol, one of his teachers was Rendle Short, who had proposed that appendicitis is caused by a lack of cellulose in the diet. Charles Darwin&#x27;s writings provided the intellectual framework to Cleave&#x27;s lifelong engagement with the relationship between diet and health, built upon the premise that the human body is ill-adapted to the diet of modern (western) man.

Cleave&#x27;s interest focussed on preventative medicine where he observed the harmful effects of the overconsumption of refined carbohydrates such as sugar and refined flour which he called &#x27;The Saccharine Disease&#x27;. He noticed that the saccharine manifestations did not occur in wild creatures or among primitive people living on traditional unrefined food.

He considered refined carbohydrates (white flour and sugar) to be the most transformed food, and therefore the most dangerous. After completing his medical training, Cleave entered the Royal Navy in 1927 as Surgeon Lieutenant.

==Military career==

Between 1938 and 1940, he served as Medical Specialist at RN Hospital, Hong Kong. It was during his war service, in 1941, whilst on the battleship King George V, that he acquired his naval nickname &#x27;the bran man&#x27; when he had sacks of bran brought on board to combat the common occurrence of constipation amongst sailors. Cleave&#x27;s intention was &#x27;to give them bowel movements as efficient as the guns they fired.&#x27; The ship assisted in the sinking of the Bismarck. Cleave was on the bridge as the Bismarck was going down and a fellow officer exclaimed to him &#x27;Well done Doc, you deserve a medal, our bowels were working like clockwork!’

Following war service, he worked at Royal Naval Hospitals in Chatham (1945–1948), Malta (1949–1951) and Plymouth (1952–1953). He retired from the Royal Navy in 1962 as Surgeon Captain, having finished his naval career as Director of Medical Research at the RN Medical School

==Post-military career==
Cleaves unique contribution to medical thought was his realisation that three mechanisms were at work when refined carbohydrates are eaten; fibre depletion, over-consumption and protein stripping, with over-consumption being the most serious.

In 1969, Dr. Cleave brought public attention to the low amount of dietary fiber in modern diets that had become rich in processed ingredients. His work was bolstered by the supporting work of Dr. Denis Burkitt.

==Awards and honors==
In 1976 Cleave was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1979 he was awarded both the Harben gold medal of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene and the Gilbert Blane medal for naval medicine by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Cleave was a 2009 inductee into the Orthomolecular Medicine Hall of Fame.

<text>Closed captioning (CC) is a form of subtitling, a process of displaying text on a television, video screen, or other visual display to provide additional or interpretive information, where the viewer is given the choice of whether the text is displayed. Closed captions are typically used as a transcription of the audio portion of a program as it occurs (either or in edited form), sometimes including descriptions of non-speech elements. Other uses have included providing a textual alternative language translation of a presentation&#x27;s primary audio language that is usually burned-in (or &quot;open&quot;) to the video and unselectable.

HTML5 defines subtitles as a &quot;transcription or translation of the dialogue when sound is available but not understood&quot; by the viewer (for example, dialogue in a foreign language) and captions as a &quot;transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information when sound is unavailable or not clearly audible&quot; (for example, when audio is muted or the viewer is deaf or hard of hearing).

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;closed&quot; indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the remote control or menu option. On the other hand, the terms &quot;open&quot;, &quot;burned-in&quot;, &quot;baked on&quot;, &quot;hard-coded&quot;, or simply &quot;hard&quot; indicate that the captions are visible to all viewers as they are embedded in the video.

In the United States and Canada, the terms &quot;subtitles&quot; and &quot;captions&quot; have different meanings. &quot;Subtitles&quot; assume the viewer can hear but cannot understand the language or accent, or the speech is not entirely clear, so they transcribe only dialogue and some on-screen text. &quot;Captions&quot; aim to describe to the deaf and hard of hearing all significant audio content—spoken dialogue and non-speech information such as the identity of speakers and, occasionally, their manner of speaking—along with any significant music or sound effects using words or symbols. Also, the term &quot;closed caption&quot; has come to be used to also refer to the North American EIA-608 encoding that is used with NTSC-compatible video.

The United Kingdom, Ireland, and a number of other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and captions and use &quot;subtitles&quot; as the general term. The equivalent of &quot;captioning&quot; is usually referred to as &quot;subtitles for the hard of hearing&quot;. Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says &quot;Subtitles&quot;, or previously &quot;Subtitles 888&quot; or just &quot;888&quot; (the latter two are in reference to the conventional videotext channel for captions), which is why the term &quot;subtitle&quot; is also used to refer to the Ceefax-based videotext encoding that is used with PAL-compatible video. The term &quot;subtitle&quot; has been replaced with &quot;caption&quot; in a number of markets—such as Australia and New Zealand—that purchase large amounts of imported US material, with much of that video having had the US CC logo already superimposed over the start of it. In New Zealand, broadcasters superimpose an ear logo with a line through it that represents subtitles for the hard of hearing, even though they are currently referred to as captions. In the UK, modern digital television services have subtitles for the majority of programs, so it is no longer necessary to highlight which have subtitling/captioning and which do not.

Remote control handsets for TVs, DVD players, and similar devices in most European markets often use &quot;SUB&quot; or &quot;SUBTITLE&quot; on the button used to control the display of subtitles and captions.

== History ==
=== Open captioning ===
Regular open-captioned broadcasts began on PBS&#x27;s &quot;The French Chef&quot; in 1972. WGBH began open captioning of the programs &quot;Zoom&quot;, &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Once Upon a Classic&quot; shortly thereafter.

=== Technical development of closed captioning ===
Closed captioning was first demonstrated in the United States at the First National Conference on Television for the Hearing Impaired at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, in December 1971. A second demonstration of closed captioning was held at Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) on February 15, 1972, where ABC and the National Bureau of Standards demonstrated closed captions embedded within a normal broadcast of &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;.
At the same time in the UK the BBC was demonstrating its Ceefax text based broadcast service which they were already using as a foundation to the development of a closed caption production system. They were working with professor Alan Newell from the University of Southampton who had been developing prototypes in the late 1960s.

The closed captioning system was successfully encoded and broadcast in 1973 with the cooperation of PBS station WETA. As a result of these tests, the FCC in 1976 set aside line 21 for the transmission of closed captions. PBS engineers then developed the caption editing consoles that would be used to caption prerecorded programs.

The BBC in the UK was the first broadcaster to include closed captions (called subtitles in the UK) in 1979 based on the Teletext framework for pre-recorded programming.

Real-time captioning, a process for captioning live broadcasts, was developed by the National Captioning Institute in 1982. In real-time captioning, stenotype operators who are able to type at speeds of over 225 words per minute provide captions for live television programs, allowing the viewer to see the captions within two to three seconds of the words being spoken.

Major US producers of captions are WGBH-TV, VITAC, CaptionMax and the National Captioning Institute. In the UK and Australasia, Ai-Media, Red Bee Media, itfc, and Independent Media Support are the major vendors.

Improvements in speech recognition technology mean that live captioning may be fully or partially automated. BBC Sport broadcasts use a &quot;respeaker&quot;: a trained human who repeats the running commentary (with careful enunciation and some simplification and markup) for input to the automated text generation system. This is generally reliable, though errors are not unknown.

=== Full-scale closed captioning ===
The National Captioning Institute was created in 1979 in order to get the cooperation of the commercial television networks.

The first use of regularly scheduled closed captioning on American television occurred on March 16, 1980. Sears had developed and sold the Telecaption adapter, a decoding unit that could be connected to a standard television set. The first programs seen with captioning were a &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot; presentation of the film &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; on NBC, an &quot;ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; airing of &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;, and &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; on PBS.

Since 2010 the BBC provides captioning for all programming across all seven of its main broadcast channels BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, CBBC, CBeebies and BBC News.

BBC iPlayer launched in 2008 as the first captioned video-on-demand service from a major broadcaster with levels of captioning comparable to those provided on its broadcast channels.

=== Legislative development in the U.S. ===
Until the passage of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, television captioning was performed by a set-top box manufactured by Sanyo Electric and marketed by the National Captioning Institute (NCI). (At that time a set-top decoder cost about as much as a TV set itself, approximately $200.) Through discussions with the manufacturer it was established that the appropriate circuitry integrated into the television set would be less expensive than the stand-alone box, and Ronald May, then a Sanyo employee, provided the expert witness testimony on behalf of Sanyo and Gallaudet University in support of the passage of the bill. On January 23, 1991, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 was passed by Congress. This Act gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) power to enact rules on the implementation of closed captioning. This Act required all analog television receivers with screens of at least 13 inches or greater, either sold or manufactured, to have the ability to display closed captioning by July 1, 1993.

Also, in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed to ensure equal opportunity for persons with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in public accommodations or commercial facilities. Title III of the ADA requires that public facilities—such as hospitals, bars, shopping centers and museums (but not movie theaters)—provide access to verbal information on televisions, films and slide shows.

The Federal Communications Commission requires all providers of programs to caption material which has audio in English or Spanish, with certain exceptions specified in Section 79.1(d) of the commission&#x27;s rules. These exceptions apply to new networks; programs in languages other than English or Spanish; networks having to spend over 2% of income on captioning; networks having less than US$3,000,000 in revenue; and certain local programs; among other exceptions. Those who are not covered by the exceptions may apply for a hardship waiver.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded on the Decoder Circuitry Act to place the same requirements on digital television receivers by July 1, 2002. All TV programming distributors in the U.S. are required to provide closed captions for Spanish-language video programming as of January 1, 2010.

A bill, H.R. 3101, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, was passed by the United States House of Representatives in July 2010. A similar bill, S. 3304, with the same name, was passed by the United States Senate on August 5, 2010 and by the House of Representatives on September 28, 2010, and was signed by President Barack Obama on October 8, 2010. The Act requires, in part, any ATSC-decoding set-top box remote to have a button to turn the closed captioning in the output signal on or off. It also requires broadcasters to provide captioning for television programs redistributed on the Internet.

On February 20, 2014, the FCC unanimously approved the implementation of quality standards for closed captioning, addressing accuracy, timing, completeness, and placement. This is the first time the FCC has addressed quality issues in captions.

In 2015, a law was passed in Hawaii requiring two screenings a week of each movie with captions on the screen. In 2022 a law took effect in New York City requiring movie theaters to offer captions on the screen for up to four showtimes per movie each week, including weekends and Friday nights.

Some state and local governments (including Boston, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Rochester, New York; and the State of Washington) require closed captioning to be activated on TVs in public places at all times, even if no one has requested it.

===Philippines===
As amended by RA 10905, all TV networks in the Philippines are required to provide closed captions. As of 2018, the three major TV networks in the country are currently testing the closed captioning system on their transmissions. ABS-CBN added closed captions in their daily &quot;3 O&#x27;Clock Habit&quot; in the afternoon. TV5 started implementing closed captions on their live noon and nightly news programs. GMA once broadcast news programs with closed captions but since stopped. Only select Korean drama and local or foreign movies, &quot; Drew&quot; (English title &quot;Drew&#x27;s Travel Adventure&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (English title &quot;Kitchen Idol&quot;) are broadcast with proper closed captioning.

Since 2016 all Filipino-language films, as well as some streaming services, like iWant, have included English subtitles in some showings. The law regarding this was proposed by Gerald Anthony Gullas Jr., a lawmaker from Cebu City, who had implemented the regulations on standardizing both official languages of the Philippines, as the people had not mastered English vocabulary.

=== Legislative development in Australia ===
The government of Australia provided seed funding in 1981 for the establishment of the Australian Caption Centre (ACC) and the purchase of equipment. Captioning by the ACC commenced in 1982 and a further grant from the Australian government enabled the ACC to achieve and maintain financial self-sufficiency. The ACC, now known as Media Access Australia, sold its commercial captioning division to Red Bee Media in December 2005. Red Bee Media continues to provide captioning services in Australia today.

=== Funding development in New Zealand ===
In 1981, TVNZ held a telethon to raise funds for Teletext-encoding equipment used for the creation and editing of text-based broadcast services for the deaf. The service came into use in 1984 with caption creation and importing paid for as part of the public broadcasting fee until the creation of the NZ On Air taxpayer fund, which is used to provide captioning for NZ On Air content and TVNZ news shows and for conversion of EIA-608 US captions to the preferred EBU STL format for only TVNZ 1, TV 2 and TV 3 with archived captions available to FOUR and select Sky programming. During the second half of 2012, TV3 and FOUR began providing non-Teletext DVB image-based captions on their HD service and used the same format on the satellite service, which has since caused major timing issues in relation to server load and the loss of captions from most SD DVB-S receivers, such as the ones Sky Television provides their customers. As of April 2, 2013, only the Teletext page 801 caption service will remain in use with the informational Teletext non-caption content being discontinued.

== Application ==
Closed captions were created for deaf and hard of hearing individuals to assist in comprehension. They can also be used as a tool by those learning to read, or those learning to speak a non-native language, or in environments where the audio is difficult to hear or is intentionally muted. Captions can also be used by viewers who simply wish to read a transcript along with the program audio.

In the United States, the National Captioning Institute noted that English as a foreign or second language (ESL) learners were the largest group buying decoders in the late 1980s and early 1990s before built-in decoders became a standard feature of US television sets. This suggested that the largest audience of closed captioning was people whose native language was not English. In the United Kingdom, of 7.5 million people using TV subtitles (closed captioning), 6 million have no hearing impairment.

Closed captions are also used in public environments, such as bars and restaurants, where patrons may not be able to hear over the background noise, or where multiple televisions are displaying different programs. In addition, online videos may be treated through digital processing of their audio content by various robotic algorithms (robots). Multiple chains of errors are the result. When a video is truly and accurately transcribed, then the closed-captioning publication serves a useful purpose, and the content is available for search engines to index and make available to users on the Internet.

Some television sets can be set to automatically turn captioning on when the volume is muted.

== Television and video ==
For live programs, spoken words comprising the television program&#x27;s soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype- or stenomask-type machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text by a computer and displayed on the screen. This technique was developed in the 1970s as an initiative of the BBC&#x27;s Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed &quot;dictionaries.&quot;

In some cases, the transcript is available beforehand, and captions are simply displayed during the program after being edited. For programs that have a mix of prepared and live content, such as news bulletins, a combination of techniques is used.

For prerecorded programs, commercials, and home videos, audio is transcribed and captions are prepared, positioned, and timed in advance.

For all types of NTSC programming, captions are encoded into line 21 of the vertical blanking intervala part of the TV picture that sits just above the visible portion and is usually unseen. For ATSC (digital television) programming, three streams are encoded in the video: two are backward compatible &quot;line 21&quot; captions, and the third is a set of up to 63 additional caption streams encoded in EIA-708 format.

Captioning is modulated and stored differently in PAL and SECAM countries (625 lines, 50 fields per second), where teletext is used rather than in EIA-608, but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home Beta and VHS videotapes, a shift down of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only a small minority of European PAL VHS machines support this (or any) format for closed caption recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can not be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional S-VHS recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low signal-to-noise ratio, especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions were stored on floppy disk, separate from the analogue master tape. DVDs have their own system for subtitles and captions, which are digitally inserted in the data stream and decoded on playback into video.

For older televisions, a set-top box or other decoder is usually required. In the US, since the passage of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, manufacturers of most television receivers sold have been required to include closed captioning display capability. High-definition TV sets, receivers, and tuner cards are also covered, though the technical specifications are different (high-definition display screens, as opposed to high-definition TVs, may lack captioning). Canada has no similar law but receives the same sets as the US in most cases.

During transmission, single byte errors can be replaced by a white space which can appear at the beginning of the program. More byte errors during EIA-608 transmission can affect the screen momentarily, by defaulting to a real-time mode such as the &quot;roll up&quot; style, type random letters on screen, and then revert to normal. Uncorrectable byte errors within the teletext page header will cause whole captions to be dropped. EIA-608, due to using only two characters per video frame, sends these captions ahead of time storing them in a second buffer awaiting a command to display them; Teletext sends these in real-time.

The use of capitalization varies among caption providers. Most caption providers capitalize all words while others such as WGBH and non-US providers prefer to use mixed-case letters.

There are two main styles of line 21 closed captioning:
* Roll-up or scroll-up or paint-on or scrolling: Real-time words sent in paint-on or scrolling mode appear from left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole line scrolls up to make way for a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn&#x27;t available. This method is signaled on EIA-608 by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.
* Pop-on or pop-up or block: A caption appears on any of the 14 screen rows as a complete sentence, which can be followed by additional captions. This method is used when captions come from an intermediary file (such as the Scenarist or EBU STL file formats) for pre-taped television and film programming, commonly produced at captioning facilities. This method of captioning can be aided by digital scripts or voice recognition software, and if used for live events, would require a video delay to avoid a large delay in the captions&#x27; appearance on-screen, which occurs with Teletext-encoded live subtitles.

==== Syntax ====
For real-time captioning done outside of captioning facilities, the following syntax is used:
* &#x27;»&#x27; (two prefixed greater-than signs) indicates a change in single speaker.
** Sometimes appended with the speaker&#x27;s name in alternate case, followed by a colon.
* &#x27;»&gt;&#x27; (three prefixed greater-than signs) indicates a change in news story or multiple speakers.

Styles of syntax that are used by various captioning producers:
* Capitals indicate main on-screen dialogue and the name of the speaker.
** Legacy EIA-608 home caption decoder fonts had no descenders on lowercase letters.
** Outside North America, capitals with background coloration indicate a song title or sound effect description.
** Outside North America, capitals with black or no background coloration indicates when a word is stressed or emphasized.
* Descenders indicate background sound description and off-screen dialogue.
** Most modern caption producers, such as WGBH-TV, use mixed case for both on-screen and off-screen dialogue.
* &#x27;-&#x27; (a prefixed dash) indicates a change in single speaker (used by National Captioning Institute or CaptionMax).
* Words in italics indicate when a word is stressed or emphasized and when real world names are quoted.
** Italics and bold type are only supported by EIA-608.
** Some North American providers use this for narrated dialogue.
** Some providers use this for off-screen dialogue.
** Italics are also applied when a word is spoken in a foreign language.
* Text coloration indicates captioning credits and sponsorship.
** Used by music videos in the past, but generally has declined due to system incompatibilities.
** In Ceefax/Teletext countries, it indicates a change in single speaker in place of &#x27;»&#x27;.
** Some Teletext countries use coloration to indicate when a word is stressed or emphasized.
** Coloration is limited to white, green, blue, cyan, red, yellow and magenta.
** UK order of use for text is white, green, cyan, yellow; and backgrounds is black, red, blue, magenta, white.
** US order of use for text is white, yellow, cyan, green; and backgrounds is black, blue, red, magenta, white.
* Square brackets or parentheses indicate a song title or sound effect description.
* Parentheses indicate speaker&#x27;s vocal pitch e.g., (man), (woman), (boy) or (girl).
** Outside North America, parentheses indicate a silent on-screen action.
* A pair of eighth notes is used to bracket a line of lyrics to indicate singing.
** A pair of eighth notes on a line of no text are used during a section of instrumental music or even voice tones playing with the music.
** Outside North America, a single number sign is used on a line of lyrics to indicate singing or may just instead use the eighth notes without the lyrics playing.
** An additional musical notation character is appended to the end of the last line of lyrics to indicate the song&#x27;s end.
** As the symbol is unsupported by Ceefax/Teletext, a number sign - which resembles a musical sharp - is substituted.

==== Technical aspects ====
There were many shortcomings in the original Line 21 specification from a typographic standpoint, since, for example, it lacked many of the characters required for captioning in languages other than English. Since that time, the core Line 21 character set has been expanded to include quite a few more characters, handling most requirements for languages common in North and South America such as French, Spanish, and Portuguese, though those extended characters are not required in all decoders and are thus unreliable in everyday use. The problem has been almost eliminated with a market specific full set of Western European characters and a private adopted Norpak extension for South Korean and Japanese markets. The full EIA-708 standard for digital television has worldwide character set support, but there has been little use of it due to EBU Teletext dominating DVB countries, which has its own extended character sets.

Captions are often edited to make them easier to read and to reduce the amount of text displayed onscreen. This editing can be very minor, with only a few occasional unimportant missed lines, to severe, where virtually every line spoken by the actors is condensed. The measure used to guide this editing is words per minute, commonly varying from 180 to 300, depending on the type of program. Offensive words are also captioned, but if the program is censored for TV broadcast, the broadcaster might not have arranged for the captioning to be edited or censored also. The &quot;TV Guardian&quot;, a television set-top box, is available to parents who wish to censor offensive language of programs—the video signal is fed into the box and if it detects an offensive word in the captioning, the audio signal is bleeped or muted for that period of time.

=== Caption channels ===

The Line 21 data stream can consist of data from several data channels multiplexed together. Odd field 1 can have four data channels: two separate synchronized captions (CC1, CC2) with caption-related text, such as website URLs (T1, T2). Even field 2 can have five additional data channels: two separate synchronized captions (CC3, CC4) with caption related text (T3, T4), and Extended Data Services (XDS) for Now/Next EPG details. XDS data structure is defined in CEA-608.

As CC1 and CC2 share bandwidth, if there is a lot of data in CC1, there will be little room for CC2 data and is generally only used for the primary audio captions. Similarly, CC3 and CC4 share the second even field of line 21. Since some early caption decoders supported only single field decoding of CC1 and CC2, captions for SAP in a second language were often placed in CC2. This led to bandwidth problems, and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommendation is that bilingual programming should have the second caption language in CC3. Many Spanish television networks such as Univision and Telemundo, for example, provides English subtitles for many of its Spanish programs in CC3. Canadian broadcasters use CC3 for French translated SAPs, which is also a similar practice in South Korea and Japan.

Ceefax and Teletext can have a larger number of captions for other languages due to the use of multiple VBI lines. However, only European countries used a second subtitle page for second language audio tracks where either the NICAM dual mono or Zweikanalton were used.

== Digital television interoperability issues ==
The US ATSC digital television system originally specified two different kinds of &quot;closed captioning&quot; datastream standards: the original analog-compatible (available by Line 21) and the more modern digital-only CEA-708 formats are delivered within the video stream. The US FCC mandates that broadcasters deliver (and generate, if necessary) both datastream formats with the CEA-708 format merely a conversion of the Line 21 format. The Canadian CRTC has not mandated that broadcasters either broadcast both datastream formats or exclusively in one format. Most broadcasters and networks to avoid large conversion cost outlays just provide EIA-608 captions along with a transcoded CEA-708 version encapsulated within CEA-708 packets.

=== Incompatibility issues with digital TV ===
Many viewers find that when they acquire a digital television or set-top box they are unable to view closed caption (CC) information, even though the broadcaster is sending it and the TV is able to display it.

Originally, CC information was included in the picture (&quot;line 21&quot;) via a composite video input, but there is no equivalent capability in digital video interconnects (such as DVI and HDMI) between the display and a &quot;source&quot;. A &quot;source&quot;, in this case, can be a DVD player or a terrestrial or cable digital television receiver. When CC information is encoded in the MPEG-2 data stream, only the device that decodes the MPEG-2 data (a source) has access to the &quot;closed caption&quot; information; there is no standard for transmitting the CC information to a display monitor separately. Thus, if there is CC information, the source device needs to overlay the CC information on the picture prior to transmitting to the display over the interconnect&#x27;s video output.

The responsibility of decoding the CC information and overlaying onto the visible video image has been taken away from the TV display and put into the &quot;source&quot; of DVI and HDMI digital video interconnects. Because the TV handles &quot;mute&quot; and, when using DVI and HDMI, a different device handles turning on and off CC, this means the &quot;captions come on automatically when the TV is muted&quot; feature no longer works. That source device—such as a DVD player or set-top box—must &quot;burn&quot; the image of the CC text into the picture data carried by the HDMI or DVI cable; there&#x27;s no other way for the CC text to be carried over the HDMI or DVI cable.

Many source devices do not have the ability to overlay CC information, for controlling the CC overlay can be complicated. For example, the Motorola DCT-5xxx and -6xxx cable set-top receivers have the ability to decode CC information located on the MPEG-2 stream and overlay it on the picture, but turning CC on and off requires turning off the unit and going into a special setup menu (it is not on the standard configuration menu and it cannot be controlled using the remote). Historically, DVD players, VCRs and set-top tuners did not need to do this overlaying, since they simply passed this information on to the TV, and they are not mandated to perform this overlaying.

Many modern digital television receivers can be directly connected to cables, but often cannot receive scrambled channels that the user is paying for. Thus, the lack of a standard way of sending CC information between components, along with the lack of a mandate to add this information to a picture, results in CC being unavailable to many hard-of-hearing and deaf users.

The EBU Ceefax-based teletext systems are the source for closed captioning signals, thus when teletext is embedded into DVB-T or DVB-S the closed captioning signal is included. However, for DVB-T and DVB-S, it is not necessary for a teletext page signal to also be present (ITV1, for example, does not carry analogue teletext signals on Sky Digital, but does carry the embedded version, accessible from the &quot;Services&quot; menu of the receiver, or more recently by turning them off/on from a mini menu accessible from the &quot;help&quot; button).

The BBC&#x27;s Subtitle (Captioning) Editorial Guidelines were born out of the capabilities of Teletext but are now used by multiple European broadcasters as the editorial and design best practice guide 

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, captions use an EBU Ceefax-based teletext system on DVB broadcasts via satellite and cable television with the exception of MediaWorks New Zealand channels who completely switched to DVB RLE subtitles in 2012 on both Freeview satellite and UHF broadcasts, this decision was made based on the TVNZ practice of using this format on only DVB UHF broadcasts (aka Freeview HD). This made composite video connected TVs incapable of decoding the captions on their own. Also, these pre-rendered subtitles use classic caption style opaque backgrounds with an overly large font size and obscure the picture more than the more modern, partially transparent backgrounds.

=== Digital television standard captioning improvements ===
The CEA-708 specification provides for dramatically improved &quot;captioning&quot;
* An enhanced character set with more accented letters and non-Latin letters, and more special symbols
* Viewer-adjustable text size (called the &quot;caption volume control&quot; in the specification), allowing individuals to adjust their TVs to display small, normal, or large captions
* More text and background colors, including both transparent and translucent backgrounds to optionally replace the big black block
* More text styles, including edged or drop shadowed text rather than the letters on a solid background
* More text fonts, including monospaced and proportional spaced, serif and sans-serif, and some playful cursive fonts
* Higher bandwidth, to allow more data per minute of video
* More language channels, to allow the encoding of more independent caption streams
As of 2009, most closed captioning for digital television environments is done using tools designed for analog captioning (working to the CEA-608 NTSC specification rather than the CEA-708 ATSC specification). The captions are then run through transcoders made by companies like EEG Enterprises or Evertz, which convert the analog Line 21 caption format to the digital format. This means that none of the CEA-708 features are used unless they were also contained in CEA-608.

== Uses in other media ==
=== DVDs and Blu-ray Discs ===
NTSC DVDs may carry closed captions in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams inside of the Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV&#x27;s built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on S-Video or component video outputs due to the lack of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning &quot;will&quot; be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple&#x27;s DVD Player does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.

In addition to Line 21 closed captions, video DVDs may also carry subtitles, which generally rendered from the EIA-608 captions as a bitmap overlay that can be turned on and off via a set top DVD player or DVD player software, just like the textual captions. This type of captioning is usually carried in a subtitle track labeled either &quot;English for the hearing impaired&quot; or, more recently, &quot;SDH&quot; (subtitled for the deaf and Hard of hearing). Many popular Hollywood DVD-Videos can carry both subtitles and closed captions (e.g. &quot;Stepmom&quot; DVD by Columbia Pictures). On some DVDs, the Line 21 captions may contain the same text as the subtitles; on others, only the Line 21 captions include the additional non-speech information (even sometimes song lyrics) needed for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. European Region 2 DVDs do not carry Line 21 captions, and instead list the subtitle languages available-English is often listed twice, one as the representation of the dialogue alone, and a second subtitle set which carries additional information for the deaf and hard-of-hearing audience. (Many deaf/ subtitle files on DVDs are reworkings of original teletext subtitle files.)

Blu-ray media typically cannot carry any VBI data such as Line 21 closed captioning due to the design of DVI-based High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) specifications that was only extended for synchronized digital audio replacing older analog standards, such as VGA, S-Video, component video, and SCART. However, a few early titles from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment carried Line 21 closed captions that are output when using the analog outputs (typically composite video) of a few Blu-ray players. Both Blu-ray and DVD can use either PNG bitmap subtitles or &#x27;advanced subtitles&#x27; to carry SDH type subtitling, the latter being an XML-based textual format which includes font, styling and positioning information as well as a unicode representation of the text. Advanced subtitling can also include additional media accessibility features such as &quot;descriptive audio&quot;.

=== Movies ===
There are several competing technologies used to provide captioning for movies in theaters. Cinema captioning falls into the categories of open and closed. The definition of &quot;closed&quot; captioning in this context is different from television, as it refers to any technology that allows as few as one member of the audience to view the captions.

Open captioning in a film theater can be accomplished through burned-in captions, projected text or bitmaps, or (rarely) a display located above or below the movie screen. Typically, this display is a large LED sign. In a digital theater, open caption display capability is built into the digital projector. Closed caption capability is also available, with the ability for 3rd-party closed caption devices to plug into the digital cinema server.

Probably the best known closed captioning option for film theaters is the Rear Window Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted in front of the viewer&#x27;s seat. In the back of the theater is an LED display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.

For film projection systems, Digital Theater Systems, the company behind the DTS surround sound standard, has created a digital captioning device called the DTS-CSS (Cinema Subtitling System). It is a combination of a laser projector which places the captioning (words, sounds) anywhere on the screen and a thin playback device with a CD that holds many languages. If the Rear Window Captioning System is used, the DTS-CSS player is also required for sending caption text to the Rear Window sign located in the rear of the theater.

Special effort has been made to build accessibility features into digital projection systems (see digital cinema). Through SMPTE, standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged with the rest of the digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. SMPTE has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging that will work with any standards-compliant digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer&#x27;s eyes. Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to SMPTE DCP, the standardized packaging method for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.

=== Sports venues ===
Captioning systems have also been adopted by most major league and high-profile college stadiums and arenas, typically through dedicated portions of their main scoreboards or as part of balcony fascia LED boards. These screens display captions of the public address announcer and other spoken content, such as those contained within in-game segments, public service announcements, and lyrics of songs played in-stadium. In some facilities, these systems were added as a result of discrimination lawsuits. Following a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act, FedExField added caption screens in 2006. Some stadiums utilize on-site captioners while others outsource them to external providers who caption remotely.

=== Video games ===
The infrequent appearance of closed captioning in video games became a problem in the 1990s as games began to commonly feature voice tracks, which in some cases contained information which the player needed in order to know how to progress in the game. Closed captioning of video games is becoming more common. One of the first video game companies to feature closed captioning was Bethesda Softworks in their 1990 release of &quot;Hockey League Simulator&quot; and &quot;The Terminator 2029&quot;. Infocom also offered &quot;Zork Grand Inquisitor&quot; in 1997. Many games since then have at least offered subtitles for spoken dialog during cutscenes, and many include significant in-game dialog and sound effects in the captions as well; for example, with subtitles turned on in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series of stealth games, not only are subtitles available during cut scenes, but any dialog spoken during real-time gameplay will be captioned as well, allowing players who can&#x27;t hear the dialog to know what enemy guards are saying and when the main character has been detected. Also, in many of developer Valve&#x27;s video games (such as &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; or &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;), when closed captions are activated, dialog and nearly all sound effects either made by the player or from other sources (e.g. gunfire, explosions) will be captioned.

Video games don&#x27;t offer Line 21 captioning, decoded and displayed by the television itself but rather a built-in subtitle display, more akin to that of a DVD. The game systems themselves have no role in the captioning either; each game must have its subtitle display programmed individually.

Reid Kimball, a game designer who is hearing impaired, is attempting to educate game developers about closed captioning for games. Reid started the Games[CC] group to closed caption games and serve as a research and development team to aid the industry. Kimball designed the Dynamic Closed Captioning system, writes articles and speaks at developer conferences. Games[CC]&#x27;s first closed captioning project called Doom3[CC] was nominated for an award as Best Doom3 Mod of the Year for IGDA&#x27;s Choice Awards 2006 show.

=== Online video streaming ===
Internet video streaming service YouTube offers captioning services in videos. The author of the video can upload a SubViewer (*.SUB), SubRip (*.SRT) or *.SBV file. As a beta feature, the site also added the ability to automatically transcribe and generate captioning on videos, with varying degrees of success based upon the content of the video. However, on August 30, 2020, the company announced that communal captions will end on September 28. The automatic captioning is often inaccurate on videos with background music or exaggerated emotion in speaking. Variations in volume can also result in nonsensical machine-generated captions. Additional problems arise with strong accents, sarcasm, differing contexts, or homonyms.

On June 30, 2010, YouTube announced a new &quot;YouTube Ready&quot; designation for professional caption vendors in the United States. The initial list included twelve companies who passed a caption quality evaluation administered by the Described and Captioned Media Project, have a website and a YouTube channel where customers can learn more about their services and have agreed to post rates for the range of services that they offer for YouTube content.

Flash video also supports captions using the Distribution Exchange profile (DFXP) of W3C timed text format. The latest Flash authoring software adds free player skins and caption components that enable viewers to turn captions on/off during playback from a web page. Previous versions of Flash relied on the Captionate 3rd party component and skin to caption Flash video. Custom Flash players designed in Flex can be tailored to support the timed-text exchange profile, Captionate .XML, or SAMI file (e.g. Hulu captioning). This is the preferred method for most US broadcast and cable networks that are mandated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to provide captioned on-demand content. The media encoding firms generally use software such as MacCaption to convert EIA-608 captions to this format. The Silverlight Media Framework also includes support for the timed-text exchange profile for both download and adaptive streaming media.

Windows Media Video can support closed captions for both video on demand streaming or live streaming scenarios. Typically, Windows Media captions support the SAMI file format but can also carry embedded closed caption data.

EBU-TT-D distribution format supports multiple players across multiple platforms.

QuickTime video supports raw EIA-608 caption data via proprietary closed caption track, which are just EIA-608 byte pairs wrapped in a QuickTime packet container with different IDs for both line 21 fields. These captions can be turned on and off and appear in the same style as TV closed captions, with all the standard formatting (pop-on, roll-up, paint-on), and can be positioned and split anywhere on the video screen. QuickTime closed caption tracks can be viewed in macOS or Windows versions of QuickTime Player, iTunes (via QuickTime), iPod Nano, iPod Classic, iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.

Typical modern browsers, such as Edge and Chrome, and/or typical modern operating systems, such as iOS 12+, Android 10+, Windows 10+, may manage the CC subtitle style.

=== Theatre ===
Live plays can be open captioned by a captioner who displays lines from the script and including non-speech elements on a large display screen near the stage. Software is also now available that automatically generates the captioning and streams the captioning to individuals sitting in the theater, with that captioning being viewed using heads-up glasses or on a smartphone or computer tablet.

Captioning on display screens or personal devices can be difficult to follow at the same time as the performance on stage. To solve this sproblem, Creative Captioning refers to the process of integrating captions into set design as part of the creative process. Creative Captions are a visible part of the show: the set designer/captioner match(es) the style of the captions to the atmosphere of the show through characteristics such as animation, color, font, and size.

=== Telephones ===
A captioned telephone is a telephone that displays real-time captions of the current conversation. The captions are typically displayed on a screen embedded into the telephone base.

=== Video conferencing ===
Some online video conferencing services, such as Google Meet, offer the ability to display captions in real time of the current conversation.

=== Media monitoring services ===
In the United States especially, most media monitoring services capture and index closed captioning text from news and public affairs programs, allowing them to search the text for client references. The use of closed captioning for television news monitoring was pioneered by Universal Press Clipping Bureau (Universal Information Services) in 1992, and later in 1993 by Tulsa-based NewsTrak of Oklahoma (later known as Broadcast News of Mid-America, acquired by video news release pioneer Medialink Worldwide Incorporated in 1997). US patent 7,009,657 describes a &quot;method and system for the automatic collection and conditioning of closed caption text originating from multiple geographic locations&quot; as used by news monitoring services.

=== Conversations ===
Software programs are available that automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations. Examples of such conversations include discussions in conference rooms, classroom lectures, or religious services.

=== Non-linear video editing systems and closed captioning ===
In 2010, Vegas Pro, the professional non-linear editor, was updated to support importing, editing, and delivering CEA-608 closed captions. Vegas Pro 10, released on October 11, 2010, added several enhancements to the closed captioning support. TV-like CEA-608 closed captioning can now be displayed as an overlay when played back in the Preview and Trimmer windows, making it easy to check placement, edits, and timing of CC information. CEA708 style Closed Captioning is automatically created when the CEA-608 data is created. Line 21 closed captioning is now supported, as well as HD-SDI closed captioning capture and print from AJA and Blackmagic Design cards. Line 21 support provides a workflow for existing legacy media. Other improvements include increased support for multiple closed captioning file types, as well as the ability to export closed caption data for DVD Architect, YouTube, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.

In mid-2009, Apple released Final Cut Pro version 7 and began support for inserting closed caption data into SD and HD tape masters via FireWire and compatible video capture cards. Up until this time, it was not possible for video editors to insert caption data with both CEA-608 and CEA-708 to their tape masters. The typical workflow included first printing the SD or HD video to a tape and sending it to a professional closed caption service company that had a stand-alone closed caption hardware encoder.

This new closed captioning workflow known as e-Captioning involves making a proxy video from the non-linear system to import into a third-party non-linear closed captioning software. Once the closed captioning software project is completed, it must export a closed caption file compatible with the non-linear editing system. In the case of Final Cut Pro 7, three different file formats can be accepted: a .SCC file (Scenarist Closed Caption file) for Standard Definition video, a QuickTime 608 closed caption track (a special 608 coded track in the .mov file wrapper) for standard-definition video, and finally a QuickTime 708 closed caption track (a special 708 coded track in the .mov file wrapper) for high-definition video output.

Alternatively, Matrox video systems devised another mechanism for inserting closed caption data by allowing the video editor to include CEA-608 and CEA-708 in a discrete audio channel on the video editing timeline. This allows real-time preview of the captions while editing and is compatible with Final Cut Pro 6 and 7.

Other non-linear editing systems indirectly support closed captioning only in Standard Definition line-21. Video files on the editing timeline must be composited with a line-21 VBI graphic layer known in the industry as a &quot;blackmovie&quot; with closed caption data. Alternately, video editors working with the DV25 and DV50 FireWire workflows must encode their DV .avi or .mov file with VAUX data which includes CEA-608 closed caption data.

== Logo ==
The current and most familiar logo for closed captioning consists of two Cs (for &quot;closed captioned&quot;) inside a television screen. It was created at WGBH. The other logo, trademarked by the National Captioning Institute, is that of a simple geometric rendering of a television set merged with the tail of a speech balloon; two such versions exist – one with a tail on the left, the other with a tail on the right.

<text>In control theory, a closed-loop transfer function is a mathematical function describing the net result of the effects of a feedback control loop on the input signal to the plant under control.

== Overview ==
The closed-loop transfer function is measured at the output. The output signal can be calculated from the closed-loop transfer function and the input signal. Signals may be waveforms, images, or other types of data streams.

An example of a closed-loop block diagram, from which a transfer function may be computed, is shown below:

The summing node and the &quot;G&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and &quot;H&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) blocks can all be combined into one block, which would have the following transfer function:

: formula_1

formula_2 is called the feed forward transfer function, formula_3 is called the feedback transfer function, and their product formula_4 is called the open-loop transfer function.

==Derivation==
We define an intermediate signal Z (also known as error signal) shown as follows:

Using this figure we write:

: formula_5

: formula_6

Now, plug the second equation into the first to eliminate Z(s):

:formula_7

Move all the terms with Y(s) to the left hand side, and keep the term with X(s) on the right hand side:

:formula_8

Therefore,

:formula_9

:formula_10

<text>In telecommunications, the term code conversion has the following meanings: 

1. Conversion of signals, or groups of signals, in one code into corresponding signals, or groups of signals, in another code. 

2. A process for converting a code of some predetermined bit structure, such as 5, 7, or 14 bits per character interval, to another code with the same or a different number of bits per character interval. 

In code conversion, alphabetical order is not significant.

<doc id="40893" wikidata="Q1778793" url="?curid=40893" title="Coherence length">
<text>In physics, coherence length is the propagation distance over which a coherent wave (e.g. an electromagnetic wave) maintains a specified degree of coherence. Wave interference is strong when the paths taken by all of the interfering waves differ by less than the coherence length. A wave with a longer coherence length is closer to a perfect sinusoidal wave. Coherence length is important in holography and telecommunications engineering.

This article focuses on the coherence of classical electromagnetic fields. In quantum mechanics, there is a mathematically analogous concept of the quantum coherence length of a wave function.

==Formulas==

In radio-band systems, the coherence length is approximated by

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the speed of light in vacuum, formula_3 is the refractive index of the medium, and formula_4 is the bandwidth of the source or formula_5 is the signal wavelength and formula_6 is the width of the range of wavelengths in the signal.

In optical communications and optical coherence tomography (OCT), assuming that the source has a Gaussian emission spectrum, the roundtrip coherence length formula_7 is given by 

:formula_8

where formula_5 is the central wavelength of the source, formula_10 is the group refractive index of the medium, and formula_11 is the (FWHM) spectral width of the source. If the source has a Gaussian spectrum with FWHM spectral width formula_12, then a path offset of formula_13 will reduce the fringe visibility to 50%. It is important to note that this is a roundtrip coherence length — this definition is applied in applications like OCT where the light traverses the measured displacement twice (as in a Michelson interferometer). In transmissive applications, such as with a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, the light traverses the displacement only once, and the coherence length is effectively doubled.

The coherence length can also be measured using a Michelson interferometer and is the optical path length difference of a self-interfering laser beam which corresponds to formula_14 fringe visibility, where the fringe visibility is defined as

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the fringe intensity.

In long-distance transmission systems, the coherence length may be reduced by propagation factors such as dispersion, scattering, and diffraction.

==Lasers==

Multimode helium–neon lasers have a typical coherence length on the order of centimeters, while the coherence length of longitudinally single-mode lasers can exceed 1 km. Semiconductor lasers can reach some 100 m, but small, inexpensive semiconductor lasers have shorter lengths, with one source claiming 20 cm. Singlemode fiber lasers with linewidths of a few kHz can have coherence lengths exceeding 100 km. Similar coherence lengths can be reached with optical frequency combs due to the narrow linewidth of each tooth. Non-zero visibility is present only for short intervals of pulses repeated after cavity length distances up to this long coherence length.

==Other light sources==
Tolansky&#x27;s &quot;An introduction to Interferometry&quot; has a chapter on sources which quotes a line width of around 0.052 angstroms for each of the Sodium D lines in an uncooled low-pressure sodium lamp, corresponding to a coherence length of around 67 mm for each line by itself. Cooling the low pressure sodium discharge to liquid nitrogen temperatures increases the individual D line coherence length by a factor of 6. A very narrow-band interference filter would be required to isolate an individual D line.

<text>For an electromagnetic wave, the coherence time is the time over which a propagating wave (especially a laser or maser beam) may be considered coherent, meaning that its phase is, on average, predictable.

In long-distance transmission systems, the coherence time may be reduced by propagation factors such as dispersion, scattering, and diffraction.

The coherence time, usually designated , is calculated by dividing the coherence length by the phase velocity of light in a medium; approximately given by
formula_1
where is the central wavelength of the source, and is the spectral width of the source in units of frequency and wavelength respectively, and is the speed of light in vacuum.

A single mode fiber laser has a linewidth of a few kHz, corresponding to a coherence time of a few hundred microseconds. Hydrogen masers have linewidth around 1 Hz, corresponding to a coherence time of about one second. Their coherence length approximately corresponds to the distance from the Earth to the Moon.

As of 2022, research groups worldwide have demonstrated superconducting qubits with coherence times up to several 100 μs.

<doc id="40897" wikidata="Q5147263" url="?curid=40897" title="Collinear antenna array">
<text>In telecommunications, a collinear antenna array (sometimes spelled colinear antenna array) is an array of dipole or quarter-wave antennas mounted in such a manner that the corresponding elements of each antenna are parallel and collinear; that is, they are located along a common axis. 

Collinear arrays are high gain omnidirectional antennas. Both dipoles and quarter-wavelength monopoles have an omnidirectional radiation pattern in free space when oriented vertically; they radiate equal radio power in all azimuthal directions perpendicular to the antenna, with the signal strength dropping to zero on the antenna axis. The purpose of stacking multiple antennas in a vertical collinear array is to increase the power radiated in horizontal directions and reduce the power radiated into the sky or down toward the earth, where it is wasted. They radiate vertically polarized radio waves. Theoretically, when stacking idealized lossless antennas in such a fashion, doubling their number will produce double the gain, with an increase of 3.01 dB. In practice, the gain realized will be below this due to imperfect radiation spread and losses.

Collinear arrays are frequently constructed as a stack of dipoles, but can also be constructed as a stack of phased quarter-wave antennas. In this configuration, the individual radiators within the array are often constructed of coaxial feedlines with the center conductor of one element being connected electrically to the shield of the one above, and so on in alternating phase for as many elements are specified by gain or overall length requirements. The final or &#x27;top&#x27; element in the stack is a quarter-wave radiator connected directly to the center conductor of the element below it. This style of collinear antenna is usually housed in a fiberglass radome, to provide both support and environmental protection to the relatively fragile coaxial elements.

A third type of collinear array, rarely seen outside amateur radio VHF/UHF applications, uses half-wavelength monopole elements with phasing coils between each consecutive pair of elements to achieve the necessary phase shift. This style tends to be less efficient due to coil losses, but has the advantage that it can be constructed with the elements supporting themselves, doing away with the need for a protective radome.

Collinear arrays are often used as the antennas for base stations for land mobile radio systems that communicate with mobile two-way radios in vehicles, such as police, fire, ambulance, and taxi dispatchers. They are also sometimes used for broadcasting..

<doc id="40898" wikidata="Q238053" url="?curid=40898" title="Collision">
<text>In physics, a collision is any event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other in a relatively short time. Although the most common use of the word &quot;collision&quot; refers to incidents in which two or more objects collide with great force, the scientific use of the term implies nothing about the magnitude of the force.

== Types of collisions ==

Collision is short-duration interaction between two bodies or more than two bodies simultaneously causing change in motion of bodies involved due to internal forces acted between them during this. Collisions involve forces (there is a change in velocity). The magnitude of the velocity difference just before impact is called the closing speed. All collisions conserve momentum. What distinguishes different types of collisions is whether they also conserve kinetic energy of the system before and after the collision. Collisions are of two types:
#Elastic collision If all of the total kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. no energy is released as sound, heat, etc.), the collision is said to be &quot;perfectly elastic&quot;. Such a system is an idealization and cannot occur in reality, due to the second law of thermodynamics.
#Inelastic collision. If most or all of the total kinetic energy is lost (dissipated as heat, sound, etc. or absorbed by the objects themselves), the collision is said to be &quot;inelastic&quot;; such collisions involve objects coming to a full stop. An example of this is a baseball bat hitting a baseball - the kinetic energy of the bat is transferred to the ball, greatly increasing the ball&#x27;s velocity. The sound of the bat hitting the ball represents the loss of energy. A &quot;perfectly inelastic&quot; collision (also called a &quot;perfectly plastic&quot; collision) is a limiting case of inelastic collision in which the two bodies coalesce after impact. An example of such a collision is a car crash, as cars crumple inward when crashing, rather than bouncing off of each other. This is by design, for the safety of the occupants and bystanders should a crash occur - the frame of the car absorbs the energy of the crash instead. 

The degree to which a collision is elastic or inelastic is quantified by the coefficient of restitution, a value that generally ranges between zero and one. A perfectly elastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of one; a perfectly inelastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of zero. The line of impact is the line that is collinear to the common normal of the surfaces that are closest or in contact during impact. This is the line along which internal force of collision acts during impact, and Newton&#x27;s coefficient of restitution is defined only along this line. 

Collisions in ideal gases approach perfectly elastic collisions, as do scattering interactions of sub-atomic particles which are deflected by the electromagnetic force. Some large-scale interactions like the slingshot type gravitational interactions between satellites and planets are almost perfectly elastic.

==Examples==

===Billiards===
Collisions play an important role in cue sports. Because the collisions between billiard balls are nearly elastic, and the balls roll on a surface that produces low rolling friction, their behavior is often used to illustrate Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. After a zero-friction collision of a moving ball with a stationary one of equal mass, the angle between the directions of the two balls is 90 degrees. This is an important fact that professional billiards players take into account, although it assumes the ball is moving without any impact of friction across the table rather than rolling with friction.
Consider an elastic collision in two dimensions of any two masses &quot;m&quot;a and &quot;m&quot;b, with respective initial velocities va1 and vb1 where vb1 = 0, and final velocities va2 and vb2.
Conservation of momentum gives &quot;m&quot;ava1 = &quot;m&quot;ava2 + &quot;m&quot;bvb2.
Conservation of energy for an elastic collision gives (1/2)&quot;m&quot;a|va1|2 = (1/2)&quot;m&quot;a|va2|2 + (1/2)&quot;m&quot;b|vb2|2.
Now consider the case &quot;m&quot;a = &quot;m&quot;b: we obtain va1 = va2 + vb2 and |va1|2 = |va2|2 + |vb2|2.
Taking the dot product of each side of the former equation with itself, |va1|2 = va1•va1 = |va2|2 + |vb2|2 + 2va2•vb2. Comparing this with the latter equation gives va2•vb2 = 0, so they are perpendicular unless va2 is the zero vector (which occurs if and only if the collision is head-on).

===Perfect inelastic collision===
In a perfect inelastic collision, i.e., a zero coefficient of restitution, the colliding particles coalesce. Using conservation of momentum:
::formula_1
the final velocity is given by
::formula_2
The reduction of total kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy before the collision in a center of momentum frame with respect to the system of two particles, because in such a frame the kinetic energy after the collision is zero. In this frame most of the kinetic energy before the collision is that of the particle with the smaller mass. In another frame, in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy there may be a transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to the other; the fact that this depends on the frame shows how relative this is.
With time reversed we have the situation of two objects pushed away from each other, e.g. shooting a projectile, or a rocket applying thrust (compare the derivation of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation).

===Animal locomotion===
Collisions of an animal&#x27;s foot or paw with the underlying substrate are generally termed ground reaction forces. These collisions are inelastic, as kinetic energy is not conserved. An important research topic in prosthetics is quantifying the forces generated during the foot-ground collisions associated with both disabled and non-disabled gait. This quantification typically requires subjects to walk across a force platform (sometimes called a &quot;force plate&quot;) as well as detailed kinematic and dynamic (sometimes termed kinetic) analysis.

===Hypervelocity impacts===

Hypervelocity is very high velocity, approximately over 3,000 meters per second (11,000 km/h, 6,700 mph, 10,000 ft/s, or Mach 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to inertial stresses. Thus, metals and fluids behave alike under hypervelocity impact. An impact under extreme hypervelocity results in vaporization of the impactor and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500 m/s (5,600 mph, 9,000 km/h, 8,200 ft/s, or Mach 7.3). Meteorite craters are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.

<text>In telecommunications, a combat-net radio (CNR) is a radio operating in a network that (a) provides a half-duplex circuit and (b) uses either a single radio frequency or a discrete set of radio frequencies when in a frequency hopping mode.

CNRs are primarily used for push-to-talk-operated radio nets for command and control of combat, combat support, and combat service support operations among military ground, sea, and air forces.

In the United States, two military standards govern the use of combat net radios and the host applications that communicate over the network: MIL-STD-188-220 and MIL-STD-2045-47001. In addition to IETF RFCs governing UDP, TCP, and IPv4/IPv6, all seven layers of the OSI communications architecture are addressed. MIL-STD-2045-47001 covers layer 7 (application), while MIL-STD-188-220 covers layers 1 through 3 (physical, data link, and network).

<text>In telecommunications, a combined distribution frame (CDF) is a distribution frame that combines the functions of main and intermediate distribution frames and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks. 

The vertical blocks are used to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks are used to terminate inside plant equipment. This arrangement permits the association of any outside line with any desired terminal equipment. These connections are made either with twisted pair wire, normally referred to as jumper wire, or with optical fiber cables, normally referred to as jumper cables. 

In technical control facilities, the vertical side may be used to terminate equipment as well as outside lines. The horizontal side is then used for jackfields and battery terminations.

<text>In telecommunications, a common battery is a single electrical power source used to energize more than one circuit, electronic component, equipment, or system. 

A common battery is usually a string of electrolytic cells and is usually centrally located to the equipment that it serves. In many telecommunications applications, the common battery is at a nominal −48 VDC. A central office common battery in the battery room supplies power to operate all directly connected instruments. &quot;Common battery&quot; may include one or more power conversion devices to transform commercial power to direct current, with a rechargeable battery floating across the output. Common battery operation largely replaced local batteries in each telephone in the early 20th century. It consists of two ends that emit opposing positive and negative charges

<doc id="40909" wikidata="Q180256" url="?curid=40909" title="Booting">
<text>In computing, booting is the process of starting a computer as initiated via hardware such as a physical button on the computer or by a software command. After it is switched on, a computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU) has no software in its main memory, so some process must load software into memory before it can be executed. This may be done by hardware or firmware in the CPU, or by a separate processor in the computer system. On some systems a power-on reset (POR) does not initiate booting and the operator must initiate booting after POR completes. IBM uses the term Initial Program Load (IPL) on some product lines.

Restarting a computer also is called &quot;rebooting&quot;, which can be &quot;hard&quot;, e.g. after electrical power to the CPU is switched from off to on, or &quot;soft&quot;, where the power is not cut. On some systems, a soft boot may optionally clear RAM to zero. Both hard and soft booting can be initiated by hardware such as a button press or by a software command. Booting is complete when the operative runtime system, typically the operating system and some applications, is attained.

The process of returning a computer from a state of sleep (suspension) does not involve booting; however, restoring it from a state of hibernation does. Minimally, some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in read-only memory (ROM). All computing systems are state machines, and a reboot may be the only method to return to a designated zero-state from an unintended, locked state.

In addition to loading an operating system or stand-alone utility, the boot process can also load a storage dump program for diagnosing problems in an operating system.

&quot;Boot&quot; is short for &quot;bootstrap&quot; or &quot;bootstrap load&quot; and derives from the phrase &quot;to pull oneself up by one&#x27;s bootstraps&quot;. The usage calls attention to the requirement that, if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer, some mechanism must exist to load the initial software onto the computer. Early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem. The invention of ROM of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start-up program, stored in the boot ROM of the computer, that could not be erased. Growth in the capacity of ROM has allowed ever more elaborate start up procedures to be implemented.

== History ==

There are many different methods available to load a short initial program into a computer. These methods reach from simple, physical input to removable media that can hold more complex programs.

=== Pre integrated-circuit-ROM examples ===
==== Early computers ====
Early computers in the 1940s and 1950s were one-of-a-kind engineering efforts that could take weeks to program and program loading was one of many problems that had to be solved. An early computer, ENIAC, had no program stored in memory, but was set up for each problem by a configuration of interconnecting cables. Bootstrapping did not apply to ENIAC, whose hardware configuration was ready for solving problems as soon as power was applied.

The EDSAC system, the second stored-program computer to be built, used stepping switches to transfer a fixed program into memory when its start button was pressed. The program stored on this device, which David Wheeler completed in late 1948, loaded further instructions from punched tape and then executed them.

==== First commercial computers ====
The first programmable computers for commercial sale, such as the UNIVAC I and the IBM 701 included features to make their operation simpler. They typically included instructions that performed a complete input or output operation. The same hardware logic could be used to load the contents of a punch card (the most typical ones) or other input media, such as a magnetic drum or magnetic tape, that contained a bootstrap program by pressing a single button. This booting concept was called a variety of names for IBM computers of the 1950s and early 1960s, but IBM used the term &quot;Initial Program Load&quot; with the IBM 7030 Stretch and later used it for their mainframe lines, starting with the System/360 in 1964.

The IBM 701 computer (1952–1956) had a &quot;Load&quot; button that initiated reading of the first 36-bit word into main memory from a punched card in a card reader, a magnetic tape in a tape drive, or a magnetic drum unit, depending on the position of the Load Selector switch. The left 18-bit half-word was then executed as an instruction, which usually read additional words into memory. The loaded boot program was then executed, which, in turn, loaded a larger program from that medium into memory without further help from the human operator. The IBM 704, IBM 7090, and IBM 7094 had similar mechanisms, but with different load buttons for different devices. The term &quot;boot&quot; has been used in this sense since at least 1958.
Other IBM computers of that era had similar features. For example, the IBM 1401 system (c. 1958) used a card reader to load a program from a punched card. The 80 characters stored in the punched card were read into memory locations 001 to 080, then the computer would branch to memory location 001 to read its first stored instruction. This instruction was always the same: move the information in these first 80 memory locations to an assembly area where the information in punched cards 2, 3, 4, and so on, could be combined to form the stored program. Once this information was moved to the assembly area, the machine would branch to an instruction in location 080 (read a card) and the next card would be read and its information processed.

Another example was the IBM 650 (1953), a decimal machine, which had a group of ten 10-position switches on its operator panel which were addressable as a memory word (address 8000) and could be executed as an instruction. Thus setting the switches to 7004000400 and pressing the appropriate button would read the first card in the card reader into memory (op code 70), starting at address 400 and then jump to 400 to begin executing the program on that card. The IBM 7040 and 7044 have a similar mechanism, in which the Load button causes the instruction set up in the entry keys on the front panel is executed, and the channel that instruction sets up is given a command to transfer data to memory starting at address 00100; when that transfer finishes, the CPU jumps to address 00101.

IBM&#x27;s competitors also offered single button program load.
* The CDC 6600 (c. 1964) had a &quot;dead start&quot; panel with 144 toggle switches; the dead start switch entered 12 12-bit words from the toggle switches to the memory of &quot;peripheral processor&quot; (&quot;PP&quot;) 0 and initiated the load sequence by causing PP 0 to execute the code loaded into memory. PP 0 loaded the necessary code into its own memory and then initialized the other PPs.
* The GE 645 (c. 1965) had a &quot;SYSTEM BOOTLOAD&quot; button that, when pressed, caused one of the I/O controllers to load a 64-word program into memory from a diode read-only memory and deliver an interrupt to cause that program to start running.
* The first model of the PDP-10 had a &quot;READ IN&quot; button that, when pressed, reset the processor and started an I/O operation on a device specified by switches on the control panel, reading in a 36-bit word giving a target address and count for subsequent word reads; when the read completed, the processor started executing the code read in by jumping to the last word read in.

A noteworthy variation of this is found on the Burroughs B1700 where there is neither a boot ROM nor a hardwired IPL operation. Instead, after the system is reset it reads and executes microinstructions sequentially from a cassette tape drive mounted on the front panel; this sets up a boot loader in RAM which is then executed. However, since this makes few assumptions about the system it can equally well be used to load diagnostic (Maintenance Test Routine) tapes which display an intelligible code on the front panel even in cases of gross CPU failure.

==== IBM System/360 and successors ====

In the IBM System/360 and its successors, including the current z/Architecture machines, the boot process is known as &quot;Initial Program Load&quot; (IPL).

IBM coined this term for the 7030 (Stretch), revived it for the design of the System/360, and continues to use it in those environments today. In the System/360 processors, an IPL is initiated by the computer operator by selecting the three hexadecimal digit device address (CUU; C=I/O Channel address, UU=Control unit and Device address) followed by pressing the &quot;LOAD&quot; button. On the high end System/360 models, most System/370 and some later systems, the functions of the switches and the LOAD button are simulated using selectable areas on the screen of a graphics console, often an IBM 2250-like device or an IBM 3270-like device. For example, on the System/370 Model 158, the keyboard sequence 0-7-X (zero, seven and X, in that order) results in an IPL from the device address, which was keyed into the input area. The Amdahl 470V/6 and related CPUs supported four hexadecimal digits on those CPUs which had the optional second channel unit installed, for a total of 32 channels. Later, IBM would also support more than 16 channels.

The IPL function in the System/360 and its successors prior to IBM Z, and its compatibles such as Amdahl&#x27;s, reads 24 bytes from an operator-specified device into main storage starting at real address zero. The second and third groups of eight bytes are treated as Channel Command Words (CCWs) to continue loading the startup program (the first CCW is always simulated by the CPU and consists of a Read IPL command, , with command chaining and suppress incorrect length indication being enforced). When the I/O channel commands are complete, the first group of eight bytes is then loaded into the processor&#x27;s Program Status Word (PSW) and the startup program begins execution at the location designated by that PSW. The IPL device is usually a disk drive, hence the special significance of the read-type command, but exactly the same procedure is also used to IPL from other input-type devices, such as tape drives, or even card readers, in a device-independent manner, allowing, for example, the installation of an operating system on a brand-new computer from an OS initial distribution magnetic tape. For disk controllers, the command also causes the selected device to seek to cylinder , head , simulating a Seek cylinder and head command, , and to search for record , simulating a Search ID Equal command, ; seeks and searches are not simulated by tape and card controllers, as for these device classes a Read IPL command is simply a sequential read command.

The disk, tape or card deck must contain a special program to load the actual operating system or standalone utility into main storage, and for this specific purpose &quot;IPL Text&quot; is placed on the disk by the stand-alone DASDI (Direct Access Storage Device Initialization) program or an equivalent program running under an operating system, e.g., ICKDSF, but IPL-able tapes and card decks are usually distributed with this &quot;IPL Text&quot; already present.

IBM introduced some evolutionary changes in the IPL process, changing some details for System/370 Extended Architecture (S/370-XA) and later, and adding a new type of IPL for z/Architecture.

==== Minicomputers ====
Minicomputers, starting with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-5 and PDP-8 (1965) simplified design by using the CPU to assist input and output operations. This saved cost but made booting more complicated than pressing a single button. Minicomputers typically had some way to &quot;toggle in&quot; short programs by manipulating an array of switches on the front panel. Since the early minicomputers used magnetic-core memory, which did not lose its information when power was off, these bootstrap loaders would remain in place unless they were erased. Erasure sometimes happened accidentally when a program bug caused a loop that overwrote all of memory.

Other minicomputers with such simple form of booting include Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP 2100 series (mid-1960s), the original Data General Nova (1969), and DEC&#x27;s PDP-4 (1962) and PDP-11 (1970).

As the I/O operations needed to cause a read operation on a minicomputer I/O device were typically different for different device controllers, different bootstrap programs were needed for different devices.

DEC later added, in 1971, an optional diode matrix read-only memory for the PDP-11 that stored a bootstrap program of up to 32 words (64 bytes). It consisted of a printed circuit card, the M792, that plugged into the Unibus and held a 32 by 16 array of semiconductor diodes. With all 512 diodes in place, the memory contained all &quot;one&quot; bits; the card was programmed by cutting off each diode whose bit was to be &quot;zero&quot;. DEC also sold versions of the card, the BM792-Yx series, pre-programmed for many standard input devices by simply omitting the unneeded diodes.

Following the older approach, the earlier PDP-1 has a hardware loader, such that an operator need only push the &quot;load&quot; switch to instruct the paper tape reader to load a program directly into core memory. The PDP-7, PDP-9, and PDP-15 successors to the PDP-4 have an added Read-In button to read a program in from paper tape and jump to it. The Data General Supernova used front panel switches to cause the computer to automatically load instructions into memory from a device specified by the front panel&#x27;s data switches, and then jump to loaded code.

===== Early minicomputer boot loader examples =====
In a minicomputer with a paper tape reader, the first program to run in the boot process, the boot loader, would read into core memory either the second-stage boot loader (often called a &quot;Binary Loader&quot;) that could read paper tape with checksum or the operating system from an outside storage medium. Pseudocode for the boot loader might be as simple as the following eight instructions:

# Set the P register to 9
# Check paper tape reader ready
# If not ready, jump to 2
# Read a byte from paper tape reader to accumulator
# Store accumulator to address in P register
# If end of tape, jump to 9
# Increment the P register
# Jump to 2

A related example is based on a loader for a Nicolet Instrument Corporation minicomputer of the 1970s, using the paper tape reader-punch unit on a Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter. The bytes of its second-stage loader are read from paper tape in reverse order.

# Set the P register to 106
# Check paper tape reader ready
# If not ready, jump to 2
# Read a byte from paper tape reader to accumulator
# Store accumulator to address in P register
# Decrement the P register
# Jump to 2

The length of the second stage loader is such that the final byte overwrites location 7. After the instruction in location 6 executes, location 7 starts the second stage loader executing. The second stage loader then waits for the much longer tape containing the operating system to be placed in the tape reader. The difference between the boot loader and second stage loader is the addition of checking code to trap paper tape read errors, a frequent occurrence with relatively low-cost, &quot;part-time-duty&quot; hardware, such as the Teletype Model 33 ASR. (Friden Flexowriters were far more reliable, but also comparatively costly.)

==== Booting the first microcomputers ====
The earliest microcomputers, such as the Altair 8800 (released first in 1975) and an even earlier, similar machine (based on the Intel 8008 CPU) had no bootstrapping hardware as such. When powered-up, the CPU would see memory that would contain random data. The front panels of these machines carried toggle switches for entering addresses and data, one switch per bit of the computer memory word and address bus. Simple additions to the hardware permitted one memory location at a time to be loaded from those switches to store bootstrap code. Meanwhile, the CPU was kept from attempting to execute memory content. Once correctly loaded, the CPU was enabled to execute the bootstrapping code. This process, similar to that used for several earlier minicomputers, was tedious and had to be error-free.

=== Integrated circuit read-only memory era ===
The introduction of integrated circuit read-only memory (ROM), with its many variants, including mask-programmed ROMs, programmable ROMs (PROM), erasable programmable ROMs (EPROM), and flash memory, reduced the physical size and cost of ROM. This allowed firmware boot programs to be included as part of the computer.

====Minicomputers====
The Data General Nova 1200 (1970) and Nova 800 (1971) had a program load switch that, in combination with options that provided two ROM chips, loaded a program into main memory from those ROM chips and jumped to it. Digital Equipment Corporation introduced the integrated-circuit-ROM-based BM873 (1974), M9301 (1977), M9312 (1978), REV11-A and REV11-C, MRV11-C, and MRV11-D ROM memories, all usable as bootstrap ROMs. The PDP-11/34 (1976), PDP-11/60 (1977), PDP-11/24 (1979), and most later models include boot ROM modules.

An Italian telephone switching computer, called &quot;Gruppi Speciali&quot;, patented in 1975 by Alberto Ciaramella, a researcher at CSELT, included an (external) ROM. Gruppi Speciali was, starting from 1975, a fully single-button machine booting into the operating system from a ROM memory composed from semiconductors, not from ferrite cores. Although the ROM device was not natively embedded in the computer of Gruppi Speciali, due to the design of the machine, it also allowed the single-button ROM booting in machines not designed for that (therefore, this &quot;bootstrap device&quot; was architecture-independent), e.g. the PDP-11. Storing the state of the machine after the switch-off was also in place, which was another critical feature in the telephone switching contest.

Some minicomputers and superminicomputers include a separate console processor that bootstraps the main processor. The PDP-11/44 had an Intel 8085 as a console processor; the VAX-11/780, the first member of Digital&#x27;s VAX line of 32-bit superminicomputers, had an LSI-11-based console processor, and the VAX-11/730 had an 8085-based console processor. These console processors could boot the main processor from various storage devices.

Some other superminicomputers, such as the VAX-11/750, implement console functions, including the first stage of booting, in CPU microcode.

====Microprocessors and microcomputers====
Typically, a microprocessor will, after a reset or power-on condition, perform a start-up process that usually takes the form of &quot;begin execution of the code that is found starting at a specific address&quot; or &quot;look for a multibyte code at a specific address and jump to the indicated location to begin execution&quot;. A system built using that microprocessor will have the permanent ROM occupying these special locations so that the system always begins operating without operator assistance. For example, Intel x86 processors always start by running the instructions beginning at F000:FFF0, while for the MOS 6502 processor, initialization begins by reading a two-byte vector address at $FFFD (MS byte) and $FFFC (LS byte) and jumping to that location to run the bootstrap code.

Apple Computer&#x27;s first computer, the Apple 1 introduced in 1976, featured PROM chips that eliminated the need for a front panel for the boot process (as was the case with the Altair 8800) in a commercial computer. According to Apple&#x27;s ad announcing it &quot;No More Switches, No More Lights ... the firmware in PROMS enables you to enter, display and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard.&quot;

Due to the expense of read-only memory at the time, the Apple II booted its disk operating systems using a series of very small incremental steps, each passing control onward to the next phase of the gradually more complex boot process. (See Apple DOS: Boot loader). Because so little of the disk operating system relied on ROM, the hardware was also extremely flexible and supported a wide range of customized disk copy protection mechanisms. (See Software Cracking: History.)

Some operating systems, most notably pre-1995 Macintosh systems from Apple, are so closely interwoven with their hardware that it is impossible to natively boot an operating system other than the standard one. This is the opposite extreme of the scenario using switches mentioned above; it is highly inflexible but relatively error-proof and foolproof as long as all hardware is working normally. A common solution in such situations is to design a boot loader that works as a program belonging to the standard OS that hijacks the system and loads the alternative OS. This technique was used by Apple for its A/UX Unix implementation and copied by various freeware operating systems and BeOS Personal Edition 5.

Some machines, like the Atari ST microcomputer, were &quot;instant-on&quot;, with the operating system executing from a ROM. Retrieval of the OS from secondary or tertiary store was thus eliminated as one of the characteristic operations for bootstrapping. To allow system customizations, accessories, and other support software to be loaded automatically, the Atari&#x27;s floppy drive was read for additional components during the boot process. There was a timeout delay that provided time to manually insert a floppy as the system searched for the extra components. This could be avoided by inserting a blank disk. The Atari ST hardware was also designed so the cartridge slot could provide native program execution for gaming purposes as a holdover from Atari&#x27;s legacy making electronic games; by inserting the Spectre GCR cartridge with the Macintosh system ROM in the game slot and turning the Atari on, it could &quot;natively boot&quot; the Macintosh operating system rather than Atari&#x27;s own TOS.

The IBM Personal Computer included ROM-based firmware called the BIOS; one of the functions of that firmware was to perform a power-on self test when the machine was powered up, and then to read software from a boot device and execute it. Firmware compatible with the BIOS on the IBM Personal Computer is used in IBM PC compatible computers. The UEFI was developed by Intel, originally for Itanium-based machines, and later also used as an alternative to the BIOS in x86-based machines, including Apple Macs using Intel processors.

Unix workstations originally had vendor-specific ROM-based firmware. Sun Microsystems later developed OpenBoot, later known as Open Firmware, which incorporated a Forth interpreter, with much of the firmware being written in Forth. It was standardized by the IEEE as IEEE standard ; firmware that implements that standard was used in PowerPC-based Macs and some other PowerPC-based machines, as well as Sun&#x27;s own SPARC-based computers. The Advanced RISC Computing specification defined another firmware standard, which was implemented on some MIPS-based and Alpha-based machines and the SGI Visual Workstation x86-based workstations.

== Modern boot loaders ==

When a computer is turned off, its softwareincluding operating systems, application code, and dataremains stored on non-volatile memory. When the computer is powered on, it typically does not have an operating system or its loader in random-access memory (RAM). The computer first executes a relatively small program stored in read-only memory (ROM, and later EEPROM, NOR flash) which support execute in place, to initialize CPU and motherboard, to initialize the memory (especially on x86 systems), to initialize and access the storage (usually a block-addressed device, e.g. hard disk drive, NAND flash, solid-state drive) from which the operating system programs and data can be loaded into RAM, and to initialize other I/O devices.

The small program that starts this sequence is known as a &quot;bootstrap loader&quot;, &quot;bootstrap&quot; or &quot;boot loader&quot;. Often, multiple-stage boot loaders are used, during which several programs of increasing complexity load one after the other in a process of chain loading.

Some earlier computer systems, upon receiving a boot signal from a human operator or a peripheral device, may load a very small number of fixed instructions into memory at a specific location, initialize at least one CPU, and then point the CPU to the instructions and start their execution. These instructions typically start an input operation from some peripheral device (which may be switch-selectable by the operator). Other systems may send hardware commands directly to peripheral devices or I/O controllers that cause an extremely simple input operation (such as &quot;read sector zero of the system device into memory starting at location 1000&quot;) to be carried out, effectively loading a small number of boot loader instructions into memory; a completion signal from the I/O device may then be used to start execution of the instructions by the CPU.

Smaller computers often use less flexible but more automatic boot loader mechanisms to ensure that the computer starts quickly and with a predetermined software configuration. In many desktop computers, for example, the bootstrapping process begins with the CPU executing software contained in ROM (for example, the BIOS of an IBM PC) at a predefined address (some CPUs, including the Intel x86 series are designed to execute this software after reset without outside help). This software contains rudimentary functionality to search for devices eligible to participate in booting, and load a small program from a special section (most commonly the boot sector) of the most promising device, typically starting at a fixed entry point such as the start of the sector.

Boot loaders may face peculiar constraints, especially in size; for instance, on the IBM PC and compatibles, the boot code must fit in the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the Partition Boot Record (PBR), which in turn are limited to a single sector; on the IBM System/360, the size is limited by the IPL medium, e.g., card size, track size.

On systems with those constraints, the first program loaded into RAM may not be sufficiently large to load the operating system and, instead, must load another, larger program. The first program loaded into RAM is called a first-stage boot loader, and the program it loads is called a second-stage boot loader. On many embedded CPUs, the CPU built-in boot ROM, sometimes called the zero-stage boot loader, can find and load first-stage boot loaders.

=== First-stage boot loaders ===
Examples of first-stage (hardware initialization stage) boot loaders include BIOS, UEFI, coreboot, Libreboot and Das U-Boot. On the IBM PC, the boot loader in the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the Partition Boot Record (PBR) was coded to require at least 32 KB (later expanded to 64 KB) of system memory and only use instructions supported by the original 8088/8086 processors.

=== Second-stage boot loaders ===

Second-stage (OS initialization stage) boot loaders, such as shim, GNU GRUB, rEFInd, BOOTMGR, Syslinux, and NTLDR, are not themselves operating systems, but are able to load an operating system properly and transfer execution to it; the operating system subsequently initializes itself and may load extra device drivers. The second-stage boot loader does not need drivers for its own operation, but may instead use generic storage access methods provided by system firmware such as the BIOS, UEFI or Open Firmware, though typically with restricted hardware functionality and lower performance.

Many boot loaders (like GNU GRUB, rEFInd, Windows&#x27;s BOOTMGR, Syslinux, and Windows NT/2000/XP&#x27;s NTLDR) can be configured to give the user multiple booting choices. These choices can include different operating systems (for dual or multi-booting from different partitions or drives), different versions of the same operating system (in case a new version has unexpected problems), different operating system loading options (e.g., booting into a rescue or safe mode), and some standalone programs that can function without an operating system, such as memory testers (e.g., memtest86+), a basic shell (as in GNU GRUB), or even games (see List of PC Booter games). Some boot loaders can also load other boot loaders; for example, GRUB loads BOOTMGR instead of loading Windows directly. Usually a default choice is preselected with a time delay during which a user can press a key to change the choice; after this delay, the default choice is automatically run so normal booting can occur without interaction.

The boot process can be considered complete when the computer is ready to interact with the user, or the operating system is capable of running system programs or application programs.

=== Embedded and multi-stage boot loaders ===

Many embedded systems must boot immediately. For example, waiting a minute for a digital television or a GPS navigation device to start is generally unacceptable. Therefore, such devices have software systems in ROM or flash memory so the device can begin functioning immediately; little or no loading is necessary, because the loading can be precomputed and stored on the ROM when the device is made.

Large and complex systems may have boot procedures that proceed in multiple phases until finally the operating system and other programs are loaded and ready to execute. Because operating systems are designed as if they never start or stop, a boot loader might load the operating system, configure itself as a mere process within that system, and then irrevocably transfer control to the operating system. The boot loader then terminates normally as any other process would.

=== Network booting ===
Most computers are also capable of booting over a computer network. In this scenario, the operating system is stored on the disk of a server, and certain parts of it are transferred to the client using a simple protocol such as the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). After these parts have been transferred, the operating system takes over the control of the booting process.

As with the second-stage boot loader, network booting begins by using generic network access methods provided by the network interface&#x27;s boot ROM, which typically contains a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) image. No drivers are required, but the system functionality is limited until the operating system kernel and drivers are transferred and started. As a result, once the ROM-based booting has completed it is entirely possible to network boot into an operating system that itself does not have the ability to use the network interface.

== IBM-compatible personal computers (PC) ==
=== Boot devices ===


The boot device is the storage device from which the operating system is loaded. A modern PC&#x27;s UEFI or BIOS firmware supports booting from various devices, typically a local solid-state drive or hard disk drive via the GPT or Master Boot Record (MBR) on such a drive or disk, an optical disc drive (using El Torito), a USB mass storage device (USB flash drive, memory card reader, USB hard disk drive, USB optical disc drive, USB solid-state drive, etc.), or a network interface card (using PXE). Older, less common BIOS-bootable devices include floppy disk drives, Zip drives, and LS-120 drives.

Typically, the system firmware (UEFI or BIOS) will allow the user to configure a &quot;boot order&quot;. If the boot order is set to &quot;first, the DVD drive; second, the hard disk drive&quot;, then the firmware will try to boot from the DVD drive, and if this fails (e.g. because there is no DVD in the drive), it will try to boot from the local hard disk drive.

For example, on a PC with Windows installed on the hard drive, the user could set the boot order to the one given above, and then insert a Linux Live CD in order to try out Linux without having to install an operating system onto the hard drive. This is an example of dual booting, in which the user chooses which operating system to start after the computer has performed its power-on self-test (POST). In this example of dual booting, the user chooses by inserting or removing the DVD from the computer, but it is more common to choose which operating system to boot by selecting from a boot manager menu on the selected device, by using the computer keyboard to select from a BIOS or UEFI boot menu, or both; the boot menu is typically entered by pressing or keys during the POST; the BIOS setup is typically entered by pressing or keys during the POST.

Several devices are available that enable the user to &quot;quick-boot&quot; into what is usually a variant of Linux for various simple tasks such as Internet access; examples are Splashtop and Latitude ON.

=== Boot sequence ===

Upon starting, an IBM-compatible personal computer&#x27;s x86 CPU, executes in real mode, the instruction located at reset vector (the physical memory address on 16-bit x86 processors and on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 processors), usually pointing to the firmware (UEFI or BIOS) entry point inside the ROM. This memory location typically contains a jump instruction that transfers execution to the location of the firmware (UEFI or BIOS) start-up program. This program runs a power-on self-test (POST) to check and initialize required devices such as main memory (DRAM), the PCI bus and the PCI devices (including running embedded option ROMs). One of the most involved steps is setting up DRAM over SPD, further complicated by the fact that at this point memory is very limited.

After initializing required hardware, the firmware (UEFI or BIOS) goes through a pre-configured list of non-volatile storage devices (&quot;boot device sequence&quot;) until it finds one that is bootable.

==== BIOS ====
Once the BIOS has found a bootable device it loads the boot sector to linear address (usually segment:offset :, but some BIOSes erroneously use :) and transfers execution to the boot code. In the case of a hard disk, this is referred to as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The conventional MBR code checks the MBR&#x27;s partition table for a partition set as &quot;bootable&quot; (the one with &quot;active&quot; flag set). If an active partition is found, the MBR code loads the boot sector code from that partition, known as Volume Boot Record (VBR), and executes it. The MBR boot code is often operating-system specific.

A bootable MBR device is defined as one that can be read from, and where the last two bytes of the first sector contain the little-endian word , found as byte sequence , on disk (also known as the MBR boot signature), or where it is otherwise established that the code inside the sector is executable on x86 PCs.

The boot sector code is the first-stage boot loader. It is located on fixed disks and removable drives, and must fit into the first 446 bytes of the Master Boot Record in order to leave room for the default 64-byte partition table with four partition entries and the two-byte boot signature, which the BIOS requires for a proper boot loader — or even less, when additional features like more than four partition entries (up to 16 with 16 bytes each), a disk signature (6 bytes), a disk timestamp (6 bytes), an Advanced Active Partition (18 bytes) or special multi-boot loaders have to be supported as well in some environments. In floppy and superfloppy Volume Boot Records, up to 59 bytes are occupied for the Extended BIOS Parameter Block on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes since DOS 4.0, whereas the FAT32 EBPB introduced with DOS 7.1 requires even 87 bytes, leaving only 423 bytes for the boot loader when assuming a sector size of 512 bytes. Microsoft boot sectors therefore traditionally imposed certain restrictions on the boot process, for example, the boot file had to be located at a fixed position in the root directory of the file system and stored as consecutive sectors, conditions taken care of by the codice_1 command and slightly relaxed in later versions of DOS. The boot loader was then able to load the first three sectors of the file into memory, which happened to contain another embedded boot loader able to load the remainder of the file into memory. When Microsoft added LBA and FAT32 support, they even switched to a boot loader reaching over &quot;two&quot; physical sectors and using 386 instructions for size reasons. At the same time other vendors managed to squeeze much more functionality into a single boot sector without relaxing the original constraints on only minimal available memory (32 KB) and processor support (). For example, DR-DOS boot sectors are able to locate the boot file in the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file system, and load it into memory as a whole via CHS or LBA, even if the file is not stored in a fixed location and in consecutive sectors.

The VBR is often OS-specific; however, its main function is to load and execute the operating system boot loader file (such as codice_2 or codice_3), which is the second-stage boot loader, from an active partition. Then the boot loader loads the OS kernel from the storage device.

If there is no active partition, or the active partition&#x27;s boot sector is invalid, the MBR may load a secondary boot loader which will select a partition (often via user input) and load its boot sector, which usually loads the corresponding operating system kernel. In some cases, the MBR may also attempt to load secondary boot loaders before trying to boot the active partition. If all else fails, it should issue an INT 18h BIOS interrupt call (followed by an INT 19h just in case INT 18h would return) in order to give back control to the BIOS, which would then attempt to boot off other devices, attempt a remote boot via network.

==== UEFI ====
Many modern systems (Intel Macs and newer PCs) use UEFI.

Unlike BIOS, UEFI (not Legacy boot via CSM) does not rely on boot sectors, UEFI system loads the boot loader (EFI application file in USB disk or in the EFI System Partition) directly, and the OS kernel is loaded by the boot loader.

== SoCs, embedded systems, microcontrollers, and FPGAs ==

Many modern CPUs, SoCs and microcontrollers (for example, TI OMAP) or sometimes even digital signal processors (DSPs) may have a boot ROM integrated directly into their silicon, so such a processor can perform a simple boot sequence on its own and load boot programs (firmware or software) from boot sources such as NAND flash or eMMC. It is difficult to hardwire all the required logic for handling such devices, so an integrated boot ROM is used instead in such scenarios. Also, a boot ROM may be able to load a boot loader or diagnostic program via serial interfaces like UART, SPI, USB and so on. This feature is often used for system recovery purposes, or it could also be used for initial non-volatile memory programming when there is no software available in the non-volatile memory yet. Many modern microcontrollers (e.g. flash memory controller on USB flash drives) have firmware ROM integrated directly into their silicon.

Some embedded system designs may also include an intermediary boot sequence step. For example, Das U-Boot may be split into two stages: the platform would load a small SPL (Secondary Program Loader), which is a stripped-down version of U-Boot, and the SPL would do some initial hardware configuration (e.g. DRAM initialization using CPU cache as RAM) and load the larger, fully featured version of U-Boot. Some CPUs and SoCs may not use CPU cache as RAM on boot process, they use an integrated boot processor to do some hardware configuration, to reduce cost.

It is also possible to take control of a system by using a hardware debug interface such as JTAG. Such an interface may be used to write the boot loader program into bootable non-volatile memory (e.g. flash) by instructing the processor core to perform the necessary actions to program non-volatile memory. Alternatively, the debug interface may be used to upload some diagnostic or boot code into RAM, and then to start the processor core and instruct it to execute the uploaded code. This allows, for example, the recovery of embedded systems where no software remains on any supported boot device, and where the processor does not have any integrated boot ROM. JTAG is a standard and popular interface; many CPUs, microcontrollers and other devices are manufactured with JTAG interfaces ().

Some microcontrollers provide special hardware interfaces which cannot be used to take arbitrary control of a system or directly run code, but instead they allow the insertion of boot code into bootable non-volatile memory (like flash memory) via simple protocols. Then at the manufacturing phase, such interfaces are used to inject boot code (and possibly other code) into non-volatile memory. After system reset, the microcontroller begins to execute code programmed into its non-volatile memory, just like usual processors are using ROMs for booting. Most notably this technique is used by Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and by others as well. In many cases such interfaces are implemented by hardwired logic. In other cases such interfaces could be created by software running in integrated on-chip boot ROM from GPIO pins.

Most DSPs have a serial mode boot, and a parallel mode boot, such as the host port interface (HPI boot).

In case of DSPs there is often a second microprocessor or microcontroller present in the system design, and this is responsible for overall system behavior, interrupt handling, dealing with external events, user interface, etc. while the DSP is dedicated to signal processing tasks only. In such systems the DSP could be booted by another processor which is sometimes referred as the &quot;host processor&quot; (giving name to a Host Port). Such a processor is also sometimes referred as the &quot;master&quot;, since it usually boots first from its own memories and then controls overall system behavior, including booting of the DSP, and then further controlling the DSP&#x27;s behavior. The DSP often lacks its own boot memories and relies on the host processor to supply the required code instead. The most notable systems with such a design are cell phones, modems, audio and video players and so on, where a DSP and a CPU/microcontroller are co-existing.

Many FPGA chips load their configuration from an external configuration ROM, typically a serial EEPROM, on power-up.

== Security ==
Various measures have been implemented which enhance the security of the booting process. Some of them are made mandatory, others can be disabled or enabled by the end user. Traditionally, booting did not involve the use of cryptography. The security can be bypassed by unlocking the boot loader, which might or might not be approved by the manufacturer. Modern boot loaders make use of concurrency, meaning they can run multiple processor cores and threads at the same time, which add extra layers of complexity to secure booting.

Matthew Garrett argued that booting security serves a legitimate goal but in doing so chooses defaults that are hostile to users.

=== Measures ===
* UEFI secure boot
* Android Verified boot
* Samsung Knox
* Measured boot with the Trusted Platform Module, also known as &quot;trusted boot&quot;.
* Intel BootGuard
* Disk encryption
* Firmware passwords

===Bootloop===
When debugging a concurrent and distributed system of systems, a bootloop (also written boot loop or boot-loop) is a diagnostic condition of an erroneous state that occurs on computing devices; when those devices repeatedly fail to complete the booting process and restart before a boot sequence is finished, a restart might prevent a user from accessing the regular interface.

====Detection of an erroneous state====
The system might exhibit its erroneous state in, for example, an explicit bootloop or a blue screen of death, before recovery is indicated. Detection of an erroneous state may require a distributed event store and stream-processing platform for real-time operation of a distributed system.

====Recovery from an erroneous state====
An erroneous state can trigger bootloops; this state can be caused by misconfiguration from previously known-good operations. Recovery attempts from that erroneous state then enter a reboot, in an attempt to return to a known-good state. In Windows OS operations, for example, the recovery procedure was to reboot three times, the reboots needed to return to a usable menu.

====Recovery policy====
Recovery might be specified via Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which can also implement Single sign-on (SSO) for some applications; in the zero trust security model identification, authorization, and authentication are separable concerns in an SSO session. When recovery of a site is indicated (viz. a blue screen of death is displayed on an airport terminal screen) personal site visits might be required to remediate the situation.

==== Examples ====
* Windows NT 4.0
* Windows 2000
* Windows Server
* Windows 10
* The Nexus 5X
* Android 10: when setting a specific image as wallpaper, the luminance value exceeded the maximum of 255 which happened due to a rounding error during conversion from sRGB to RGB. This then crashed the SystemUI component on every boot.
* Google Nest hub
* LG smartphone bootloop issues
* On 19 July 2024, an update of CrowdStrike″s Falcon software caused the 2024 CrowdStrike incident resulting in Microsoft Windows systems worldwide stuck in bootloops or recovery mode.

<text>A common carrier in common law countries (corresponding to a public carrier in some civil law systems, usually called simply a carrier) is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport. A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body, which has usually been granted &quot;ministerial authority&quot; by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.
A common carrier (also called a &quot;public carrier&quot; in British English) is distinguished from a contract carrier, which is a carrier that transports goods for only a certain number of clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a private carrier. A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to meet the needs of the regulator&#x27;s quasi-judicial role of impartiality toward the public&#x27;s interest) for the &quot;public convenience and necessity.&quot; A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is &quot;fit, willing, and able&quot; to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as common carriers. Under US law, an ocean freight forwarder cannot act as a common carrier.

The term &quot;common carrier&quot; is a common law term and is seldom used in Continental Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In Continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier is referred to as a &quot;public carrier&quot; or simply as a &quot;carrier&quot;. However, &quot;public carrier&quot; in Continental Europe is different from &quot;public carrier&quot; in British English in which it is a synonym for &quot;contract carrier.&quot;

==General==
Although common carriers generally transport people or goods, in the United States the term may also refer to telecommunications service providers and public utilities. In certain U.S. states, amusement parks that operate roller coasters and comparable rides have been found to be common carriers; a famous example is Disneyland.

Regulatory bodies may also grant carriers the authority to operate under contract with their customers instead of under common carrier authority, rates, schedules and rules. These regulated carriers, known as contract carriers, must demonstrate that they are &quot;fit, willing and able&quot; to provide service, according to standards enforced by the regulator. However, contract carriers are specifically not required to demonstrate that they will operate for the &quot;public convenience and necessity.&quot; A contract carrier may be authorized to provide service over either fixed routes and schedules, i.e., as regular route carrier or on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis as an irregular route carrier.

It should be mentioned that the carrier refers only to the person (legal or physical) that enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper. The carrier does not necessarily have to own or even be in the possession of a means of transport. Unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, the carrier may use whatever means of transport approved in its operating authority, as long as it is the most favorable from the cargo interests&#x27; point of view. The carriers&#x27; duty is to get the goods to the agreed destination within the agreed time or within reasonable time.

The person that is physically transporting the goods on a means of transport is referred to as the &quot;actual carrier&quot;. When a carrier subcontracts with another provider, such as an independent contractor or a third-party carrier, the common carrier is said to be providing &quot;substituted service&quot;. The same person may hold both common carrier and contract carrier authority. In the case of a rail line in the US, the owner of the property is said to retain a &quot;residual common carrier obligation&quot;, unless otherwise transferred (such as in the case of a commuter rail system, where the authority operating passenger trains may acquire the property but not this obligation from the former owner), and must operate the line if service is terminated. 

In contrast, private carriers are not licensed to offer a service to the public. Private carriers generally provide transport on an irregular or &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis for their owners.

Carriers were very common in rural areas prior to motorised transport. Regular services by horse-drawn vehicles would ply to local towns, taking goods to market or bringing back purchases for the village. If space permitted, passengers could also travel.

Cases have also established limitations to the common carrier designation. In a case concerning a hot air balloon, &quot;Grotheer v. Escape Adventures, Inc.&quot;, the court affirmed a hot air balloon was not a common carrier, holding the key inquiry in determining whether or not a transporter can be classified as a common carrier is whether passengers expect the transportation to be safe because the operator is reasonably capable of controlling the risk of injury.

== Telecommunications ==

In the United States, telecommunications carriers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission under title II of the Communications Act of 1934.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 made extensive revisions to the &quot;Title II&quot; provisions regarding common carriers and repealed the judicial 1982 AT&amp;T consent decree (often referred to as the Modification of Final Judgment) that effectuated the breakup of AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell System. Further, the Act gives telephone companies the option of providing video programming on a common carrier basis or as a conventional cable television operator. If it chooses the former, the telephone company will face less regulation but will also have to comply with FCC regulations requiring what the Act refers to as &quot;open video systems&quot;. The Act generally bars, with certain exceptions including most rural areas, acquisitions by telephone companies of more than a 10 percent interest in cable operators (and vice versa) and joint ventures between telephone companies and cable systems serving the same areas.

== Internet Service Providers ==
Using provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC classified Internet service providers as common carriers, effective June 12, 2015, for the purpose of enforcing net neutrality. Led by the Trump administration&#x27;s appointed commissioner Ajit Pai, on December 14, 2017 the FCC reversed its rules on net neutrality, effectively revoking common carrier status as a requirement for Internet service providers. Following this, in 2018 the U.S. Senate narrowly passed a non-binding resolution aiming to reverse the FCC&#x27;s decision and restore FCC&#x27;s net neutrality rules. On 25 April 2024, the FCC voted 3–2 to reinstate net neutrality in the United States by reclassifying the Internet under Title II. However, legal challenges filed by ISPs resulted in an appeals court order that stays the net neutrality rules until the court makes a final ruling, with the court opining that the ISPs are likely to prevail over the FCC on the merits.

==Pipelines==
In the United States, many oil, gas and CO2 pipelines are common carriers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates charged and other tariff terms imposed by interstate common carrier pipelines. Intrastate common carrier pipeline tariffs are often regulated by state agencies. The US and many states have delegated the power of eminent domain to common carrier gas pipelines.

==Legal implications==
Common carriers are subject to special laws and regulations that differ depending on the means of transport used, e.g. sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers. In common law jurisdictions as well as under international law, a common carrier is absolutely liable for goods carried by it, with four exceptions:
* An act of nature
* An act of the public enemies
* Fault or fraud by the shipper
* An inherent defect in the goods
A sea carrier may also, according to the Hague-Visby Rules, escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned, e.g. a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ship&#x27;s master or other crewmember.

Carriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a contract of carriage, often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier.

An important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot &quot;discriminate,&quot; that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason. As of 2007, the status of Internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated (network neutrality).

The term common carrier does not exist in continental Europe but is distinctive to common law systems, particularly law systems in the US.

In &quot;Ludditt v Ginger Coote Airways&quot; the Privy Council (Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright, Lord Porter and Lord Simonds) held the liability of a public or common carrier of passengers is only to carry with due care. This is more limited than that of a common carrier of goods. The complete freedom of a carrier of passengers at common law to make such contracts as he thinks fit was not curtailed by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854, and a specific contract that enlarges, diminishes or excludes his duty to take care (e.g., by a condition that the passenger travels &quot;at his own risk against all casualties&quot;) cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it. There was nothing in the provisions of the Canadian Transport Act 1938 section 25 that would invalidate a provision excluding liability. &quot;Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Robinson&quot; [1915] A.C. 740 was followed and &quot;Peek v North Staffordshire Railway&quot; 11 E.R. 1109 was distinguished.

<text>In telecommunications, common control is a principle of switching telephone calls in an automatic telephone exchange that employs shared control equipment which is attached to the circuit of a call only for the duration of establishing or otherwise controlling the call. Thus, such control equipment need only be provided in as few units to satisfy overall exchange traffic, rather than being duplicated for every subscriber line.

In contrast, &quot;direct control&quot; systems have subsystems for call control that are an integral part of the switching network. Strowger exchanges are usually direct control systems, whereas crossbar, and electronic exchanges (including all stored program control systems) are common control systems. Common control is also known as indirect control or register control.

== History ==
Early semi-mechanical installations with common control components existed, for example rotary systems in Sweden and France in 1915, and the first panel switches in Newark, New Jersey, also in 1915. The first large-scale, fully automatic, common control switching system deployed in commercial production service was the &quot;ATlantic&quot; central office in Omaha, Nebraska, a panel system cut over on December 10, 1921. Other panel offices for Kansas City and New York City (the &quot;PENnsylvania exchange&quot;) were in planning at the same time and opened shortly after.

In 1922, common control was introduced in Strowger-type step-by-step systems, resulting in the first installations of Director systems in Havana, Cuba in 1924, and in London, England in 1927.

By the mid-1920s, common control ideas had extended to include marker systems for testing for idle trunks.

During the 1960s, common control exchanges became stored program control exchanges, and by the 1970s they used common-channel signaling in which the channels that are used for signaling are not used for message traffic (out of band signaling).

<doc id="40912" wikidata="Q5153433" url="?curid=40912" title="Common Management Information Service">
<text>The Common Management Information Service (CMIS) is the service interface specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.710, ISO/IEC International Standard 9595 that is employed by OSI network elements for network management. It defines the service interface that is implemented by the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.711, ISO/IEC International Standard 9596-1. CMIS is part of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) body of international network standards.

Note the term CMIP is sometimes used erroneously when CMIS is intended. CMIS/CMIP is most often used in telecommunications applications, in other areas SNMP has become more popular.

==Services==
The following services are made available by the Common Management Information Service Element (CMISE) to allow management of network elements:

===Management operation services===
* M-CREATE – Create an instance of a managed object
* M-DELETE – Delete an instance of a managed object
* M-GET – Request managed object attributes (for one object or a set of objects)
* M-CANCEL-GET – Cancel an outstanding GET request
* M-SET – Set managed object attributes
* M-ACTION – Request an action to be performed on a managed object

===Management notification services===
* M-EVENT-REPORT – Send events occurring on managed objects

===Management association services===
To transfer management information between open systems using CMIS/CMIP, peer connections, &quot;i.e.,&quot; associations, must be established. This requires the establishment of an Application layer association, a Session layer connection, a Transport layer connection, and, depending on supporting communications technology, Network layer and Link layer connections.

CMIS initially defined management association services but it was later decided these services could be provided by ACSE and these services were removed. Below is a list of these services which were subsequently removed from ISO 9595:

* M-INITIALIZE – Creates an association with (i.e. connects to) another CMISE
* M-TERMINATE – Terminates an established connection
* M-ABORT – Terminates the association in the case of an abnormal connection termination

<doc id="40915" wikidata="Q1097684" url="?curid=40915" title="Communications blackout">
<text>In telecommunications, communications blackouts are
* a cessation of communications or communications capability, caused by a lack of power to a communications facility or to communications equipment.
* a total lack of radio communications capability, caused by ionospheric anomalies, e.g., during strong auroral activity or during re-entry of a spacecraft into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==Technical failures==
Uptime being a key goal of most communications networks, power supplies and backup generators are typically used to ensure high-reliability power.

Wireless networks may be subject to radio jamming; wired networks can be physically severed. Network design can also play a role in maintaining communications reliability; depending on the constraints in building a fiber-optic network, a self-healing ring topology may be used.

==Spacecraft reentry==
The communications blackouts that affect spacecraft re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which are also known as radio blackouts, ionization blackouts, or reentry blackouts, are caused by an envelope of ionized air around the craft, created by the heat from the compression of the atmosphere by the craft. The ionized air interferes with radio signals. For the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft, such communications blackouts lasted for several minutes. Gemini 2, for example, endured such a blackout for four minutes, beginning at 9 minutes 5 seconds into the descent.

For Apollo missions, the communications blackout was approximately three minutes long. For Apollo 16, for example, pre-advisory data (PAD) for re-entry listed the expected times for re-entry communications blackout to be from 0 minutes 16 seconds after entry interface to 3 minutes 33 seconds after entry interface (a total of 3 minutes 17 seconds). For the Apollo 13 mission, the blackout was much longer than normal because the flight path of the spacecraft was unexpectedly at a much shallower angle than normal. According to the mission log maintained by Gene Kranz, the Apollo 13 re-entry blackout lasted around 6 minutes, beginning at 142:39 and ending at 142:45, and was 1 minute 27 seconds longer than had been predicted.

Communications blackouts for re-entry are not solely confined to entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. They apply to entry into any atmosphere where such ionization occurs around a craft. The Mars Pathfinder endured a 30-second communications blackout as it entered Mars&#x27; atmosphere, for example. The Huygens probe endured a communications blackout as it entered the atmosphere of Titan.

Until the creation of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), the Space Shuttle endured a 30-minute blackout. The TDRSS allowed the Shuttle to communicate by relay with a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite during re-entry, through a &quot;hole&quot; in the ionized air envelope at the tail end of the craft, created by the Shuttle&#x27;s shape.

==Space weather==

Radio blackouts on Earth caused by solar flares are measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on a scale from 1 (minor) to 5 (extreme).

==Solar position==

Communications can also be lost when the Sun is blocking or behind one station in the same line of sight; Sun outages periodically interrupt communications with geosynchronous satellites. It is also a common problem for interplanetary space missions.

<text>In telecommunications, communications-electronics (C-E) is the specialized field concerned with the use of electronic devices and systems for the acquisition or acceptance, processing, storage, display, analysis, protection, disposition, and transfer of information.

C-E includes the wide range of responsibilities and actions relating to:

* Electronic devices and systems used in the transfer of ideas and perceptions;
* Electronic sensors and sensory systems used in the acquisition of information devoid of semantic influence;
* Electronic devices and systems intended to allow friendly forces to operate in hostile environments and to deny to hostile forces the effective use of electromagnetic resources.

== Electronic Communications Equipment ==
Communication electronics radio equipment has been a rapidly growing industry for more than a century. Homeland Security in the USA is one of the reasons for the fast growth. Since the invention of the “solid state” transistor in the 1950s and the TTL (transistor-transistor logic) that led to the development of the IC (integrated circuit) in the 1960s the growth in the field of electronics has been phenomenal. As now witnessed in the “radio communications” field. The latest trend is to send conventional LMR (land-mobile-radio) signals over the Internet (Internet Protocol) this is called RoIP (Radio over Internet Protocol), which is just like VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) but uses the radio. By sending signals over the Internet it allows radios to be connected together all over the world. Hence: the “Communications Revolution”.

<text>[[Communication protocol|Communications]] security is the discipline of preventing unauthorized interceptors from accessing telecommunications in an intelligible form, while still delivering content to the intended recipients.

In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization culture, including United States Department of Defense culture, it is often referred to by the abbreviation COMSEC. The field includes cryptographic security, transmission security, emissions security and physical security of COMSEC equipment and associated keying material.

COMSEC is used to protect both classified and unclassified traffic on military communications networks, including voice, video, and data. It is used for both analog and digital applications, and both wired and wireless links.

Voice over secure internet protocol VOSIP has become the de facto standard for securing voice communication, replacing the need for Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) in much of NATO, including the U.S.A. USCENTCOM moved entirely to VOSIP in 2008.

== Specialties ==
* Cryptographic security: The component of communications security that results from the provision of technically sound cryptosystems and their proper use. This includes ensuring message confidentiality and authenticity.
* Emission security (EMSEC): The protection resulting from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from communications systems and cryptographic equipment intercepts and the interception and analysis of compromising emanations from cryptographic equipment, information systems, and telecommunications systems.
* Transmission security (TRANSEC): The component of communications security that results from the application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis (e.g. frequency hopping and spread spectrum).
* Physical security: The component of communications security that results from all physical measures necessary to safeguard classified equipment, material, and documents from access thereto or observation thereof by unauthorized persons.

== DoD Electronic Key Management System ==
The Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) key management, COMSEC material distribution, and logistics support system. The National Security Agency (NSA) established the EKMS program to supply electronic key to COMSEC devices in securely and timely manner, and to provide COMSEC managers with an automated system capable of ordering, generation, production, distribution, storage, security accounting, and access control.

The Army&#x27;s platform in the four-tiered EKMS, AKMS, automates frequency management and COMSEC management operations. It eliminates paper keying material, hardcopy Signal operating instructions (SOI) and saves the time and resources required for courier distribution. It has 4 components:
* LCMS provides automation for the detailed accounting required for every COMSEC account, and electronic key generation and distribution capability.
* ACES is the frequency management portion of AKMS. ACES has been designated by the Military Communications Electronics Board as the joint standard for use by all services in development of frequency management and crypto-net planning.
* CT3 with DTD software is in a fielded, ruggedized hand-held device that handles, views, stores, and loads SOI, Key, and electronic protection data. DTD provides an improved net-control device to automate crypto-net control operations for communications networks employing electronically keyed COMSEC equipment.
* SKL is a hand-held PDA that handles, views, stores, and loads SOI, Key, and electronic protection data.

== Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program ==
KMI is intended to replace the legacy Electronic Key Management System to provide a means for securely ordering, generating, producing, distributing, managing, and auditing cryptographic products (e.g., asymmetric keys, symmetric keys, manual cryptographic systems, and cryptographic applications). This system is currently being fielded by Major Commands and variants will be required for non-DoD Agencies with a COMSEC Mission.

<text>In telecommunications, communications survivability is the ability of communications systems to continue to operate effectively under adverse conditions, though portions of the system may be damaged or destroyed. 

Various methods may be used to maintain communications services, such as using alternate routing, different transmission media or methods, redundant equipment, and sites and equipment that are radiation hardened.

<text>A communications system or communication system is a collection of individual telecommunications networks systems, relay stations, tributary stations, and terminal equipment usually capable of interconnection and interoperation to form an integrated whole. The components of a communications system serve a common purpose, are technically compatible, use common procedures, respond to controls, and operate in union.

Telecommunications is a method of communication (e.g., for sports broadcasting, mass media, journalism, etc.). Communication is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.

== Types ==
=== By media===
An optical communication system is any form of communications system that uses light as the transmission medium. Equipment consists of a transmitter, which encodes a &quot;message&quot; into an optical &quot;signal&quot;, a &quot;communication channel&quot;, which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. Fiber-optic communication systems transmit information from one place to another by sending light through an optical fiber. The light forms a carrier signal that is modulated to carry information.

A radio communication system is composed of several communications subsystems that give exterior communications capabilities. A radio communication system comprises a transmitting conductor in which electrical oscillations or currents are produced and which is arranged to cause such currents or oscillations to be propagated through the free space medium from one point to another remote therefrom and a receiving conductor at such distant point adapted to be excited by the oscillations or currents propagated from the transmitter.

Power line communication systems operate by impressing a modulated carrier signal on power wires. Different types of powerline communications use different frequency bands, depending on the signal transmission characteristics of the power wiring used. Since the power wiring system was originally intended for transmission of AC power, the power wire circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies. The propagation problem is a limiting factor for each type of power line communications.

===By technology===
A duplex communication system is a system composed of two connected parties or devices which can communicate with one another in both directions. The term &quot;duplex&quot; is used when describing communication between two parties or devices. Duplex systems are employed in nearly all communications networks, either to allow for a communication &quot;two-way street&quot; between two connected parties or to provide a &quot;reverse path&quot; for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. An antenna is basically a small length of a conductor that is used to radiate or receive electromagnetic waves. It acts as a conversion device. At the transmitting end it converts high frequency current into electromagnetic waves. At the receiving end it transforms electromagnetic waves into electrical signals that is fed into the input of the receiver. several types of antenna are used in communication.

Examples of communications subsystems include the Defense Communications System (DCS).

===Examples: by technology===
*Telephone
*Mobile phone
*Tablet computer
*Television
*Telegraph
*Edison Telegraph
*TV cable
*Computer

===By application area===
A tactical communications system is a communications system that 
(a) is used within, or in direct support of tactical forces
(b) is designed to meet the requirements of changing tactical situations and varying environmental conditions, 
(c) provides securable communications, such as voice, data, and video, among mobile users to facilitate command and control within, and in support of, tactical forces, and 
(d) usually requires extremely short installation times, usually on the order of hours, in order to meet the requirements of frequent relocation.

An Emergency communication system is any system (typically computer based) that is organized for the primary purpose of supporting the two way communication of emergency messages between both individuals and groups of individuals. These systems are commonly designed to integrate the cross-communication of messages between are variety of communication technologies.

An Automatic call distributor (ACD) is a communication system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for product or service complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).

A Voice Communication Control System (VCCS) is essentially an ACD with characteristics that make it more adapted to use in critical situations (no waiting for dial tone, or lengthy recorded announcements, radio and telephone lines equally easily connected to, individual lines immediately accessible etc..)

== Key components ==
===Sources===
Sources can be classified as electric or non-electric; they are the origins of a message or input signal. Examples of sources include but are not limited to the following:
* Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc...)
* Graphic Image Files (GIFs)
* Email Messages
* Human voice
* Television Picture
* Electromagnetic radiation

=== Input transducers (sensors) ===
Sensors, like microphones and cameras, capture non-electric sources, like sound and light (respectively), and convert them into electrical signals. These types of sensors are called input transducers in modern analog and digital communication systems. Without input transducers there would not be an effective way to transport non-electric sources or signals over great distances, i.e. humans would have to rely solely on our eyes and ears to see and hear things despite the distances.

Other examples of input transducers include:
* Microphones
* Cameras
* Keyboards
* Mouse
* Force sensors
* Accelerometers

=== Transmitter ===
Once the source signal has been converted into an electric signal, the transmitter will modify this signal for efficient transmission. In order to do this, the signal must pass through an electronic circuit containing the following components:
# Noise filter
# Analog-to-digital converter
# Encoder
# Modulator
# Signal amplifier
After the signal has been amplified, it is ready for transmission. At the end of the circuit is an antenna, the point at which the signal is released as electromagnetic waves (or electromagnetic radiation).

=== Communication channel ===
A communication channel is simply referring to the medium by which a signal travels. There are two types of media by which electrical signals travel, i.e. guided and unguided. Guided media refers to any medium that can be directed from transmitter to receiver by means of connecting cables. In optical fiber communication, the medium is an optical (glass-like) fiber. Other guided media might include coaxial cables, telephone wire, twisted-pairs, etc... The other type of media, unguided media, refers to any communication channel that creates space between the transmitter and receiver. For radio or RF communication, the medium is air. Air is the only thing between the transmitter and receiver for RF communication while in other cases, like sonar, the medium is usually water because sound waves travel efficiently through certain liquid media. Both types of media are considered unguided because there are no connecting cables between the transmitter and receiver. Communication channels include almost everything from the vacuum of space to solid pieces of metal; however, some mediums are preferred more than others. That is because differing sources travel through subjective mediums with fluctuating efficiencies.

=== Receiver ===
Once the signal has passed through the communication channel, it must be effectively captured by a receiver. The goal of the receiver is to capture and reconstruct the signal before it passed through the transmitter (i.e. the A/D converter, modulator and encoder). This is done by passing the &quot;received&quot; signal through another circuit containing the following components:
# Noise Filter
# Digital-to-analog converter
# Decoder
# Demodulator
# Signal Amplifier
Most likely the signal will have lost some of its energy after having passed through the communication channel or medium. The signal can be boosted by passing it through a signal amplifier. When the analog signal converted into digital signal.

=== Output transducer ===
The output transducer simply converts the electric signal (created by the input transducer) back into its original form. Examples of output transducers include but are not limited to the following:
* Speakers (Audio)
* Monitors (See Computer Peripherals)
* Motors (Movement)
* Lighting (Visual)

=== Other ===
Some common pairs of input and output transducers include:
# Microphones and speakers (audio signals)
# Keyboards and computer monitors
# Cameras and liquid crystal displays (LCDs)
# Force sensors (buttons) and lights or motors

Again, input transducers convert non-electric signals like voice into electric signals that can be transmitted over great distances very quickly. Output transducers convert the electric signal back into sound or picture, etc... There are many different types of transducers and the combinations are limitless.

<text>In telecommunications and signal processing, companding (occasionally called compansion) is a method of mitigating the detrimental effects of a channel with limited dynamic range. The name is a portmanteau of the words compressing and expanding, which are the functions of a compander at the transmitting and receiving ends, respectively. The use of companding allows signals with a large dynamic range to be transmitted over facilities that have a smaller dynamic range capability. Companding is employed in telephony and other audio applications such as professional wireless microphones and analog recording.

==How it works==
The dynamic range of a signal is compressed before transmission and is expanded to the original value at the receiver. The electronic circuit that does this is called a compander and works by compressing or expanding the dynamic range of an analog electronic signal such as sound recorded by a microphone. One variety is a triplet of amplifiers: a logarithmic amplifier, followed by a variable-gain linear amplifier, and ending with an exponential amplifier. Such a triplet has the property that its output voltage is proportional to the input voltage raised to an adjustable power.

Companded quantization is the combination of three functional building blocks – namely, a (continuous-domain) signal dynamic range &quot;compressor&quot;, a limited-range uniform quantizer, and a (continuous-domain) signal dynamic range &quot;expander&quot; that inverts the compressor function. This type of quantization is frequently used in telephony systems.

In practice, companders are designed to operate according to relatively simple dynamic range compressor functions that are suitable for implementation as simple analog electronic circuits. The two most popular compander functions used for telecommunications are the A-law and μ-law functions.

==Applications==
Companding is used in digital telephony systems, compressing before input to an analog-to-digital converter, and then expanding after a digital-to-analog converter. This is equivalent to using a non-linear ADC as in a T-carrier telephone system that implements A-law or μ-law companding. This method is also used in digital file formats for better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at lower bit depths. For example, a linearly encoded 16-bit PCM signal can be converted to an 8-bit WAV or AU file while maintaining a decent SNR by compressing before the transition to 8-bit and expanding after conversion back to 16-bit. This is effectively a form of lossy audio data compression.

Professional wireless microphones do this since the dynamic range of the microphone audio signal itself is larger than the dynamic range provided by radio transmission. Companding also reduces the noise and crosstalk levels at the receiver.

Companders are used in concert audio systems and in some noise reduction schemes.

==History==
The use of companding in an analog picture transmission system was patented by A. B. Clark of AT&amp;T in 1928 (filed in 1925):

In 1942, Clark and his team completed the SIGSALY secure voice transmission system that included the first use of companding in a PCM (digital) system.

In 1953, B. Smith showed that a nonlinear DAC could be complemented by the inverse nonlinearity in a successive-approximation ADC configuration, simplifying the design of digital companding systems.

In 1970, H. Kaneko developed the uniform description of segment (piecewise linear) companding laws that had by then been adopted in digital telephony.

In the 1980s and 1990s, many of the music equipment manufacturers (Roland, Yamaha, Korg) used companding when compressing the library waveform data in their digital synthesizers. However, exact algorithms are unknown, neither if any of the manufacturers ever used the Companding scheme which is described in this article. The only known thing is that manufacturers did use data compression in the mentioned time period and that some people refer to it as &quot;companding&quot; while in reality it might mean something else, for example data compression and expansion. This dates back to the late &#x27;80s when memory chips were often one of the most costly components in the instrument. Manufacturers usually quoted the amount of memory in its compressed form: i.e. 24 MB of physical waveform ROM in a Korg Trinity is actually 48 MB when uncompressed. Similarly, Roland SR-JV expansion boards were usually advertised as 8 MB boards with &#x27;16 MB-equivalent content&#x27;. Careless copying of this technical information, omitting the &quot;equivalence&quot; reference, can often cause confusion.

<text>In electronics, a comparator is a device that compares two voltages or currents and outputs a digital signal indicating which is larger. It has two analog input terminals formula_1 and formula_2 and one binary digital output formula_3. The output is ideally
: formula_4
A comparator consists of a specialized high-gain differential amplifier. They are commonly used in devices that measure and digitize analog signals, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), as well as relaxation oscillators.

==Differential voltage==

The differential voltages must stay within the limits specified by the manufacturer. Early integrated comparators, like the LM111 family, and certain high-speed comparators like the LM119 family, require differential voltage ranges substantially lower than the power-supply voltages (±15 V vs. 36 V). &quot;Rail-to-rail&quot; comparators allow any differential voltages within the power-supply range. When powered from a bipolar (dual rail) supply, 
: formula_5

or when powered from an unipolar TTL/CMOS power supply,

: formula_6.

Specific rail-to-rail comparators with p–n–p input transistors, like the LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3 volts &quot;below&quot; the negative supply rail, but do not allow it to rise above the positive rail. Specific ultra-fast comparators, like the LMH7322, allow the input signal to swing below the negative rail &quot;and&quot; above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2 V. Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.

==Op-amp voltage comparator==
An operational amplifier (op-amp) has a well balanced difference input and a very high gain. This parallels the characteristics of comparators and can be substituted in applications with low-performance requirements.

A comparator circuit compares two voltages and outputs either a 1 (the voltage at the plus side) or a 0 (the voltage at the negative side) to indicate which is larger. Comparators are often used, for example, to check whether an input has reached some predetermined value. In most cases a comparator is implemented using a dedicated comparator IC, but op-amps may be used as an alternative. Comparator diagrams and op-amp diagrams use the same symbols.

A simple comparator circuit made using an op-amp without feedback simply heavily amplifies the voltage difference between Vin and VREF and outputs the result as Vout. If Vin is greater than VREF, then voltage at Vout will rise to its positive saturation level; that is, to the voltage at the positive side. If Vin is lower than VREF, then Vout will fall to its negative saturation level, equal to the voltage at the negative side.

In practice, this circuit can be improved by incorporating a hysteresis voltage range to reduce its sensitivity to noise.

Because of the difference in characteristics of an operational amplifier and comparator, using an operational amplifier as a comparator presents several disadvantages as compared to using a dedicated comparator.

# Op-amps are designed to operate in the linear mode with negative feedback. Hence, an op-amp typically has a lengthy recovery time from saturation. Almost all op-amps have an internal compensation capacitor which imposes slew rate limitations for high frequency signals. Consequently, an op-amp makes a sloppy comparator with propagation delays that can be as long as tens of microseconds.
# Since op-amps do not have any internal hysteresis, an external hysteresis network is always necessary for slow moving input signals.
# The quiescent current specification of an op-amp is valid only when the feedback is active. Some op-amps show an increased quiescent current when the inputs are not equal.
# A comparator is designed to produce well-limited output voltages that easily interface with digital logic. Compatibility with digital logic must be verified while using an op-amp as a comparator.
# Some multiple-section op-amps may exhibit extreme channel-channel interaction when used as comparators.
# Many op-amps have back to back diodes between their inputs. Op-amp inputs usually follow each other so this is fine. But comparator inputs are not usually the same. The diodes can cause unexpected current through inputs.

==Design==

A comparator consists of a high gain differential amplifier whose output is compatible with the logic gates used in the digital circuit. The gain is high enough that a very small difference between the input voltages will saturate the output, the output voltage will be in either the low logic voltage band or the high logic voltage band of the gate input. Analogue op amps have been used as comparators, however a dedicated comparator chip will generally be faster than a general-purpose operational amplifier used as a comparator, and may also contain additional features such as an accurate, internal reference voltage, adjustable hysteresis, and a clock gated input.

A dedicated voltage comparator chip such as LM339 is designed to interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog-to-digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just the equivalent of a cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large p–n junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.

=== Open collector output ===

Some comparators (e.g. LM339) use open collector output to help interface to different logic families. When the inverting input is at a higher voltage than the non inverting input, the output of the comparator connects to the negative power supply. When the non inverting input is higher than the inverting input, the output is high impedance, so the output voltage in this state can be set by an external pull-up resistor to a different voltage supply.

==Key specifications==
While it is easy to understand the basic task of a comparator, that is, comparing two voltages or currents, several parameters must be considered while selecting a suitable comparator:

===Speed and power===
While in general comparators are &quot;fast,&quot; their circuits are not immune to the classic speed-power tradeoff. High speed comparators use transistors with larger aspect ratios and hence also consume more power. Depending on the application, select either a comparator with high speed or one that saves power. For example, nano-powered comparators in space-saving chip-scale packages (UCSP), DFN or SC70 packages such as MAX9027,&lt;ref name=qv_pk/4268&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; LTC1540, LPV7215, MAX9060,&lt;ref name=qv_pk/5823&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and MCP6541, are ideal for ultra-low-power, portable applications. Likewise if a comparator is needed to implement a relaxation oscillator circuit to create a high speed clock signal then comparators having few nano seconds of propagation delay may be suitable. ADCMP572 (CML output), LMH7220 (LVDS Output), MAX999 (CMOS output / TTL output), LT1719 (CMOS output / TTL output), MAX9010 (TTL output), and MAX9601 (PECL output), are examples of some good high speed comparators.

===Hysteresis===
A comparator normally changes its output state when the voltage between its inputs crosses through approximately zero volts. Small voltage fluctuations due to noise, always present on the inputs, can cause undesirable rapid changes between the two output states when the input voltage difference is near zero volts. To prevent this output oscillation, a small hysteresis of a few millivolts is integrated into many modern comparators. 
For example, the LTC6702, MAX9021, and MAX9031, have internal hysteresis desensitizing them from input noise. In place of one switching point, hysteresis introduces two: one for rising voltages, and one for falling voltages. The difference between the higher-level trip value (VTRIP+) and the lower-level trip value (VTRIP-) equals the hysteresis voltage (VHYST).

If the comparator does not have internal hysteresis or if the input noise is greater than the internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting Schmitt trigger circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as LMP7300, LTC1540, MAX931, MAX971,&lt;ref name=qv_pk/1279&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and ADCMP341, also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.

===Output type===
Because comparators have only two output states, their outputs are either near zero or near the supply voltage. Bipolar rail-to-rail comparators have a common-emitter output that produces a small voltage drop between the output and each rail. That drop is equal to the collector-to-emitter voltage of a saturated transistor. When output currents are light, output voltages of CMOS rail-to-rail comparators, which rely on a saturated MOSFET, range closer to the rail voltages than their bipolar counterparts.

On the basis of outputs, comparators can also be classified as open-drain or push–pull. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull-up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open-drain comparators are more suitable for mixed-voltage system design. Since the output has high impedance for logic high level, open-drain comparators can also be used to connect multiple comparators to a single bus. Push–pull output does not need a pull-up resistor and can also source current, unlike an open-drain output.

===Internal reference===
The most frequent application for comparators is the comparison between a voltage and a stable reference. TL431 is widely used for this purpose. Most comparator manufacturers also offer comparators in which a reference voltage is integrated on to the chip. Combining the reference and comparator in one chip not only saves space, but also draws less supply current than a comparator with an external reference. ICs with wide range of references are available such as MAX9062 (200 mV reference), LT6700 (400 mV reference), ADCMP350 (600 mV reference), MAX9025 (1.236 V reference), MAX9040 (2.048 V reference), TLV3012 (1.24 V reference), and TSM109 (2.5 V reference). 

===Continuous versus clocked===
A continuous comparator will output either a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot; any time a high or low signal is applied to its input and will change quickly when the inputs are updated. However, many applications only require comparator outputs at certain instances, such as in A/D converters and memory. By only strobing a comparator at certain intervals, higher accuracy and lower power can be achieved with a clocked (or dynamic) comparator structure, also called a latched comparator. Often latched comparators employ strong positive feedback for a &quot;regeneration phase&quot; when a clock is high, and have a &quot;reset phase&quot; when the clock is low. 
This is in contrast to a continuous comparator, which can only employ weak positive feedback since there is no reset period.

==Applications==
===Null detectors===
A null detector identifies when a given value is zero. Comparators are ideal for null detection comparison measurements, since they are equivalent to a very high gain amplifier with well-balanced inputs and controlled output limits. The null detector circuit compares two input voltages: an unknown voltage and a reference voltage, usually referred to as vu and vr. The reference voltage is usually on the non-inverting input (+), while the unknown voltage is usually on the inverting input (−). (A circuit diagram would display the inputs according to their sign with respect to the output when a particular input is greater than the other.) Unless the inputs are nearly equal (see below), the output is either positive or negative, for example ±12 V. In the case of a null detector the aim is to detect when the input voltages are nearly equal, which gives the value of the unknown voltage since the reference voltage is known.

When using a comparator as a null detector, accuracy is limited; an output of zero is given whenever the magnitude of the voltage difference multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is within the voltage limits. For example, if the gain is 106, and the voltage limits are ±6 V, then an output of zero will be given if the voltage difference is less than 6 μV. One could refer to this as a fundamental uncertainty in the measurement.

===Zero-crossing detectors===
For this type of detector, a comparator detects each time an AC pulse changes polarity. The output of the comparator changes state each time the pulse changes its polarity, that is the output is HI (high) for a positive pulse and LO (low) for a negative pulse squares the input signal.

===Relaxation oscillator===
A comparator can be used to build a relaxation oscillator. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a Schmitt trigger configuration. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.

===Level shifter===

This circuit requires only a single comparator with an open-drain output as in the LM393, TLV3011, or MAX9028. The circuit provides great flexibility in choosing the voltages to be translated by using a suitable pull up voltage. It also allows the translation of bipolar ±5 V logic to unipolar 3 V logic by using a comparator like the MAX972.

===Analog-to-digital converters===
When a comparator performs the function of telling if an input voltage is above or below a given threshold, it is essentially performing a 1-bit quantization. This function is used in nearly all analog to digital converters (such as flash, pipeline, successive approximation, delta-sigma modulation, folding, interpolating, dual-slope and others) in combination with other devices to achieve a multi-bit quantization.

===Window detectors===
Comparators can also be used as window detectors. In a window detector, a comparator is used to compare two voltages and determine whether a given input voltage is under voltage or over voltage.

===Absolute-value detectors===
Comparators can be used to create absolute-value detectors. In an absolute-value detector, two comparators and a digital logic gate are used to compare the absolute values of two voltages.

<doc id="40931" wikidata="Q5156161" url="?curid=40931" title="Compatible sideband transmission">
<text>A Compatible sideband transmission, also known as [[amplitude modulation]] equivalent (AME) or [[Single sideband]] reduced-carrier (SSB-RC), is a type of single sideband RF modulation in which the carrier is deliberately reinserted at a lower level after its normal suppression to permit reception by conventional AM receivers. The general convention is to filter the lower-sideband, and communicate using only the upper-sideband and a partial carrier. 
The benefits of compatible-sideband over conventional AM are increased spectral efficiency due to a reduction in bandwidth of 50% as well as a decrease in wasted power. 
By using compatible sideband instead of AM, less RF power is required at the transmitter to transmit the same quality of signal the same distance. This results in compatible sideband being almost 100% power-efficient, where regular AM is comparably only 16% power-efficient (84% of RF power wasted). 

This modulation was first used by the first West-German longwave transmitter between 1953 and 1962, which worked on 151 kHz and is currently mostly used in high frequency military communications.

<doc id="40936" wikidata="Q726686" url="?curid=40936" title="Compromise">
<text>To compromise is to make a deal between different parties where each party gives up part of their demand. In arguments, compromise means finding through communication, through a mutual acceptance of terms—often involving variations from an original goal or desires. Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system.

Research indicates that suboptimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party, leading them to settle for suboptimal agreements. Mutually better outcomes can often be found by careful investigation of both parties&#x27; interests, especially if done early in negotiations.

The compromise solution of a multicriteria decision making or multi-criteria decision analysis problem that is the closest to the ideal could be determined by the VIKOR method, which provides a maximum utility of the majority, and a minimum individual regret of the opponent.

== Politics ==
In international politics, compromises often discussed include infamous deals with dictators, such as Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement of Adolf Hitler. Margalit calls these &quot;rotten compromises.&quot; In the United States and other democratic countries , many politicians of recent times permanently campaign to gain reelection. Thus, United States Ambassador to Germany Amy Gutmann and political scientist Dennis F. Thompson have observed that compromise is more difficult. The problem of political compromise in general is an important subject in political ethics.

Politicians being willing to compromise can reduce partisanship and hostility. Politics is sometimes called the &quot;art of compromise&quot;. Polling by the American Survey Center indicates that Americans take a favorable view of political compromise.

== Human relationships ==
In human relationships, &quot;compromise&quot; can make no party happy because the parties involved feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little. Compromise may be referred to as capitulation, a &quot;surrender&quot; of objectives, principles, or material. Extremism is often considered as an antonym to compromise, which, depending on context, may be associated with concepts of balance and tolerance.

<doc id="40940" wikidata="Q1783614" url="?curid=40940" title="Concentrator">
<text>In telecommunications, the term concentrator has the following meanings:

* In data transmission, a functional unit that permits a common path to handle more data sources than there are channels currently available within the path. A concentrator usually provides communication capability between many low-speed, usually asynchronous channels and one or more high-speed, usually synchronous channels. Usually different speeds, codes, and protocols can be accommodated on the low-speed side. The low-speed channels usually operate in contention and require buffering.
* A device that connects a number of links with only one destination, the main function of this device is to make a kind of load balancing between two or more servers connected together, data distribution is done according to the server processing rate.
* A patch panel or other component in the cable plant where cable runs converge.
* ISP used concentrators to enable modem dialing; this kind of concentrator is sometimes called a modem concentrator or a remote access concentrator. The term &quot;access concentrator&quot; is also used to describe similar provider edge equipment used in computer networks that doesn&#x27;t rely on modems anymore, e.g. FTTH.

==Theory==
In the evolution of modern telecommunications systems there was a requirement to connect large numbers of low-speed access devices with large telephone company &#x27;central office&#x27; switches over common paths. During the first generations of digital networks, analog signals were digitized on line cards attached to the telephone exchange switches. In an effort to reduce local loop costs, it was decided to push this conversion closer to the customer premises by deploying small conversion devices in customer neighborhoods. These devices would combine multiple digital signals on a single link to a larger telephone switch, which would provide service to the customer. These devices were initially called remote concentrators or simply remotes.

In fibre-optic distribution systems which offer triple-play services (voice, television, internet) the digitization has arrived at the customer premises and signals are digitized at the source and combined using customer edge routers. This traffic enters the distribution network at an Optical Network Termination and is carried to the central office using Wavelength division multiplexing and Passive optical networking.

<text>Configuration management (CM) is a management process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product&#x27;s performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life. The CM process is widely used by military engineering organizations to manage changes throughout the system lifecycle of complex systems, such as weapon systems, military vehicles, and information systems. Outside the military, the CM process is also used with IT service management as defined by ITIL, and with other domain models in the civil engineering and other industrial engineering segments such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings.

==Introduction==
CM applied over the life cycle of a system provides visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of system information and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned manyfold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and sometimes can have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.

CM emphasizes the functional relation between parts, subsystems, and systems for effectively controlling system change. It helps to verify that proposed changes are systematically considered to minimize adverse effects. Changes to the system are proposed, evaluated, and implemented using a standardized, systematic approach that ensures consistency, and proposed changes are evaluated in terms of their anticipated impact on the entire system. CM verifies that changes are carried out as prescribed and that documentation of items and systems reflects their true configuration. A complete CM program includes provisions for the storing, tracking, and updating of all system information on a component, subsystem, and system basis.

A structured CM program ensures that documentation (e.g., requirements, design, test, and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate and consistent with the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is not consistent with the item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change. This reverse engineering process is wasteful in terms of human and other resources and can be minimized or eliminated using CM.

==History==
Configuration Management originated in the United States Department of Defense in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and it is now a standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of military standards called the &quot;480 series&quot; (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the &quot;480 series&quot; was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry technical standards supported by standards developing organizations (SDO). This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, ANSI–EIA–649–1998. Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline&#x27;s concepts include systems engineering (SE), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 9000, Prince2 project management method, COBIT, ITIL, product lifecycle management, and Application Lifecycle Management. Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.

==Overview==
CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time. CM implements the policies, procedures, techniques, and tools that manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes. CM programs and plans provide technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation of the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes, and resources required to successfully develop and support a complex system. During system development, CM allows program management to track requirements throughout the life-cycle through acceptance and operations and maintenance. As changes inevitably occur in the requirements and design, they must be approved and documented, creating an accurate record of the system status. Ideally the CM process is applied throughout the system lifecycle. Most professionals mix up or get confused with Asset management (AM, see also ISO/IEC 19770), where it inventories the assets on hand. The key difference between CM and AM is that the former does not manage the financial accounting aspect but on service that the system supports or in other words, that the later (AM) is trying to realize value from an IT asset.

The CM process for both hardware- and software-configuration items comprises five distinct disciplines as established in the MIL–HDBK–61A and in ANSI/EIA-649. Members of an organization interested in applying a standard change-management process will employ these disciplines as policies and procedures for establishing baselines, manage and control change, and monitor and assess the effectiveness and correctness of progress. The IEEE 12207 process IEEE 12207.2 also has these activities and adds &quot;Release management and delivery&quot;.
The five disciplines are:

# CM Planning and Management: a formal document and plan to guide the CM program that includes items such as:
#* Personnel
#* Responsibilities and resources
#* Training requirements
#* Administrative meeting guidelines, including a definition of procedures and tools
#* Baselining processes
#* Configuration control and configuration-status accounting
#* Naming conventions
#* Audits and reviews
#* Subcontractor/vendor CM requirements
# Configuration Identification (CI): consists of setting and maintaining baselines, which define the system or subsystem architecture, components, and any developments at any point in time. It is the basis by which changes to any part of a system are identified, documented, and later tracked through design, development, testing, and final delivery. CI incrementally establishes and maintains the definitive current basis for Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) of a system and its configuration items (CIs) throughout their lifecycle (development, production, deployment, and operational support) until disposal.
# Configuration Control: includes the evaluation of all change-requests and change-proposals, and their subsequent approval or disapproval. It covers the process of controlling modifications to the system&#x27;s design, hardware, firmware, software, and documentation.
# Configuration Status Accounting: includes the process of recording and reporting configuration item descriptions (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, etc.) and all departures from the baseline during design and production. In the event of suspected problems, the verification of baseline configuration and approved modifications can be quickly determined.
# Configuration Verification and Audit: an independent review of hardware and software for the purpose of assessing compliance with established performance requirements, commercial and appropriate military standards, and functional, allocated, and product baselines. Configuration audits verify that the system and subsystem configuration documentation complies with the functional and physical performance characteristics before acceptance into an architectural baseline.

==Software==

The software configuration management (SCM) process is looked upon by practitioners as the best solution to handling changes in software projects. It identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.

The SCM process further defines the need to trace changes, and the ability to verify that the final delivered software has all of the planned enhancements that are supposed to be included in the release. It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are:
# Configuration identification
# Configuration control
# Configuration status accounting
# Configuration audits

These terms and definitions change from standard to standard, but are essentially the same.
* Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item. A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose. These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. Baselining an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.
* Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item&#x27;s attributes and to re-baseline them.
* Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time.
* Configuration audits are broken into functional and physical configuration audits. They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change. A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation.

===Configuration management database===

ITIL specifies the use of a configuration management system (CMS) or configuration management database (CMDB) as a means of achieving industry best practices for Configuration Management. CMDBs are used to track Configuration Items (CIs) and the dependencies between them, where CIs represent the things in an enterprise that are worth tracking and managing, such as but not limited to computers, software, software licenses, racks, network devices, storage, and even the components within such items. CMS helps manage a federated collection of CMDBs.

The benefits of a CMS/CMDB includes being able to perform functions like root cause analysis, impact analysis, change management, and current state assessment for future state strategy development. 

&quot;Configuration Management&quot; (CM) is an ITIL-specific ITSM process that tracks all of the individual CIs in an IT system which may be as simple as a single server, or as complex as the entire IT department. In large organizations a configuration manager may be appointed to oversee and manage the CM process. In ITIL version 3, this process has been renamed as &quot;Service Asset and Configuration Management&quot;.

===Information assurance===
For information assurance, CM can be defined as the management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to hardware, software, firmware, documentation, test, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the life cycle of an information system. CM for information assurance, sometimes referred to as &quot;secure configuration management&quot; (SCM), relies upon performance, functional, and physical attributes of IT platforms and products and their environments to determine the appropriate security features and assurances that are used to measure a system configuration state. For example, configuration requirements may be different for a network firewall that functions as part of an organization&#x27;s Internet boundary versus one that functions as an internal local network firewall.

==Maintenance systems==
Configuration management is used to maintain an understanding of the status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of serviceability for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.

In the military, this type of activity is often classed as &quot;mission readiness&quot;, and seeks to define which assets are available and for which type of mission; a classic example is whether aircraft on board an aircraft carrier are equipped with bombs for ground support or missiles for defense.

===Operating system configuration management===
Configuration management can be used to maintain OS configuration files. Many of these systems utilize Infrastructure as Code to define and maintain configuration.

The Promise theory of configuration maintenance was developed by Mark Burgess, with a practical implementation on present day computer systems in the software CFEngine able to perform real time repair as well as preventive maintenance.

===Preventive maintenance===

Understanding the &quot;as is&quot; state of an asset and its major components is an essential element in preventive maintenance as used in maintenance, repair, and overhaul and enterprise asset management systems.

Complex assets such as aircraft, ships, industrial machinery etc. depend on many different components being serviceable. This serviceability is often defined in terms of the amount of usage the component has had since it was new, since fitted, since repaired, the amount of use it has had over its life and several other limiting factors. Understanding how near the end of their life each of these components is has been a major undertaking involving labor-intensive record keeping until recent developments in software.

===Predictive maintenance===

Many types of component use electronic sensors to capture data which provides live condition monitoring. This data is analyzed on board or at a remote location by computer to evaluate its current serviceability and increasingly its likely future state using algorithms which predict potential future failures based on previous examples of failure through field experience and modeling. This is the basis for &quot;predictive maintenance&quot;.

Availability of accurate and timely data is essential in order for CM to provide operational value and a lack of this can often be a limiting factor. Capturing and disseminating the operating data to the various support organizations is becoming an industry in itself.

The consumers of this data have grown more numerous and complex with the growth of programs offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These are designed to offer operators guaranteed availability and make the picture more complex with the operator managing the asset but the OEM taking on the liability to ensure its serviceability.

==Construction==
More recently configuration management has been applied to large construction projects which can often be very complex and have a huge number of details and changes that need to be documented. Construction agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration have used configuration management for their infrastructure projects. There are construction-based configuration management tools that aim to document change orders and RFIs in order to ensure a project stays on schedule and on budget. These programs can also store information to aid in the maintenance and modification of the infrastructure when it is completed. One such application, CCSNet, was tested in a case study funded by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) in which the efficacy of configuration management was measured through comparing the approximately 80% complete construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency (LACMTA) first and second segments of the Red Line, a $5.3 billion rail construction project. This study yielded results indicating a benefit to using configuration management on projects of this nature.

<doc id="40950" wikidata="Q727896" url="?curid=40950" title="Connectionless communication">
<text>Connectionless communication, often referred to as CL-mode communication, is a data transmission method used in packet switching networks, using data packets that are frequently called datagrams, in which each data packet is individually addressed and routed based on information carried in each packet, rather than in the setup information of a prearranged, fixed data channel as in connection-oriented communication. Connectionless protocols are usually described as stateless protocols, the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are examples.

==Attributes==
Under connectionless communication between two network endpoints, a message can be sent from one endpoint to another without prior arrangement. The device at one end of the communication transmits data addressed to the other, without first ensuring that the recipient is available and ready to receive the data. Some protocols allow for error correction by requesting retransmission.

Connectionless protocols are stateless protocols because the endpoints have no protocol-defined way to remember where they are in a &quot;conversation&quot; of message exchanges. It has lower overhead than connection-oriented communication because, in connection-oriented communication, the communicating peers must first establish a logical or physical data channel or &quot;connection&quot; in a dialog preceding the exchange of user data. It allows for multicast and broadcast operations in which the same data are transmitted to several recipients in a single transmission.

In connectionless transmissions the service provider usually cannot guarantee that there will be no loss, error insertion, misdelivery, duplication, or out-of-sequence delivery of the packet. However, the effect of errors may be reduced by implementing error correction within an application protocol.

In connectionless mode, there is less opportunity for optimization when sending several data units between the same two peers. By establishing a connection at the beginning of such a data exchange the components (routers, bridges) along the network path would be able to pre-compute (and hence cache) routing-related information, avoiding re-computation for every packet. In connection-oriented communication, network components can also reserve capacity for the transfer of the subsequent data units of a video download, for example.

==Architecture and implementations==
Distinction between connectionless and connection-oriented transmission may take place at several layers of the OSI Reference Model:
* Transport layer: TCP is a connection-oriented transport protocol. UDP is connectionless.
* Network layer.
* Data link layer: The IEEE 802.2 protocol at the Logical Link Control sublayer of the data link layer may provide both connectionless and connection-oriented services. In fact, some network protocols (such as SNA&#x27;s Path Control in its early stages) require a connection-oriented data link layer. Others (like IP) do not. (After the appearance of APPN, SNA could operate on a connectionless data link service as well.)

Notable connectionless protocols are: Internet Protocol (IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), Transparent Inter-process Communication, NetBIOS, and Fast and Secure Protocol (FASP).

<text>In telecommunication, a convolutional code is a type of error-correcting code that generates parity symbols via the sliding application of a boolean polynomial function to a data stream. The sliding application represents the &#x27;convolution&#x27; of the encoder over the data, which gives rise to the term &#x27;convolutional coding&#x27;. The sliding nature of the convolutional codes facilitates trellis decoding using a time-invariant trellis. Time invariant trellis decoding allows convolutional codes to be maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoded with reasonable complexity.

The ability to perform economical maximum likelihood soft decision decoding is one of the major benefits of convolutional codes. This is in contrast to classic block codes, which are generally represented by a time-variant trellis and therefore are typically hard-decision decoded. Convolutional codes are often characterized by the base code rate and the depth (or memory) of the encoder formula_1. The base code rate is typically given as formula_2, where is the raw input data rate and is the data rate of output channel encoded stream. is less than because channel coding inserts redundancy in the input bits. The memory is often called the &quot;constraint length&quot; , where the output is a function of the current input as well as the previous formula_3 inputs. The depth may also be given as the number of memory elements in the polynomial or the maximum possible number of states of the encoder (typically: formula_4).

Convolutional codes are often described as continuous. However, it may also be said that convolutional codes have arbitrary block length, rather than being continuous, since most real-world convolutional encoding is performed on blocks of data. Convolutionally encoded block codes typically employ termination. The arbitrary block length of convolutional codes can also be contrasted to classic block codes, which generally have fixed block lengths that are determined by algebraic properties.

The code rate of a convolutional code is commonly modified via symbol puncturing. For example, a convolutional code with a &#x27;mother&#x27; code rate formula_5 may be punctured to a higher rate of, for example, formula_6 simply by not transmitting a portion of code symbols. The performance of a punctured convolutional code generally scales well with the amount of parity transmitted. The ability to perform economical soft decision decoding on convolutional codes, as well as the block length and code rate flexibility of convolutional codes, makes them very popular for digital communications.

== History ==
Convolutional codes were introduced in 1955 by Peter Elias. It was thought that convolutional codes could be decoded with arbitrary quality at the expense of computation and delay. In 1967, Andrew Viterbi determined that convolutional codes could be maximum-likelihood decoded with reasonable complexity using time invariant trellis based decoders — the Viterbi algorithm. Other trellis-based decoder algorithms were later developed, including the BCJR decoding algorithm.

Recursive systematic convolutional codes were invented by Claude Berrou around 1991. These codes proved especially useful for iterative processing including the processing of concatenated codes such as turbo codes.

Using the &quot;convolutional&quot; terminology, a classic convolutional code might be considered a Finite impulse response (FIR) filter, while a recursive convolutional code might be considered an Infinite impulse response (IIR) filter.

== Where convolutional codes are used ==
Convolutional codes are used extensively to achieve reliable data transfer in numerous applications, such as digital video, radio, mobile communications (e.g., in GSM, GPRS, EDGE and 3G networks (until 3GPP Release 7)) and satellite communications. These codes are often implemented in concatenation with a hard-decision code, particularly Reed–Solomon. Prior to turbo codes such constructions were the most efficient, coming closest to the Shannon limit.

== Convolutional encoding ==
To convolutionally encode data, start with &quot;k&quot; memory registers, each holding one input bit. Unless otherwise specified, all memory registers start with a value of 0. The encoder has &quot;n&quot; modulo-2 adders (a modulo 2 adder can be implemented with a single Boolean XOR gate, where the logic is: , , , ), and &quot;n&quot; generator polynomials — one for each adder (see figure below). An input bit &quot;m&quot;1 is fed into the leftmost register. Using the generator polynomials and the existing values in the remaining registers, the encoder outputs &quot;n&quot; symbols. These symbols may be transmitted or punctured depending on the desired code rate. Now bit shift all register values to the right (&quot;m&quot;1 moves to &quot;m&quot;0, &quot;m&quot;0 moves to &quot;m&quot;−1) and wait for the next input bit. If there are no remaining input bits, the encoder continues shifting until all registers have returned to the zero state (flush bit termination).

The figure below is a rate () encoder with constraint length (&quot;k&quot;) of 3. Generator polynomials are , and . Therefore, output bits are calculated (modulo 2) as follows:
:&quot;n&quot;1 = &quot;m&quot;1 + &quot;m&quot;0 + &quot;m&quot;−1
:&quot;n&quot;2 = &quot;m&quot;0 + &quot;m&quot;−1
:&quot;n&quot;3 = &quot;m&quot;1 + &quot;m&quot;−1.

Convolutional codes can be systematic and non-systematic:

* systematic repeats the structure of the message before encoding
* non-systematic changes the initial structure

Non-systematic convolutional codes are more popular due to better noise immunity. It relates to the free distance of the convolutional code.

== Recursive and non-recursive codes ==
The encoder on the picture above is a &quot;non-recursive&quot; encoder. Here&#x27;s an example of a recursive one and as such it admits a feedback structure:

The example encoder is &quot;systematic&quot; because the input data is also used in the output symbols (Output 2). Codes with output symbols that do not include the input data are called &quot;non-systematic.&quot;

Recursive codes are typically systematic and, conversely, non-recursive codes are typically non-systematic. It isn&#x27;t a strict requirement, but a common practice.

The example encoder in Img. 2. is an 8-state encoder because the 3 registers will create 8 possible encoder states (23). A corresponding decoder trellis will typically use 8 states as well.

Recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes have become more popular due to their use in Turbo Codes. Recursive systematic codes are also referred to as pseudo-systematic codes.

Other RSC codes and example applications include:

Useful for LDPC code implementation and as inner constituent code for serial concatenated convolutional codes (SCCC&#x27;s).

Useful for SCCC&#x27;s and multidimensional turbo codes.

Useful as constituent code in low error rate turbo codes for applications such as satellite links. Also suitable as SCCC outer code.

== Impulse response, transfer function, and constraint length ==
A convolutional encoder is called so because it performs a &quot;convolution&quot; of the input stream with the encoder&#x27;s &quot;impulse responses&quot;:

:formula_7

where is an input sequence, is a sequence from output , is an impulse response for output and formula_8 denotes convolution.

A convolutional encoder is a discrete linear time-invariant system. Every output of an encoder can be described by its own transfer function, which is closely related to the generator polynomial. An impulse response is connected with a transfer function through Z-transform.

Transfer functions for the first (non-recursive) encoder are:
* formula_9
* formula_10
* formula_11

Transfer functions for the second (recursive) encoder are:
* formula_12
* formula_13

Define by
: formula_14

where, for any rational function formula_15,
: formula_16.

Then is the maximum of the polynomial degrees of the

formula_17, and the &quot;constraint length&quot; is defined as formula_18. For instance, in the first example the constraint length is 3, and in the second the constraint length is 4.

== Trellis diagram ==
A convolutional encoder is a finite state machine. An encoder with &quot;n&quot; binary cells will have 2&quot;n&quot; states.

Imagine that the encoder (shown on Img.1, above) has &#x27;1&#x27; in the left memory cell (&quot;m&quot;0), and &#x27;0&#x27; in the right one (&quot;m&quot;−1). (&quot;m&quot;1 is not really a memory cell because it represents a current value). We will designate such a state as &quot;10&quot;. According to an input bit the encoder at the next turn can convert either to the &quot;01&quot; state or the &quot;11&quot; state. One can see that not all transitions are possible for (e.g., a decoder can&#x27;t convert from &quot;10&quot; state to &quot;00&quot; or even stay in &quot;10&quot; state).

All possible transitions can be shown as below:

An actual encoded sequence can be represented as a path on this graph. One valid path is shown in red as an example.

This diagram gives us an idea about &quot;decoding&quot;: if a received sequence doesn&#x27;t fit this graph, then it was received with errors, and we must choose the nearest &quot;correct&quot; (fitting the graph) sequence. The real decoding algorithms exploit this idea.

== Free distance and error distribution ==
The free distance (&quot;d&quot;) is the minimal Hamming distance between different encoded sequences. The &quot;correcting capability&quot; (&quot;t&quot;) of a convolutional code is the number of errors that can be corrected by the code. It can be calculated as

:formula_19

Since a convolutional code doesn&#x27;t use blocks, processing instead a continuous bitstream, the value of &quot;t&quot; applies to a quantity of errors located relatively near to each other. That is, multiple groups of &quot;t&quot; errors can usually be fixed when they are relatively far apart.

Free distance can be interpreted as the minimal length of an erroneous &quot;burst&quot; at the output of a convolutional decoder. The fact that errors appear as &quot;bursts&quot; should be accounted for when designing a concatenated code with an inner convolutional code. The popular solution for this problem is to interleave data before convolutional encoding, so that the outer block (usually Reed–Solomon) code can correct most of the errors.

== Decoding convolutional codes ==


Several algorithms exist for decoding convolutional codes. For relatively small values of &quot;k&quot;, the Viterbi algorithm is universally used as it provides maximum likelihood performance and is highly parallelizable. Viterbi decoders are thus easy to implement in VLSI hardware and in software on CPUs with SIMD instruction sets.

Longer constraint length codes are more practically decoded with any of several sequential decoding algorithms, of which the Fano algorithm is the best known. Unlike Viterbi decoding, sequential decoding is not maximum likelihood but its complexity increases only slightly with constraint length, allowing the use of strong, long-constraint-length codes. Such codes were used in the Pioneer program of the early 1970s to Jupiter and Saturn, but gave way to shorter, Viterbi-decoded codes, usually concatenated with large Reed–Solomon error correction codes that steepen the overall bit-error-rate curve and produce extremely low residual undetected error rates.

Both Viterbi and sequential decoding algorithms return hard decisions: the bits that form the most likely codeword. An approximate confidence measure can be added to each bit by use of the Soft output Viterbi algorithm. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) soft decisions for each bit can be obtained by use of the BCJR algorithm.

== Popular convolutional codes ==

In fact, predefined convolutional codes structures obtained during scientific researches are used in the industry. This relates to the possibility to select catastrophic convolutional codes (causes larger number of errors).

An especially popular Viterbi-decoded convolutional code, used at least since the Voyager program, has a constraint length of 7 and a rate &quot;r&quot; of 1/2.

Mars Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rover and the Cassini probe to Saturn use a of 15 and a rate of 1/6; this code performs about 2 dB better than the simpler formula_20 code at a cost of 256× in decoding complexity (compared to Voyager mission codes).

The convolutional code with a constraint length of 2 and a rate of 1/2 is used in GSM as an error correction technique.

== Punctured convolutional codes ==


Convolutional code with any code rate can be designed based on polynomial selection; however, in practice, a puncturing procedure is often used to achieve the required code rate. Puncturing is a technique used to make a &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot; rate code from a &quot;basic&quot; low-rate (e.g., 1/&quot;n&quot;) code. It is achieved by deleting of some bits in the encoder output. Bits are deleted according to a &quot;puncturing matrix&quot;. The following puncturing matrices are the most frequently used:

For example, if we want to make a code with rate 2/3 using the appropriate matrix from the above table, we should take a basic encoder output and transmit every first bit from the first branch and every bit from the second one. The specific order of transmission is defined by the respective communication standard.

Punctured convolutional codes are widely used in the satellite communications, for example, in Intelsat systems and Digital Video Broadcasting.

Punctured convolutional codes are also called &quot;perforated&quot;.

== Turbo codes: replacing convolutional codes ==


Simple Viterbi-decoded convolutional codes are now giving way to turbo codes, a new class of iterated short convolutional codes that closely approach the theoretical limits imposed by Shannon&#x27;s theorem with much less decoding complexity than the Viterbi algorithm on the long convolutional codes that would be required for the same performance. Concatenation with an outer algebraic code (e.g., Reed–Solomon) addresses the issue of error floors inherent to turbo code designs.

<text>In telecommunications, a cord circuit is a switchboard circuit in which a plug-terminated cord is used to establish connections manually between user lines or between trunks and user lines. A number of cord circuits are furnished as part of the switchboard position equipment. The cords may be referred to as front cord and rear cord or trunk cord and station cord. In modern cordless switchboards, the cord-circuit function is switch operated and may be programmable.

In early and middle 20th century telephone exchanges this task was done by a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it a function of the trunk circuit or absorbed it into software.
