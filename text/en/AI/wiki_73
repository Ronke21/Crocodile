<text>Quantum evolution is a component of George Gaylord Simpson&#x27;s multi-tempoed theory of evolution proposed to explain the rapid emergence of higher taxonomic groups in the fossil record. According to Simpson, evolutionary rates differ from group to group and even among closely related lineages. These different rates of evolutionary change were designated by Simpson as &quot;bradytelic&quot; (slow tempo), &quot;horotelic&quot; (medium tempo), and &quot;tachytelic&quot; (rapid tempo). 

Quantum evolution differed from these styles of change in that it involved a drastic shift in the adaptive zones of certain classes of animals. The word &quot;quantum&quot; therefore refers to an &quot;all-or-none reaction&quot;, where transitional forms are particularly unstable, and thereby perish rapidly and completely. Although quantum evolution may happen at any taxonomic level, it plays a much larger role in &quot;the origin taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes.&quot;

==Quantum evolution in plants==

Usage of the phrase &quot;quantum evolution&quot; in plants was apparently first articulated by Verne Grant in 1963 (pp. 458-459). He cited an earlier 1958 paper by Harlan Lewis and Peter H. Raven, wherein Grant asserted that Lewis and Raven gave a &quot;parallel&quot; definition of quantum evolution as defined by Simpson. Lewis and Raven postulated that species in the Genus Clarkia had a mode of speciation that resulted ...as a consequence of a rapid reorganization of the chromosomes due to the presence, at some time, of a genotype conducive to extensive chromosome breakage. A similar mode of origin by rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is suggested for the derivation of other species of Clarkia. In all of these examples the derivative populations grow adjacent to the parental species, which they resemble closely in morphology, but from which they are reproductively isolated because of multiple structural differences in their chromosomes. The spatial relationship of each parental species and its derivative suggests that differentiation has been recent. The repeated occurrence of the same pattern of differentiation in Clarkia suggests that a rapid reorganization of chromosomes has been an important mode of evolution in the genus. This rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is comparable to the systemic mutations proposed by Goldschmidt as a mechanism of macroevolution. In Clarkia, we have not observed marked changes in physiology and pattern of development that could be described as macroevolution. Reorganization of the genomes may, however, set the stage for subsequent evolution along a very different course from that of the ancestral populations

Harlan Lewis refined this concept in a 1962 paper where he coined the term &quot;Catastrophic Speciation&quot; to describe this mode of speciation, since he theorized that the reductions in population size and consequent inbreeding that led to chromosomal rearrangements occurred in small populations that were subject to severe drought.

Leslie D. Gottlieb in his 2003 summary of the subject in plants stated we can define quantum speciation as the budding off of a new and very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, quantum speciation is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both. Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was &quot;unnecessarily restrictive&quot; in identifying cases of sympatric speciation. In this 2003 paper Gottlieb summarized instances of quantum evolution in the plant species Clarkia, Layia, and Stephanomeria.

==Mechanisms==
According to Simpson (1944), quantum evolution resulted from Sewall Wright&#x27;s model of random genetic drift. Simpson believed that major evolutionary transitions would arise when small populations, that were isolated and limited from gene flow, would fixate upon unusual gene combinations. This &quot;inadaptive phase&quot; (caused by genetic drift) would then (by natural selection) drive a deme population from one stable adaptive peak to another on the adaptive fitness landscape. However, in his &quot;Major Features of Evolution&quot; (1953) Simpson wrote that this mechanism was still controversial:

&quot;whether prospective adaptation as prelude to quantum evolution arises adaptively or inadaptively. It was concluded above that it usually arises adaptively . . . . The precise role of, say, genetic drift in this process thus is largely speculative at present. It may have an essential part or none. It surely is not involved in all cases of quantum evolution, but there is a strong possibility that it is often involved. If or when it is involved, it is an initiating mechanism. Drift can only rarely, and only for lower categories, have completed the transition to a new adaptive zone.&quot;

This preference for adaptive over inadaptive forces led Stephen Jay Gould to call attention to the &quot;hardening of the Modern Synthesis&quot;, a trend in the 1950s where adaptationism took precedence over the pluralism of mechanisms common in the 1930s and 40s.

Simpson considered quantum evolution his crowning achievement, being &quot;perhaps the most important outcome of [my] investigation, but also the most controversial and hypothetical.&quot;

<doc id="43055" wikidata="Q103949" url="?curid=43055" title="Buster Keaton">
<text>Joseph Frank &quot;Buster&quot; Keaton (October 4, 1895 – February 1, 1966) was an American actor, comedian and filmmaker. He is best known for his silent films during the 1920s, in which he performed physical comedy and inventive stunts. He frequently maintained a stoic, deadpan facial expression that became his trademark and earned him the nickname &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;.

Keaton was a child vaudeville star, performing as part of his family&#x27;s traveling act. As an adult, he began working with independent producer Joseph M. Schenck and filmmaker Edward F. Cline, with whom he made a series of successful two-reel comedies in the early 1920s, including &quot;One Week&quot; (1920), &quot;The Playhouse&quot; (1921), &quot;Cops&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Electric House&quot; (1922). He then moved to feature-length films; several of them, such as &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; (1924), &quot;The General&quot; (1926), &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Cameraman&quot; (1928), remain highly regarded. &quot;The General&quot; is perhaps his most acclaimed work; Orson Welles considered it &quot;the greatest comedy ever made...and perhaps the greatest film ever made&quot;.

Keaton&#x27;s career declined after 1928, when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence. His first wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He was fired from MGM in 1933, ending his career as a leading man in feature films. He recovered in the 1940s, marrying Eleanor Norris and working as an honored comic performer until the end of his life. During this period, he made cameos in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952), and a variety of television programs. He earned an Academy Honorary Award in 1959. 

Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929&quot; when he &quot;worked without interruption&quot; as having made him &quot;the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, stating that &quot;his films offer belly laughs of mind-boggling physical invention and a spacey determination that nears philosophical grandeur.&quot; In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him as the 21st-greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.

== Career ==

=== Early life in vaudeville ===


Keaton was born into a vaudeville family in Piqua, Kansas, the small town that his mother, Myra Keaton (née Cutler), was visiting at the time. He was named Joseph to continue a tradition on his father&#x27;s side (he was sixth in a line bearing the name Joseph Keaton) and Frank for his maternal grandfather, who disapproved of his parents&#x27; union. His father was Joseph Hallie &quot;Joe&quot; Keaton who had a traveling show called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company, which performed on stage and sold patent medicine on the side. According to a frequently repeated story, which may be apocryphal, Keaton acquired the nickname Buster at the age of 18 months. After the child fell down a long flight of stairs without injury, an actor friend named George Pardey remarked, &quot;Gee whiz, he&#x27;s a regular buster!&quot; After this, Keaton&#x27;s father began to use the nickname to refer to the youngster. Keaton retold the anecdote over the years, including in a 1964 interview with the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Telescope&quot;. In Keaton&#x27;s retelling, he was six months old when the incident occurred, and Harry Houdini gave him the nickname (though the family did not get to know Houdini until later).

At the age of 3, Keaton began performing with his parents in The Three Keatons. He first appeared on stage in 1899 in Wilmington, Delaware. The act was mainly a comedy sketch. Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Keaton performed center stage, both wearing slapsoles, bald-headed wigs and &quot;Irish&quot; beards. The young Keaton goaded his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton responded by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience. A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton&#x27;s clothing to aid with the constant tossing. The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage. This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of child abuse and, occasionally, arrest. However, Keaton was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones. He was eventually billed as &quot;The Little Boy Who Can&#x27;t Be Damaged&quot;, and the overall act as &quot;The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage&quot;. Decades later, Keaton said that he was never hurt by his father and that the falls and physical comedy were a matter of proper technical execution. In 1914, he told the &quot;Detroit News&quot;: &quot;The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand. It&#x27;s a knack. I started so young that landing right is second nature with me. Several times I&#x27;d have been killed if I hadn&#x27;t been able to land like a cat. Imitators of our act don&#x27;t last long, because they can&#x27;t stand the treatment.&quot;

Keaton said he had so much fun that he sometimes began laughing as his father threw him across the stage. Noticing that this caused the audience to laugh less, he adopted his famous deadpan expression when performing. The act ran up against laws banning child performers in vaudeville. According to one biographer, Keaton was made to go to school while performing in New York, but only attended for part of one day. Despite tangles with the law, Keaton was a rising and relatively well-paid star in the theater. He stated that he learned to read and write late, and was taught by his mother. By the time he was 21, his father&#x27;s alcoholism threatened the reputation of the family act, so Keaton and his mother, Myra, left for New York, where Keaton&#x27;s career quickly moved from vaudeville to film.

Keaton served in the American Expeditionary Forces in France with the United States Army&#x27;s 40th Infantry Division during World War I. His unit remained intact and was not broken up to provide replacements, as happened to some other late-arriving divisions. During his time in uniform, he developed an ear infection that permanently impaired his hearing.

===Film===
==== Silent film era ====
Keaton spent the summers of 1908–1916 &quot;at the &#x27;Actor&#x27;s Colony&#x27; in the Bluffton neighborhood of Muskegon, along with other famous vaudevillians.&quot;

In February 1917, he met Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to Joseph M. Schenck. Joe Keaton disapproved of films, and Keaton also had reservations about the medium. During his first meeting with Arbuckle, he was asked to jump in and start acting. Keaton was such a natural in his first film, &quot;The Butcher Boy,&quot; he was hired on the spot. At the end of the day, he asked to borrow one of the cameras to get a feel for how it worked. He took the camera back to his hotel room where he dismantled and reassembled it by morning. Keaton later said that he was soon Arbuckle&#x27;s second director and his entire gag department. He appeared in a total of 14 Arbuckle shorts, running into 1920. They were popular, and contrary to Keaton&#x27;s later reputation as &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, he often smiled and even laughed in them. Keaton and Arbuckle became close friends, and Keaton was one of few people, along with Charlie Chaplin, to defend Arbuckle&#x27;s character during accusations that he was responsible for the death of actress Virginia Rappe. (Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, with an apology from the jury for the ordeal he underwent.)
In 1920, &quot;The Saphead&quot; was released, in which Keaton had his first starring role in a full-length feature film. It was based on a successful play, &quot;The New Henrietta&quot;, which had already been filmed once, under the title &quot;The Lamb&quot;, with Douglas Fairbanks playing the lead. After Keaton&#x27;s successful work with Arbuckle, Schenck gave him his own production unit, Buster Keaton Productions. He made a series of 19 two-reel comedies, including &quot;One Week&quot; (1920), &quot;The Playhouse&quot; (1921), &quot;Cops&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Electric House&quot; (1922). Keaton then moved to full-length features.
Keaton&#x27;s writers included Clyde Bruckman, Joseph Mitchell, and Jean Havez, but the most ingenious gags were generally conceived by Keaton himself. Comedy director Leo McCarey, recalling the freewheeling days of making slapstick comedies, said, &quot;All of us tried to steal each other&#x27;s gagmen. But we had no luck with Keaton because he thought up his best gags himself and we couldn&#x27;t steal &quot;him!&quot;&quot; The more adventurous ideas called for dangerous stunts, performed by Keaton at great physical risk. During the railroad water-tank scene in &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterwards. A scene from &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; required Keaton to stand still on a particular spot. Then, the facade of a two-story building toppled forward on top of Keaton. Keaton&#x27;s character emerged unscathed, due to a single open window. The stunt required precision, because the prop facade weighed two tons, and the window only offered a few inches of clearance around Keaton&#x27;s body. The sequence furnished one of the most memorable images of his career.

Aside from &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; (1928), Keaton&#x27;s most enduring feature-length films include &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923), &quot;Our Hospitality&quot; (1923), &quot;The Navigator&quot; (1924), &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; (1924), &quot;Seven Chances&quot; (1925), &quot;The Cameraman&quot; (1928), and &quot;The General&quot; (1926). &quot;The General&quot;, set during the American Civil War, combined physical comedy with Keaton&#x27;s love of trains, including an epic locomotive chase. Employing picturesque locations, the film&#x27;s storyline reenacted an actual wartime incident. Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton&#x27;s greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time. It was too dramatic for some filmgoers expecting a lightweight comedy, and reviewers questioned Keaton&#x27;s judgment in making a comedic film about the Civil War, even while noting it had a &quot;few laughs&quot;.

It was an expensive misfire (the climactic scene of a locomotive plummeting through a burning bridge was the most expensive single shot in silent-film history), and Keaton was never entrusted with total control over his films again. His distributor, United Artists, insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements. Keaton endured this treatment for two more feature films, and then exchanged his independent setup for employment at Hollywood&#x27;s biggest studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Keaton&#x27;s loss of independence as a filmmaker coincided with the coming of sound films (although he was interested in making the transition) and mounting personal problems, and his career in the early sound era was hurt as a result.

=== New studio, new problems ===
Keaton&#x27;s last three features had been produced and released independently, under Keaton&#x27;s control, and fell short of financial expectations at the box office. In 1928 film executive Nicholas Schenck arranged a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for Keaton&#x27;s services. Keaton had little to say about the details of the MGM contract; he would no longer have any financial responsibility for his films, and even his salary had been pre-negotiated, without his own input. Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd advised him against making the move, cautioning that he would lose his independence. But, given Schenck&#x27;s desire to keep things &quot;in the family&quot; and Keaton&#x27;s having to admit that his independent pictures hadn&#x27;t done well, Keaton agreed to sign with MGM. He would later cite this as the worst business decision of his life in his autobiography.

Welcomed to the studio by Irving Thalberg, with whom he initially had a relationship of mutual admiration, Keaton realized too late that the studio system MGM represented would severely limit his creative input. The giant studio was run along strict factory lines, with everything planned and budgeted in advance. The first of MGM&#x27;s Keaton films was &quot;The Cameraman&quot; (1928), and Keaton sensed trouble immediately when he saw the script. &quot;It was as long as &quot;War and Peace&quot;,&quot; Keaton recalled. &quot;I took out 40 useless characters and a couple of subplots. These guys didn&#x27;t realize—they &quot;still&quot; don&#x27;t realize—that the best comedies are simple. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to do something with a drunk and a fat lady and a kid. Get &#x27;em for me.&#x27; At my studio they would have the characters I wanted in 10 minutes. But not MGM. You had to requisition a toothpick in triplicate. I just stood there, and everybody is hassling.&quot; MGM wanted only Keaton the star, Keaton the creator was considered a waste of time and money because &quot;in the time it took him to develop a project, he could have appeared in two or three pictures set up by the studio&#x27;s production staff.&quot;

When the studio began making talking films, Keaton was enthused about the new technology and wanted to make his next film, &quot;Spite Marriage&quot;, with sound. MGM refused, because the film was more valuable in silent form; it could be shown around the world in theaters that had not converted to sound. Also, soundstages were then at a premium, and MGM usually reserved them for dramatic productions. MGM also forced Keaton to use a stunt double during some of the more dangerous scenes to protect its investment, something he had never done in his heyday: &quot;Stuntmen don&#x27;t get you laughs,&quot; Keaton had said.

In the first Keaton pictures with sound, he and his fellow actors would shoot each scene three times: once in English, once in Spanish, and once in either French or German. The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after. This is discussed in the TCM documentary &quot;Buster Keaton: So Funny it Hurt&quot;, with Keaton complaining about having to shoot lousy films not just once, but three times.

Keaton kept trying to persuade his bosses to let him do things his way. Production head Irving Thalberg would not permit Keaton to create a script from scratch because the studio had already purchased a stage property dating from 1917, &quot;Parlor, Bedroom and Bath&quot;, at the suggestion of Lawrence Weingarten, who was Thalberg&#x27;s brother-in-law and Keaton&#x27;s producer. (&quot;We were desperate. We didn&#x27;t know what to do,&quot; recalled Weingarten.) However, Thalberg did allow Keaton to stage the gags, including long stretches of pantomime, and agreed to send a crew to Keaton&#x27;s own mansion for exterior shots. Keaton&#x27;s relative freedom during this project resulted in a better than usual film. &quot;Apart from its exceptional quality,&quot; writes biographer James Curtis, &quot;the big takeaway from &quot;Parlor, Bedroom and Bath&quot; was its extraordinary commercial success. Performing better at the box office than any of Keaton&#x27;s other MGM talkies, it pulled in worldwide rentals of $985,000 [$20,694,850 in 2024]. With a yield [net profit] of $299,000 [$6,281,990 in 2024], it became the most profitable of all of Buster Keaton&#x27;s features, silent or sound.&quot; Curtis notes that it was also the only one of his MGM features that came in under budget and ahead of schedule. 

The next project confirmed Keaton&#x27;s fears about studio interference. He was handed a script titled &quot;Sidewalks of New York&quot; (1931), in which he played a millionaire becoming involved with a slum-neighborhood girl and a gang of rowdy kids. Keaton thought the premise was totally unsuitable, and was uncomfortable with his directors Jules White and Zion Myers, who emphasized blunt slapstick. &quot;I went over (Weingarten&#x27;s) head and appealed to Irving Thalberg to help get me out of the assignment. Irving was usually on my side, but this time he said, &#x27;Larry likes it. Everybody else in the studio likes the story. You are the only one who doesn&#x27;t.&#x27; In the end, I gave up like a fool and said &#x27;what the hell?&#x27; Who was I to say I was right and everyone was wrong?&quot; The film&#x27;s emphasis on obvious slapstick made it unsuitable for the usual, prestigious Broadway premiere -- it opened simultaneously in two New York side-street theaters -- but the less discriminating audiences in small towns across America flocked to the film, resulting in an ultimate success.

MGM had been featuring comical musician Cliff Edwards in Keaton&#x27;s films. The studio replaced Edwards, who had substance-abuse problems, with nightclub comedian Jimmy Durante. The laconic Keaton and the rambunctious Durante offered enough contrast to function as a team, resulting in three very successful films: &quot;Speak Easily&quot; (1932), &quot;The Passionate Plumber&quot; (1932), and &quot;What! No Beer?&quot; (1933).

Behind the scenes there was trouble. In March 1932 studio chief Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s office requested Keaton to report for work on a Saturday afternoon, to go through the motions of filming a scene for studio visitors. Keaton already had plans to attend a local college-baseball championship, where he was to be the home-team mascot. He sent his regrets to Mayer&#x27;s office and kept his date at the ball game, only to receive a warning from Mayer the following Tuesday, suspending his pay until he resumed working.

Keaton&#x27;s behavior had become erratic by 1932, despondent over working conditions at the studio, and over his wife&#x27;s antagonism toward him at home. This affected his films; he was sometimes visibly intoxicated on- and off-camera. &quot;I got to the stage where I didn&#x27;t give a darn whether school kept or not, and then I started drinking too much,&quot; Keaton told interviewer Tony Thomas. &quot;When I found out that they could write stories and material better than I could anyway, what was the use of my fighting with them?&quot; The demoralized Keaton couldn&#x27;t turn to production chief Irving Thalberg for support, because Thalberg was then on a medical leave that lasted eight months. This left Louis B. Mayer temporarily in sole charge of the studio, which made Keaton&#x27;s standing at MGM even more fragile. Keaton&#x27;s absences were costing the company $3,000 a day ($63,030 in 2024).

The last straw came when Mayer &quot;raided&quot; Keaton&#x27;s dressing room during a wild party with Keaton&#x27;s &quot;cronies and their girlfriends&quot;. MGM staffer Sam Marx remembered the outcome: &quot;Buster ordered him out of the trailer, and Mayer ordered him out of the studio.&quot; Mayer couldn&#x27;t oust him immediately, because Keaton&#x27;s latest picture wasn&#x27;t yet finished. Immediately after Keaton completed retakes on &quot;What! No Beer?&quot;, he was fired &quot;for good and sufficient cause&quot; in a letter signed by Mayer on February 2, 1933.
Keaton had been considered to appear in the studio&#x27;s all-star success &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, only to have his role of the consumptive Kringelein taken by Lionel Barrymore. As &quot;What! No Beer?&quot; was nearing completion, Keaton—&quot;sober, shaved, and calm&quot; as Keaton told his biographer Rudi Blesh—pitched an idea to Irving Thalberg. He wanted to make a feature-length parody of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; with an all-comedy cast: himself in the Lionel Barrymore role, Jimmy Durante in the John Barrymore role, Marie Dressler in the Greta Garbo role, Polly Moran in the Joan Crawford role, Henry Armetta in the Jean Hersholt role, Edward Everett Horton in the Lewis Stone role, and Laurel and Hardy sharing the Wallace Beery role. Edward Sedgwick would be directing. Keaton called his version &quot;Grand Mills Hotel&quot; (after the Mills Hotel, a Bowery flophouse). Thalberg was hesitant about burlesquing the dignified studio&#x27;s own work but, seeing Keaton&#x27;s obvious disappointment, said he&#x27;d think about it.

After Louis B. Mayer had fired Keaton, Thalberg returned to the studio and persuaded Mayer that Keaton was still valuable to the company. Thalberg tried to resurrect Keaton&#x27;s MGM career by offering to go ahead with the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; satire, now retitled &quot;Gland Hotel&quot;. Keaton, still furious at Mayer, refused to return to the studio and Mayer was not about to apologize. So ended Buster Keaton&#x27;s starring career in feature films.

=== European productions ===
In 1934, Keaton accepted an offer to make an independent film in Paris, &quot;Le Roi des Champs-Élysées&quot;; it was not released in the United States. During this period, he made another film in England, &quot;The Invader&quot;. MGM, which needed a certain number of British-made films to comply with a legal quota (see quota quickies), distributed the Keaton film in England but declined to release it in the United States, because the studio had already terminated Keaton&#x27;s employment and was no longer promoting him as one of its stars. &quot;The Invader&quot; was acquired by film importer J. H. Hoffberg in October 1935, and he retitled it &quot;An Old Spanish Custom&quot;. Hoffberg released the film in America on the &quot;states-rights&quot; market, where independent exchanges bought regional rights to the film and offered it to local theaters in their territories.

=== Educational Pictures ===
In 1934, Buster Keaton made a screen comeback in two-reel comedies for Educational Pictures. Most of these 20-minute shorts are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films. Keaton had a free hand in staging the films, within the studio&#x27;s budgetary limits and using its staff writers. The Educational two-reelers have far more pantomime than his earlier talkies, and Keaton is in good form throughout. The high point in the Educational series is &quot;Grand Slam Opera&quot; (1936), featuring Keaton in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant.

The Educational series was very well received by theater owners and movie audiences, and Keaton was the studio&#x27;s most important comedian. He was also its most expensive comedian (earning $2,500 per film, equal to $54,776 in 2024), and when Educational was forced to economize in 1937, the company could no longer afford to maintain two studios. Educational closed its Hollywood studio, thus forfeiting Keaton&#x27;s services, and kept its cheaper New York studio going. The company replaced Keaton with New York-based stage star Willie Howard.

=== Gag writer ===
After Keaton&#x27;s Educational series lapsed, he returned to MGM as a gag writer, supplying material for the final three Marx Brothers MGM films: &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939), &quot;Go West&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941); these were not as artistically successful as the Marxes&#x27; previous MGM features. Keaton also directed three one-reel novelty shorts for the studio, but these did not result in further directorial assignments.

=== Columbia Pictures ===
In 1939, Columbia Pictures hired Keaton to star in two-reel comedies; he filmed two at a time over two years. These 10 films comprise his last series as a starring comedian. Columbia&#x27;s short-subject comedians were generally paid a flat fee of $500 per film. Keaton, considered exceptional, was hired at double the usual rate. The director was usually Jules White, whose emphasis on slapstick and farce made most of these films resemble White&#x27;s famous Three Stooges shorts. White sometimes paired Keaton with a second banana: either veteran comic Monty Collins or raucous comic dancer Elsie Ames. The insistent White directed Keaton whenever possible – to Keaton&#x27;s mild annoyance – and only two Keaton shorts did without White&#x27;s services because they were filmed on location, away from the studio. Those remaining two shorts were directed by Del Lord, a former director for Mack Sennett. Keaton&#x27;s personal favorite was the series&#x27; debut, &quot;Pest from the West&quot;, directed by Lord; it was a shorter, tighter remake of Keaton&#x27;s little-viewed 1935 feature &quot;The Invader&quot;. Trade critics loved it. &quot;Film Daily&quot; raved: &quot;One of the funniest shorts of the season. In fact, of any season. It just goes to prove that this Buster Keaton feller is a natural boxoffice gold mine that is not being mined. When a comedy shown cold in a projection room can make trade press critics howl in their seats, then you can bet your mortgaged theater that it&#x27;s FUNNY [emphasis theirs].&quot;

Moviegoers and exhibitors welcomed Keaton&#x27;s Columbia comedies; and when Columbia began reissuing older comedies to theaters in 1948, Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Pest from the West&quot; was chosen to launch the &quot;Comedy Favorites&quot; series (&quot;A 1939 Buster Keaton film and one of his funniest,&quot; noted &quot;Boxoffice&quot;. &quot;It is good to see Buster back.&quot;) Keaton&#x27;s Columbia shorts came back to theaters from 1948 to 1952, and again from 1962 to 1964. Author John McElwee reports the boxoffice figures: &quot;&quot;Pest from the West&quot;, the first series entry in 1939, brought back domestic rentals of $23,000, and subsequent ones tended to hover around that approximate figure (&quot;Nothing But Pleasure&quot; did $24,000, &quot;General Nuisance&quot; got $26,000). Columbia also realized profits from reissues of the Keatons after the war. &quot;The Spook Speaks&quot; was back for the 1949-50 season, and picked up $24,200, this in addition to the $28,500 it had realized on its initial run.&quot;

=== 1940s and feature films ===
Keaton&#x27;s personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage to MGM dancer Eleanor Norris, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Resuming his daily job as an MGM gag writer, he provided material for Red Skelton and gave help and advice to Lucille Ball.

Keaton accepted various character roles in both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; features. He made his last starring feature, &quot;El Moderno Barba Azul&quot; (1946), in Mexico; the film was a low-budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS videotape in 1986, under the title &quot;Boom in the Moon&quot;. The film has a largely negative reputation, with renowned film historian Kevin Brownlow calling it the worst film ever made.

Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger &quot;prestige&quot; pictures. He had cameos in such films as &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; (1949), &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956). In &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot;, Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together, where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress.

Keaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; (released in 1952), recalling the vaudeville of &quot;The Playhouse&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Seeing Stars&quot;, a minor publicity film produced in 1922, &quot;Limelight&quot; was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film.

=== Television and rediscovery ===

In 1949, comedian Ed Wynn invited Keaton to appear on his CBS Television comedy-variety show, &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot;, which was televised live on the West Coast. Kinescope film prints were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country, since there was no transcontinental coaxial cable until September 1951. Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live (&quot;The Buster Keaton Show&quot;, 1950).

Producer Carl Hittleman mounted a new series, again titled &quot;The Buster Keaton Show&quot;, in 1951. This was an attempt to recreate the first series on film, allowing the program to be broadcast nationwide. The series benefited from a company of veteran actors, including Marcia Mae Jones as the ingenue, Iris Adrian, Dick Wessel, Fuzzy Knight, Dub Taylor, Philip Van Zandt, and his silent-era contemporaries Harold Goodwin, Hank Mann, and stuntman Harvey Parry. Keaton&#x27;s wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Keaton&#x27;s Romeo in a little-theater vignette). Despite the hardworking cast and crew, the series was unsuccessful and only 13 half-hour episodes were filmed. Producer Hittleman audaciously reissued these same episodes in 1952 as though they were entirely new, with the series now titled &quot;Life with Buster Keaton&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reporter Fred Hift reviewed it as a series premiere, noting that it was filmed without a studio audience: the &quot;lack of studio laughter weakened the climax of several of its acts.&quot; The producers fashioned a theatrical, hourlong feature film from the series, intended for the European market: &quot;The Misadventures of Buster Keaton&quot; was released on April 29, 1953 by British Lion, and it began playing on American television in September 1953. &quot;Roughly reproduced slapstick museum piece, it&#x27;s most likely to amuse those too young to remember the real thing,&quot; reported Josh Billings in London&#x27;s &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;. American television syndicators agreed, and marketed &quot;Life with Buster Keaton&quot; as a children&#x27;s show. It continued to play for years afterward on small, low-budget stations.


Keaton&#x27;s periodic television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s helped to revive interest in his silent films. He appeared in the early television series &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;. Whenever a TV show wanted to simulate silent-movie comedy, Keaton answered the call and guested in such successful series as &quot;The Ken Murray Show&quot;, &quot;You Asked for It&quot;, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Well into his fifties, Keaton successfully recreated his old routines, including one stunt in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor. Garry Moore recalled, &quot;I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll show you.&#x27; He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that&#x27;s how he did it—it &quot;hurt&quot;—but you had to care enough not to care.&quot;

=== Silent films revived ===
In 1954, Buster and Eleanor met movie-theater manager Raymond Rohauer, with whom they developed a business partnership to re-release his films. Actor James Mason had bought the Keatons&#x27; house and found numerous cans of films, among which was Keaton&#x27;s long-lost classic &quot;The Boat&quot;. Keaton had prints of the features &quot;Three Ages&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;, and &quot;College&quot; (missing one reel), and the shorts &quot;The Boat&quot; and &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Relations&quot;. Rohauer instructed Keaton to approach Mason for the films, but Mason decided to donate them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Rohauer then formed a new legal entity, Buster Keaton Productions, which gave Rohauer legal access to the old films at the Academy.

On April 3, 1957, Keaton was surprised by Ralph Edwards for the weekly NBC program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. The program also promoted the release of the fictionalized film biography &quot;The Buster Keaton Story&quot; with Donald O&#x27;Connor. In December 1958, Keaton was a guest star in the episode &quot;A Very Merry Christmas&quot; of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; on ABC. He returned to the program in 1965 in the episode &quot;Now You See It, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot;. In August 1960, Keaton played mute King Sextimus the Silent in the national touring company of the Broadway musical &quot;Once Upon A Mattress&quot;. In 1961, he starred in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, which included both silent and sound sequences. He worked with comedian Ernie Kovacs on a television pilot tentatively titled &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, shooting scenes for it on January 12, 1962—the day before Kovacs died in a car crash. &quot;Medicine Man&quot; was completed but not aired.

==Promotional and commercial films==
Buster Keaton found steady work as an actor in TV commercials for Colgate, Alka-Seltzer, U.S. Steel, 7-Up, RCA Victor, Phillips 66, Milky Way, Ford Motors, Minit-Rub, and Budweiser, among others. In a series of pantomime television commercials for Simon Pure Beer made in 1962 by Jim Mohr in Buffalo, New York, Keaton revisited some of the gags from his silent-film days.

In 1961, Keaton appeared in promotional films for Maryvale, a housing development in the western part of Phoenix.

==Return to feature films==
In 1960, Keaton returned to MGM for the final time, playing a lion tamer in a 1960 adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Much of the film was shot on location on the Sacramento River, which doubled for the Mississippi River setting of Twain&#x27;s book. In 1962 he signed on for a Canadian musical comedy feature, &quot;Ten Girls Ago&quot;, starring teen idol Dion and featuring Keaton, Bert Lahr, and Eddie Foy, Jr. Keaton filmed his scenes as arranged, but the film endured a host of production problems and was never released.

Keaton had a cameo in the all-star comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), appearing near the end of the film as Jimmy. He assists Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper&#x27;s ultimately unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a scene where Jimmy and Culpepper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic&#x27;s &quot;roadshow&quot; exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.)

In 1964, Keaton was featured in his first theatrical film series since 1941. American International Pictures hired him to furnish comedy scenes for its successful &quot;Beach Party&quot; pictures. Keaton appeared in four: &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964), &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;, &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot;, and &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot; (all 1965). Director William Asher recalled:

Keaton&#x27;s new popularity in movies prompted Columbia Pictures to re-release some of his vintage-1940 two-reel comedies to theaters. Columbia&#x27;s home-movie division also sold two shorts, &quot;Pardon My Berth Marks&quot; and &quot;So You Won&#x27;t Squawk&quot;, in abridged form on silent 8mm film.

During the autumn of 1964 Keaton was in Canada, starring in the color featurette &quot;The Railrodder&quot; for the National Film Board of Canada. He traveled from one end of Canada to the other on a motorized handcar, wearing his traditional pork pie hat and performing gags similar to those in films that he made 50 years before. A black-and-white companion film, &quot;Buster Keaton Rides Again&quot; (1965), documented Keaton at work during &quot;The Railrodder&quot;, staging, improving, and rejecting gags on location.

In 1965, he appeared on the CBS television special &quot;A Salute to Stan Laurel&quot;, a tribute to the comedian and friend of Keaton who had died earlier that year. He also played the central role in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s experimental project &quot;Film&quot; (1965), directed by Alan Schneider. 

American International co-produced an Italian comedy, &quot;Due Marines e un Generale&quot;, co-starring the Italian comedy team of Franco and Ciccio. To make it more suitable for American audiences, the studio sent Buster Keaton, Fred Clark, and Martha Hyer to join the cast and crew in Italy. (While in Italy, Keaton made an appearance at the Venice Film Festival.) The completed film was released in 1966 as &quot;War Italian Style&quot;; his performance (as a German general) is almost entirely in pantomime. 

For his next assignment, Keaton departed Italy for Spain, where Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; was filmed in September–November 1965. Keaton amazed the cast and crew by doing many of his own stunts. His increasingly ill health compelled director Lester to save Keaton&#x27;s strength for the major stunts and use a double for distant, routine shots of Keaton running. 

Keaton&#x27;s final appearance on film was in &quot;The Scribe&quot;, a 1966 safety film produced in Toronto by the Construction Safety Associations of Ontario: he died shortly after completing it.

== Style and themes ==
=== Use of parody ===

Keaton started experimenting with parody during his vaudeville years, where most frequently his performances involved impressions and burlesques of other performers&#x27; acts. Most of these parodies targeted acts with which Keaton had shared the bill. When Keaton transposed his experience in vaudeville to film, in many works he parodied melodramas. Other favorite targets were cinematic plots, structures and devices.

One of his most biting parodies is &quot;The Frozen North&quot; (1922), a satirical take on William S. Hart&#x27;s Western melodramas, like &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hinges&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Narrow Trail&quot; (1917). Keaton parodied the tired formula of the melodramatic transformation from bad guy to good guy, which Hart&#x27;s characters went through, known as &quot;the good badman&quot;. He wears a small version of Hart&#x27;s campaign hat from the Spanish–American War and a six-shooter on each thigh, and during the scene in which he shoots the neighbor and her husband, he reacts with thick glycerin tears, a trademark of Hart&#x27;s. Audiences of the 1920s recognized the parody and thought the film hysterically funny. However, Hart himself was not amused by Keaton&#x27;s antics, particularly the crying scene, and did not speak to Keaton for two years after he had seen the film. The film&#x27;s opening intertitles give it its mock-serious tone, and are taken from &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGrew&quot; by Robert W. Service.

In &quot;The Playhouse&quot; (1921), he parodied his contemporary Thomas H. Ince, Hart&#x27;s producer, who indulged in over-crediting himself in his film productions. The short also featured the impression of a performing monkey which was likely derived from a co-biller&#x27;s act (called &quot;Peter the Great&quot;). &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923), his first feature-length film, is a parody of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), from which it replicates the three inter-cut shorts structure. &quot;Three Ages&quot; also featured parodies of Bible stories, like those of Samson and Daniel. Keaton directed the film, along with Edward F. Cline. By this time, Keaton had further developed his distinct signature style that consisted of lucidity and precision along with acrobatics of ballistic precision and kineticism. Critic and film historian Imogen Sara Smith stated about Keaton&#x27;s style:

=== Body language ===
Film critic David Thomson later described Keaton&#x27;s style of comedy: &quot;Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation. Look at his face—as beautiful but as inhuman as a butterfly—and you see that utter failure to identify sentiment.&quot; Gilberto Perez commented on &quot;Keaton&#x27;s genius as an actor to keep a face so nearly deadpan and yet render it, by subtle inflections, so vividly expressive of inner life. His large, deep eyes are the most eloquent feature; with merely a stare, he can convey a wide range of emotions, from longing to mistrust, from puzzlement to sorrow.&quot; Critic Anthony Lane also noted Keaton&#x27;s body language:

Film historian Jeffrey Vance wrote:

===Pork-pie hats===
Keaton designed and modified his own pork pie hats during his career. In 1964, he told an interviewer that in making &quot;this particular pork pie&quot;, he &quot;started with a good Stetson and cut it down&quot;, stiffening the brim with sugar water. The hats were often destroyed during Keaton&#x27;s wild film antics; some were given away as gifts and some were snatched by souvenir hunters. Keaton said he was lucky if he used only six hats in making a film. He estimated that he and his wife Eleanor made thousands of hats during his career. Keaton observed that during his silent period, such a hat cost him around two dollars (~$27–33 in 2022 dollars); at the time of his interview, he said, they cost almost $13 (~$116 in 2022 dollars).

== Personal life ==

On May 31, 1921, Keaton married Natalie Talmadge, his leading lady in &quot;Our Hospitality&quot;, and the sister of actresses Norma Talmadge (married to his business partner Joseph M. Schenck at the time) and Constance Talmadge, at Norma&#x27;s home in Bayside, Queens. They had two sons: Joseph, called James (June 2, 1922 – February 14, 2007), and Robert (February 3, 1924 – July 19, 2009).

After Robert&#x27;s birth, the marriage began to suffer. Talmadge decided not to have any more children, banishing Keaton to a separate bedroom; he dated actresses Dorothy Sebastian and Kathleen Key during this period. Natalie&#x27;s extravagance was another factor, as she spent up to a third of her husband&#x27;s earnings.

It was clear that Mr. Keaton and Mrs. Keaton had different ideas and lifestyles. Keaton had designed and built a modest but comfortable, cottage-like home as a surprise wedding gift for his bride. When she saw the little house, she flew into a rage: she thought the house was much too small, with no place for servants. Realizing that his bride wanted a palace, he sold the cottage to MGM executive Eddie Mannix at cost, and commissioned Gene Verge Sr. in 1926 to build a estate in Beverly Hills for $300,000 ($5,141,000 in 2024). Neighbors included Tom Mix and Rudolph Valentino. Among famous subsequent residents were renter Marlene Dietrich and, later, Cary Grant with his wife, heiress Barbara Hutton. James Mason and his wife Pamela purchased the home in 1948. 

After attempts at reconciliation, Natalie divorced Buster in 1932, and changed the boys&#x27; surname to &quot;Talmadge&quot;. On July 1, 1942, the 18-year-old Robert and the 20-year-old Joseph made the name change permanent after their mother won a court petition.

With the failure of his marriage and the loss of his independence as a filmmaker, Keaton descended into alcoholism. He was briefly institutionalized, according to the Turner Classic Movies documentary &quot;So Funny It Hurt&quot;. He escaped a straitjacket with tricks learned from Harry Houdini. In 1933, he married his nurse Mae Scriven during an alcoholic binge, about which he later claimed to remember nothing. Scriven claimed that she did not know Keaton&#x27;s real first name until after the marriage. She filed for divorce in 1935 after finding him with Leah Clampitt Sewell, the wife of millionaire Barton Sewell, in a hotel in Santa Barbara. They divorced in 1936 at great financial cost to Keaton. After undergoing aversion therapy, he stopped drinking for five years.
On May 29, 1940, Keaton married Eleanor Norris, who was 23 years his junior. She has been credited with salvaging his life and career. The marriage lasted until his death. Between 1947 and 1954, the couple appeared regularly in the Cirque Medrano in Paris as a double act. She came to know his routines so well that she often participated in them in television revivals.

== Death ==
Keaton died of lung cancer on February 1, 1966, aged 70, in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. Despite being diagnosed with cancer in January 1966, he was never told he was terminally ill. Keaton thought that he was recovering from a severe case of bronchitis. Confined to a hospital during his final days, Keaton was restless and paced the room endlessly, desiring to return home. In a British television documentary about his career, his widow Eleanor told producers from Thames Television that Keaton was up out of bed and moving around, and even played cards with friends who came to visit the day before he died. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California.

== Influence and legacy ==
Keaton was presented with a 1959 Academy Honorary Award at the 32nd Academy Awards, held in April 1960. Keaton has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: 6619 Hollywood Boulevard (for motion pictures); and 6225 Hollywood Boulevard (for television).

Six of his films have been included in the National Film Registry, making him one of the most honored filmmakers on that list: &quot;One Week&quot; (1920)&quot;, Cops (&quot;1922)&quot;, Sherlock Jr.&quot; (1924)&quot;, The General&quot; (1926)&quot;, Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;, and &quot;The Cameraman&quot; (both 1928)

A 1957 film biography, &quot;The Buster Keaton Story&quot;, starring Donald O&#x27;Connor as Keaton was released. The screenplay, by Sidney Sheldon, who also directed the film, was loosely based on Keaton&#x27;s life but contained many factual errors and merged his three wives into one character. A 1987 documentary, &quot;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow&quot;, directed by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, won two Emmy Awards.

The International Buster Keaton Society was founded on October 4, 1992: Keaton&#x27;s birthday. Dedicated to bringing greater public attention to Keaton&#x27;s life and work, the membership includes many individuals from the television and film industry: actors, producers, authors, artists, graphic novelists, musicians, and designers, as well as those who simply admire the magic of Buster Keaton. The Society&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Damfinos&quot;, draws its name from a boat in Keaton&#x27;s 1921 comedy, &quot;The Boat&quot;.

In his essay &quot;Film-arte, film-antiartístico&quot;, artist Salvador Dalí declared the works of Keaton to be prime examples of &quot;anti-artistic&quot; filmmaking, calling them &quot;pure poetry&quot;. In 1925, Dalí produced a collage titled &quot;The Marriage of Buster Keaton&quot; featuring an image of the comedian in a seated pose, staring straight ahead with his trademark boater hat resting in his lap.

Film critic Roger Ebert stated, &quot;The greatest of the silent clowns is Buster Keaton, not only because of what he did, but because of how he did it. Harold Lloyd made us laugh as much, Charlie Chaplin moved us more deeply, but no one had more courage than Buster.&quot; In his presentation for &quot;The General&quot;, filmmaker Orson Welles hailed Buster Keaton as &quot;the greatest of all the clowns in the history of the cinema... a supreme artist, and I think one of the most beautiful people who was ever photographed&quot;. Welles said Keaton was &quot;beyond all praise... a very great artist, and one of the most beautiful men I ever saw on the screen. He was also a great director. In the last analysis, no one came near him.&quot;

Filmmaker Mel Brooks has credited Keaton as a major influence, saying: &quot;I owe (Buster) a lot on two levels: One for being such a great teacher for me as a filmmaker myself, and the other just as a human being watching this gifted person doing these amazing things. He made me believe in make-believe.&quot; He also admitted to borrowing the idea of the changing room scene in &quot;The Cameraman&quot; for his own film &quot;Silent Movie&quot;. Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Jr&quot;., in which he walks into the movie he is projecting, was an influence Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo,&quot; in which a character walks out of a movie and into real life&quot;.&quot; George Lucas was influenced by Keaton for the character of Jar Jar Binks in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Most notably he borrowed from &quot;The General&quot;, &quot;The Navigator,&quot; and &quot;Seven Chances&quot;.

In 1994, caricaturist Al Hirschfeld penned a series of silent film stars for the United States Post Office, including Rudolph Valentino and Keaton. Hirschfeld said that modern film stars were more difficult to depict, that silent film comedians such as Laurel and Hardy and Keaton &quot;looked like their caricatures&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, writing that &quot;More than Chaplin, Keaton understood movies: He knew they consisted of a four-sided frame in which resided a malleable reality off which his persona could bounce. A vaudeville child star, Keaton grew up to be a tinkerer, an athlete, a visual mathematician; his films offer belly laughs of mind-boggling physical invention and a spacey determination that nears philosophical grandeur.&quot;

Actor and stunt performer Johnny Knoxville cites Keaton as an inspiration when coming up with ideas for &quot;Jackass&quot; projects. He re-enacted a famous Keaton stunt for the finale of &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;. Comedian Richard Lewis stated that Keaton was his prime inspiration, and spoke of having a close friendship with Keaton&#x27;s widow Eleanor. Lewis was particularly moved by the fact that Eleanor said his eyes looked like Keaton&#x27;s.

In 2012, Kino Lorber released &quot;The Ultimate Buster Keaton Collection&quot;, a 14-disc Blu-ray box set of Keaton&#x27;s work, including 11 of his feature films. In 2016, Tony Hale portrayed Keaton in an episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot; focusing on the silent comedian&#x27;s supposed rivalry with Charlie Chaplin, who was played by musician Billie Joe Armstrong. On June 16, 2018, the International Buster Keaton Society laid a four-foot plaque in honor of both Keaton and Charles Chaplin on the corner of the shared block (1021 Lillian Ave) where each had made many of their silent comedies in Hollywood. In honor of the event, the City of Los Angeles declared the date &quot;Buster Keaton Day&quot;.

In 2018, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich released &quot;The Great Buster: A Celebration&quot;, a documentary about Keaton&#x27;s life, career, and legacy. In 2022, two works on Keaton appeared within a month of each other. Critic Dana Stevens published a cultural history of Keaton&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Camera Man: Buster Keaton, the Dawn of Cinema, and the Invention of the Twentieth Century&quot;. It was followed a month later by James Curtis&#x27; biography &quot;Buster Keaton: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Life&quot;. In 2023, Keaton&#x27;s life and work was depicted in the graphic novel biography &quot;Buster: A Life in Pictures&quot;, written by Ryan Barnett and illustrated by Matthew Tavares.

Anthony Lane wrote: &quot;He was just too good, in too many ways, too soon... No action thriller of the last, blood-streaked decade has matched the kinetic violence at the end of &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;, in which a storm pulls Keaton through one random catastrophe after another. Anyone who thinks that the movie-within-a-movie is a recent conceit, the province of &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, should check out &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, a film in which Keaton &quot;dreams&quot; himself into another film: he strolls up the aisle of the theatre, hops into the action, and fights to keep up with the breakneck changes of scene. As for &quot;The General&quot;, where do you start? It&#x27;s a film about a train, but it&#x27;s also a spirited romance, peppered with bickering and longing, and its evocation of the Civil War period has never been surpassed... He is the first action hero; to be precise, he is a small, pale-faced American who is startled, tripped, drenched and inspired into &quot;becoming&quot; a hero.&quot;

<doc id="43063" wikidata="Q1476042" url="?curid=43063" title="Operation Anaconda">
<text>Operation Anaconda or the Battle of Shah-i-Kot was a military operation that took place in early March 2002 as part of the War in Afghanistan. CIA paramilitary officers, working with their allies, attempted to destroy al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. The operation took place in the Shah-i-Kot Valley and Arma Mountains southeast of Zormat. This operation was the first large-scale battle in the post-2001 War in Afghanistan since the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001. This was the first operation in the Afghanistan theater to involve a large number of U.S. forces participating in direct combat activities.

Between March 2 and March 18, 2002, 1,700 airlifted U.S. troops and 1,000 pro-government Afghan militia battled between 300 and 1,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters to obtain control of the valley. The Taliban and al-Qaeda forces fired mortars and heavy machine guns from entrenched positions in the caves and ridges of the mountainous terrain at U.S. forces attempting to secure the area. Afghan Taliban commander Maulavi Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor later led Taliban reinforcements to join the battle. U.S. forces had estimated the strength of the rebels in the Shah-i-Kot Valley at 200 to 250, but later information suggested the actual strength was of 500 to 1,000 fighters.

==Background==
On September 11, 2001, a group of Islamic terrorists attacked the United States. They were led by Osama bin Laden, who was the leader of a group called Al-Qaeda. It was suspected that bin Laden was hiding in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban.

To respond to this threat, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7, 2001. The goal was to remove the Taliban from power and eliminate Al-Qaeda. To achieve this, the US worked together with a rebel group in Afghanistan known as the Northern Alliance. The Northern Alliance was made up of people from different ethnic backgrounds, such as Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras, who opposed the Taliban, which was primarily led by ethnic Pashtuns.

The US used a combination of airstrikes and special ground forces to help the Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban. They were able to quickly capture Taliban strongholds, and on November 13, 2001, they successfully took control of the capital city, Kabul.

Around the same time, intelligence suggested that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda leaders had taken refuge in a training camp located in the Tora Bora mountains near Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province in Eastern Afghanistan. Unlike previous battle areas in Northern Afghanistan, this region was mainly inhabited by Pashtuns.

The United States wanted the Northern Alliance to help them attack Al-Qaeda in Tora Bora, but the Tajik and Uzbek warlords of the Northern Alliance refused. They were not willing to enter the hostile Pashtun areas in the east or south. So, the United States had to find other allies for the assault.

They managed to bribe Pashtun militias in the areas to join forces with them, and called this group the &quot;Eastern Alliance.&quot; Together, they launched an attack on the Al-Qaeda training camp in Tora Bora on November 30, 2001. However, these Eastern Alliance militias proved to be far less effective than the Northern Alliance had been. They didn&#x27;t have the same level of animosity towards Al-Qaeda and would leave the battlefield each night to break their Ramadan fast. Due to the lack of effective cooperation with the Eastern Alliance militias, Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda leaders escaped from the Battle of Tora Bora.

After the Tora Bora operation, there was a perception that the reason Osama bin Laden escaped was because there were no US forces in place to stop Al-Qaeda from fleeing into Pakistan. The commanders on the ground had asked for 800 United States Army Rangers to be sent to block these escape routes, but CENTCOM, the military authorities, declined their request. This perceived failure to deploy blocking forces would have a significant impact on the planning of Operation Anaconda.

Around mid-January 2002, US officials received intelligence reports indicating that enemy forces, including Al-Qaeda, were gathering in the Shah-i-kot valley in Paktia Province, which was located about 60 miles south of Gardez. The Lower Shah-i-kot region was close to the Pakistani tribal lands, where many Al-Qaeda fighters were thought to have fled after the Tora Bora operation. As January progressed, US military officials started considering a potential attack on the Shah-i-kot valley.

The Shah-i-kot Valley, meaning &#x27;the Place of the King&#x27; in Pashto, is about 9 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide at its widest point. It consists of two main areas, the Lower Shah-i-kot and the Upper Shah-i-kot, running roughly parallel to each other. In the lower Shah-i-kot, there are several imposing mountains, with Takur Ghar being the most prominent at the southeastern end, and Tsapare Ghar to the northeast, which controls the northern entrance to the valley.

The valley is quite defendable, as its high ridges offer natural caves, crevasses, and other protected spots where guerrilla fighters can position themselves to shoot at the valley floor and access routes. During the Soviet-Afghan War, this area was also a battleground, as the Soviets fought mujahideen guerillas. The mujahideen, who opposed the Red Army in southeast Afghanistan, strategically positioned their defenses in Paktia province, mainly along the central mountain range. One critical highway between Gardez and Khost was a major supply route for the Soviet forces stationed in Khost. However, in 1981, the Afghan fighters successfully blocked this road and laid siege to Khost, forcing the Soviets to rely on airlift for resupply. The siege continued for seven years, and eventually, the Soviets were forced to retreat from the area.

During the Soviet–Afghan War, Mujahideen leader Malawi Nasrullah Mansoor was in charge of the valley and invited foreign jihadists to base themselves in the Lower Shah-i-kot. Mansoor fortified the valley, digging trench systems, building bunkers and firing positions into the ridgelines, many of which would be put into effect during the operation. Malawi Nasrullah Mansoor later joined the Taliban, becoming governor of Paktia Province before being killed in a battle with a rival warlord. Using his family&#x27;s connections in the region Nasrullah Mansoor&#x27;s son, Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor, became the leading Taliban commander of Zurmat District in Paktia Province by 2002. The mujahideen fighters had successfully defeated the Soviet Army twice in this valley, and the Taliban-Al-Qaeda coalition expected events here to pan out in a similar fashion.

Increasing signals and human intelligence indicated a strong presence of Taliban, IMU and al-Qaeda fighters in the Shah-i-Kot Valley; approximately 200 to 250 fighters were believed to be wintering and possibly preparing for a spring offensive in the valley. The signal intelligence also raised the possibility that high-value targets (HVTs) were present in the valley among which were not only Saif Rehman, but also Tohir Yuldeshev, co-founder of the terrorist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose tribal network controlled the area.

Jalaluddin Haqqani had a history of fighting against the Soviets with support from the CIA and Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence agency, ISI. He was once seen as a potential alternative leader among the Pashtuns, apart from the Taliban. The CIA linked the Haqqani family to Osama bin Laden&#x27;s escape from Tora Bora, an allegation that the family strongly denied. As a result, the Haqqani family became a target for American airstrikes, leading most of its members to flee across the border into Pakistan. However, despite their departure, Al-Qaeda fighters who had sought shelter in the family&#x27;s tribal lands remained in the Shah-i-kot Valley.

In late January and February, a plan was developed to attack the Shah-i-kot Valley. The operation involved Afghan military forces (AMF) supported and guided by US special operators. Major General Franklin L. Hagenbeck was assigned to lead the Combined Joint Task Force Mountain responsible for the operation. The strategy was to have Afghan Pashtun militias launch an attack on the valley, similar to what had happened at Tora Bora. But this time, US special forces would be positioned in the eastern mountains to block any potential escape routes into Pakistan. The expectation was that Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters would retreat in the face of the Afghan militias&#x27; assault, and the US forces would be able to capture them as they fled.

The US decided to place its trust in a Pashtun warlord named Zia Lodin to lead the Afghan tribal forces. The operation officer of Task Force Dagger, Mark Rosengard, explained why they chose to rely on the Afghan militias that had previously disappointed them during the Battle of Tora Bora. First, there were reports suggesting that the Al-Qaeda forces in Shah-i-kot Valley were mixed among 1000 Afghan civilians. In such a situation, it was crucial to have troops who could distinguish between local civilians and jihadist foreign fighters. There was concern about accidentally killing civilians and repeating the Soviet forces&#x27; mistakes, which led to the Afghans viewing them as occupiers. Another reason was to foster a sense of &quot;ownership&quot; among the Afghans over the victory. Rosengard wanted the local people to feel like they were the ones who had driven out the foreign Al-Qaeda fighters from their country. When asked whether such a concept could be embraced on a national level in a country as ethnically diverse as Afghanistan, Mark Rosengard responded that at least Zia Lodin seemed to grasp the idea.

An important element in the operation was a group called Advanced Force Operations (AFO), reporting to Task Force 11 (TF 11). Their role was to carry out risky reconnaissance missions deep within enemy territory. AFO was not a fixed organization; it was a concept coordinated by a special operations headquarters cell that could draw personnel from various special operations units based on the mission&#x27;s needs. Pete Blaber was chosen to lead AFO&#x27;s efforts in Afghanistan. It was decided to use U.S. conventional infantry. The forces used, consisting of the 187th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Rakkasans&quot;) of the 101st Airborne Division, led by Colonel Frank Wiercinski, and soldiers of 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul LaCamera, were to be inserted by CH-47D Chinooks, supported by six AH-64A Apache helicopters and secure these blocking positions. In keeping with established strategy in Afghanistan, fire support was to be provided by United States Air Force units, rather than artillery. Further air support was provided by U.S. Navy units and French Air Force Mirage 2000Ds. The amount of conventional assets allowed in Afghanistan was limited by United States Central Command (CENTCOM) and civilian defense leadership. The final plan foresaw two major forces: TF Hammer and TF Anvil. TF Hammer consisted of Afghan militias and a small number of US special operators as the primary effort to assault the Shah-i-Kot Valley; their objective was to enter the valley from the north, assaulting through the villages of Serkhankheyl and Marzak, where intelligence indicated that the enemy was concentrated, and channel fleeing enemy into the TF Anvil, the Rakkasan blocking positions. TF Anvil consisted of TF Rakkasan and the 1–87 to set up blocking positions and prevent enemy forces from escaping.

==Units involved==
The operation was composed of elements: Task Force Dagger: ODAs from the 5th SFG, B company, 2nd Battalion, 160th SOAR and USAF Combat Controllers. Task Force Rakkasan: 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, 1st and 2nd battalion 187th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division. Task Force Commando: 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. Task Force 64: 1 Squadron, Australian Special Air Service Regiment. Task Force K-Bar: ODAs from the 3rd SFG. Task Force Bowie: AFO (made up of a 45-man reconnaissance unit Delta Force and augmented by selected DEVGRU operators recce specialists, combat controllers and supported by ISA&#x27;s technical experts, AFO conducted covert reconnaissance usually sending small 2 or 3 man teams on foot or on ATVs, deploying observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance). Task Force Sword/11: Mako 30, 31 and 21, Task Force Blue/DEVGRU.

SOF teams from Task Force K-Bar and Task Force 64, which included: Navy SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8, Green Berets from 3rd SFG, The Canadian Army&#x27;s Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2), The German Army&#x27;s &quot;Kommando Spezialkräfte&quot; (KSK), the Norwegian special forces units &quot;Forsvarets Spesialkommando&quot; (FSK) and Marinejegerkommandoen (MJK), elements of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service, Dutch Korps Commandotroepen and the Danish special forces from &quot;Jægerkorpset&quot;. these teams inserted into the outer edges of the valley to cut off any escape.

Other units that took part are the B Co. 159th Avn Rgt, 75th Ranger Regiment, Joint Special Operations Command and CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division and British Royal Marines.

The Afghan militia forces were made up of three Pashtun units. The first unit, led by commander Zia Lodin, had around 600 men. They were planned to use as the main force and given the name TF Hammer for the operation. They received advice and training from ODAs 594 and 372. The other Afghan units were led by Zakim Khan and Kamel Khan, each comprising about 400 to 500 fighters. Zakim&#x27;s units partnered with ODAs 542 and 381, while Kamel&#x27;s units worked with ODAs 571 and 392. These two forces were designated as TF Anvil.

==Prelude==

During the planning phase of the operation, Advanced Force Operations (AFO) units carried out reconnaissance to gather intelligence about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda positions in Shah-i-Kot. Efforts to access U.S. intelligence databases had provided no useful information. Even extensive satellite imagery of the Shah-i-Kot area didn&#x27;t reveal much because the Al-Qaeda forces there were too lightly equipped and too adept at camouflage to stand out, unlike the easily recognizable Iraqi tank brigades in the First Gulf War.

Intelligence operatives realized that they would have to rely mainly on human intelligence gathering (HUMINT) and intercepted signals (SIGINT) to gather insights about the situation in the valley. The commander of Delta Force, lieutenant colonel Pete Blaber ruled out any helicopter infiltration of AFOs into the area as not to alert the terrorists in the valley; in addition to AFOs conducting reconnaissance of routes into and around the valley on modified Polaris ATVs (often in adverse weather conditions on difficult terrain), two teams (codenamed India and Juliet) with 3 and 5 operators (respectively) of highly experienced Delta operators from their squadrons Reconnaissance and Surveillance Troop and elite Air Force combat controllers from the 24th STS climbed high into the mountains and gorges of the Shah-i-Kot, often in extreme weather conditions, to conduct environmental reconnaissance. Their vital intelligence was fed back to the AFO and would prove invaluable once the operation started. On February 28, three AFO teams were covertly infiltrated into the valley, one codenamed Juliet was made up of 5 Delta operators, a combat controller, and a signals intelligence specialist from the ISA, entered the valley on ATVs from the north, driving through the night in adverse weather conditions, eventually reaching a covert hide on the eastern side of the valley. Another team codenamed India, composed of three Delta operators, a combat controller, and an attached ISA operator walked into the valley through the same conditions to hide in the southwest of the valley, known as the &quot;Fish Hook&quot;. The final team was known as Mako 31 and was composed of three SEALs from DEVGRUs Red Team, a USAF Combat Controller, and a US Navy EOD operator. They infiltrated the area on foot via the southern edge of the valley to set up an observation post on a terrain feature known as &#x27;The Finger.&#x27; All three teams were tasked with confirming enemy strengths and dispositions including antiaircraft emplacements, ensuring the designated Rakkasan helicopter landing zones were clear of obstructions, and providing terminal guidance for air support both prior to and during the insertion of conventional forces. SOF teams from Task Force K-Bar and Task Force 64 were also inserted into the valley to establish observation posts which according to US planners &quot;had to be tenable, afford good reconnaissance, and cover the identified escape routes or &#x27;rat lines&#x27; into Pakistan&quot;

After reading the daily reports from the AFO team, general Tommy Franks became convinced that a major operation was necessary to deal with what appeared to be a significant enemy presence in the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The military authorities finalized their plan for the attack on the valley. Task Force Rakkasan were to air assault into the valley using CH-47D Chinook transport helicopters, supported by six AH-64A Apache attack helicopters. Their role was to occupy several blocking positions along the eastern ridgeline of Shah-i-Kot. Task Force Hammer, led by Commander Zia Lodin with 500 Afghan Pashtun units, would enter the valley through the northern entrance in a ground assault convoy. Before their ground assault, a planned aerial bombardment would target known enemy positions. As Task Force Hammer moved through the villages of Serkhankheyl and Marzak, where enemy forces were believed to be concentrated, the Task Force Rakkasan soldiers manning the blocking positions would be ready to engage any fleeing enemy forces. Additionally, two Afghan militias were assigned to create an outer cordon to prevent any Al-Qaeda or IMU stragglers from escaping into Pakistan. The operation was originally scheduled to be launched February 28, but was delayed until March 2 due to a severe snowstorm.

==Battle==

===1 March 2002===
A day before the planned operation, two Mako 31 snipers found a group of foreign fighters that had established a position and were manning a DShK HMG on the peak where they planned to set up an observation post. The DShK overlooked the southeastern entrance to the valley through which the TF Rakkasan Chinooks were due to fly in 24 hours and, if it was not disabled before then, it could shoot down the Chinooks carrying the conventional forces. The SEALs came up with a plan to ambush the enemy in the pre-dawn darkness before the Rakkasans flew into the valley. At 4 A.M the next morning, the three SEALs from MAKO 31 quietly approached the enemy camp, intending to wait until shortly before the air assault was scheduled to begin before eliminating the fighters there. However, the SEALs were spotted by an Uzbek IMU insurgent and a brief firefight ensued. During the intense exchange, two of the SEALs&#x27; rifles jammed after firing just one shot. The third SEAL held off the enemy as his colleagues quickly cleared the jams and resumed firing, killing 5 out of the 7 foreign fighters. As another insurgent joined the firefight, firing a PKM, the SEAL team decided to break contact and called in an AC-130 which destroyed the enemy encampment with 105 mm rounds. The sound of the AC-130 firing alerted the Al-Qaeda fighters throughout the valley, who began firing their weapons into the air. However, this turned out to be a fatal mistake as the tracer rounds revealed their positions to the AFO teams, who noted the locations to be targeted by airstrikes later.

The SEALs proceeded to occupy the observation post. Upon searching the camp, they discovered that the Al-Qaeda fighters were well-equipped. Not only did the SEALs find plenty of ammunition for the DShK, but also a Soviet-style SVD Dragunov sniper rifle, several Kalashnikov assault rifles, at least one RPG-7 launcher with several rounds, a PK machine gun, and several fragmentation grenades. The SEALs also found documents that were written in both Arabic and Cyrillic scripts, indicating that the Arab Al-Qaeda fighters and the Uzbek and Chechen IMU fighters were not operating separately, but had formed cross-cultural teams. Among the documents was a notebook containing instructions on how to construct homemade bombs for blowing up bridges, buildings, buses, and cars.

===2 March 2002===
Canadian and U.S. sniper teams and Afghan forces began to sweep the Shah-i-Kot valley area to root out rebel forces regrouping in the valley after the fall of the Taliban regime.

====TF Hammer/TF Anvil====
Around midnight, the units of TF Hammer loaded into their vehicles and left their base in Gardez at for the Shah-i-Kot Valley in a convoy of 39 trucks, buses, and other vehicles. TF Hammer consisted of a large force of Afghan militia led by Zia Lodin and the Special Forces A-teams Texas 14/ODA 594 and Cobra 72/ODA 372. The road conditions were terrible due to a recent snowstorm that had turned the dirt roads into muddy and slippery terrain. This made progress challenging, especially in the difficult terrain.

As they moved, some trucks got stuck, and there was even an accident where a large bus turned over, injuring several fighters. The commanders ordered the trucks to use their headlights, destroying any element of surprise. As TF Hammer continued, it suffered from a lack of unit cohesion because of the transportation difficulties. A convoy led by Army Chief Warrant Officer Stanley L. Harriman of the Third Special Forces Group split off from the main TF Hammer force to reach the assigned observation point. Grim 31, an AC-130 aircraft providing fire support and reconnaissance for the assault, spotted Harriman&#x27;s convoy and, due to a failure in its inertial navigation system, believed it was in a position away from friendly forces (this was due to a problem with the &quot;glint&quot; panels which should have identified the convoy as American.) Grim 31 engaged the column, resulting in the friendly fire death of Harriman and the wounding of several Afghan militias and U.S. special forces.

The main body of TF Hammer reached its pre-assault point around 06:15 and waited for the expected &quot;55 minute&quot; aerial bombardment of enemy positions. Miscommunication between Texas 14 and higher command meant the bombardment was not that extensive and consisted of six bombs. This was due to a bomb getting stuck in the launch bay of the B-1B that was on its bomb run. The next aircraft in line waited for the B-1B to receive permission to jettison the bomb and go round again. During this time, both bombers plus the additional two F-15Es claimed to have received a &quot;knock off&quot; call directing them to cease the bombardment. One of the F-15E pilots later acknowledged that this may have been a communication directing Grim-31 to cease fire. This lack of air support demoralized the Afghans and frustrated the special forces. The Afghan fighters, in trucks, were devastated by mortar fire registered in advance to strike fixed points on the road. The Afghans suffered forty or more deaths and injuries.

At this point, it became clear that the Al Qaeda fighters had been expecting an attack. The intense small arms and mortar fire, combined with the absence of close air support, caused the Afghan forces of TF Hammer to scatter and refuse to advance any further. This situation was reminiscent of the challenges faced during the earlier Tora Bora operation, in which the Afghan militias had similarly refused to advance in the face of enemy resistance. With no opportunity to alter the operation that had already been set in motion, the task of assaulting the Shah-i-Kot Valley had to be carried out by the troops of TF Anvil instead.

====TF Rakkasan====

At 05:00, the assault troops of TF Rakkasan boarded their CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters at Bagram Air Base and flew south towards the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The weather was cold and cloudy, and the soldiers bundled up in cold weather gear to keep warm. The six Chinooks carrying the Rakkasans were accompanied by two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and several AH-64 Apaches. The aircraft ran into significant troubles during the flight caused by foggy weather, and somehow the Chinooks passed the valley entrance significantly ahead of the Apaches, forcing the Rakkasans to drop off on &quot;hot&quot; landing zones (meaning that the insurgents were nearby and able to engage them immediately as they dropped off). The six Chinooks spread out and headed for their respective landing zones. As the security team rushed to secure the landing zones, the TF Rakkasan commander observed the valley with concern. He noticed that there were no signs of civilians in the towns below. No colors, no smoke, no animals, no hanging clothes – nothing to indicate people living there. It became clear that the civilians had been moved out and that there were only enemy combatants to be found there.

At 06:30 the first wave of Rakkasans and Mountain troops landed via Chinook helicopter along the eastern and northern edges of the valley to await the fleeing fighters at their assigned blocking positions. The terrorists appeared surprised and did not fire on the Chinooks at first, possibly due to them being distracted by TF Hammer&#x27;s advance or because of ineffective communication between the foreign fighters themselves. This confusion bought the infantry invaluable time to take up security positions around the helicopter landing zone, and the first shots rang out as the Chinooks lifted off and departed. Due to TF Hammer having aborted the mission, they came under much heavier fire than they had anticipated after landing on their objectives and remained pinned down by heavy mortar fire and found themselves locked in a fierce firefight throughout the day. Orbiting Apache helicopters attempted to suppress enemy mortar teams, but ran into a wall of RPG and 12.7mm fire, with one Apache losing all of its electronics to an RPG hit. Instead of 200-250 fighters in the valley, as originally expected, post-assessment held that the area contained 750 to 1,000 terrorists dug in on the high ground around the valley. The insurgents used their ZPU-1 antiaircraft guns, DSHK, and small arms fire against the attack helicopters supporting the Rakkasans. 

The Al-Qaeda fighters employed a tactic they had learned from the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan war. They fired their RPG rockets into the air, aiming for the self-destruct mechanism that automatically detonates the warheads after traveling a specific distance (920 meters). The insurgents used this method to set the rounds to explode near the aircraft and damage its hydraulic and electrical innards with its lethal flak bursts of shrapnel. Furthermore, the terrorists launched RPG barrages just ahead of the Apaches, another old mujahideen tactic that made it challenging for the Apaches to navigate through the valley safely. Two Apaches were taken out of the fight and forced to return to base early on the first day due to the heavy RPG and machine-gun fire. Upon returning to base, the crew discovered more than 30 bullet holes in the fuselage of one of the helicopters, in addition to damage to its left side caused by an RPG. According to journalist Steve Call, due to the intense hostile reception, only two out of the planned eight CH-47s managed to land in their designated landing zones, although this is disputed as other sources contend that there were only six chinooks, and all of them successfully landed without incident.

Despite heavy opposition, Task Force Rakkasan managed to secure its blocking positions to the north by the middle of the morning. The presence of AFO teams in strategic high-ground locations played a crucial role in preventing the infantry from being overrun by the enemy. General Hagenbeck, who was in charge of the operation, was considering calling the mission off. However, Pete Blaber, the AFO commander, got on the radio and convinced him otherwise. Blaber insisted that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity on the battlefield and that he intended to keep his teams in the Shah-i-Kot Valley, continuing to decimate the enemy through air strikes until they were no longer a threat. Throughout the day, TF Rakkasan soldiers fought relentlessly with the AFOs providing continuous support by calling in air strikes on Al-Qaeda positions. The Apaches also played a crucial role in protecting the Rakkasans on the valley floor during the intense battle. AFO&#x27;s only frustration was that Rakkasan ETAC/JTAC had priority for calling in airstrikes over the AFOs requests and the other SOF reconnaissance teams in and around the valley.

The troops of the 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment in the southern landing zones faced the heaviest fighting. The men on the floor of the valley then picked up and began to patrol north again moving another 50 or so meters when an RPG was fired off a low foothill to the east. This round closed in on around 10 men, including the two Australians and most of the American leadership, landing in the snow and mud right amongst them but failing to detonate. The AQ then opened up with a DShK as the troops on the ground ran for the only cover on the valley floor in what became known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Halfpipe.&quot; In this engagement, Staff Sergeant Andrzej Ropel, and Specialist William Geraci, recently transferred in from the Division&#x27;s Long Range Surveillance Detachment, led the squad under fire to a ridgeline above the &quot;Halfpipe.&quot; Ropel was able to kill the enemy observer calling mortar fire into the &quot;Halfpipe,&quot; and he and his squad could now see the surrounding terrain. Ropel was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal with a Valor device for his actions. The expectation of very limited enemy indirect fire capability meant that only a single 120mm mortar was brought in the first wave. The primary fire support for the troops was provided by two McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apaches of the 3rd Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Aviation Brigade (&quot;Eagle Attack&quot;).

As the AFO scouts investigated the southern area near the base of Takur Ghar, the prominent mountain in the valley, they came across an unusual scene. Among the Al-Qaeda fighters, they spotted a female combatant, a rare occurrence not frequently seen among the Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan. This woman, in her mid-thirties, stood out with her ponytailed hair, a long scarf that draped all the way down to her knees, and an AK-47 slung across her back. Despite being armed, she wasn&#x27;t engaged in combat; instead, she sat on a ledge at the mountain&#x27;s base, cooking. Other enemy fighters, who had been actively sniping at the US scouts, would come down to join her for meals before returning to their positions. As the scouts prepared to move on, they called for mortar support from the 187th Infantry&#x27;s mortar platoon positioned in the &quot;Halfpipe,&quot; obliterating the woman&#x27;s position, along with the other Al-Qaeda fighters in the vicinity.

Signalman Martin &quot;Jock&quot; Wallace, of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during the fighting. When a mortar team from the 1-87 Infantry was hit by enemy mortar fire, Wallace put himself in harm&#x27;s way, collecting some of the wounded by dragging them into the creek bed, then dressing their wounds along with another SASR liaison officer. Throughout the day, the TACP forward air controllers and Special Forces teams that had infiltrated into the area the previous day assisted in calling in airstrikes from B-1, B-52, F-15, F-18 and F-16 aircraft, inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, but by no means silencing them. After nearly having their position overrun, the men in the southern landing zones were in a desperate position, pinned down all day and short of ammunition. Salvation came after dark in the form of an AC-130U Spooky gunship that unlike the faster-moving jets during the day, was able to loiter over the area and provide sustained firepower so the men could be airlifted out under cover of darkness; the group suffered 35 wounded (two chalks of which were casevaced by PaveHawk CSAR choppers) and none killed.

===3 March and 4 March 2002===

====Battle of Takur Ghar====
On the second day of the operation, General Hagenbeck and Colonel Wiercinski decided to make some changes. Because many soldiers in the southern blocking position of the 187th Infantry had been wounded, Hagenbeck chose to withdraw forces from the southern end of the valley. Instead, he relocated them to the northern position to assist the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division in carrying out a sweep from the north to the south along the eastern ridge. Lieutenant Colonel Ron Corkran&#x27;s 187th Infantry Battalion arrived in the northern region around 8:00 PM on March 3 and began their careful sweep southward, encountering no resistance. It became clear that the defenders had abandoned the valley floor. By the end of the day, they had successfully cleared a path to the base of Takur Ghar, and had gained a much better feel for the opposition, which had proven to be more formidable than initially anticipated.

General Hagenbeck also took steps to address the challenges the air assault team had faced on the initial day of the operation. The Apache helicopters had suffered significant damage, and it had become apparent that the AC-130 aircraft were susceptible to ground fire, making them unsuitable for daytime operations. Furthermore, there weren&#x27;t enough Air Force tactical controllers available to fulfill the demand for precision-guided strikes against al-Qaeda positions. To tackle these issues, CENTCOM deployed five A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. Not only were these robust aircraft far less susceptible to ground fire, but they could also remain over the battlefield during daylight hours and deliver accurate strikes without requiring the assistance of Air Force tactical controllers.

In the late evening of 3 March, Lieutenant Colonel Pete Blaber received notice from Brigadier General Gregory Trebon, commander of TF 11, that two SEAL fire teams commanded by Lieutenant Commander Vic Hyder were to be inserted into the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The two SEAL fire teams, Mako 30 and Mako 21, planned to establish an observation point on either end of the valley. One team would move to the peak of Takur Ghar, which commanded the southern approach to the Shah-i-Kot valley. Due to time constraints, a helicopter insertion would be needed for the teams to reach the peak before dawn. Hyder requested authorization to shift the insertion 24 hours to the next evening but was directed that insertion was critical to SOF providing support to the Operation. Originally, an insertion point east of the peak was identified, but due to uncontrollable time constraints, the SEALs of Mako 30 were forced into an insertion to the peak itself. Even though all overhead imagery showed no signs of life on the peak of Takur Ghar, Lieutenant Commander Hyder gave the team final guidance per special operation procedure that if any signs were seen, the mission would be aborted.

The SEAL fire team, Mako 30, was picked up by an MH-47 Chinook helicopter, at 23:23 on 3 March. However, the Chinook experienced engine difficulties and new MH-47s were dispatched to replace the original helicopters. This delay meant that the SEALs could not be inserted into the landing zone east of the peak until 02:30 on 4 March, which did not allow enough time to reach the peak before daylight. Blaber was notified that the SEALs were forced to insert on the peak to fulfill the order to infil Mako 30 that night. Nail 22, an AC-130H Spectre, reconnoitered the peak, and, seeing no enemy activity, declared the mountaintop secure. It was then called away to support other troops before the Chinook arrived.

At approximately 03:00, the Chinook attempted to land atop the mountain. As they approached, the pilots and SEALs observed tracks in the snow and other signs of recent human activity. As they discussed a possible mission abort, the helicopter was met with effective RPG fire. Two Rocket Propelled Grenades slammed into the helicopter, shutting down one of its engines, the electric system, and the hydraulic systems. Petty Officer First Class Neil C. Roberts had fallen out of the open ramp as the pilot had taken evasive actions. They first attempted to return and retrieve him, but the engine damage prevented proper control and the helicopter was forced to crash-land in the valley below, approximately 4 miles away. The SEAL team Mako 30, regrouped and was ferried by nearby units to another Chinook to go back to Takur Ghar and search for Roberts. The AC-130 was then directed to attack the large groupings of enemy combatants currently exposed on top of the mountain, one to three minutes before the Mako 30 was scheduled to arrive. When the Chinook dropped off the SEALs back on top of the mountain, they came under immediate fire, and Air Force combat controller Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman was seriously injured, along with two Navy SEALs. Mako 30 was forced off the peak due to the heavy fire and damage done. The Ranger quick reaction force (QRF) force located at Bagram Air Base and led by Captain Nate Self, was called in to search for the SEAL who fell out of the helicopter, now alone on top of the mountain.

Around this time command decided to change the frequencies for satellite radio communications which different units, including the AFO teams in their reconnaissance positions, were relying on to conduct and adapt the mission as the battle unfolded. One of the generals in overall charge of the events at Takur Ghar ordered the radio frequencies switched to prevent the plan being modified. Though the change may have been meant to enhance direct control of the rescue of the downed SEAL atop Takur Ghar, it had the critical effect of severely limiting communications between the different teams participating in the battle.
At 03:45, the Ranger quick reaction force was dispatched to the area. Though they weren&#x27;t given a specific mission, they were to establish communication for further instructions upon reaching Gardez, 10 minutes from the mountain. The quick reaction force consisted of 19 Rangers, a Tactical Air Control Party (Tacp), and a three-man USAF special tactics team carried by two Chinooks, Razor 01 and Razor 02. As Air Force rules prohibited AC-130 aircraft from remaining in hostile airspace in daylight after the crash of an AC-130 in Khafji in the Gulf War, the AC-130 support protecting Mako 30 was forced to leave before Razor 01 reached the landing zone, although the leadership was aware that Razor 01 was incoming. Unfortunately, the Razor Chinooks had not been equipped with functioning satellite radios to maintain communication with the headquarters in Bagram or, even more critically, the AFO Team&#x27;s lead. Also, unfortunately, the pilot of the Razor 01 was not told about the enemy&#x27;s anti-aircraft location on top of the mountain. Due to the satellite communications difficulties (which may have been caused by a little-known space weather effect caused by equatorial plasma bubbles), Razor 01 was mistakenly directed to the &quot;hot&quot; landing zone on the peak at . Because of this, the Razor 01 flew into the same enemy trap that the SEALs had flown into, with no one able to communicate the reality of the situation.

At approximately 06:10, Razor 01 reached the landing zone. The aircraft immediately began taking fire, and the right door minigunner, Sergeant Phillip Svitak, was killed by small arms fire. Drone footage of the incident showed the mortally wounded Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman drawing fire away from Razor 01 as it landed. This action earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. A rocket-propelled grenade then hit the helicopter, destroying the right engine and forcing it to crash land. As the Rangers and special tactics team exited the aircraft, Private First Class Matt Commons, posthumously promoted to Corporal, Sergeant Brad Crose, and Specialist Marc Anderson were also killed, leading to a total of three Ranger casualties during the operation. The surviving crew and quick-reaction force at first attempted a daring assault on the Taliban positions but faced tough resistance from concealed insurgent bunkers, which caused the Rangers to retreat and take cover in a hillock where a fierce firefight began. Razor 02, which had been diverted to Gardez as Razor 01 was landing on Takur Ghar, returned with the rest of the quick-reaction force and Lieutenant Commander Hyder at 06:25. With the help of the new arrivals and close air support, the force was able to consolidate its position on the peak. The quick reaction force&#x27;s Chalk 2 moved up the mountain to assist Chalk 1. While air force jets provided suppressive fire on the mountain top with individual gun runs since Mako 30 was less than north of the peak and Chalk 1 with its downed MH-47 was less than 100 m south of the peak. Hyder saw the need to assist Mako 21 who at that time had two dead and two injured, one of them non-ambulatory. It was obvious from this viewpoint that the proximity of friendly forces to the enemy positions was preventing sufficient suppressive firepower from being used due to danger close distance to both Mako 30 and quick reaction force chalk 1. Hyder directed the Chalk 2 leader to continue mission up the mountain and moved, alone, to link up with Mako 21 in order to assist that team&#x27;s movement away from the peak thereby creating a better situation for air assets to support by fire. An enemy counterattack midday mortally wounded Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham, a pararescueman. The wounded were refused medical evacuation during the daylight hours, due to risk of another downed helicopter. Mako 30 and Lt. Cmdr. Hyder moved down the mountain with their wounded. Through threat of nearby enemy response elements, hypothermia and shock of wounded personnel, and across nearly 30&quot; of snow in extreme terrain, Mako 21 found a site suitable for an MH-47. The SEAL team set up defenses, attempted to warm the wounded, and waited for dark when a recovery would be attempted.

Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) soldiers inserted with a United States Air Force Combat Controller had infiltrated the area prior to the first helicopter crash undetected as part of a long range reconnaissance mission when the Chinooks went down. They remained undetected in an observation post through the firefight and proved critical in co-ordinating multiple Coalition air strikes to prevent the al-Qaeda fighters from overrunning the downed aircraft, to devastating effect. This, plus the actions of the two SASR officers working with the 10th Mountain Division, earned the commander of the Australian SASR force in Afghanistan the US Bronze Star for his unit&#x27;s outstanding contribution to the war on terrorism. Australian soldiers had utilised &#x27;virtual reality&#x27; style software for mission rehearsal prior to insertion, and this contributed significantly to their situational awareness in the darkness and poor weather conditions. This was the first time this capability had been used for a live combat mission.

At around 20:00, the quick-reaction force and Mako 30/21 were exfiltrated from the Takur Ghar peak. As a result of this action, both Technical Sergeant Chapman and Senior Airman Cunningham were awarded the Air Force Cross, the second-highest award for bravery. In 2018, Chapman&#x27;s Air Force Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor and he was promoted posthumously to the rank of Master Sergeant. US and Afghan sources believe at least 200 Taliban and Al Qaida fighters were killed during the initial assault and subsequent rescue mission.

Also on March 4, the 2nd Battalion of the Rakkasans air assaulted into the eastern end of the valley, immediately attacking the heights under Apache cover. Meanwhile, the 3rd battalion were dropped into the northern end of the valley with the objective of linking up with the stranded forces at the blocking positions. Supported by 16 Apaches, 5 USMC Cobras helicopters and several A-10A ground attack aircraft; the Rakkasans methodically cleared an estimated 130 caves, 22 bunkers and 40 buildings to finally secure the valley.

=====Fate of Roberts=====
It is not certain whether the sailor died immediately or was killed by opposing soldiers. There is a possibility that Roberts was captured by the al Qaeda fighters, and executed later with a single shot to the back of the head (One of the feeds showed a group of 8-10 fighters huddling around what appeared to be a body; both GRIM 32 and MAKO 30 noted that an IR strobe was active, a video feed showed the fighters passing the IR strobe around). This report has not been confirmed. Major General Frank Hagenbeck did confirm that al-Qaeda fighters were seen (on live video feed from a Predator drone orbiting the firefight) chasing Roberts, and later dragging his body away from the spot where he fell. Another feed from the same Predator showed a puff of heat [from a rifle] and the indistinct figure in front of it fall. Also, the quick-reaction soldiers reported fighters wearing Robert&#x27;s gear and finding &quot;a helmet with a bullet hole in it, [from which] it was clear the last person [Roberts] to wear it had been shot in the head.&quot; Predator drone footage also suggested the possibility that Technical Sergeant John Chapman was alive and fighting on the peak after the SEALs left rather than being killed outright as thought by Mako 30. Chapman was seen fighting in a bunker against multiple enemies before stepping into the open and braving enemy small arms fire one last time to allow the quick reaction force helicopter a bit of breathing room.

A paper written by Andrew Milani (Former commander of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment) and Dr. Stephen D. Biddle entitled &quot;Pitfalls of Technology: A Case Study of the battle of Takur Ghar&quot; noted that the Predator was on station 90 minutes after Roberts had fallen; the images that were shot before the Predator had arrived were shot by GRIM-32&#x27;s Infrared Cameras. although this has not been confirmed by commanders.

===5 March 2002===

The last remaining AFO team in the Shah-i-Kot Valley was Team Juliet. They investigated a cave and building complex at the eastern end of the pass. The area had been targeted by multiple air strikes, including a thermobaric bomb that had destroyed the cave on the day of the operation&#x27;s start. Team Juliet used their ATVs to conduct a passage of lines with the TF Rakkasan elements. They then boarded their Chinook and flew back to Gardez, meaning that every AFO team had now left the valley.

Plans were put in motion to bring in fresh troops for the clearing of the Shah-i-Kot valley, such as troops of the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment and allied Canadian troops. However, there was very little fighting after the events at Takur Ghar, and the U.S. commanders simply chose to take a passive approach and allow the surrounding fires to eliminate the enemy forces.

===10 March 2002===
Major Bryan Hilferty stated that the &quot;major battle ended three or four days ago.&quot; The U.S. sent 400 of its troops back to base. Efforts were organized to convene the Afghan warlords Zia Lodin and Gul Haidar. Their collaboration aimed to formulate a final offensive to sweep the valley floor and rid the villages of any remaining Al-Qaeda presence. Mark Rosengard maintained his belief in nurturing a sense of ownership and pride among the Afghans. He emphasized that the Afghans themselves needed to lead the operation to clear the villages, ensuring their active involvement in the process. Attempting to facilitate cooperation between Zia Lodin and Gul Haidar posed significant challenges. It was evident that there existed a history between these two men, marked by a lack of mutual trust, although the exact details remained elusive to the Americans. Zia Lodin, a Pashtun commander, held distinct differences from Gul Haidar, a Tajik from Logar Province, who served as the Afghan defense minister and had a background with the Northern Alliance.

The primary point of contention between these two men was the order in which they would enter the valley. Both were wary that being the first to advance would leave them with their back turned towards the other, who might potentially take advantage of the situation and shoot them from behind. This disagreement stemmed from their mutual distrust and added complexity to their collaboration efforts. Nevertheless, the Americans ultimately succeeded in convincing the warlords to cooperate and sweep into the valley on March 12.

===12 March 2002===

The Afghan troops finally initiated their belated sweep into the valley using a pincer-style attack. A significant aspect of this operation was Gul Haidar&#x27;s inclusion of a column of T-55 tanks. The U.S. military leadership believed these tanks could play a crucial role in this final operation, despite intelligence suggesting that it was unlikely that any enemy combatants remained in the valley. The American troops accompanying Gul Haidar&#x27;s forces were impressed by his leadership qualities. An illustrative example of this was when his tank column encountered several antitank mines partially buried along the path. Gul Haidar took charge of the situation and personally used a grabbing hook to secure the mines. This garnered both respect and concern from the Americans, who were worried about the commander&#x27;s safety. The only issue happened at one point when Haidar&#x27;s tanks mistakenly fired upon the Rakkasan troops positioned on the mountainside. A T-55 tank crew accidentally fired a main gun round that went right through a pup tent belonging to 2-187 Infantry. Fortunately, no one was injured, and swift radio communication corrected the error.

Meanwhile, Zia Lodin&#x27;s forces, accompanied by Pete Blaber himself, were engaged in clearing the valley&#x27;s southern end. This time, the Afghan troops had the freedom to conduct the operation according to their own strategies, and this made a big difference. Blaber noted that the Afghan troops were highly motivated because they were actually using their own tactics this time. By this point, the operation was nearing its conclusion, with no combat taking place after Takur Ghar except for a minor engagement on March 17. Zia&#x27;s troops continued to clear the deserted villages within the valley, but there was minimal sign of either civilians or enemy combatants. The operation officially continued for a few more days but during this time, the focus shifted to counting bodies and verifying enemy casualties rather than encountering further fighting.

===13 March 2002===
The Rakkasans were replaced by fresh elements from the 10th Mountain Division, who continued to clear the southern end of the Shah-i-Kot. AFO teams launched further Recce teams into the nearby Naka Valley, hunting for al-Qaeda terrorists that had escaped but did not find anything. By this day, following heavy bombing by U.S. strike fighter aircraft, joint U.S. and Afghan forces swept through the valley and cleared it of remaining rebel forces, with little significant combat by 18 March. A total of 8 U.S. soldiers, sailors, and airmen were killed and 82 wounded, along with several Afghan militiamen; U.S. estimates of other casualties vary, indicating rebel casualties between 500 and 800 and at least 14 civilian casualties. An undetermined number of rebels are said to have escaped the fighting through rugged terrain.

===17 March 2002===
Task Force 11 received time-sensitive intelligence that a possible high-value target was traveling within a convoy of al-Qaeda fighters who were attempting to escape by vehicle from Shah-i-Kot into Pakistan. A Predator UAV had the convoy under surveillance, showing 3 SUVs, a pickup truck, and a large security element of gunmen. The TF 11 element assigned to the mission included SEAL operators from DEVGRU (commanded by the SEAL who led the Mako 30 mission on Takur Ghar) and attached British SBS operators, with a mixed force of Rangers as back up. The operators and an assigned CSAR team boarded 3 MH-47Es while the Rangers climbed aboard a pair of MH-60G Blackhawks, launching from Bagram in the early morning. The MH-47Es carrying the SEALs caught up to their targets: the lead Chinook landed in front of the convoy; as the occupants leapt out of their vehicles, the door gunner hosed the vehicles down with his minigun, cutting down a number of al-Qaeda terrorists; the second Chinook overshot the column and raked it with minigun fire as it passed. The TF 11 operators added their firepower. Two Chinooks then landed their passengers in cover nearby and the operators took up positions overlooking the convoy. Both teams of SEAL operators now opened fire down on the enemy fighters in a crossfire and the third Chinook landed its operators nearby to investigate a suspicious looking vehicle. The firefight was over in minutes; of the 18 al-Qaeda fighters, 16 were killed and two were wounded. The fighters were a mix of well equipped Uzbeks, Chechens, and Arabs. The operators recovered a lot of US military equipment: a US-made suppressor, a number of US fragmentation grenades issued to TF 11 and a Garmin handheld GPS, later traced to the crew of Razor 01.

===18 March 2002===
General Tommy Franks declared Operation Anaconda over, later describing it &quot;an unqualified and complete success.&quot; Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh refuted the official account, describing it as &quot;in fact a debacle, plagued by squabbling between the services, bad military planning and avoidable deaths of American soldiers, as well as the escape of key al-Qaeda leaders, likely including Osama bin Laden.&quot;

==Assessment==

At the end of Operation Anaconda, the US and Afghan forces had succeeded at removing the majority of the Al-Qaeda and Taliban presence from the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The US forces suffered 80 casualties in the operation, with 8 killed and 72 wounded. An undetermined number of Afghan fighters were also killed in the Operation Anaconda. Estimates of Al-Qaeda and Taliban casualties range from 100 to 1,000, with U.S. commanders favoring the higher estimates and Afghan commanders favoring the lower estimates. The U.S. forces estimated they had killed at least 500 fighters over the duration of the battle, however, journalists later noted that only 23 bodies were found – and critics suggested that after a couple of days, the operation &quot;was more driven by media obsession, than military necessity&quot;.

Security expert Bill Roggio argued that al-Qaeda &quot;took a beating during the battle, [but] they were by no means defeated&quot;.

A significant critique of Operation Anaconda centered around the lack of air support that the Rakkasan troops relied upon. General Hagenbeck expressed frustration about the delays in getting requested airstrikes when needed. He highlighted in an interview with &quot;Field Artillery&quot; magazine in September 2002 that there were instances where it took anywhere from twenty-six minutes to several hours for the requested air strikes to actually arrive. This meant that the Infantry positioned in the Halfpipe had to endure extended periods of time lying in the dirt, exposed to enemy fire, without the necessary air cover. While air support proved crucial in assisting the Infantry during the operation, often responding quickly and neutralizing insurgent mortar positions and machine-gun nests as requested, there were other instances in which the air support team failed to adequately assist the ground forces.

Operation Anaconda was also met with criticism from allied coalition forces. According to an interview of some soldiers of the German Special Forces KSK, the post-operation briefing was broken down by an argument between the KSK soldiers and U.S. soldiers. The cause of the conflict is said to have been the complaint of some U.S. soldiers that the KSK soldiers had only changed their position when a shepherd stumbled into their hideout instead of killing him. &quot;Use your silenced gun, then move on.&quot;

&quot;&quot;The U.S. soldiers would in fact eliminate such &#x27;threats,&#x27; says a former KSK officer. (...) The Germans are quoted to have witnessed U.S. Forces flattening entire villages during Operation Anaconda: &#x27;Let&#x27;s go, free to pillage&#x27; (...). A former KSK commander is quoted in the German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; to have said: &#x27;The pictures of Abu Ghraib, the torture in Iraqi prison camps, did absolutely not surprise me.&quot;&#x27;

In the wake of Operation Anaconda, relations between US and UK forces on the ground soured when &quot;Stars and Stripes,&quot; the magazine for American forces and their families, openly criticized the Royal Marines for returning &quot;empty-handed&quot; from their search for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters claiming that Britain&#x27;s contribution to the campaign was &quot;disappointing.&quot; Relations were further soured with reports from a number of publications that Osama bin Laden might have escaped due to a substantial delay from the original H-hour of the deployment of American Forces.

Stephen Biddle has characterized Operation Anaconda as a &quot;series of surprisingly orthodox ground battles.&quot; He rejects the popular characterization of the operation as a guerilla war.

===Long-distance sniper record===
The record for the longest combat kill by a sniper was during Operation Anaconda by the Canadian Army sniper Corporal Rob Furlong of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and held for seven years until it was surpassed in 2009. Using a McMillan TAC-50 .50-calibre rifle, Furlong killed a Taliban fighter armed with an RPK machine gun at a confirmed distance of 2,430 meters (1.51 miles). A few days prior to Furlong&#x27;s shot, his teammate, Arron Perry, also from the 3rd Battalion PPCLI, had set the previous record of , meaning that a new record was achieved twice during the operation.

The five-man team, including MCpl Graham Ragsdale, MCpl Tim McMeekin, MCpl Arron Perry, Cpl Dennis Eason, and Cpl Rob Furlong, killed over 20 enemy fighters during the operation and were awarded Bronze Star medals by the United States for their service.

==Aftermath==
After defeating Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the Shah-i-Kot valley, coalition forces launched a series of follow-up operations codenamed &quot;Operation Jacana&quot; starting April 16. These operations aimed to tackle insurgents who were expected to regroup and launch guerrilla attacks in surrounding areas. The British Defense Secretary, Geoff Hoon, announced the largest deployment of British combat forces since the Gulf War in 1991. Around 1,700 Royal Marines, including troops from the 45 Commando battalion, were sent to Afghanistan for these planned operations. Franks and Hagenbeck anticipated many more battles ahead, stating that there were ‘thousands of enemies [still] out there’. In fact, this assumption turned out to be completely false, and Operation Anaconda became the last major battle in Afghanistan for the next several years. This led many Royal Marines to complain that they had been deployed &quot;a month too late&quot;, as the combat action that they had anticipated did not materialize.

The 10th Mountain Division carried out intelligence-driven operations to locate any remaining Al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents but did not find much, as it appeared that the jihadists had either escaped to Pakistan or gone into hiding in remote areas of Afghanistan. A large proportion of the US forces found themselves in a state of waiting, eager to act, but with no immediate tasks at hand. The troops of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps found themselves in a similar situation, spending only 5 out of 120 days actively engaged in operations outside their bases. By July the tactical-level units from the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne Division, including TF Rakkasan, had all
departed Afghanistan; the CTF Mountain headquarters staff followed in early September. They were replaced by CTF 82, formed from the headquarters of the 82d Airborne Division and led by the division&#x27;s commander, Major General John R. Vines. CTF 82&#x27;s headquarters was at Bagram Airfield, and Vines-based TF Panther, his primary maneuver element, at the Kandahar Airfield. TF Panther was under the command of Colonel James L. Huggins and had two infantry battalions from the 3d Brigade of the 82d Airborne Division and one attached infantry battalion from the division&#x27;s 1st Brigade. Huggins also had support from artillery, aviation, military intelligence, and other units. TF Panther deployed to Afghanistan in late June 2002 and would serve under CTF 82 until 5 December 2002. At that point TF Devil, a unit formed around the 1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division arrived to take the lead in tactical-level security operations.

The Taliban subsequently portrayed the operation as a &quot;historical battle&quot; and a &quot;beginning of the sacred jihad against the occupation of Afghanistan&quot;, praising Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor&#x27;s leadership. The battle and Mansoor (who was killed in 2008) were eulogized by the Taliban&#x27;s official website, &quot;Voice of Jihad&quot;, on 7 March 2021.

<text>&quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; is a short story by O. Henry (pen name of William Sydney Porter) first published in 1905. The story tells of a young husband and wife and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money. As a sentimental story with a moral lesson about gift-giving, it has been popular for adaptation, especially for presentation at Christmas time. The plot and its twist ending are well known; the ending is generally considered an example of cosmic irony. The story was allegedly written at Pete&#x27;s Tavern on Irving Place in New York City.

The story was initially published in &quot;The New York Sunday World&quot; under the title &quot;Gifts of the Magi&quot; on December 10, 1905. It was first published in book form in the O. Henry collection &quot;The Four Million&quot; in April 1906.

==Plot==

On Christmas Eve, a woman named Della Dillingham Young discovers that she has only $1.87 (equivalent to about $ in ) to buy a present for her husband James, also known as Jim. Despite being poor, the Dillingham Youngs love each other and possess two items they value as treasures: Della&#x27;s knee-length brown hair that would depreciate the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s jewels, and Jim&#x27;s gold pocket watch, a family heirloom that would make King Solomon envy him.

Della dresses warmly and visits the nearby shop of a wig maker, Madame Sofronie, who buys Della&#x27;s hair for $20 (about $ in ). Della then uses the money to buy a platinum fob chain to go with Jim&#x27;s watch, which he has attached with a worn leather strap. When Jim comes home from work that evening, Della admits that she sold her hair to buy him the chain. Jim gives Della her present, a set of ornamental combs, which she cannot use until her hair grows back out. Della gives Jim the watch chain, and he tells her that he sold his watch to buy the combs. While they know the gifts they gave each other cannot be used for a while, Jim and Della realize how far they went to show each other their love and how invaluable it truly is. The story ends with the narrator declaring that those who sacrifice their material possessions for the people they love are as wise as the magi.

<text>William Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 – June 5, 1910), better known by his pen name O. Henry, was an American writer known primarily for his short stories, though he also wrote poetry and non-fiction. His works include &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, &quot;The Duplicity of Hargraves&quot;, and &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;, as well as the novel &quot;Cabbages and Kings&quot;. Porter&#x27;s stories are known for their naturalist observations, witty narration, and surprise endings.

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Porter worked at his uncle&#x27;s pharmacy after finishing school and became a licensed pharmacist at age 19. In March 1882, he moved to Texas, where he initially lived on a ranch, and later settled in Austin, where he met his first wife, Athol Estes. While working as a drafter for the Texas General Land Office, Porter began developing characters for his short stories. He later worked for the First National Bank of Austin, while also publishing a weekly periodical, &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 1895, he was charged with embezzlement stemming from an audit of the bank. Before the trial, he fled to Honduras, where he began writing &quot;Cabbages and Kings&quot; (in which he coined the term &quot;banana republic&quot;). Porter surrendered to U.S. authorities when he learned his wife was dying from tuberculosis, and he cared for her until her death in July 1897. He began his five-year prison sentence in March 1898 at the Ohio Penitentiary, where he served as a night druggist. While imprisoned, Porter published 14 stories under various pseudonyms, one being O. Henry.

Released from prison early for good behavior, Porter moved to Pittsburgh to be with his daughter Margaret before relocating to New York City, where he wrote 381 short stories. He married Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman in 1907; she left him two years later. Porter died on June 5, 1910, after years of deteriorating health. Porter&#x27;s legacy includes the O. Henry Award, an annual prize awarded to outstanding short stories.

==Biography==
===Early life===
William Sidney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in Greensboro, North Carolina, during the American Civil War. He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898. His parents were Algernon Sidney Porter (1825–88), a physician, and Mary Jane Virginia Swaim Porter (1833–65). William&#x27;s parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died after giving birth to her third child, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to dime novels; his favorite works were Lane&#x27;s translation of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; and Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;.

Porter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter&#x27;s elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was 15. In 1879, he started working in his uncle&#x27;s drugstore in Greensboro, and on August 30, 1881, at the age of 19, Porter was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.

===Life in Texas===
Porter traveled along with James K. Hall to Texas in March 1882, hoping that a change of air would help alleviate a persistent cough he had developed. He took up residence on the sheep ranch of Richard Hall, James Hall&#x27;s son, in La Salle County and helped out as a shepherd, ranch hand, cook, and baby-sitter. While on the ranch, he learned bits of Spanish and German from the mix of indigenous and immigrant ranch hands. He also spent time reading classic works of literature.

Porter&#x27;s health did improve. He traveled with Richard to Austin, Texas, in 1884, where he decided to remain and was welcomed into the home of Richard&#x27;s friends, Joseph Harrell, and his wife. Porter resided with the Harrells for three years. He went to work briefly for the Morley Brothers Drug Company as a pharmacist. Porter then moved on to work for the Harrell Cigar Store located in the Driskill Hotel. He also began writing as a sideline and wrote many of his early stories in the Harrell house.

As a young bachelor, Porter led an active social life in Austin. He was known for his wit, story-telling, and musical talents. He played both the guitar and mandolin. He sang in the choir at St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church and became a member of the &quot;Hill City Quartette&quot;, a group of young men who sang at gatherings and serenaded young women of the town.
Porter met and began courting Athol Estes, 17 years old and from a wealthy family. Historians believe Porter met Athol at the laying of the cornerstone of the Texas State Capitol on March 2, 1885. Her mother objected to the match because Athol was ill, suffering from tuberculosis. On July 1, 1887, Porter eloped with Athol and they were married in the parlor of the home of the Reverend R. K. Smoot, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, where the Estes family attended church. The couple continued to participate in musical and theater groups, and Athol encouraged her husband to pursue his writing. Athol gave birth to a son in 1888, who died hours after birth, and then a daughter Margaret Worth Porter in September 1889.

Porter&#x27;s friend Richard Hall became Texas Land Commissioner and offered Porter a job. Porter started as a draftsman at the Texas General Land Office (GLO) on January 12, 1887, at a salary of $100 a month, drawing maps from surveys and field notes. The salary was enough to support his family, but he continued his contributions to magazines and newspapers. In the GLO building, he began developing characters and plots for such stories as &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Ruling&quot; (1900), and &quot;Buried Treasure&quot; (1908). The castle-like building he worked in was woven into some of his tales such as &quot;Bexar Scrip No. 2692&quot; (1894). His job at the GLO was a political appointment by Hall. Hall ran for governor in the election of 1890 but lost. Porter resigned on January 21, 1891, the day after the new governor, Jim Hogg, was sworn in.
The same year, Porter began working at the First National Bank of Austin as a teller and bookkeeper at the same salary he had made at the GLO. The bank was operated informally, and Porter was apparently careless in keeping his books and may have embezzled funds. In 1894, he was accused by the bank of embezzlement and lost his job but was not indicted at the time.

He then worked full-time on his humorous weekly called &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot;, which he started while working at the bank. &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot; featured satire on life, people, and politics and included Porter&#x27;s short stories and sketches. Although eventually reaching a top circulation of 1,500, &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot; failed in April 1895 because the paper never provided an adequate income. However, his writing and drawings had caught the attention of the editor at the &quot;Houston Post&quot;.

Porter and his family moved to Houston in 1895, where he started writing for the &quot;Post&quot;. His salary was only $25 a month, but it rose steadily as his popularity increased. Porter gathered ideas for his column by loitering in hotel lobbies and observing and talking to people there. This was a technique he used throughout his writing career.

While he was in Houston, federal auditors audited the First National Bank of Austin and found the embezzlement shortages that led to his firing. A federal indictment followed, and he was arrested on charges of embezzlement.

===Flight and return===

After his arrest, Porter&#x27;s father-in-law posted his bail. He was due to stand trial on July 7, 1896, but the day before, as he was changing trains to get to the courthouse, he got scared. He fled, first to New Orleans and later to Honduras, with which the United States had no extradition treaty at that time. Porter lived in Honduras for six months, until January 1897. There he became friends with Al Jennings, a notorious train robber, who later wrote a book about their friendship. He holed up in a Trujillo hotel, where he wrote &quot;Cabbages and Kings&quot;, which notably coined the term &quot;banana republic&quot;. Porter had sent Athol and Margaret back to Austin to live with Athol&#x27;s parents. Unfortunately, Athol became too ill to meet Porter in Honduras as he had planned. When he learned that his wife was dying, Porter returned to Austin in February 1897 and surrendered to the court, pending trial. Athol Estes Porter died from tuberculosis (then known as consumption) on July 25, 1897.

Porter had little to say in his own defense at his trial and was found guilty on February 17, 1898, of embezzling $854.08. He was sentenced to five years in prison and imprisoned on March 25, 1898, at the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio. Porter was a licensed pharmacist and was able to work in the prison hospital as the night druggist. He was given his own room in the hospital wing, and there is no record that he actually spent time in the cell block of the prison. He had 14 stories published under various pseudonyms while he was in prison but was becoming best known as &quot;O. Henry&quot;, a pseudonym that first appeared over the story &quot;Whistling Dick&#x27;s Christmas Stocking&quot; in the December 1899 issue of &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. A friend of his in New Orleans would forward his stories to publishers so that they had no idea that the writer was imprisoned.

Porter was released on July 24, 1901, for good behavior after serving three years. He reunited with his daughter Margaret, now age 11, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Athol&#x27;s parents had moved after Porter&#x27;s conviction.

===Later life===
Porter&#x27;s most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. While there, he wrote 381 short stories. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the &quot;New York World Sunday Magazine&quot;. His wit, characterization, and plot twists were adored by his readers but often panned by critics.

Porter married again in 1907 to childhood sweetheart Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman, whom he met again after revisiting his native state of North Carolina. Coleman was herself a writer and wrote a romanticized and fictionalized version of their correspondence and courtship in her novella &quot;Wind of Destiny&quot;.

===Death===
Porter was a heavy drinker, and by 1908, his markedly deteriorating health affected his writing. In 1909, Sarah left him, and he died on June 5, 1910, of cirrhosis of the liver, complications of diabetes, and an enlarged heart. According to one account, he died of cerebral hemorrhage.

After funeral services in New York City, he was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, North Carolina. His daughter Margaret Worth Porter had a short writing career from 1913 to 1916. She married cartoonist Oscar Cesare of New York in 1916; they were divorced four years later. She died of tuberculosis in 1927 and was buried next to her father.

According to the cemetery, as of 2023, people have been leaving $1.87 in change (the amount of Della&#x27;s savings at the beginning of &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;) on Porter&#x27;s grave for at least 30 years. The cemetery says the money is given to area libraries.

==Stories==

Most of Porter&#x27;s stories are set in his own time, the early 20th century. He had an obvious affection for New York City, which he called &quot;Bagdad-on-the-Subway&quot;, and many of his stories are set there, while others are set in small towns or in other cities. They frequently feature working class characters, such as policemen and waitresses, as well as criminals and social outcasts. In his day he was called the American answer to French naturalist Guy de Maupassant, whose work was similarly concerned with the struggles of common people and often had twist endings.

&quot;Cabbages and Kings&quot; was his first collection of stories, followed by &quot;The Four Million&quot;. The second collection opens with a reference to Ward McAllister&#x27;s claim that there were &quot;...only &#x27;Four Hundred&#x27; people in New York City who were really worth noticing. But a wiser man has arisen—the census taker—and his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the Four Million.&quot;

His final work was &quot;Dream&quot;, a short story intended for the magazine &quot;The Cosmopolitan&quot;. It was never completed.

Among his most famous stories are:
* &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; is about a young couple, Jim and Della, who are short of money but desperately want to buy each other Christmas gifts. Unbeknownst to Jim, Della sells her most valuable possession, her beautiful hair, in order to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim&#x27;s watch; while unbeknownst to Della, Jim sells his own most valuable possession, his watch, to buy jeweled combs for Della&#x27;s hair. The essential premise of this story has been copied, re-worked, parodied, and otherwise re-told countless times in the century since it was written.
* &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot; in which two men kidnap a boy of ten years old to ransom him. The boy turns out to be so spoiled and obnoxious that the desperate men ultimately pay the boy&#x27;s father $250 to take him back.
* &quot;The Cop and the Anthem&quot; about a New York City hobo named Soapy who sets out to get arrested so that he can be a guest of the city jail instead of sleeping out in the cold winter. Despite his best efforts at committing petty theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and &quot;flirting&quot; with a young prostitute, Soapy fails to draw the attention of the police. Dejected, he stops in front of a church, where an organ anthem inspires him to clean up his life; however, he is charged with loitering, and sentenced to three months in prison.
* &quot;A Retrieved Reformation&quot; tells the tale of safecracker Jimmy Valentine, a man recently freed from prison. He goes to a town bank to case it before he robs it. As he walks to the door, he catches the eye of the banker&#x27;s beautiful daughter. They immediately fall in love and Valentine decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph Spencer, a shoemaker. Just as he is about to leave to deliver his specialized tools to an old associate, a lawman who recognizes him arrives at the bank. Jimmy and his fiancée and her family are at the bank, inspecting a new safe when a child accidentally gets locked inside the airtight vault. Knowing it will seal his fate, Valentine opens the safe to rescue the child. However, much to Valentine&#x27;s surprise, the lawman denies recognizing him and lets him go.
* &quot;The Duplicity of Hargraves&quot; tells the story of the Talbots, a father and daughter from the Old South, newly poor after the Civil War, who move to Washington, DC. An actor, Hargraves, offers Mr. Talbot money, which he is too proud to accept. But when Talbot is approached by an old man, a former slave who gives him money to settle an old family debt, he accepts it. It is later revealed that Hargraves secretly portrayed the slave.
* &quot;The Caballero&#x27;s Way&quot; in which Porter&#x27;s most famous character, the Cisco Kid, is introduced. It was first published in 1907 in the July issue of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and collected in the book &quot;Heart of the West&quot; that same year. In later film and TV depictions, the Kid would be portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily on the side of the angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature the character, the Kid is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger.

==Pen name==
Porter used a number of pen names (including &quot;O. Henry&quot; or &quot;Olivier Henry&quot;) in the early part of his writing career; other names included S.H. Peters, James L. Bliss, T.B. Dowd, and Howard Clark. Nevertheless, the name &quot;O. Henry&quot; seemed to garner the most attention from editors and the public, and was used exclusively by Porter for his writing by about 1902. He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name. In 1909, he gave an interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he gave an account of it:

William Trevor writes in the introduction to &quot;The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories&quot; (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1973) that &quot;there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry&quot; in the Ohio State Penitentiary &quot;whom William Sydney Porter ... immortalised as O. Henry&quot;.

According to J. F. Clarke, it is from the name of the French pharmacist Etienne Ossian Henry, whose name is in the &quot;U.S. Dispensary&quot; which Porter used working in the prison pharmacy.

Writer and scholar Guy Davenport offers his own hypothesis: &quot;The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of &quot;Ohio&quot; and the second and last two of &quot;penitentiary&quot;.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The O. Henry Award is an annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories.

A film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot;. The episode garnering the most critical acclaim was &quot;The Cop and the Anthem&quot; starring Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe. The other stories are &quot;The Clarion Call&quot;, &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;, &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;, and &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;.

&quot;Strictly Business&quot; is a 1962 Soviet comedy film, directed by Leonid Gaidai, based on three short stories by O. Henry: &quot;The Roads We Take&quot;, &quot;Makes the Whole World Kin&quot;, and &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;. The premiere of the film was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the writer. Henry was particularly popular in Russia in the 1920s, and was described by the critic Deming Brown in 1953 as &quot;remain[ing] a minor classic in Russia&quot;. In 1962, the Soviet Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating O. Henry&#x27;s 100th birthday.

A 1957 television series, &quot;The O. Henry Playhouse&quot;, was syndicated in 39 episodes to 188 markets. Actor Thomas Mitchell portrayed O. Henry in each episode as he interacted with his characters or related his latest story to his publisher or a friend.

The 1986 Indian anthology television series &quot;Katha Sagar&quot; adapted several of Henry&#x27;s short stories as episodes including &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;.

An opera in one long act, &quot;The Furnished Room&quot;, with music by Daniel Steven Crafts and libretto by Richard Kuss, is based on O. Henry&#x27;s story of the same name.

The O. Henry House and O. Henry Hall, both in Austin, Texas, are named for him. O. Henry Hall, now owned by the Texas State University System, previously served as the federal courthouse in which O. Henry was convicted of embezzlement. The O. Henry House has been the site of the O. Henry Pun-Off, an annual spoken word competition inspired by Porter&#x27;s love of language, since 1978. (Dr. Samuel E. Gideon, a historical architect and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, was a strong advocate for the saving of the O. Henry House in Austin.)

Several schools are named for Porter: William Sydney Porter Elementary in Greensboro, North Carolina, O. Henry Elementary in Garland, Texas, the O. Henry School (I.S. 70) in New York City, and O. Henry Middle School in Austin, Texas.

The O. Henry Hotel in Greensboro is also named for Porter, as is US 29, which is O. Henry Boulevard.

Asheville, North Carolina, where Porter is buried, has O. Henry Avenue, the location of the &quot;Asheville Citizen-Times&quot; building.

On September 11, 2012, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of O. Henry&#x27;s birth.

On November 23, 2011, Barack Obama quoted O. Henry while granting pardons to two turkeys named &quot;Liberty&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;. In response, political science professor P. S. Ruckman Jr. and Texas attorney Scott Henson filed a formal application for a posthumous pardon in September 2012, the same month that the U.S. Postal Service issued its O. Henry stamp. Previous attempts were made to obtain such a pardon for Porter in the administrations of Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan, but no one had ever bothered to file a formal application. Ruckman and Henson argued that Porter deserved a pardon because (1) he was a law-abiding citizen prior to his conviction; (2) his offense was minor; (3) he had an exemplary prison record; (4) his post-prison life clearly indicated rehabilitation; (5) he would have been an excellent candidate for clemency in his time, had he but applied for pardon; (6) by today&#x27;s standards, he remains an excellent candidate for clemency; and (7) his pardon would be a well-deserved symbolic gesture and more. The pardon remains ungranted.

In 2021 the Library of America included O. Henry in their list by publishing a collection of 101 of his stories, edited by Ben Yagoda.

<text>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends is a 1981–1983 American animated television series produced by Marvel Productions, considered to be a crossover series connected to the 1981 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series. The show stars already-established Marvel Comics characters Spider-Man and Iceman, along with an original character, Firestar. As a trio called the Spider-Friends, they fight against various villains of the Marvel Universe.

==Production==
The series was an attempt by NBC to replicate some of the success ABC enjoyed with the &quot;Super Friends&quot; franchise. The makers of the show originally intended the stars to be Spider-Man, Iceman, and the Human Torch. However, legal issues about the rights to the Human Torch character (which had also plagued Marvel once before for the 1978 &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; cartoon) led to the Human Torch being replaced by a new character, Firestar, who had similar powers, but was a mutant like Iceman. Due to Firestar&#x27;s popularity with fans, she has since become a part of the mainstream Marvel Universe. In pre-production, Firestar&#x27;s codename changed frequently; the unused names include Firefly, Starblaze, and Heatwave.

Marvel Comics maintained a high level of creative control over the series, with Stan Lee (co-creator of both Spider-Man and Iceman) working with the screenwriters and involving himself in the casting and animation.

Some of the sound effects used in the series originated from Universal Television&#x27;s &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. Adding Ms. Lion, a pet, as a character was another attempt to emulate the &quot;Super Friends&quot; (specifically the characters Wonder Dog and Gleek).

Firestar actress Kathy Garver recalled that though the storyboards for each episode were completed before the voices were recorded for it, &quot;... we really just worked from script. We&#x27;d do a roundtable to get the feeling of how the show was going, and then we would record&quot;.

==Broadcast schedule==
Originally broadcast on NBC as a Saturday morning cartoon, the series ran first-run original episodes for three seasons, from 1981 to 1983, then aired repeats for an additional two years (from 1984 to 1986). Alongside the 1981 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series, &quot;Amazing Friends&quot; was later re-aired in the late 1980s as part of the 90-minute &quot;Marvel Action Universe&quot;, a syndicated series that was used as a platform for old and new Marvel-produced animated fare (the newer programming featured &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dino-Riders&quot; and on occasion &quot;X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men&quot;, which was a pilot for a potential X-Men animated series). Mihahn and Toei Animation contributed some of the animation for this series.

===Season changes===
During the first season, each episode contained a cold open, which was and remains unusual for a children&#x27;s cartoon. When the same episodes were re-aired later in the series&#x27; run, these teaser sequences were edited to fit after the titles and episode card. Still, the original sequence infrequently showed up on NBC&#x27;s re-airings. Stan Lee did not originally narrate the episodes from this season.

In the second season, the show aired along with a newly produced Hulk animated series as The Incredible Hulk and the Amazing Spider-Man. The two shows shared one intro which showcased the new title. In place of the cold opens from the first season, Marvel Productions created 12-second previews aired immediately preceding the episodes. Stan Lee began narrating the episodes in the second season. Marvel Productions also added narrations by Lee to the first-season episodes at this time to give the series cohesion. Neither first nor second season narrations appear on the current masters, and they have not aired since the NBC airings (as seen on the Stan Lee narration list at Spider-Friends.com).

For the third season, the characters&#x27; billing was reversed and the show was called, The Amazing Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk. It remained that way for most of the remaining years. NBC did air the show individually in mid-season (post 1986) after it was not initially announced for their fall schedule. Only some of the Stan Lee narrations for the third season are on the current masters. The missing narrations have not aired since the NBC airings.

==Storyline==
Peter Parker (Spider-Man), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Angelica Jones (Firestar) are all college students at Empire State University. After working together to defeat the Beetle and recovering the &quot;Power Booster&quot; he stole from Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) the trio decide to team-up permanently as the &quot;Spider-Friends&quot;. They live together in Peter&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s home with her and a pet dog named Ms. Lion, a Lhasa Apso who was adopted by Firestar. Together, the superheroes battle various supervillains.

Some stories featured team-ups with other superheroes including but not limited to Captain America, Thor, Sunfire, and the mid-1970s X-Men.

==Characters==
===Original characters===
A number of characters in the series were original characters that did not appear in the comics prior to the premiere of the series:

====Firestar====

One of the series&#x27; main characters, Firestar was created specifically for this series when the Human Torch was unavailable (due to licensing issues). The original plan was for Spider-Man to have fire and ice based teammates, so Angelica Jones/Firestar was created. Her pre-production names included &quot;Heatwave&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, (both having already been names of DC Comics villains) and &quot;Starblaze&quot;.

Firestar did not appear in Marvel&#x27;s mainstream comic book universe until &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193 (May 1985). She appears as a member of the Hellions, a group of teenage mutants who functioned as rivals to the New Mutants (a similar group under the tutelage of Charles Xavier). After leaving the Hellions, Firestar becomes a founding member of the New Warriors and later serves as a distinguished member of the Avengers along with her fellow New Warrior, Justice. She is currently a member of the X-Men.

====Hiawatha Smith====
Hiawatha Smith is a college professor at the Spider-Friends&#x27; university. He is the son of a heroic Native American chief who fought against the Axis during World War II.

Hiawatha Smith&#x27;s home is adorned with decorations from various cultures including Hindu and native African tribes. Producer and story editor Dennis Marks created the character and admits to basing him on Indiana Jones.

Smith&#x27;s father passed down to his son the mystic knowledge of their people and a map leading to a vast Nazi treasure of wealth and advanced technology sought by the Red Skull. Smith often employs a boomerang in battle. He possesses a supernatural ability to communicate with animals.

====Lightwave====

Lightwave&#x27;s real name is Aurora Dante. Like her older half-brother Bobby Drake (a.k.a. the superhero Iceman), Lightwave is a mutant. She can manipulate and control light. Her other light-based powers include laser blasts, photonic force fields and solid light pressor beams. She can also transform herself into light; in such a form, she is able to exist in the vacuum of outer space.

Lightwave&#x27;s only appearance was in &quot;Save the Guardstar&quot;, the final episode of the 1980s cartoon. She is voiced by Annie Lockhart. Bobby Drake explains that they share the same mother.

An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Lightwave is considered a traitor, due to mind control by rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Buzz Mason. Mason induces Lightwave to steal assorted devices to create a &quot;quantum enhancer&quot; which would increase her powers 1,000 times. With such power, Lightwave would be able to control the Guardstar satellite which orbits the Earth and controls all defense systems and communications systems for the United States. Mason expects world conquest since he controls Lightwave.

Iceman, Firestar, and Spider-Man attempt to stop Lightwave. However, she is powerful enough to defeat them. Aboard a space vessel, Buzz Mason forces Iceman into outer space, dooming Iceman if he remains there for long. Spider-Man convinces Lightwave to realize that the half-brother she loves is in mortal danger. Her reaction breaks Mason&#x27;s control over her, and she saves Iceman and disables Mason long enough for Spider-Man to subdue him.

Presumably, with Mason&#x27;s role realized, S.H.I.E.L.D. restores Lightwave&#x27;s good standing. As this is Lightwave&#x27;s only appearance, her fate is unknown.

====Videoman====
Videoman is an intangible two-dimensional being with lightning bolt-shaped horns that is mostly composed of electronic data gleaned from a video arcade. Videoman makes three appearances in the series where there are two versions of him.

=====As a villain=====
In Season 1, Videoman first appeared as an angular humanoid energy construct created by Electro. Its abilities include moving through and manipulating electronic circuits and projecting rectangular pulses of energy. Videoman is used by Electro to suck in and entrap Spider-Man, Flash Thompson, Firestar and Iceman into a video game display where Electro attempts to destroy the four. However, Flash is able to save himself and the others by escaping through the monitor and into Electro&#x27;s electronic components to save the others.

This first villainous version of Videoman makes one other appearance in Season 2&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Ice-Man&quot;, with the additional abilities of bringing video game characters to life and draining the unique bio-energy of mutants, temporarily suppressing Iceman&#x27;s powers and weakening Firestar, as well as being able to emulate their powers for its own use. This time, Videoman is defeated when the Spider-Friends trick it and its video game minions into attacking one another.

=====As a superhero=====
In the Season 3 episode &quot;The Education of a Superhero&quot;, nerdy Francis Byte is an avid video game player who is especially engrossed into gaining the high score on a game called Zellman Comman at the local arcade. The villain Gamesman sends a hypnotic signal that entrances over 300,000 people in the city. This does not affect Francis&#x27; girlfriend Louise, Spider-Man, and Firestar, nor does the signal affect Francis&#x27; mind, which is distracted from entrancement by Louise and the game. Louise walks away from Francis, then also gets affected and hypnotized after having her pleas disregarded by Francis. He (unbeknownst to any others) plays the arcade machine so rigorously that it and other arcade machines (most of which are emitting the hypnotic waves) explode. The explosion somehow transforms Francis into Videoman.

Francis discovers that he can become his new blue and white, red-eyed alter-ego Videoman at will. However, he is completely inexperienced with his handling of such powerful abilities. He tries to help the trio (which has awakened Iceman from his trance) against a hypnotized mob, but they repel his offers due to his inexperience. He then tries to save Louise from the Gamesman, but he is easily blackmailed into manipulating a military communications satellite system in return for Louise&#x27;s freedom, an offer that is then reneged upon by the Gamesman. Enraged at the trickery, Videoman helps Spider-Man and the others free Louise and also reverses his stoppage of the military computer. After the Gamesman is defeated, Francis accepts an invitation to join the X-Men, while Louise accepts him and his abilities.

&quot;Videoman&quot; made a cameo appearance in the 2023 film &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;. He is depicted as a prisoner of Miguel O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Spider-Society among other universe-displaced villains.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
=== Season 1 (1981) ===
=== Season 2 (1982) ===
This season features the origins of all three Spider-Friends.

=== Season 3 (1983) ===
==Release==
===Home media===
No Region 1 or other NTSC release is planned at this time.
====Region 2====
In April 2008, Liberation Entertainment secured the home media rights to select Marvel shows from Jetix Europe in select European territories, including &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;. On November 10, the company released the first season of the series on DVD followed up with a Series 2-3 set and Complete Series DVD sets on November 24. These releases were distributed through Lace International, due to Liberation closing their UK branch a few weeks prior in October. The Liberation releases did not include any of the Stan Lee narrations from the first or second season. Only some of the Stan Lee narrations were in the third season.

Clear Vision later took over European rights and re-released the series on August 2, 2010 (Season 1) and September 6, 2010 (Seasons 2 and 3) in the United Kingdom respectively, with a German release following afterwards. These newer editions have improved image quality and include German dubbing, while removing the 5.1 audio track and English subtitles. A Complete Series release followed on February 11, 2013.

Budget distributor Walk released a small number of DVD releases in the United Kingdom containing two episodes each for sale in Poundland stores in 2013, under the &quot;Treat Size Introduces...&quot; banner.

===Streaming===
The series was available for instant streaming via Netflix from 2011 to August 2015. As part of the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, the copyrights to the New World library were transferred to TFCF America, Inc., a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, effective on March 15, 2019. Consequently, the series became available on the Disney+ streaming service, as a part of U.S. launch on November 12, 2019.

====Censorship====
The episode &quot;The Quest of the Red Skull&quot; was excluded due to its direct depictions of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi swastika and the phrase &#x27;Heil Hitler&#x27;. In 2020, Disney+ placed a warning on the 3rd episode (entitled &quot;Sunfire&quot;) for a racially insensitive portrayal of Sunfire. In the episode, Sunfire is portrayed as speaking English with a Japanese accent.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Adam Levine of &quot;Looper&quot; said: &quot;The mutant duo became a memorable pairing for Spider-Man, and the series has been fondly remembered in the decades since for its quaint stories, colorful villains, light-hearted nature, and iconic introductions by creator Stan Lee. The animation was a step up from previous attempts, even if it was still relatively simplistic, and stories explored more of Peter Parker&#x27;s personal life than the 1960s series before it&quot;. James Whitbrook of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; ranked 5th in their &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s Best Cartoons&quot; list, writing: &quot;The trio had an excellent dynamic that elevated Amazing beyond its sister show, and as campy as it could be, there&#x27;s a reason why it remains beloved by many&quot;.

Olivia Fitzpatrick of &quot;Collider&quot; ranked &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friend&quot; 3rd in their &quot;Every &#x27;Spider-Man&#x27; Animated Series&quot; list. Jason Serafino of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked 25th in their &quot;25 Best Animated Comic Book TV Shows Of All Time&quot; list. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; 59th in their &quot;Top 100 Animated Series&quot; list, stating that &quot;the animation was predictably budget for the time, particularly when viewed in this post-&quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; world of ours, but it was fun nonetheless&quot;.

=== Impact ===
* Scenes from &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; were re-cut, edited, and re-dubbed into comical shorts as part of Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Mash-Up&quot; shorts for their &quot;Marvel Universe on Disney XD&quot; block of programming that includes &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; where scenes from &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot; were also mixed with some scenes from the 1981 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cartoon. The cast consists of Dave Boat as Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, Beetle, Sandman, Norman Osborn, Shocker, Thor, Doctor Strange, Wolverine, Colossus, Sprite, Thunderbird, Red Skull, and Magneto, Tom Kenny as Iceman, Firestar, Aunt May, Green Goblin, Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, Swarm, Captain America, Professor X, Nightcrawler, and Loki, J. P. Karliak as Black Cat and Bruce Banner, James Arnold Taylor as Chameleon, Captain America, Iron Man, and Cyberiad, Dee Bradley Baker as Lizard, Jeff Bennett as Cyclops and Juggernaut, and Travis Willingham as Storm, Ka-Zar, and Doctor Doom.
* In the 1984 film &quot;Missing in Action&quot; starring Chuck Norris, the &quot;Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends&quot; episode &quot;Along Came Spidey&quot; can be seen on a television.
* In her civilian identity, Angelica Jones resembles Peter&#x27;s girlfriend from the comic books, Mary Jane Watson. This was played up in issues of &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot; in which Firestar appeared.

===Accolades===
&quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; was nominated for Best Children&#x27;s Television Series at the 1982 Young Artist Awards.

==Comic books==
===Adaptation===
The first comic book that directly referenced the &quot;Amazing Friends&quot; show was &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; #1 (December 1981), a one-shot that adapted the pilot episode, &quot;The Triumph of the Green Goblin&quot;. Though the comic version altered the story to bring it in line with established Marvel Universe continuity (such as making the Green Goblin identity a costume as in the comics, rather than a physical transformation as in the episode), it was not considered part of said continuity. It is the first appearance of Firestar in a comics story, though the version of Firestar that exists within Marvel continuity would not appear until &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193 (May 1985).

The story was reprinted in England in late 1983 in the weekly Marvel UK title &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;. It was reprinted in the U.S. as &quot;Marvel Action Universe&quot; #1 (January 1989), released to coincide with the airing of &quot;Amazing Friends&quot; reruns on the television series of the same name and on the 2017 trade paperback &quot;X-Men Origins: Firestar&quot;.

In the Marvel mainstream continuity, Spider-Man, Firestar and Iceman have made sporadic team-ups in &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot; #7 (July 2014) and &quot;Iceman&quot; #3 (November 2018).

===Firestar===
The mainstream Marvel Universe version of Firestar debuted in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193 as part of Emma Frost&#x27;s Hellions team. Firestar was given an origin story in a self-titled mini-series (March – June 1986). The character went on to be a founding member of the New Warriors, and later a member of the Avengers.

One change to Firestar from the TV show to the comic books was her powers. In the cartoon, they were fire based. However, Marvel had a number of characters who could control and/or create fire, so they changed her mutant ability to the power to emit and control microwave energy.

===&quot;Amazing Friends&quot; 2006===
To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show, Marvel released &quot;Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends&quot; #1 on August 9, 2006. The comic starts with an all-new story, &quot;Opposites Attack&quot;, which is officially set before &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #75. After that is a Mini Marvel tale, &quot;Spider-Man And His Amazing &lt;del&gt;Friends&lt;/del&gt; Co-Workers&quot; (note that the strikethrough of &quot;Friends&quot; was a deliberate inclusion in the title). Both stories were written by Sean McKeever.

The remainder of the one-shot is composed of reprints of &quot;Untold Tales of Spider-Man&quot; #2 and &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; #2.

===&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;===
An arc in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; is titled &quot;Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends&quot; and issue #118&#x27;s cover, showing Spider-Man, Iceman, and Firestar, is a homage to the series title screen. Johnny Storm and Kitty Pryde are also said to be members of the team. Instead of Angelica Jones, Firestar is Liz Allan. Since then, in &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot;, Spidey, Iceman, and the Human Torch have begun living together at Aunt May&#x27;s house and have been working as a team as another homage to the series (because Liz, as Firestar, was a member of the X-Men in this continuity; this team roster also reflects the original intent of &quot;Amazing Friends&quot; to use the Human Torch before licensing issues forced the creation of Firestar).

===&quot;Amazing Friends&quot; in-continuity?===
In 2007&#x27;s &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe—Spider-Man: Back in Black&quot; one-shot, the villain Videoman is given a brief biography from his &quot;retcon&quot; appearance in the &quot;Spider-Man Family&quot; one-shot. There is also an annotation describing an &quot;Earth 8107&quot;, where an alternate reality Videoman was created by Electro to battle that world&#x27;s Spider-Man. Later, in the same reality, Francis Byte is mutated by an exploding arcade console to become a new Videoman, and later &quot;possibly&quot; join the X-Men. Essentially, this places the events of &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; — or at the very least, the episodes &quot;Videoman&quot; and &quot;The Education of a Superhero&quot; — in an alternate-Earth continuity of the Marvel Comics Multiverse.

===Spider-Verse===
The Spider-Friends of Earth-1983 (described as a &quot;kinder, gentler than most&quot; world), except for Ms. Lion, are apparently killed by a dimension-hopping Morlun, set on draining the life out of every variation of Spider-Man across the multiverse.

===&quot;Iceman&quot; 2018===
At the &quot;Street Cart Named Desire Festival&quot;, Peter sees Angelica, but doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize her when explaining to Mary Jane that she&#x27;s the only redhead that he&#x27;s interested in. Bobby and Angelica briefly catch up before returning to their dates which are then interrupted by an ice monster attack. Iceman, Firestar, and Spider-Man suit up and defeat the attacker together. The team-up is called &quot;Iceman and His amazing Friends&quot; both on the issue&#x27;s cover and by Iceman in the story. Afterward, the trio chat and Angelica and Bobby commiserate about men on dating apps.

<text>Firestar (Angelica &quot;Angel&quot; Jones) is a superhero appearing in media and American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by John Romita Sr., Rick Hoberg, and Dennis Marks, the character first appeared in 1981 on the NBC animated television series &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;. Firestar has the ability to generate and manipulate microwave radiation, allowing her to fly and create intense heat and flames. In the comics, she has acted as a solo hero and also as a member of the Hellions, New Warriors, Avengers, and X-Men.

==Development and publication history==
===&quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;===

Firestar – spelled as Fire-Star – was created for the NBC animated series &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;, with Kathy Garver providing her voice. This version of the character has the ability to control heat in all its forms, as stated in the 1981 &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; one-shot comic.

The creators had wanted to use the Human Torch, but the rights to the character were tied up. Firestar&#x27;s pre-production names included Heatwave, Starblaze, and Firefly. Dennis Marks, one of the original writers of &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;, stated in a 2002 interview that he had come up with the name of Fire-Star&#x27;s alias, Angelica Jones, taken from one of his old girlfriends.

In the series, Fire-Star is identified as a former member of the X-Men, along with Iceman, with whom she occasionally appears to have a flirtatious relationship, and with whom she is sometimes seen on dates. At times, she dates Peter Parker (Spider-Man) as well, resulting in a relaxed love triangle of sorts. Fire-Star also has a one-episode romance with Sunfire.

Her origin is explained in &quot;A Fire-Star is Born.&quot; Young Angelica Jones was subject to constant bullying by a schoolmate named Bonnie, who calls her &quot;Miss Angelica Jinx&quot; on account of mysterious events that occur in Angelica&#x27;s presence, which unbeknownst to Bonnie and others around Angelica, are triggered by her newly emerging powers, of which Angelica is gradually becoming aware. As Angelica becomes fully aware that she is a mutant with superhuman abilities, she saves her father at one point during an accident while disguised.

Early in her senior year of high school, Bonnie and her boyfriend framed Angelica for the theft of a school trophy, causing Dean Wilmer to temporarily suspend Angelica from school. A strong need to correct this situation leads Angelica to become Fire-Star for the first time. She finds proof of Bonnie&#x27;s deception, retrieved the missing trophy, and compels Bonnie to confess, which justifies her expulsion from school. She is later approached by Cyclops, Angel, and Iceman to join the X-Men. She accepted and was seen helping them against Magneto and the Sentinels.

The animated series and the one-shot &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; comic book (which adapted an episode for print) are not considered part of standard Marvel Universe continuity. However, the 2006 one-shot comic &quot;Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends&quot; (August 2006) features an in-continuity story, &quot;Opposites Attack!&quot;, in which the three superheroes work as a short-lived team. This story takes place shortly after the up-and-coming hero Firestar becomes a founding member of the New Warriors.

===Firestar mini-series===

Firestar&#x27;s first in-continuity comic book appearance was in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193 (May 1985). She next appeared in her own mini-series, which presented her definitive, in-continuity origin. The &quot;Firestar&quot; four issue mini-series depicts events both before and after Firestar&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193, showing her development from a shy, insecure girl afraid of her developing powers to a confident young woman capable of easily defeating Emma Frost.

The mini-series also established that Firestar&#x27;s powers were microwave-based, rather than the more common fire-generation power that her animated counterpart displayed; the comic-book Firestar essentially harnesses ambient microwave radiation from her environment, making her powers far stronger in an environment such as space, where the concentration of microwaves is much greater than within a planetary atmosphere.

===Established character===
Despite the mini-series&#x27; efforts to flesh out the character, Firestar was not featured in any stories for a few years (aside from a five-part serial in the &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; anthology series; issues #82–87) and seemed destined to fade into obscurity until she joined the New Warriors. She would go on to appear as a regular character in &quot;Avengers&quot;, and the informal all-female team &quot;Marvel Divas&quot;.

After the special &quot;Firestar&quot; one-shot issue (April 2010), Firestar returned to full-time superheroics as a character in the short-lived comic series &quot;Young Allies&quot;. Firestar appears as a main character in the &quot;I Am an Avenger&quot; comic book mini-series.

Firestar was one of the feature characters in the 2011 six-issue limited series &quot;Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt&quot;.

At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Firestar was announced &quot;to take her place as a major X-Men character for the first time&quot; starring in the new comic book &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot; in November 2013.

Firestar came to more prominence in the Krakoa era of X-Men comic books, particularly the later &quot;Fall of X&quot; storyline where she selflessly plays a double agent role in the villainous organization Orchis, allowing the world and her teammates to believe she has betrayed mutantkind, on instructions from Jean Grey. At the storyline&#x27;s inception, Firestar was announced as a full member of the main X-Men team for the first time following a reader vote.

==Fictional character biography==

===Hellions===
A lonely girl raised by her widowed father Bartholomew and paternal grandmother, Angelica Jones discovered that she possessed mutant powers. After her grandmother&#x27;s death by heart failure and her revelation that she was a mutant, her father sent Angelica to the Massachusetts Academy. The Hellfire Club&#x27;s original White Queen Emma Frost began training Angelica in the use of her powers for the Hellfire Club&#x27;s team of young mutants. She was never sent on field missions with the other Hellions, however, because of her lack of control over her lethal powers and because the White Queen wished to instill cruelty and callousness in Firestar&#x27;s personality, and befriending other young mutants would work against that goal. The White Queen manipulated Angelica into perceiving Frost as a loving mother figure, unaware that Frost was secretly grooming her to be a potential assassin and bodyguard. Angelica did meet the New Mutants at a Massachusetts Academy dance and, with the White Queen&#x27;s telepathic prompting, formed a crush on Cannonball.

Firestar was later emotionally manipulated by Empath, and accompanied the Hellions Thunderbird, Empath and Roulette on a mission against the X-Men, in which Thunderbird sought revenge on Xavier, thinking him responsible for his brother&#x27;s death. Angelica felt terrible guilt over the incident once she was free of Empath&#x27;s power, however. Professor Xavier offered her a place at the Xavier School, but although she declined out of loyalty to the White Queen, she was touched and pleased by the offer.

While a student of the Massachusetts Academy, Angelica had Hellfire mercenary Randall Chase assigned to her as a bodyguard. Growing close to Angelica, Randall eventually began to suspect the White Queen&#x27;s true motives and was to be terminated. He escaped, mortally wounded, and managed to warn Angelica of Frost&#x27;s duplicity just before he died. In retaliation, Jones attacked and defeated the White Queen, and decimated the hidden training complex beneath Frost&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy. Afterwards, she returned to living with her father (as she was still a minor at the time) but kept the unique costume and identity of Firestar given to her by Frost.

Firestar was later to become one of the few surviving original Hellions after most members were murdered by Trevor Fitzroy. She, Warpath and Empath were the only members of the team not present during the massacre. Firestar and Warpath (accompanied by Warpath&#x27;s X-Force teammate and Firestar&#x27;s former love interest Cannonball), travelled to Nova Roma in Brazil to inform Empath and former New Mutant Magma of their teammates&#x27; deaths. The trio then went to the Massachusetts Academy where they removed the few remaining files on record of the Hellions&#x27; existence.

===New Warriors===
Shortly after her resignation from the Massachusetts Academy, Firestar became a founding member of the New Warriors when she was invited (or rather blackmailed) by Night Thrasher into joining, and helped them battle Terrax. She also aided Night Thrasher against Midnight&#x27;s Fire. She also helped Thor defeat the Juggernaut alongside the New Warriors. The team battled the Mad Thinker and Primus, and then battled Psionex.

The team battled the second Star Thief and Stane International&#x27;s Mandroids. With teammates Marvel Boy and Namorita, and the Star Thief, she launched into space aboard a Stane rocket. They encountered the Inhumans and the Watcher on the Moon. With the help of Black Bolt and the Star Thief, she destroyed the Stane rocket containing hazardous waste.

Back on Earth, the New Warriors battled the Force of Nature in a Brazilian jungle, and rescued teammate Speedball&#x27;s mother. The New Warriors also battled the White Queen and her Hellions.

Eventually, she fell in love and became engaged to teammate Vance Astrovik (also known as Justice, formerly Marvel Boy). She later discovered that using her microwave powers could eventually render her infertile.

During a revenge scheme by a gang of thugs called the Poison Memories, Firestar&#x27;s father was shot in the chest. He nearly died but recovered. Firestar also faced a time without Vance, as he had to serve a prison term for the involuntary slaying of his own abusive father.

Firestar also provided vital assistance in helping Spider-Man tackle Carnage during &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot;, when he was also forced to ally himself with Venom, Black Cat and Morbius to stop Carnage&#x27;s reign of slaughter. Her microwave power proved the only weapon truly effective against Carnage following his &#x27;upgrade&#x27;—his vulnerability to sonics having been weakened—but she still refused to kill Carnage, even to stop his murders. For a time, she was briefly attracted to Spider-Man&#x27;s clone, Ben Reilly, when he joined the New Warriors under the identity of the Scarlet Spider, but their relationship never went beyond an interest due to Firestar&#x27;s engagement to Justice and Reilly&#x27;s secrecy causing him to avoid revealing his identity.

===Avengers===
Firestar and Justice eventually left the New Warriors together. Some time later the two joined the Avengers after an alternate-universe adventure and a struggle against Morgan le Fay. Firestar helped demonstrate her fitness for the position when she and Vance took down Whirlwind, a villain that had foiled most of the other Avengers at once.

Firestar demonstrated a more restrained fashion sense, refusing to wear a cleavage-baring costume designed by the Wasp. Though she is seen wearing exactly that costume in an Avengers promo poster and in some early Avengers appearances, she quickly altered the costume to be more modest, which was consistent with her personality.

During this period, Hank Pym determined that the cause of her potential infertility was that her natural immunity to the effects of her own powers (which all mutants possess) had never fully developed. He designed a costume for her that would siphon off the excess radiation, give her natural immunity the opportunity to manifest fully and heal the damage already done. After a distinguished tenure with the Avengers, including going undercover in a bizarre cult, facing a horde of Ultron robots, and struggling against Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s takeover of modern-day Earth, she and Justice left the Avengers. She also made a tentative peace with Emma Frost during this time.

Angelica started college and enjoyed a &quot;normal life&quot;, but she abandoned wedding preparations, leaving Vance with all of the responsibility. When Vance confronted her about this, she confessed that she needed more life experience before settling into married life. Vance left in anger and presumably ended their engagement.

===Retirement===
Firestar is one of the few mutants left on the planet with her powers intact after the Scarlet Witch altered reality and decimated the mutant population. Firestar was not among the New Warriors who died in the catastrophe that sparked the events of &quot;Civil War&quot;. She was presumed to be among the Warriors who confronted the operator of an anti-Warriors hate site created in the wake of the catastrophe, revealed to be former Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge (Hindsight Lad). She is seen flying in the background, above the confrontation.

Firestar responded to the Superhuman Registration Act by effectively retiring from her career as a costumed hero. She was seen as part of a New Warriors reunion of sorts with Nova and Justice, with whom she seems to be on good terms again.

===Marvel Divas===
In the limited series &quot;Marvel Divas&quot; (which was pitched as &quot;&quot;Sex and the City&quot; in the Marvel Universe&quot;), it is revealed Angelica&#x27;s closest friends are Black Cat, Hellcat and Photon. At the end of the first issue, Firestar announces she has been diagnosed with cancer. She&#x27;s later diagnosed by Doctor Strange and the Night Nurse as being in the earlier stages of the illness, provoked seemingly by the same inability to shield herself from her microwave emission powers that is making her infertile. Despite her bravery in dealing with the illness (she asks Patsy to write a book and a blog to relay her experience to other cancer survivors, strongly believing in her ability to heal), and Hank Pym offering her a second opinion (despite Pym actually being a biochemist, and not a physician), she is still in visible distress; enough for Daimon Hellstrom to approach his ex-wife Patsy, ensuring her fast healing in exchange for Patsy remarrying him (and giving him her soul in the process). Learning about Patsy&#x27;s brave move to help in her recovery, Angelica and her supportive friends travelled to Hellstrom&#x27;s dimension to rescue her, thereby rejecting his &#x27;healing&#x27; help for Hellcat&#x27;s freedom and taking her chances against the cancer. After returning to Earth, Angelica had a follow-up exam that revealed her cancer to be in complete remission. During this series, she is a New York University graduate student in art history, specializing in Medieval European art. Due to her chemotherapy, Angelica began to lose her hair. Initially opting for a wig, she decided to cut her hair short instead.

===One-shot and Young Allies===
Firestar continues her education while engaging in super heroics part-time. In her one-shot issue, she is wearing a long-haired red wig as her natural hair has not grown back yet.

When the Bastards of Evil attack at the World Trade Center Ground Zero, she is the first of New York&#x27;s heroes to respond. Shortly after, she is joined by Gravity, Nomad, Spider-Girl and Toro. The five heroes unite to defeat the menace, but are not taken seriously by the established teams (the Fantastic Four and Avengers) to arrive after the battle.

The group worked to track down the Bastards of Evil, Firestar partnering with Gravity while the others pursued independent leads. In addition to tracking the Bastards, Firestar and Gravity begin to patrol the city at night fighting street level crime. During this period, Angelica is dismissive of Nomad and Spider-Girl, which she later regrets as it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that she was an adolescent super hero.

When Nomad and Spider-Girl are captured by the Bastards on their way to meet Gravity and Firestar, Angelica is able to use her microwave powers to track the Bastards and is able to drain the radiation that empowers them. With Gravity&#x27;s help, she is able to expel the energy harmlessly into space. Nomad suggests that they remain together as the Young Allies, which everyone objects to, and they appear to go their separate ways.

In the final issue of &quot;Young Allies&quot; (issue #6), Emma Frost attempts to recruit Angelica to move to Utopia with the rest of the mutant population. No offer to join the X-Men was explicitly made, but as most of the mutants living in Utopia appear to be on call as needed, it can be assumed that if Firestar moved she would have been available to the team. Angelica refused the offer, eventually burning down Emma&#x27;s hotel room to be left alone. Gravity and Firestar continue their evening patrols, and Frost suggests that Gravity has a romantic/sexual interest in her. He also appears to recognize her civilian identity when he sees her in a coffee shop, but she does not notice him.

The Young Allies are continuing to operate as a loosely affiliated team to fight Onslaught alongside the Secret Avengers in &quot;Onslaught Unleashed&quot;, despite the cancellation of their own series. Then Firestar appears at a meeting held by Prodigy regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth. She and Gravity agree to co-lead an Initiative team to help keep order during the crisis. After Gravity is injured in a fight with Crossbones, she assumes full command until she and Prodigy travel to Las Vegas to assist with the damage control efforts after the Juggernaut&#x27;s attack on the city and subsequent battle with the Heavy Hitters. Reunited with Gravity, who also went to Las Vegas to confront Heavy Hitters leader Hardball regarding civilian casualties during the fight, Firestar joined Gravity, Hardball and Telemetry on a mission to prevent seismic damage to the area. Believing they were going to die, she and Gravity revealed their secret identities to each other. Following the end of Fear Itself, Firestar has been seen with Gravity and their former Young Allies associate Spider-Girl fighting Hydro Man, indicating the group is still working together.

Firestar applied for a teaching job at the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning but when she admitted that she had a thing for Iceman she was rejected as Kitty Pryde, the headmistress of the school who was doing the interviewing, was at the time Iceman&#x27;s girlfriend.

===X-Men===
Firestar joined the X-Men as a new teacher in the Jean Grey School assigned to teaching physics. After being dragged to Hell with other members of the X-Men, she was pulled into a quest to search for the deceased Nightcrawler, at one point setting Hell itself on fire to stop a wave of demons attacking her and Iceman, an action that notably impressed Nightcrawler. Later on, after returning to Earth, Firestar and Iceman encountered Spider-Man. She participated in the containment of a massive Wendigo outbreak in Canada, became a member of the New Tian Strikeforce after Hydra&#x27;s brief takeover of the USA, and battled X-Man and Carnage.

===Orchis===
After the establishment of the mutant colony on Krakoa, Firestar was slated to become a full-time member of the X-Men. Shortly after, however, Orchis attacked the island, slaying several mutants, including Jean Grey. As she lay dying, Grey telepathically instructed Firestar to join Orchis as a mole, leading the other X-Men to believe that she allowed Orchis access to Krakoa. In this role, she was confronted by Kitty Pryde and her ex-fiancé Justice. She was eventually exposed, but rescued by Pryde, Emma Frost and Synch to participate in their final strike against Orchis.

===West Coast Avengers===
However, the trauma of having worked for a mutant-hating organization caused Firestar to sink into an alcohol-drowned depression. In this state, she was invited by James Rhodes to join the new West Coast Avengers which he and Tony Stark were putting together, which included several former supervillains like Ultron and Blue Bolt in their lineup. In her feeling of fatalism, she made callous mistakes, like injuring people she was supposed to subdue. However, Blue Bolt, after giving her a kiss before willingly returning to prison, managed to talk some sense back into her.

==Powers and abilities==
Firestar is a mutant whose body stores ambient electromagnetic energy, which she can project and manipulate for various effects. As she alters the electromagnetic wavelengths, they form a microwave aura around her body, at which point she mentally &quot;pushes&quot; the microwaves away from herself. Doing this allows her to release heat, light and radiation into her environment at various intensities. By focusing microwaves on a specific target, she can cause it to burst into flames, explode or melt. She can project microwave energy blasts which have a thermo-concussive effect, heating objects to the point of melting or being incinerated, while the superheated and pressurized air created by the directed microwaves produces impact. Firestar can also sense microwave signals (such as cellular phone signals or remote-control devices) and disrupt electronics with her own microwave emissions. By superheating the air around her, Firestar can generate enough upward thrust to fly at high speeds and lift objects as heavy as the X-Man Colossus. Firestar&#x27;s mutant abilities do not grant her any particular immunity to the effects of intense heat other than that generated by her own microwave powers. During training exercises with Emma Frost in her limited series, she was chastised by her teacher for clumsiness and warned that she could have been &quot;severely burned&quot; by a laser. During a fight between the Avengers and Fantastic Four years later, the Human Torch was afraid of burning her with his own flames. However, she eventually displayed the ability to siphon heat energy and to detect electromagnetic signatures from broadcast transmissions.

Though exposure to high levels of microwave radiation can be harmful or fatal to living beings, Firestar is apparently immune to most of the damaging effects of her powers. Unlike most mutants, her immunity to her own power was not complete; she was in danger of rendering herself sterile until Hank Pym discovered a cure. He designed a suit of micro-circuitry to be worn under her costume that absorbed the excess microwave energy that was affecting her cells, and diverted it in a way that would &quot;kick start&quot; her natural immunity to her own powers. Pym claimed it would take about six months for process to be complete, and over time Firestar appeared to be functionally immune to microwave radiation. She was later diagnosed with breast cancer which was attributed to long-term exposure to her own power. Though the cancer is in remission, the current status of her immunity is unknown.

On rare occasion, Firestar has demonstrated the ability to disrupt the psionic powers of others using her own power (namely, Emma Frost, Empath, and the Darkling). She is not immune to psychic assault, but when using microwave abilities at a high level she is capable of disrupting it. Onslaught, and the Gamesmaster, were both able to use telepathy against her effectively.

The nature of Firestar&#x27;s power grants her the capacity for large-scale destruction. She typically limits how much of her own power she accesses for fear of permanently damaging the planet, its atmosphere and electromagnetic field. In space, she is far less inhibited, and can access greater levels of ambient electromagnetic energy to fuel her powers. She easily produced an attack that injured Garthan Saal when he possessed the energy of the entire Nova Corps, and also used her enhanced abilities to power a massive Shi&#x27;ar interstellar transport gate with very little effort.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Firestar a &quot;role model&quot; and &quot;truly heroic.&quot; Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Firestar 34th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every Avenger ever&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Firestar 4th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members of The New Warriors&quot; list, 8th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Firestar 4th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members of The New Warriors&quot; list, and 15th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Female Members Of The Avengers&quot; list.

Anthony Orland of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; called Firestar one of the &quot;12 new Marvel characters we want to see in the Spider-Man 4 movie.&quot; Jordan Iacobucci of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Firestar in their &quot;10 Marvel Superheroes From The ‘80s Who Should Join The MCU&quot; list, while Lukas Shayo named her one of the &quot;10 Iconic New York City-Based Marvel Superheroes We Haven&#x27;t Seen In The MCU&quot; list.

=== Impact ===
In July 2022, Marvel Comics announced that Firestar was the winner of the second annual X-Men fan vote.

==Other versions==

===Spider-Verse===
Appearing in &quot;Edge of Spider-Verse: Web of Fear&quot;, Spider-UK (a British Spider-Man who is a member of the Captain Britain Corps) witnesses Morlun kill Spider-Man, as well as Firestar and Iceman lying dead. This universe is an alternate version of &quot;Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends&quot; (Earth-1983).

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Firestar was forced to join the team known as Weapon X, a group of alternate reality-hopping super-people bound to repair broken worlds. Joining the team, Angelica was soon killed in a mega-blast unleashed by her own powers, opposing the evil Hyperion. In the process, her sacrifice also killed Spider. Because her body was reduced to ash, it was not returned to its native universe (Earth-3062).

===Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness===
In issue #3 of this miniseries, she is shown, in flashback, to be among the reserve members of the Avengers answering Colonel America&#x27;s distress signal (unaware it was a trap), and subsequently leaving the mansion (with fewer people than went in) infected and hungry for human flesh.

===MC2===
Firestar appeared in a flashback detailing the last adventure of the original Avengers. Firestar was among the team members who died in the team&#x27;s final battle.

===Mutant X===
In the Mutant X Universe, Firestar&#x27;s powers had evolved to the point where her entire body was composed of microwave energy. She was one of the many people trying to resist the rule of Madelyne Pryor. She, along with numerous other heroes, died in battle in the final issue of &quot;Mutant X&quot;.

===Spider-Man Loves Mary-Jane===
Firestar appeared in &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;. In the initial Firestar story, Mary Jane watched Spider-Man and Firestar battling crime together and became very jealous. In subsequent issues, Firestar expressed a true romantic interest in Spider-Man. The Firestar story arc took place in issues #16-20 of the series and was compiled in digest format as &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, Vol. 4&quot;. Also, Iceman appears in a few pages of the final issue of the story arc, showcasing a rare comic-book moment in which the &quot;Spider-Friends&quot; are shown together.

===Ultimate Marvel===

Brian Michael Bendis, writer of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, revealed his intentions to have the Ultimate Marvel version of Firestar appear in the book in an interview on Comic Book Resources on July 20, 2007. Bendis further stated he had spent 120 issues working toward this and making it an &quot;organic&quot; event and not something &quot;I pulled out of my ass&quot;.

Ultimate Firestar makes her debut in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #118, when Liz Allan claims to be suffering from some bizarre ailment shortly after kissing the Human Torch, and at the close of the issue catches fire while at a beach party with her friends. In the final moments of the story, Liz&#x27;s body becomes a living mass of flames, signaling her transformation into what could be considered Ultimate Firestar.

The next issue (#119) deals with Liz as she tried to come to grips with her powers. The Human Torch is forced to deal with a call from the Fantastic Four, while Shadowcat is grounded, leaving only Iceman and Spider-Man able to go after Liz, an homage to the &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; television series. After some friendly banter, Magneto shows up, asking Liz to come with him so that he can take her to her biological father. Unsure of what to do, Liz goes home to confront her mother who reveals that her uncle Frank is in fact her real father. Magneto and the X-Men, summoned by Spider-Man, then show up asking Liz to side with one of them. Liz chooses neither and flees to Mary Jane&#x27;s house.

Spider-Man quickly follows her there, and to convince her of his words, he reveals his true identity. She is greatly moved by this and refers to him as an &quot;amazing friend&quot;. Swayed, Liz then thinks it might be cool to join the X-Men, leaving for the mansion alongside Iceman. The issue ends with a flashback that reveals that Liz&#x27;s father is in fact the Blob. It was revealed in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #94 that Liz has chosen the codename Firestar, and has some control of her powers.

Liz Allan was believed to have been missing in action after Ultimatum, but survived and is featured in &quot;Ultimate X&quot; beginning with issue #4. In this issue, it is revealed she, her mother and her newfound half-brother Teddy (and son of the Blob) try to make a fresh start in California. She often teases Teddy because, as she says, he reminds her of her father, though her mother speculates it might be because he reminds her of what she is. When Teddy&#x27;s friend kills the high school&#x27;s principal, Teddy&#x27;s powers manifest, and the situation goes awry. When approached by Jean Grey&#x27;s Tomorrow People and Quicksilver&#x27;s Brotherhood, Liz chooses to follow Jean whereas Teddy joins Quicksilver. After briefly working with the team, she settles in Tian, a safe haven for mutants, until its destruction. She then rejoins the X-Men. She also attended a small party that commemorated Peter a few years after his death with Iceman and Human Torch.

<text>A superhero or superheroine is a fictional character who typically possesses &quot;superpowers&quot; or abilities beyond those of ordinary people, is frequently costumed concealing their identity, and fits the role of the hero, typically using their powers to help the world become a better place, or dedicating themselves to protecting the public and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially, since the 1930s, in American comic books (and later in Hollywood films, film serials, television and video games), as well as in Japanese media (including &quot;kamishibai&quot;, &quot;tokusatsu&quot;, manga, anime and video games).

Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins. Some superheroes (for example, Batman and Iron Man) derive their status from advanced technology they create and use, while others (such as Superman and Spider-Man) possess non-human or superhuman biology or use and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such as Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). The &quot;Dictionary.com&quot; definition of &quot;superhero&quot; is &quot;a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime&quot;, and the Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as &quot;a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person.&quot; Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.

Some superheroes use their powers to help fight daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from &quot;supervillains&quot;, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero&#x27;s archenemy or &quot;nemesis&quot;. Some popular supervillains become recurring characters in their own right.

==History==
===Influences===
Antecedents of the archetype include mythological characters such as Gilgamesh, Hanuman, Perseus, Odysseus, David, and demigods like Heracles, all of whom were blessed with extraordinary abilities, which later inspired the superpowers that became a fundamental aspect of modern-day superheroes. The distinct clothing and costumes of individuals from English folklore, like Robin Hood and Spring-Heeled Jack, also became inspirations. The dark costume of the latter, complete with a domino mask and a cape, became influential for the myriad of masked rogues in penny dreadfuls and dime novels.

The vigilantes of the American Old West also became an influence to the superhero. Several vigilantes during this time period hid their identities using masks. In frontier communities where de jure law was not yet matured, people sometimes took the law into their own hands with makeshift masks made out of sacks. Vigilante mobs and gangs like the San Diego Vigilantes and the Bald Knobbers became infamous throughout that Old West era. Such masked vigilantism later inspired fictional masked crimefighters in American story-telling, beginning with the character Deadwood Dick in 1877.

===1900s–1939===

The word dates back to 1899. The 1903 British play &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; and its spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity. Over the next few decades, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Jimmie Dale/The Grey Seal (1914), Zorro (1919), Buck Rogers (1928), The Shadow (1930), and Flash Gordon (1934), and comic strip heroes such as the Phantom (1936), began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including the comic-strip characters Patoruzú (1928) and Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie&#x27;s character Hugo Danner (1930). Another early example was Sarutobi Sasuke, a Japanese superhero ninja from children&#x27;s novels in the 1910s; by 1914, he had a number of superhuman powers and abilities. The French character L&#x27;Oiselle, created in 1909, can be classed as a superheroine. &quot;Famany&quot;, the &quot;flying man&quot; of a German comic story of 1937, who uses a winged apparatus to fly over New York and who becomes embroiled in the world of crime, had only one appearance.

In August 1937, in a letter column of the pulp magazine &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, the word &quot;superhero&quot; was used to define the title character of the comic strip &quot;Zarnak&quot;, by Max Plaisted. In the 1930s, the trends converged in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes, such as Japan&#x27;s Ōgon Bat (1931) and Prince of Gamma (early 1930s), who first appeared in &quot;kamishibai&quot; (a kind of hybrid media combining pictures with live storytelling), Mandrake the Magician (1934), Olga Mesmer (1937) and then Superman (1938) and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, whose span, though disputed, is generally agreed to have started with Superman&#x27;s launch. Superman has remained one of the most recognizable superheroes, and his success spawned a new archetype of characters with secret identities and superhuman powers. At the end of the decade, in 1939, Batman was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.

===1940s===
During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era saw the debut of one of the earliest female superheroes, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks&#x27;s character Fantomah, an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Comic&quot; #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous &quot;Barclay Flagg&quot;. The Invisible Scarlet O&#x27;Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.

In 1940, Maximo the Amazing Superman debut in Big Little Book series, by Russell R. Winterbotham (text), Henry E. Vallely and Erwin L. Hess (art).
 Captain America also appeared for the first time in print in December 1940, a year prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese government, when America was still in isolationism. Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the superhero was the physical embodiment of the American spirit during World War II.

One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell—debuted in &quot;Mystic Comics&quot; #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime fighters during this era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red, introduced in Standard Comics&#x27; &quot;Thrilling Comics&quot; #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert &quot;The Spirit Section&quot; June 2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury, debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced in Quality Comics &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat, introduced in Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Pocket Comics&quot; #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character. The most iconic comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman. Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne. Wonder Woman&#x27;s first appearance was in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.

Pérák was an urban legend originating from the city of Prague during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the midst of World War II. In the decades following the war, Pérák has also been portrayed as the only Czech superhero in film and comics.

===1950s===
In 1952, Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s manga &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot;, more popularly known in the West as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, was published. The series focused upon a robot boy built by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally intended for military purposes, Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs.

The 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl, Miss Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male superheroes.

In 1957 Japan, Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant, signaling a shift in Japanese popular culture towards &quot;tokusatsu&quot; masked superheroes over &quot;kaiju&quot; giant monsters. Along with &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the &quot;Super Giant&quot; serials had a profound effect on Japanese television. 1958 saw the debut of superhero &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot; on Japanese television. It was the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero genre. Created by Kōhan Kawauchi, he followed up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows &quot;Seven Color Mask&quot; (1959) and &quot;Messenger of Allah&quot; (1960), both starring a young Sonny Chiba.

===1960s===
It is arguable that the Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s brought the biggest assortment of superheroes ever at one time into permanent publication, the likes of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil, Nick Fury, Thor, The Avengers (featuring a rebooted Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man and Quicksilver), and many others were given their own monthly titles.

Typically the superhero supergroups featured at least one (and often the only) female member, much like DC&#x27;s flagship superhero team the Justice League of America (whose initial roster included Wonder Woman as the token female); examples include the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Invisible Girl, the X-Men&#x27;s Jean Grey (originally known as Marvel Girl), the Avengers&#x27; Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants&#x27; Scarlet Witch (who later joined the Avengers) with her brother, Quicksilver.

In 1963, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was adapted into a highly influential anime television series. &quot;Phantom Agents&quot; in 1964 focused on ninjas working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type series. 1966 saw the debut of the sci-fi/horror series &quot;Ultra Q&quot; created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead to the sequel &quot;Ultraman&quot;, spawning a successful franchise which pioneered the Kyodai Hero subgenre where the superheroes would be as big as giant monsters (&quot;kaiju&quot;) that they fought.

The &quot;kaiju&quot; monster Godzilla, originally a villain, began being portrayed as a radioactive superhero in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, starting with &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; (1964). By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine &quot;King of the Monsters&quot; in 1977 describing Godzilla as &quot;Superhero of the &#x27;70s.&quot;

===1970s===
In 1971, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; launched the &quot;Henshin Boom&quot; on Japanese television in the early 1970s, greatly impacting the tokusatsu superhero genre in Japan. In 1972, the &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action &quot;Phantom Agents&quot; as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; by Go Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga &quot;Cutey Honey&quot; in 1973; although the Magical Girl genre already existed, Nagai&#x27;s manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media.

The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s Skull Man (the basis for his later &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;) in 1970, Go Nagai&#x27;s Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John Romita&#x27;s Punisher in 1974.

The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes. The character was redesigned to resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen Rider series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle-riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Metamorphosis) to don his costume and gain superhuman powers.

The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (no relation to the superhero team of the same name), but later reverted to Marston&#x27;s original concept after the editors of Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional costume; Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on &quot;Action Comics&quot; to headline &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of &quot;The Avengers&quot; as a group of mind-controlled superheroines led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists; and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade ago.

Both major American publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development. Examples include Big Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from Marvel, the second Black Widow, Shanna the She-Devil, and The Cat. Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late 1950s onward: Hal Jordan&#x27;s love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of Ferris Aircraft and later took over the company from her father; Medusa, who was first introduced in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series, is a member of the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people&#x27;s quasi-feudal society; and Carol Danvers, a decorated officer in the United States Air Force who would become a costumed superheroine herself years later.

In 1975 Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Himitsu Sentai Gorenger&quot; debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action, and began the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; franchise (later adapted into the American &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series in the 1990s). In 1978, Toei adapted Spider-Man into a live-action Japanese television series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei&#x27;s Battle Fever J (also co-produced with Marvel) and now multi-colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with.

===1980–present===
In subsequent decades, popular characters like Dazzler, She-Hulk, Elektra, Catwoman, Witchblade, Spider-Girl, Batgirl and the Birds of Prey became stars of long-running eponymous titles. Female characters began assuming leadership roles in many ensemble superhero teams; the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; series and its related spin-off titles in particular have included many female characters in pivotal roles since the 1970s. Volume 4 of the X-Men comic book series featured an all-female team as part of the Marvel NOW! branding initiative in 2013. Superpowered female characters like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Darna have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective countries of origin.

With more and more anime, manga and tokusatsu being translated or adapted, Western audiences were beginning to experience the Japanese styles of superhero fiction more than they were able to before. Saban&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Zyuranger&quot;, created a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai. Internationally, the Japanese comic book character, Sailor Moon, is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes ever created.

==Trademark status==
=== Background ===
The first use of the word &quot;super hero&quot; dates back to 1917. At the time, the word was merely used to describe a &quot;public figure of great accomplishments.&quot; However, in 1967, Ben Cooper, Inc., an American Halloween costume manufacturer, became the first entity to commercialize the phrase &quot;super hero&quot; when it registered the mark in connection with Halloween costumes. In 1972, Mego Corporation, an American toy company, attempted to register the mark &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Superheroes&quot; in connection with its line of action figures. Mego Corporation’s attempted registration led Ben Cooper, Inc. to sue Mego Corporation for trademark infringement. Due to its financial struggles, Mego Corporation was unwilling to defend itself against Ben Cooper Inc.&#x27;s suit. As a result, in 1977, Mego Corporation jointly assigned its interest in the trademark to DC Comics, Inc. (&quot;DC&quot;) and Marvel Comics (&quot;Marvel&quot;). Due to the financial prowess of DC and Marvel, Ben Cooper, Inc. decided to withdraw its trademark opposition and jointly assigned its interest in the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes&quot; mark to DC and Marvel. Two years later in 1979, DC and Marvel applied for the mark in connection with comic books, and were granted the mark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in 1981.

In the years leading up to the assignment of the mark, both DC and Marvel battled to register various trademarks involving the phrase “superhero.” However, DC and Marvel quickly discovered that they could only register marks involving the phrase &quot;superhero&quot; if the phrase referenced their own company or a character associated with their company. As a result, DC and Marvel decided to become joint owners of the &quot;superhero&quot; trademark.

Although many consumers likely see DC and Marvel as competitors, the two comic book publishing giants are allies when it comes to protecting the trademark &quot;superhero&quot; and variants thereof. Although joint ownership in a trademark is uncommon, the USPTO will grant joint ownership in a mark. For example, in the case &quot;Arrow Trading Co., Inc. v. Victorinox A.G. and Wegner S.A.&quot;, Opposition No. 103315 (TTAB June 27, 2003), the TTAB held that when &quot;two entities have a long-standing relationship and rely on each other for quality control, it may be found, in appropriate circumstances, that the parties, as joint owners, do represent a single source.&quot;

DC and Marvel have continued to expand their commercialization of the &quot;superhero&quot; mark to categories beyond comic books. Now, the two publishers jointly own numerous trademarks for figurines (see Spider-Man, Batman), movies, TV shows, magazines, merchandise, cardboard stand-up figures, playing cards, erasers, pencils, notebooks, cartoons, and many more. For instance, the companies filed a trademark application as joint owners for the mark &quot;SUPER HEROES&quot; for a series of animated motion pictures in 2009 (Reg. No. 5613972). Both DC and Marvel also individually owned trademarks involving the &quot;super hero&quot; mark. Notably, DC owns the mark &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; for comic magazines and Marvel owns the mark &quot;Marvel Super Hero Island&quot; for story books, fiction books, and children’s activity books.

DC and Marvel have become known for aggressively protecting their registered marks. In 2019, the companies pursued a British law student named Graham Jules who was attempting to publish a self-help book titled &quot;Business Zero to Superhero&quot;. Much academic debate exists about whether the &quot;super hero&quot; mark has become generic and whether DC and Marvel have created a duopoly over the &quot;super hero&quot; mark. Conversely, DC and Marvel hold that they are merely exercising their right and duty to protect their registered marks.

=== Current status/relevant cases ===
The following trademarks were or are registered jointly with MARVEL CHARACTERS, INC. and DC COMICS:

* 73222079 SUPER HEROES for publications (Cancelled)
* 72243225 SUPER HERO for costumes (Cancelled)
* 77732560 SUPER HEROES for production and distribution of a series of animated motion picture
* 78356610 SUPER HEROES for t-shirts (Cancelled)
* 73011796 SUPER HEROES for toy figures (Cancelled)

As mentioned, the two companies also own a variety of other superhero-related marks. For instance, DC owns &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; and &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; and Marvel owns “Marvel Super Hero Island&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Hero Adventures.&quot;

DC and Marvel have garnered a reputation for zealously protecting their superhero marks. As noted above, one of these instances included a man by the name of Graham Jules, who sought to publish a book entitled &quot;Business Zero to Superhero&quot;. In 2014, he received a cease and desist from DC and Marvel who claimed that his use of the term superhero would cause confusion and dilute their brands. He was offered a few thousand dollars in settlement to change the name of his book, but he did not concede. A few days prior to the scheduled hearing at the Intellectual Property Office in London, the companies backed down.

A similar scenario occurred when comic book creator Ray Felix attempted to register his comic book series &quot;A World Without Superheroes&quot; with the USPTO. Felix is one of many who argue that the term &quot;superhero&quot; has become generic (see discussion below). Felix&#x27;s mark is currently abandoned, but he has stated that he intends to fight against DC and Marvel for use of the term.

In 2024, Superbabies Limited managed to obtain a default judgement and cancel the &quot;super heroes&quot; trademarks as genericized, except for the animation pictures mark. This was unexpected as Marvel and DC had filed a motion to extend time to answer.

=== Ongoing legal debate ===
There is an ongoing debate among legal scholars and in the courts about whether the term &quot;superhero&quot; has become genericized due to its widespread use in popular culture, similar to terms like &quot;aspirin&quot; or &quot;escalator&quot; which lost their trademark protection and became generic terms for their respective products. Some argue the term &quot;SUPER HERO&quot; trademark is at risk of becoming generic.

Courts have noted that determining whether a term has become generic is a highly factual inquiry not suitable for resolution without considering evidence like dictionary definitions, media usage, and consumer surveys. Trademark owners can take steps to prevent genericide, such as using the trademark with the generic product name, educating the public, and policing unauthorized uses. However, misuse by the public alone does not necessarily cause a trademark to become generic if the primary significance of the term is still to indicate a particular source.

Some legal experts argue that, like the once-trademarked terms &quot;aspirin&quot; and &quot;yo-yo,&quot; the term &quot;superhero&quot; now primarily refers to a general type of character with extraordinary abilities, rather than characters originating from specific publishers.

==Minority superheroes==
In keeping with their origins as representing the archetypical hero stock character in 1930s American comics, superheroes are predominantly depicted as White American middle- or upper-class young adult males and females who are typically tall, athletic, educated, physically attractive and in perfect health. Beginning in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States, and increasingly with the rising concern over political correctness in the 1980s, superhero fiction centered on cultural, ethnic, national, racial and language minority groups (from the perspective of US demographics) began to be produced. This began with depiction of black superheroes in the 1960s, followed in the 1970s with a number of other ethnic-minority superheroes. In keeping with the political mood of the time, cultural diversity and inclusivism would be an important part of superhero groups starting from the 1980s. In the 1990s, this was further augmented by the first depictions of superheroes as homosexual. In 2017, Sign Gene emerged, the first group of deaf superheroes with superpowers through the use of sign language.

===Female superheroes and villains===

Female super heroes—and villains—have been around since the early years of comic books dating back to the 1940s. The representation of women in comic books has been questioned in the past decade following the rise of comic book characters in the film industry (Marvel/DC movies). Women are presented differently than their male counterparts, typically wearing revealing clothing that showcases their curves and cleavage and showing a lot of skin in some cases. Heroes like Power Girl and Wonder Woman are portrayed wearing little clothing and showing cleavage. Power Girl is portrayed as wearing a suit not unlike the swimsuits in the T.V. show &quot;Baywatch&quot;. The sexualization of women in comic books can be explained mainly by the fact that the majority of writers are male. Not only are the writers mostly male, but the audience is mostly male as well. Therefore, writers are designing characters to appeal to a mostly male audience. The super hero characters illustrate a sociological idea called the &quot;male gaze&quot; which is media created from the viewpoint of a normative heterosexual male. The female characters in comic books are used to satisfy male desire for the &quot;ideal&quot; woman (small waist, large breasts, toned, athletic body). These characters have god-like power, but the most easily identifiable feature is their hyper sexualized bodies: they are designed to be sexually pleasing to the hypothetical heteronormative male audience.

Villains, such as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, use their sexuality to take advantage of their male victims. In the film versions of these characters, their sexuality and seductive methods are highlighted. Poison Ivy uses seduction through poison to take over the minds of her victims as seen in the 1997 film &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;. Harley Quinn in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; uses her sexuality to her advantage, acting in a promiscuous manner.

Through the overdeveloped bodies of the heroes or the seductive mannerisms of the villains, women in comic books are used as subordinates to their male counterparts, regardless of their strength or power. Wonder Woman has been subject to a long history of suppression as a result of her strength and power, including American culture&#x27;s undoing of the Lynda Carter television series. In 2017&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, she had the power of a god, but was still drawn to a much weaker, mortal male character. This can be explained by the sociological concept &quot;feminine apologetic,&quot; which reinforces a woman&#x27;s femininity to account for her masculine attributes (strength, individualism, toughness, aggressiveness, bravery). Women in comic books are considered to be misrepresented due to being created by men, for men.

The Hawkeye Initiative is a website satirizing the sexualized portrayal of women in comics by recreating the same poses using male superheroes, especially Marvel&#x27;s Hawkeye.

=== Ethnic and religious minorities ===
In 1966, Marvel introduced the Black Panther, an African monarch who became the first non-caricatured black superhero. The first African-American superhero, the Falcon, followed in 1969, and three years later, Luke Cage, a self-styled &quot;hero-for-hire&quot;, became the first black superhero to star in his own series. In 1989, the Monica Rambeau incarnation of Captain Marvel was the first female black superhero from a major publisher to get her own title in a special one-shot issue. In 1971, Red Wolf became the first Native American in the superheroic tradition to headline a series. In 1973, Shang-Chi became the first prominent Asian superhero to star in an American comic book (Kato had been a secondary character of the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; media franchise series since its inception in the 1930s.). Kitty Pryde, a member of the X-Men, was an openly Jewish superhero in mainstream American comic books as early as 1978.

Comic-book companies were in the early stages of cultural expansion and many of these characters played to specific stereotypes; Cage and many of his contemporaries often employed lingo similar to that of blaxploitation films, Native Americans were often associated with shamanism and wild animals, and Asian Americans were often portrayed as kung fu martial artists. Subsequent minority heroes, such as the X-Men&#x27;s Storm and the Teen Titans&#x27; Cyborg avoided such conventions; they were both part of ensemble teams, which became increasingly diverse in subsequent years. The X-Men, in particular, were revived in 1975 with a line-up of characters drawn from several nations, including the Kenyan Storm, German Nightcrawler, Soviet/Russian Colossus, Irish Banshee, and Japanese Sunfire. In 1993, Milestone Comics, an African-American-owned media/publishing company entered into a publishing agreement with DC Comics that allowed them to introduce a line of comics that included characters of many ethnic minorities. Milestone&#x27;s initial run lasted four years, during which it introduced &quot;Static,&quot; a character adapted into the WB Network animated series &quot;Static Shock&quot;.

In addition to the creation of new minority heroes, publishers have filled the identities and roles of once-Caucasian heroes with new characters from minority backgrounds. The African-American John Stewart appeared in the 1970s as an alternate for Earth&#x27;s Green Lantern Hal Jordan, and would become a regular member of the Green Lantern Corps from the 1980s onward. The creators of the 2000s-era &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series selected Stewart as the show&#x27;s Green Lantern. In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Miles Morales, a youth of Puerto Rican and African-American ancestry who was also bitten by a genetically-altered spider, debuted as the new Spider-Man after the apparent death of the original Spider-Man, Peter Parker. Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American Muslim teenager who is revealed to have Inhuman lineage after her shapeshifting powers manifested, takes on the identity of Ms. Marvel in 2014 after Carol Danvers had become Captain Marvel. Her self-titled comic book series became a cultural phenomenon, with extensive media coverage by CNN, the New York Times and The Colbert Report, and embraced by anti-Islamophobia campaigners in San Francisco who plastered over anti-Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers. Other such successor-heroes of color include James &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes as Iron Man and to a lesser extent Riri &quot;Ironheart&quot; Williams, Ryan Choi as the Atom, Jaime Reyes as Blue Beetle and Amadeus Cho as Hulk.

Certain established characters have had their ethnicity changed when adapted to another continuity or media. A notable example is Nick Fury, who is reinterpreted as African-American both in the Ultimate Marvel as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe continuities.

===Sexual orientation and gender identity===
In 1992, Marvel revealed that Northstar, a member of the Canadian mutant superhero team Alpha Flight, was homosexual, after years of implication. This ended a long-standing editorial mandate that there would be no homosexual characters in Marvel comics. Although some minor secondary characters in DC Comics&#x27; mature-audience 1980s miniseries &quot;Watchmen&quot; were gay, and the reformed supervillain Pied Piper came out to Wally West in an issue of &quot;The Flash&quot; in 1991, Northstar is considered to be the first openly gay superhero appearing in mainstream comic books. From the mid-2000s onward, several established Marvel and DC comics characters (or a variant version of the pre-existing character) were outed or reintroduced as LGBT individuals by both publishers. Examples include the Mikaal Tomas incarnation of Starman in 1998; Colossus in the Ultimate X-Men series; Renee Montoya in DC&#x27;s &quot;Gotham Central&quot; series in 2003; the Kate Kane incarnation of Batwoman in 2006; Rictor and Shatterstar in an issue of X-Factor in 2009; the Golden Age Green Lantern Alan Scott is reimagined as openly gay following The New 52 reboot in 2011; and in 2015, a younger time displaced version of Iceman in an issue of &quot;All-New X-Men&quot;.

Many new openly gay, lesbian and bisexual characters have since emerged in superhero fiction, such as Gen13&#x27;s Rainmaker, Apollo and Midnighter of The Authority, and Wiccan and Hulkling of the Young Avengers. Notable transgender or gender bending characters are fewer in number by comparison: the alter ego of superheroine Zsazsa Zaturnnah, a seminal character in Philippine popular culture, is an effeminate gay man who transforms into a female superhuman after ingesting a magical stone. Desire from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, Cloud from Defenders, and Xavin from the Runaways are all characters who could (and often) change their gender at will. Alysia Yeoh, a supporting character created by writer Gail Simone for the Batgirl ongoing series published by DC Comics, received substantial media attention in 2011 for being the first major transgender character written in a contemporary context in a mainstream American comic book.

The &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series is known for featuring a substantial number of openly LGBT characters since its inception, as Japan have traditionally been more open about portraying homosexuality in its children&#x27;s media compared to many countries in the West. Certain characters who are presented as homosexual or transgender in one continuity may not be presented as such in others, particularly with dubbed versions made for international release.

An animated short &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot; parodies comic book superheroes and features Ace and Gary (Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell). It originated on &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; and then moved to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===Language minority===
In 2017, Pluin introduced &quot;Sign Gene&quot;, a film featuring a group of deaf superheroes whose powers derive from their use of sign language. The film was produced by and with deaf people and deals with Deaf culture, history and language.

<text>Interleaf, Inc. was a company that created computer software products for the technical publishing creation and distribution process. Founded in 1981, its initial product was the first commercial document processor that integrated text and graphics editing, producing WYSIWYG (&quot;what you see is what you get&quot;) output at near-typeset quality. It also had early products in the document management, electronic publishing, and Web publishing spaces. Interleaf&#x27;s &quot;Active Documents&quot; functionality, integrated into its text and graphics editing products in the early 1990s, was the first to give document creators programmatic access (via LISP) to virtually all of the document&#x27;s elements, structures, and software capabilities.

Broadvision acquired Interleaf in January 2000, and Aurea Software Inc. acquired Broadvision in May 2020.

Interleaf&#x27;s headquarters was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, and later moved to Waltham, Massachusetts.

== History ==

Interleaf was founded by David Boucher and Harry George in 1981. Boucher served as chief executive officer from 1981 until 1992; George served as chief financial officer. Earlier, both were among the founders of Kurzweil Computer Products. Other early personnel came from NBI and Wang Labs. The company initially produced &quot;turnkey&quot; systems, that is, combinations of hardware and software integrated by the company. It initially ran on workstations from Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computers, but later ported its software to workstations made by Digital Equipment Corporation, HP, IBM and SGI, and later still, to the Apple Macintosh II and the IBM Personal Computer.

Interleaf released its first product in 1985. Inspired by the Xerox Star and Apple Lisa, TPS (Technical Publishing Software) uniquely enabled authors to write their text and create technical graphics on a computer screen that showed what the page would look like when formatted and printed on a laser printer. This capability was so unusual in 1985 that the company&#x27;s name referred to the &quot;interleaving&quot; of text and graphics. TPS was also noted for its ability to handle the sorts of long documents corporate technical publishing departments routinely created.

Interleaf had its initial public offering (IPO) in June 1986, raising $24.6 million.

In 1990, Interleaf moved from Cambridge to Waltham.

The company was bought by Broadvision in 2000, which renamed its authoring products &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. The availability of Quicksilver 3.0 was announced in March 2007. The availability of QuickSilver 3.5 was announced in May 2010. QuickSilver 3.7 was released in July 2014. Quicksilver is currently sold and supported by Aurea Software, Inc.

== Conversion ==
There remain engineering companies and defense contractors that have their archives in the Interleaf/Quicksilver format, however in the 2000s it became increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain documents in that format, thus, established users of Quicksilver and the original Interleaf often seek to convert their documents to another format, usually Microsoft Word because of its ubiquity in large corporations.

Because of the aging of the Interleaf/Quicksilver code, by the early 2000s there were few technical options to convert Interleaf/Quicksilver documents. One option is to retype the entire document manually. This is only cost effective using labor in countries with low labor costs like China and the Philippines, however, in any case, a manual conversion process has high risks of human contamination of data.

Based on a web search, there appear to have been few software based, programmatic conversion services for Interleaf/Quicksilver. By 2023, we found only one such service in the marketplace: ZANDAR Corporation&#x27;s TagWrite, that claims to have the ability to make precise, programmatic conversion of Interleaf/Quicksilver entirely in computer memory without human intervention.

== Interleaf History ==
=== TPS ===

TPS (later renamed to &quot;Interleaf 5,&quot; up through &quot;Interleaf 7&quot;) was an integrated, networked text-and-graphics document creation system initially designed for technical publishing departments. Versions after its first release in 1984 added instantaneous updating of page numbering and reference numbers through multi-chapter and multi-volumes sets, increased graphics capabilities, automatic index and table of content generation, hyphenation, equations, &quot;microdocuments&quot; that recursively allowed fully functional whole document elements to be embedded in any document, and the ability to program any element of a document (a capability the company called &quot;Active Documents&quot;). Interleaf software was available in many languages including Japanese text layout.

TPS was a structured document editor. That is, it internally treated a document as a set of element classes, each with its own set of properties. Classes might include common document elements such as a body, paragraphs, titles, subheadings, captions, etc. Authors were free to create any set of elements and save them as a reusable template. The properties of a class — its font size, for example — could be changed and automatically applied to every instance of that class. If this caused a change in pagination — increasing the font size could change where the page breaks were — the software would update the screen quickly enough for the author to continue typing, including altering all of the cross-references that the author may have inserted; this WYSIWYG capability was a competitive advantage for the company. The structured nature of the documents also enabled TPS to provide &quot;conditional document assembly&quot;, a feature that enabled users to &quot;tag&quot; document elements with metadata about them, and then automatically assemble versions of the document based upon those tags. For example, an aircraft manufacturer might tag paragraphs with the model number of the planes to which they applied and then assemble versions of the documentation specific to each model.

The fact that it created structured documents enabled Interleaf to add its Active Document capabilities in the early 1990s. Just as JavaScript enables contemporary software developers to add functionality and &quot;intelligence&quot; to Web documents, Interleaf used LISP to enable document authors and engineers to enhance its authoring electronic publishing systems. Any document element could be given new &quot;methods&quot; (capabilities), and could respond to changes in the content or structure of the document itself. Typical applications included documents that automatically generated and updated charts based upon data expressed in the document, pages that altered themselves based on data accessed from databases or other sources, and systems that dynamically created pages to guide users through complex processes such as filling out insurance forms.

=== Interleaf Relational Document Manager (RDM) ===

RDM was an early document management product, acquired in the late 1980s and then integrated with Interleaf&#x27;s other products. RDM used a relational database management system to manage the elements of complex document sets, including their versions. Team of authors and editors would &quot;check in&quot; their documents when done with a work session, and begin a new session by &quot;checking them out.&quot; In so doing, RDM would ensure that the authors were working on the most current version of the document, even if another author had worked on it in the interim.

=== Interleaf WorldView ===

Interleaf Worldview&#x27;s core functionality is familiar to users of Adobe Acrobat Reader and other Portable Document Format (PDF) viewers, although Worldview preceded it by a year Worldview allowed document sets created with Interleaf&#x27;s technical publishing tools to be viewed on workstations, Macintoshes, and PCs, retaining page fidelity, and including hyperlinks among the pages

=== Interleaf WorldView Press ===

Worldview Press prepared documents for online viewing via Worldview. It imported documents created not only with Interleaf&#x27;s systems but by the other major document creation and graphic systems of the time, including Microsoft Word, PostScript, TIFF and SGML. Using Interleaf&#x27;s technical publishing system&#x27;s ability to reformat documents rapidly, Worldview Press enabled the creation of documents formatted for particular delivery vehicles. For example, the same documents could be formatted for reading on a small laptop screen or for a large workstation&#x27;s monitor. WorldView Press, developed in Lisp, was conceived and implemented by Jim Giza.

=== Interleaf Cyberleaf===

As the World Wide Web became increasingly adopted as the preferred mechanism for distributing electronic documents, Interleaf added Cyberleaf, a version of the WorldView Press that produced HTML documents.
Bill O&#x27;Donnell was the designer and developer of Cyberleaf. Later versions were worked on by Brenda White.

== Competitors ==

In the technical authoring and publishing area, Framemaker and Ventura Publisher became major competitors.

In the document management area, Interleaf competed with Documentum.

In the electronic distribution area, Adobe Acrobat, launched after Interleaf Worldview, became the dominant software.

<text>One Thousand and One Nights (,), is a collection of Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the Arabic language during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition (), which rendered the title as &quot;The Arabian Nights&#x27; Entertainment&quot;.

The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, and North Africa. Some tales trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, and Mesopotamian literature. Most tales, however, were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras, while others, especially the frame story, are probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work (, ), which in turn may be translations of older Indian texts.

Common to all the editions of the &quot;Nights&quot; is the framing device of the story of the ruler Shahryar being narrated the tales by his wife Scheherazade, with one tale told over each night of storytelling. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while some are self-contained. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights of storytelling, while others include 1001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.

Some of the stories commonly associated with the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;—particularly &quot;Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp&quot; and &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;—were not part of the collection in the original Arabic versions, but were instead added to the collection by French translator Antoine Galland after he heard them from Syrian writer Hanna Diyab during the latter&#x27;s visit to Paris. Other stories, such as &quot;The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, had an independent existence before being added to the collection.

==Synopsis==
The main frame story concerns Shahryār, whom the narrator calls a &quot;Sasanian king&quot; ruling in &quot;India and China&quot;. Shahryār is shocked to learn that his brother&#x27;s wife is unfaithful. Discovering that his own wife&#x27;s infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him.

Eventually the Vizier (Wazir), whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade, the vizier&#x27;s daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.

The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of erotica. Numerous stories depict jinn, ghouls, ape people, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade&#x27;s tale will begin telling other characters a story of their own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.

Versions differ, at least in detail, as to final endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.

The narrator&#x27;s standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing their life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king&#x27;s curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.

A number of stories within the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; also feature science fiction elements. One example is &quot;The Adventures of Bulukiya&quot;, where the protagonist Bulukiya&#x27;s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In another &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. &quot;The City of Brass&quot; features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, life-like humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city. &quot;The Ebony Horse&quot; features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the &quot;Third Qalandar&#x27;s Tale&quot; also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. &quot;The City of Brass&quot; and &quot;The Ebony Horse&quot; can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.

==History, versions and translations==
The history of the &quot;Nights&quot; is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin summarises their findings:

===Possible Indian influence===
Devices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the &quot;Nights&quot;. The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the &quot;Nights&quot; by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and &quot;Baital Pachisi&quot; is particularly notable.

It is possible that the influence of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the &quot;Tantropakhyana&quot;. Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of the &quot;Tantropakhyana&quot; survive, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil, Lao, Thai, and Old Javanese. The frame story follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;—with its original Indian setting.

The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and various tales from &quot;Jatakas&quot; were first translated into Persian by Borzūya in 570 CE; they were later translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in 750 CE. The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.

===Persian prototype: ===

The earliest mentions of the &quot;Nights&quot; refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, (also known as &quot;Afsaneh&quot; or &quot;Afsana&quot;), meaning &#x27;The Thousand Stories&#x27;. In the tenth century, Ibn al-Nadim compiled a catalogue of books (the &quot;Fihrist&quot;) in Baghdad. He noted that the Sassanid kings of Iran enjoyed &quot;evening tales and fables&quot;. Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian , explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night. Eventually one has the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king will delay her execution.

However, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection&#x27;s literary quality, observing that &quot;it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling&quot;. In the same century Al-Masudi also refers to the , saying the Arabic translation is called (&#x27;A Thousand Entertaining Tales&#x27;), but is generally known as (&#x27;A Thousand Nights&#x27;). He mentions the characters Shirāzd (Scheherazade) and Dināzād.

No physical evidence of the has survived, so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery. Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection. These stories include the cycle of &quot;King Jali&#x27;ad and his Wazir Shimas&quot; and &quot;The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son&quot; (derived from the seventh-century Persian ).

In the 1950s, the Iraqi scholar Safa Khulusi suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; was responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the eighth century.

===Evolving Arabic versions===
In the mid-20th century, the scholar Nabia Abbott found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title &quot;The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights&quot;, dating from the ninth century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the &quot;Nights&quot;. The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title &quot;The One Thousand and One Nights&quot; appears in Cairo in the 12th century. Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:

Two main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition is primarily represented by the earliest extensive manuscript of the &quot;Nights&quot;, a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript now known as the Galland Manuscript. It and surviving copies of it are much shorter and include fewer tales than the Egyptian tradition. It is represented in print by the so-called &quot;Calcutta I&quot; (1814–1818) and most notably by the &#x27;Leiden edition&#x27; (1984). The Leiden Edition, prepared by Muhsin Mahdi, is the only critical edition of 1001 Nights to date, believed to be most stylistically faithful representation of medieval Arabic versions currently available.

Texts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written, and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries.

All extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:

* The Merchant and the Genie
* The Fisherman and the Genie
* The Porter and the Three Ladies
* The Three Apples
* Nur al-Din Ali and Anis al-Jalis
* Ali Ibn Bakkar and Shams al-Nahar

The texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more &quot;authentic&quot; and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as Muhsin Mahdi have suspected that this was caused in part by European demand for a &quot;complete version&quot;; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.

=== Printed Arabic editions ===
The first printed Arabic-language edition of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; was published in 1775. It contained an Egyptian version of &quot;The Nights&quot; known as &quot;ZER&quot; (Zotenberg&#x27;s Egyptian Recension) and 200 tales. No copy of this edition survives, but it was the basis for an 1835 edition by Bulaq, published by the Egyptian government.

The &quot;Nights&quot; were next printed in Arabic in two volumes in Calcutta by the British East India Company in 1814–1818. Each volume contained one hundred tales.

Soon after, the Prussian scholar Christian Maximilian Habicht collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create an edition containing 1001 nights both in the original Arabic and in German translation, initially in a series of eight volumes published in Breslau in 1825–1838. A further four volumes followed in 1842–1843. In addition to the Galland manuscript, Habicht and al-Najjar used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar.

Both the ZER printing and Habicht and al-Najjar&#x27;s edition influenced the next printing, a four-volume edition also from Calcutta (known as the &quot;Macnaghten&quot; or &quot;Calcutta II&quot; edition). This claimed to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (which has never been found).

A major recent edition, which reverts to the Syrian recension, is a critical edition based on the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale, originally used by Galland. This edition, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by Muhsin Mahdi (1984–1994). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a &quot;definitive&quot; coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the Mamluk period (a view that remains contentious). Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of &quot;the only &quot;real&quot; Arabian Nights&quot; recognize it as being the best source on the original &quot;style&quot; and linguistic form of the medieval work.

In 1997, a further Arabic edition appeared, containing tales from the Arabian Nights transcribed from a seventeenth-century manuscript in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic.

===Modern translations===
The first European version (1704–1717) was translated into French by Antoine Galland from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, &quot;Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français&quot; (&#x27;The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French&#x27;), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Lamp&quot;, and &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland&#x27;s translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from the Christian Maronite storyteller Hanna Diab during Diab&#x27;s visit to Paris. Galland&#x27;s version of the &quot;Nights&quot; was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland&#x27;s publisher using Galland&#x27;s name without his consent.

As scholars were looking for the presumed &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;original&quot; form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the &quot;standard version&quot;. The first translations of this kind, such as that of Edward Lane (1840, 1859), were bowdlerized. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by John Payne, under the title &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night&quot; (1882, nine volumes), and then by Sir Richard Francis Burton, entitled &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot; (1885, ten volumes) – the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of plagiarism.

In view of the sexual imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores) and the strict Victorian laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton&#x27;s original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled &quot;The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;, which were printed between 1886 and 1888. It has, however, been criticized for its &quot;archaic language and extravagant idiom&quot; and &quot;obsessive focus on sexuality&quot; (and has even been called an &quot;eccentric &quot; and a &quot;highly personal reworking of the text&quot;).

Later versions of the &quot;Nights&quot; include that of the French doctor J. C. Mardrus, issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by Powys Mathers, and issued in 1923. Like Payne&#x27;s and Burton&#x27;s texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.

Muhsin Mahdi&#x27;s 1984 Leiden edition, based on the Galland Manuscript, was rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). This translation has been praised as &quot;very readable&quot; and &quot;strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic flavour of those tales&quot;. An additional second volume of &quot;Arabian nights&quot; translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales &quot;not&quot; present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995. Both volumes were the basis for a single-volume reprint of selected tales of Haddawy&#x27;s translations.

A new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in three volumes in 2008. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton&#x27;s. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called &quot;orphan stories&quot; of &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Ali Baba&quot; as well as an alternative ending to &quot;The seventh journey of Sindbad&quot; from Antoine Galland&#x27;s original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, &quot;[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to &#x27;rectify&#x27; ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text,&quot; and the work is a &quot;representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye&quot;. The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation. This translation was generally well-received upon release.

A new English language translation was published in December 2021, the first solely by a female author, Yasmine Seale, which removes earlier sexist and racist references. The new translation includes all the tales from Hanna Diyab and additionally includes stories previously omitted featuring female protagonists, such as tales about Parizade, Pari Banu, and the horror story Sidi Numan.

===Timeline===

Scholars have assembled a timeline concerning the publication history of &quot;The Nights&quot;:
* One of the oldest Arabic manuscript fragments from Syria (a few handwritten pages) dating to the early ninth century. Discovered by scholar Nabia Abbott in 1948, it bears the title &quot;Kitab Hadith Alf Layla&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Tale of the Thousand Nights&quot;) and the first few lines of the book in which Dinazad asks Shirazad (Scheherazade) to tell her stories.
* 10th century: mention of &quot;Hezār Afsān&quot; in Ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s &quot;Fihrist&quot; (Catalogue of books) in Baghdad. He attributes a pre-Islamic Sassanid Persian origin to the collection and refers to the frame story of Scheherazade telling stories over a thousand nights to save her life.
* 10th century: reference to &quot;The Thousand Nights&quot;, an Arabic translation of the Persian &quot;Hezār Afsān&quot; (&quot;Thousand Stories&quot;), in &quot;Muruj Al-Dhahab&quot; (The Meadows of Gold) by Al-Mas&#x27;udi.
* 12th century: a document from Cairo refers to a Jewish bookseller lending a copy of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot; (this is the first appearance of the final form of the title).
* 14th century: existing Syrian manuscript in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (contains about 300 tales).
* 1704: Antoine Galland&#x27;s French translation is the first European version of &quot;Nights&quot;. Later volumes were introduced using Galland&#x27;s name, though the stories were written by unknown persons at the behest of the publisher, who wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the collection.
* c. 1706 – c. 1721: an anonymously translated 12-volume English version appears in Europe, dubbed the &quot;Grub Street&quot; version. This is entitled &quot;Arabian Nights&#x27; Entertainments&quot;—the first known use of the common English title of the work.
* 1768: first Polish translation, 12 volumes. Based, as with many European versions, on the French translation.
* 1775: Egyptian version of &quot;Nights&quot; called &quot;ZER&quot; (Hermann Zotenberg&#x27;s Egyptian Recension) with 200 tales (no extant edition).
* 1804–1806, 1825: Austrian polyglot and orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856) translates a subsequently lost manuscript into French between 1804 and 1806. His French translation, which was partially abridged and included Galland&#x27;s &quot;orphan stories&quot;, has been lost, but its translation into German, published in 1825, survives.
* 1814: Calcutta I, the earliest existing Arabic printed version, is published by the British East India Company. A second volume was released in 1818. Both had 100 tales each.
* 1811: Jonathan Scott (1754–1829), an Englishman who learned Arabic and Persian in India, produces an English translation, mostly based on Galland&#x27;s French version, supplemented by other sources. Robert Irwin calls it the &quot;first literary translation into English&quot;, in contrast to earlier translations from French by &quot;Grub Street hacks&quot;.
* Early 19th century: Modern Persian translations of the text are made, variously under the title &quot;Alf leile va leile&quot;, &quot;Hezār-o yek šhab&quot; (), or, in distorted Arabic, &quot;Alf al-leil&quot;. Muhammad Baqir Khurasani Buzanjirdi (b.1770) finalized his translation in 1814, patronized by Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet (1783–1852), British Resident in Hyderabad. Three decades later, Abdul Latif Tasuji completed his translation. It was later illustrated by Sani ol Molk (1814–1866) for Mohammad Shah Qajar.
* 1825–1838: the Breslau/Habicht edition is published in Arabic in eight volumes. Christian Maximilian Habicht (born in Breslau, Prussia, 1775) collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create this edition containing 1001 nights. In addition to the Galland manuscript, they used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar. Using versions of &quot;Nights&quot;, tales from Al-Najjar, and other stories of unknown origin, Habicht published his version in Arabic and German.
* 1842–1843: Four additional volumes by Habicht.
* 1835: Bulaq version: these two volumes, printed by the Egyptian government, are the oldest printed and published version of &quot;Nights&quot; in Arabic by a non-European. It is primarily a reprinting of the ZER text.
* 1839–1842: Calcutta II (4 volumes) is published. It claims to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (this has never been found). This version contains many elements and stories from the Habicht edition.
* 1838: Torrens version in English.
* 1838–1840: Edward William Lane publishes an English translation. Notable for Lane&#x27;s exclusion of content he found immoral and for his anthropological notes on Arab customs.
* 1882–1884: John Payne publishes an English version translated entirely from Calcutta II, adding some tales from Calcutta I and Breslau.
* 1885–1888: Sir Richard Francis Burton publishes an English translation from several sources (largely the same as Payne). His version accentuated the sexuality of the stories &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; Lane&#x27;s bowdlerized translation.
* 1889–1904: J. C. Mardrus publishes a French version using Bulaq and Calcutta II editions.
* 1973: First Polish translation based on the original language edition, but compressed 12 volumes to 9, by Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy.
* 1984: Muhsin Mahdi publishes an Arabic edition based on the oldest surviving Arabic manuscript (based on the oldest surviving Syrian manuscript currently held in the Bibliothèque Nationale).
* 1986–1987: French translation by Arabist René R. Khawam.
* 1990: Husain Haddawy publishes an English translation of Mahdi.
* 1991: French translation by Arabists Jamel-Eddine Bencheikh and André Miquel for the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade.
* 2008: New Penguin Classics translation (in three volumes) by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons of the Calcutta II edition

==Literary themes and techniques==
The &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; and various tales within it make use of many innovative literary techniques, which the storytellers of the tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions. Some of these date back to earlier Persian, Indian and Arabic literature, while others were original to the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

===Frame story===
The &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; employs an early example of the frame story, or framing device: the character Scheherazade narrates a set of tales (most often fairy tales) to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Scheherazade&#x27;s tales are themselves frame stories, such as the &quot;Tale of Sinbad the Seaman and Sinbad the Landsman&quot;, which is a collection of adventures related by Sinbad the Seaman to Sinbad the Landsman.

In folkloristics, the frame story is classified as ATU 875B*, &quot;Storytelling Saves a Wife from Death&quot;.

===Embedded narrative===
Another technique featured in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; is an early example of the &quot;story within a story&quot;, or &quot;embedded narrative&quot; technique: this can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; of ancient Sanskrit literature. The &quot;Nights&quot;, however, improved on the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase &quot;If you&#x27;re not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you.&quot; In the &quot;Nights&quot;, this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story: instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.

The general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In most of Scheherazade&#x27;s narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. This is particularly the case for the &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; story narrated by Scheherazade in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Within the &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as &quot;The Three Apples&quot; and &quot;The Seven Viziers&quot;. In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, &quot;The Fisherman and the Jinni&quot;, the &quot;Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban&quot; is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.

===Dramatic visualization===
Dramatic visualization is &quot;the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene &#x27;visual&#x27; or imaginatively present to an audience&quot;. This technique is used in several tales of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, such as the tale of &quot;The Three Apples&quot; (see Crime fiction elements below).

===Fate and destiny===
A common theme in many &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales is and destiny. Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini observed:

Though invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. The plot devices often used to present this theme are coincidence, reverse causation, and the self-fulfilling prophecy (see Foreshadowing section below). 

===Foreshadowing===
Early examples of the foreshadowing technique of repetitive designation, now known as &quot;Chekhov&#x27;s gun&quot;, occur in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, which contains &quot;repeated references to some character or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative.&quot; A notable example is in the tale of &quot;The Three Apples&quot; (see Crime fiction elements below).

Another early foreshadowing technique is &quot;formal patterning&quot;, &quot;the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds.&quot; This technique is also found in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

==== The self-fulfilling prophecy ====
Several tales in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; use the self-fulfilling prophecy, as a special form of literary prolepsis, to foreshadow what is going to happen. This literary device dates back to the story of Krishna in ancient Sanskrit literature, and Oedipus or the death of Heracles in the plays of Sophocles. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in Arabic literature (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the Hebrew Bible).

A notable example is &quot;The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream&quot;, in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in English folklore as the &quot;Pedlar of Swaffham&quot; and Paulo Coelho&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot;; Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; collection of short stories &quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot; featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as &quot;The Story of the Two Dreamers&quot;.

&quot;The Tale of Attaf&quot; depicts another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the House of Wisdom), reads a random book, &quot;falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful vizier Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya from sight. Ja&#x27;afar, disturbed and upset, flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries&quot;. After returning to Baghdad, Ja&#x27;afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun&#x27;s reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of reverse causation.

Near the end of the tale, Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he did not commit but Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century, this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included in his &quot;Disciplina Clericalis&quot;, alongside the &quot;Sindibad&quot; story cycle. In the 14th century, a version of &quot;The Tale of Attaf&quot; also appears in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; and Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;.

===Repetition===
&quot;Leitwortstil&quot; is &quot;the purposeful repetition of words&quot; in a given literary piece that &quot;usually expresses a motif or theme important to the given story.&quot; This device occurs in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, which binds several tales in a story cycle. The storytellers of the tales relied on this technique &quot;to shape the constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole&quot;.

Another technique used in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; is thematic patterning, which is:[T]he distribution of recurrent thematic concepts and moralistic motifs among the various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in common.Several different variants of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; story, which has its origins in the ancient Greek story of Rhodopis, appear in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, including &quot;The Second Shaykh&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;The Eldest Lady&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers&quot;, all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, &quot;Judar and His Brethren&quot;, departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.

===Sexual humour===
The &quot;Nights&quot; contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this borders on satire, as in the tale called &quot;Ali with the Large Member&quot; which pokes fun at obsession with penis size.

===Unreliable narrator===
The literary device of the unreliable narrator was used in several fictional medieval Arabic tales of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. In one tale, &quot;The Seven Viziers&quot; (also known as &quot;Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs&quot;), a courtesan accuses a king&#x27;s son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the Qur&#x27;anic/Biblical story of Yusuf/Joseph). Seven viziers attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers. The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in &quot;The Three Apples&quot; and humor in &quot;The Hunchback&#x27;s Tale&quot; (see Crime fiction elements below).

=== Genre elements ===
====Crime fiction====

An example of the murder mystery and suspense thriller genres in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements was &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, also known as &quot;Hikayat al-sabiyya &#x27;l-maqtula&quot; (&#x27;The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman&#x27;).

In this tale, Harun al-Rashid comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, Ja&#x27;far, three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja&#x27;far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman&#x27;s husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman&#x27;s murder.

Harun then gives Ja&#x27;far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja&#x27;far&#x27;s own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.

Another &quot;Nights&quot; tale with crime fiction elements was &quot;The Hunchback&#x27;s Tale&quot; story cycle which, unlike &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, was more of a suspenseful comedy and courtroom drama rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor&#x27;s favourite comedian, being invited to dinner by a tailor couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a Jewish doctor&#x27;s clinic and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the &quot;Tale of the Jewish Doctor&quot;, where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback&#x27;s body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a courtroom, all making different claims over how the hunchback had died. Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of &quot;The Tale of Attaf&quot; (see Foreshadowing above).

==== Horror fiction ====
Haunting is used as a plot device in gothic fiction and horror fiction, as well as modern paranormal fiction. Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. In particular, the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale of &quot;Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad&quot; revolves around a house haunted by jinn. The &quot;Nights&quot; is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls, and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story &quot;The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib&quot; (from &quot;Nights&quot; vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to Islam.

Horror fiction elements are also found in &quot;The City of Brass&quot; tale, which revolves around a ghost town.

The horrific nature of Scheherazade&#x27;s situation is magnified in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot;, in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the &quot;Nights&quot; on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. As a child, he was fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he attributes some of his creations to his love of the &quot;1001 Nights&quot;.

==== Fantasy and science fiction ====
Several stories within the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; feature early science fiction elements. One example is &quot;The Adventures of Bulukiya&quot;, in which the protagonist Bulukiya&#x27;s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinn, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In &quot;Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud&quot;, the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets.

In another &quot;1001 Nights&quot; tale, &quot;Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman&quot;, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales also depict Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.

&quot;The City of Brass&quot; features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinni, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city, which has now become a ghost town. The &quot;Third Qalandar&#x27;s Tale&quot; also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman.

===Poetry===
There is an abundance of Arabic poetry in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. It is often deployed by stories&#x27; narrators to provide detailed descriptions, usually of the beauty of characters. Characters also occasionally quote or speak in verse in certain settings. The uses include but are not limited to:

* Giving advice, warning, and solutions.
* Praising God, royalties and those in power.
* Pleading for mercy and forgiveness.
* Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck.
* Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges.
* Criticizing elements of life, wondering.
* Expressing feelings to others or one&#x27;s self: happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise, anger.

In a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman, standing outside the castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival. He wraps his ring in a paper and hands it to the servant who delivers it to the Queen. When she opens it and sees the ring, joy conquers her, and out of happiness she chants this poem:

Translations:

==In world culture==

The influence of the versions of &quot;The Nights&quot; on world literature is immense. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib Mahfouz have alluded to the collection by name in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the &quot;Nights&quot; include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk, Goethe, Walter Scott, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Nodier, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal, Dumas, Hugo, Gérard de Nerval, Gobineau, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W. B. Yeats, H. G. Wells, Cavafy, Calvino, Georges Perec, H. P. Lovecraft, Marcel Proust, A. S. Byatt and Angela Carter.

Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further &quot;long ago&quot; or farther &quot;far away&quot;; this process culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.

In 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began naming features on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton&#x27;s translation because &quot;its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy.&quot;

===In Arab culture===
There is little evidence that the &quot;Nights&quot; was particularly treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist. Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as &quot;khurafa&quot; (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children). According to Robert Irwin, &quot;Even today, with the exception of certain writers and academics, the &quot;Nights&quot; is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written&quot;.

Nevertheless, the &quot;Nights&quot; have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as Tawfiq al-Hakim (author of the Symbolist play &quot;Shahrazad&quot;, 1934), Taha Hussein (&quot;Scheherazade&#x27;s Dreams&quot;, 1943) and Naguib Mahfouz (&quot;Arabian Nights and Days&quot;, 1979). Idries Shah finds the Abjad numerical equivalent of the Arabic title, &quot;alf layla wa layla&quot;, in the Arabic phrase &quot;ʾumm al-qiṣṣa&quot;, meaning &#x27;mother of stories&#x27;. He goes on to state that many of the stories &quot;are encoded Sufi teaching stories, descriptions of psychological processes, or enciphered lore of one kind or another&quot;.

On a more popular level, film and TV adaptations based on stories like Sinbad and Aladdin enjoyed long lasting popularity in Arabic speaking countries.

===Early European literature===
Although the first known translation into a European language appeared in 1704, it is possible that the &quot;Nights&quot; began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by Juan Manuel&#x27;s story collection &quot;El Conde Lucanor&quot; and Ramón Llull&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Beasts&quot;.

Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the &quot;Nights&quot; are found in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (in &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tale&quot; the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. Echoes in Giovanni Sercambi&#x27;s &quot;Novelle&quot; and Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known. Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the Balkans and a translation of the &quot;Nights&quot; into Romanian existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.

=== Western literature (18th century onwards) ===
==== Galland translations (1700s) ====

The modern fame of the &quot;Nights&quot; derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to Robert Irwin, Galland &quot;played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the &quot;Nights&quot;&quot;.

The immediate success of Galland&#x27;s version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for &quot;contes de fées&quot; (&#x27;fairy stories&#x27;). This fashion began with the publication of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s &quot;Histoire d&#x27;Hypolite&quot; in 1690. D&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s book has a remarkably similar structure to the &quot;Nights&quot;, with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the &quot;Nights&quot; spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.

Galland&#x27;s version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include Anthony Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Les quatre Facardins&quot; (1730), Crébillon&#x27;s &quot;Le sopha&quot; (1742) and Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Les bijoux indiscrets&quot; (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zadig&quot; (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background. The English versions of the &quot;Oriental Tale&quot; generally contained a heavy moralising element, with the notable exception of William Beckford&#x27;s fantasy &quot;Vathek&quot; (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki&#x27;s novel &quot;Saragossa Manuscript&quot; (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the &quot;Nights&quot; with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.

The work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar (then an apprentice) to a Presbyterian minister. This is illustrative of the title&#x27;s widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.

==== 19th century–20th century ====
The &quot;Nights&quot; continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to A. S. Byatt, &quot;In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.&quot; In their autobiographical writings, both Coleridge and de Quincey refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. Wordsworth and Tennyson also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry. Charles Dickens was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the &quot;Nights&quot; pervades the opening of his last novel &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1870).

Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale, including Théophile Gautier (&quot;La mille deuxième nuit&quot;, 1842) and Joseph Roth (&quot;Die Geschichte von der 1002 Nacht&quot;, 1939). Edgar Allan Poe wrote &quot;The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade&quot; (1845), a short story depicting the eighth and final voyage of Sinbad the Sailor, along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe&#x27;s lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.

Another important literary figure, the Irish poet W. B. Yeats was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, A Vision an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid, in relation to his joint experiments with his wife Georgie Hyde-Lees, with automatic writing, a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person&#x27;s eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats&#x27;s poem as &quot;a gift&quot; herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher Qusta Ibn Luqa, who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

Modern authors influenced by the &quot;Nights&quot; include James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges, John Barth and Ted Chiang.

=== Film, radio and television ===

Stories from the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; have been popular subjects for films, beginning with Georges Méliès&#x27; &quot;Le Palais des Mille et une nuits&quot; (1905).

The critic Robert Irwin singles out the two versions of &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; (1924 version directed by Raoul Walsh; 1940 version produced by Alexander Korda) and Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Il fiore delle Mille e una notte&quot; (1974) as ranking &quot;high among the masterpieces of world cinema.&quot; Michael James Lundell calls &quot;Il fiore&quot; &quot;the most faithful adaptation, in its emphasis on sexuality, of &quot;The 1001 Nights&quot; in its oldest form&quot;.

&quot;Alif Laila&quot; (; 1933) was a Hindi-language fantasy film based on &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; from the early era of Indian cinema, directed by Balwant Bhatt and Shanti Dave. K. Amarnath made, &quot;Alif Laila&quot; (1953), another Indian fantasy film in Hindi based on the folktale of Aladdin. Niren Lahiri&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, an adventure-fantasy film adaptation of the stories, released in 1946. A number of Indian films based on the &quot;Nights&quot; and &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; were produced over the years, including &quot;Baghdad Ka Chor&quot; (1946), &quot;Baghdad Thirudan&quot; (1960), and &quot;Baghdad Gaja Donga&quot; (1968). A television series, &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;, was also made in India which aired on Zee TV between 2000 and 2001.

UPA, an American animation studio, produced an animated feature version of &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot; (1959), featuring the cartoon character Mr. Magoo.

The 1949 animated film &quot;The Singing Princess&quot;, another movie produced in Italy, is inspired by The Arabian Nights. The animated feature film, &quot;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&quot; (1969), produced in Japan and directed by Osamu Tezuka and Eichii Yamamoto, featured psychedelic imagery and sounds, and erotic material intended for adults.

&quot;Alif Laila&quot; (&quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;), a 1993–1997 Indian TV series based on the stories from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; produced by Sagar Entertainment Ltd, aired on DD National starts with Scheherazade telling her stories to Shahryār, and contains both the well-known and the lesser-known stories from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Another Indian television series, &quot;Alif Laila&quot;, based on various stories from the collection aired on Dangal TV in 2020.

&quot;Alf Leila Wa Leila&quot;, Egyptian television adaptations of the stories was broadcast between the 1980s and early 1990s, with each series featuring a cast of big name Egyptian performers such as Hussein Fahmy, Raghda, Laila Elwi, Yousuf Shaaban, Nelly, Sherihan and Yehia El-Fakharany. Each series premiered on every yearly month of Ramadan between the 1980s and 1990s.

One of the best known Arabian Nights-based films is the 1992 Walt Disney animated movie &quot;Aladdin&quot;, which is loosely based on the story of the same name.

&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (2000), a two-part television mini-series adopted for BBC and ABC studios, starring Mili Avital, Dougray Scott, and John Leguizamo, and directed by Steve Barron, is based on the translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton.

Shabnam Rezaei and Aly Jetha created, and the Vancouver-based Big Bad Boo Studios produced &quot;1001 Nights&quot; (2011), an animated television series for children, which launched on Teletoon and airs in 80 countries around the world, including Discovery Kids Asia.

&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (2015, in Portuguese: &quot;As Mil e uma Noites&quot;), a three-part film directed by Miguel Gomes, is based on &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

&quot;Alf Leila Wa Leila&quot;, a popular Egyptian radio adaptation was broadcast on Egyptian radio stations for 26 years. Directed by famed radio director Mohamed Mahmoud Shabaan also known by his nickname &quot;Baba Sharoon&quot;, the series featured a cast of respected Egyptian actors, among them Zouzou Nabil as Scheherazade and Abdelrahim El Zarakany as Shahryar.

&quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019) is a musical fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie from a screenplay he co-wrote with John August. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Rideback, it is a live-action remake of Disney&#x27;s 1992 animated feature film of the same title.

<text>Traffic comprises pedestrians, vehicles, ridden or herded animals, trains, and other conveyances that use public ways (roads/sidewalks) for travel and transportation. 

Traffic laws govern and regulate traffic, while rules of the road include traffic laws and informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic. Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, and traffic control at intersections. (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea govern the oceans and influence some laws for navigating domestic waters.)

Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, cones, or signs. Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated. Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road while others rely more on drivers&#x27; common sense and willingness to cooperate.

Organization typically produces a better combination of travel safety and efficiency. Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include road construction, collisions, and debris in the roadway. On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a phenomenon known as traffic waves. A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and gridlock. Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.

== Etymology and types ==

The word &quot;traffic&quot; originally meant &quot;trade&quot; (as it still does) and comes from the Old Italian verb &quot;trafficare&quot; and noun &quot;traffico&quot;. The origin of the Italian words is unclear. Suggestions include Catalan &quot;trafegar&quot; &quot;decant&quot;, an assumed Vulgar Latin verb &quot;transfricare&quot; &#x27;rub across&#x27;, an assumed Vulgar Latin combination of &quot;trans-&quot; and &quot;facere&quot; &#x27;make or do&#x27;, Arabic &quot;tafriq&quot; &#x27;distribution&#x27;, and Arabic &quot;taraffaqa&quot;, which can mean &#x27;seek profit&#x27;. Broadly, the term covers many kinds of traffic including network traffic, air traffic, marine traffic and rail traffic, but it is often used narrowly to mean only road traffic.

== Rules of the road ==

Rules of the road and driving etiquette are the general practices and procedures that road users are required to follow. These rules usually apply to all road users, though they are of special importance to motorists and cyclists. These rules govern interactions between vehicles and pedestrians. The basic traffic rules are defined by an international treaty under the authority of the United Nations, the 1968 &quot;Vienna Convention on Road Traffic&quot;. Not all countries are signatory to the convention and, even among signatories, local variations in practice may be found. There are also unwritten local rules of the road, which are generally understood by local drivers.

As a general rule, drivers are expected to avoid a collision with another vehicle and pedestrians, regardless of whether or not the applicable rules of the road allow them to be where they happen to be.

In addition to the rules applicable by default, traffic signs and traffic lights must be obeyed, and instructions may be given by a police officer, either routinely (on a busy crossing instead of traffic lights) or as road traffic control around a construction zone, accident, or other road disruption.

===Directionality===
Traffic heading in inverse ways ought to be isolated so as to not hinder each other&#x27;s way. The most essential guideline is whether to utilize the left or right half of the street.

===Traffic regulations===
In many countries, the rules of the road are codified, setting out the legal requirements and punishments for breaking them.

In the United Kingdom, the rules are set out in the Highway Code, which includes not only obligations but also advice on how to drive sensibly and safely.

In the United States, traffic laws are regulated by the states and municipalities through their respective traffic codes. Most of these are based at least in part on the Uniform Vehicle Code, but there are variations from state to state. In states such as Florida, traffic law and criminal law are separate; therefore, unless someone flees the scene of an accident or commits vehicular homicide or manslaughter, they are only guilty of a minor traffic offense. However, states such as South Carolina have completely criminalised their traffic law, so, for example, one is guilty of a misdemeanor simply for travelling 5 miles over the speed limit.

=== Trail ethics (right of way) ===
Trail ethics are a set of informal rules for right of way for users of trails, including hikers, mountaineers, equestrians, cyclists, and mountain bikers.

==Organised traffic==
===Passage priority (right of way)===

Vehicles often come into conflict with other vehicles and pedestrians because their intended courses of travel intersect, and thus interfere with each other&#x27;s routes. The general principle that establishes who has the right to go first is called &quot;right of way&quot; or &quot;priority&quot;. It establishes who has the right to use the conflicting part of the road and who has to wait until the other does so.
Signs, signals, markings and other features are often used to make priority explicit. Some signs, such as the stop sign, are nearly universal. When there are no signs or markings, different rules are observed depending on the location. These default priority rules differ between countries, and may even vary within countries. Trends toward uniformity are exemplified at an international level by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, which prescribes standardised traffic control devices (signs, signals, and markings) for establishing the right of way where necessary.

Crosswalks (or pedestrian crossings) are common in populated areas, and may indicate that pedestrians have priority over vehicular traffic. In most modern cities, the traffic signal is used to establish the right of way on the busy roads. Its primary purpose is to give each road a duration of time in which its traffic may use the intersection in an organised way. The intervals of time assigned for each road may be adjusted to take into account factors such as difference in volume of traffic, the needs of pedestrians, or other traffic signals. Pedestrian crossings may be located near other traffic control devices; if they are not also regulated in some way, vehicles must give priority to them when in use. Traffic on a public road usually has priority over other traffic such as traffic emerging from private access; rail crossings and drawbridges are typical exceptions.

====Uncontrolled traffic====
Uncontrolled traffic comes in the absence of lane markings and traffic control signals. On roads without marked lanes, drivers tend to keep to the appropriate side if the road is wide enough. Drivers frequently overtake others. Obstructions are
common.

Intersections have no signals or signage, and a particular road at a busy intersection may be dominant – that is, its traffic flows – until a break in traffic, at which time the dominance shifts to the other road where vehicles are queued. At the intersection of two perpendicular roads, a traffic jam may result if four vehicles face each other side-on.

=== Turning ===
Drivers often seek to turn onto another road or onto private property. The vehicle&#x27;s blinking turn signals (commonly known as &quot;blinkers&quot; or &quot;indicators&quot;) are often used as a way to announce one&#x27;s intention to turn, thus alerting other drivers. The actual usage of directional signals varies greatly amongst countries, although its purpose is to indicate a driver&#x27;s intention to depart from the current (and natural) flow of traffic well before the departure is executed (typically 3 seconds as a guideline).
This will usually mean that turning traffic must stop and wait for a breach to turn, and this might cause inconvenience for drivers that follow them but do not want to turn. This is why dedicated lanes and protected traffic signals for turning are sometimes provided. On busier intersections where a protected lane would be ineffective or cannot be built, turning may be entirely prohibited, and drivers will be required to &quot;drive around the block&quot; in order to accomplish the turn. Many cities employ this tactic quite often; in San Francisco, due to its common practice, making three right turns is known colloquially as a &quot;San Francisco left turn&quot;. Likewise, as many intersections in Taipei City are too busy to allow direct left turns, signs often direct drivers to drive around the block to turn.

Turning rules are by no means universal. For example, in New Zealand (a drive-on-the-left country) between 1977 and 2012, left turning traffic had to give way to opposing right-turning traffic wishing to take the same road (unless there were multiple lanes, but then one must take care in case a vehicle jumped lanes). New Zealand abolished this particular rule on 25 March 2012, except at roundabouts or when denoted by a Give Way or Stop sign. Although the rule caused initial driver confusion, and many intersections required or still require modification, the change is predicted to eventually prevent one death and 13 serious injuries annually.

On roads with multiple lanes, turning traffic is generally expected to move to the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn. For example, traffic intending to turn right will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection. Likewise, left-turning traffic will move to the leftmost lane. Exceptions to this rule may exist where for example the traffic authority decides that the two rightmost lanes will be for turning right, in which case drivers may take whichever of them to turn. Traffic may adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority. For example, it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. If several vehicles on the right lane are all turning right, a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane and turn right as well, in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.

==== Intersections ====

In most of Continental Europe, the default rule is to give priority to the right, but this may be overridden by signs or road markings. There, priority was initially given according to the social rank of each traveler, but early in the life of the automobile this rule was deemed impractical and replaced with the &quot;priorité à droite&quot; (priority to the right) rule, which still applies. At a traffic circle where &quot;priorité à droite&quot; is not overridden, traffic on what would otherwise be a roundabout gives way to traffic entering the circle. Most French roundabouts now have give-way signs for traffic entering the circle, but there remain some notable exceptions that operate on the old rule, such as the Place de l&#x27;Étoile around the Arc de Triomphe. Priority to the right where used in continental Europe may be overridden by an ascending hierarchy of markings, signs, signals, and authorized persons.

In the United Kingdom, priority is generally indicated by signs or markings, so that almost all junctions between public roads (except those governed by traffic signals) have a concept of a major road and minor road. The default give-way-to-the-right rule used in Continental Europe causes problems for many British and Irish drivers who are accustomed to having right of way by default unless otherwise indicated. A very small proportion of low-traffic junctions are unmarked – typically on housing estates or in rural areas. Here the rule is to &quot;proceed with great care&quot; i.e. slow the vehicle and check for traffic on the intersecting road.

Other countries use various methods similar to the above examples to establish the right of way at intersections. For example, in most of the United States, the default priority is to yield to traffic from the right, but this is usually overridden by traffic control devices or other rules, like the boulevard rule. This rule holds that traffic entering a major road from a smaller road or alley must yield to the traffic of the busier road, but signs are often still posted. The boulevard rule can be compared with the above concept of a major and minor road, or the priority roads that may be found in countries that are parties to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.

;Perpendicular intersections
Also known as a &quot;four-way&quot; intersection, this intersection is the most common configuration for roads that cross each other, and the most basic type.

If traffic signals do not control a four-way intersection, signs or other features are typically used to control movements and make clear priorities. The most common arrangement is to indicate that one road has priority over the other, but there are complex cases where all traffic approaching an intersection must yield and may be required to stop.

In the United States, South Africa, and Canada, there are four-way intersections with a stop sign at every entrance, called four-way stops. A failed signal or a flashing red light is equivalent to a four-way stop, or an all-way stop. Special rules for four-way stops may include:

# In the countries that use four-way stops, pedestrians always have priority at crosswalks – even at unmarked ones, which exist as the logical continuations of the sidewalks at every intersection with approximately right angles – unless signed or painted otherwise.
# Whichever vehicle first stops at the stop line – or before the crosswalk, if there is no stop line – has priority.
# If two vehicles stop at the same time, priority is given to the vehicle on the right.
# If several vehicles arrive at the same time, a right-of-way conflict may arise wherein no driver has the legal right-of-way. This may result in drivers informally signaling to other drivers to indicate their intent to yield, for example by waving or flashing headlights.

In Europe and other places, there are similar intersections. These may be marked by special signs (according to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals), a danger sign with a black X representing a crossroads. This sign informs drivers that the intersection is uncontrolled and that default rules apply. In Europe and in many areas of North America the default rules that apply at uncontrolled four-way intersections are almost identical:

# Rules for pedestrians differ by country, in the United States and Canada pedestrians generally have priority at such an intersection.
# All vehicles must give priority to any traffic approaching from their right,
# Then, if the vehicle is turning right or continuing on the same road it may proceed.
# Vehicles turning left must also give priority to traffic approaching from the opposite direction, unless that traffic is also turning left.
# If the intersection is congested, vehicles must alternate directions and/or circulate priority to the right one vehicle at a time. 

====Protected intersection for bicycles====
A number of features make this protected intersection. A corner refuge island, a setback crossing of the pedestrians and cyclists, generally between 1.5–7 metres of setback, a forward stop bar, which allows cyclists to stop for a traffic light well ahead of motor traffic who must stop behind the crosswalk. Separate signal staging or at least an advance green for cyclists and pedestrians is used to give cyclists and pedestrians no conflicts or a head start over traffic. The design makes a right turn on red, and sometimes left on red depending on the geometry of the intersection in question, possible in many cases, often without stopping.

This type of intersection is common in the bicycle-friendly Netherlands.

====Pedestrian crossings====

Pedestrians must often cross from one side of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of vehicles traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.
The actual appearance of pedestrian crossings varies greatly, but the two most common appearances are: (1) a series of lateral white stripes or (2) two longitudinal white lines. The former is usually preferred, as it stands out more conspicuously against the dark pavement.

Some pedestrian crossings accompany a traffic signal to make vehicles stop at regular intervals so pedestrians can cross. Some countries have &quot;intelligent&quot; pedestrian signals, where the pedestrian must push a button in order to assert their intention to cross. In some countries, approaching traffic is monitored by radar or by electromagnetic sensors buried in the road surface, and the pedestrian crossing lights are set to red if a speed infringement is detected. This has the effect of enforcing the local speed limit. See Speed Limits below.

Pedestrian crossings without traffic signals are also common. In this case, the traffic laws usually states that the pedestrian has the right of way when crossing, and that vehicles must stop when a pedestrian uses the crossing. Countries and driving cultures vary greatly as to the extent to which this is respected. In the state of Nevada the car has the right of way when the crosswalk signal specifically forbids pedestrian crossing. Traffic culture is a determinant factor for the behaviors of all road users’ traffic. Specifically, it has a main role in crashes.

Some jurisdictions forbid crossing or using the road anywhere other than at crossings, termed &quot;jaywalking&quot;. In other areas, pedestrians may have the right to cross where they choose, and have right of way over vehicular traffic while crossing.

In most areas, an intersection is considered to have a crosswalk, even if not painted, as long as the roads meet at approximate right angles. The United Kingdom and Croatia are among the exceptions.

Pedestrian crossings may also be located away from intersections.

===Level crossings===

A level crossing is an at-grade intersection of a railway by a road. Because of safety issues, they are often equipped with closable gates, crossing bells and warning signs.

===Speed limits===
The higher the speed of a vehicle, the more difficult collision avoidance becomes and the greater the damage if a collision does occur. Therefore, many countries of the world limit the maximum speed allowed on their roads. Vehicles are not supposed to be driven at speeds which are higher than the posted maximum.

To enforce speed limits, two approaches are generally employed. In the United States, it is common for the police to patrol the streets and use special equipment (typically a radar unit) to measure the speed of vehicles, and pull over any vehicle found to be in violation of the speed limit. In Brazil, Colombia and some European countries, there are computerized speed-measuring devices spread throughout the city, which will automatically detect speeding drivers and take a photograph of the license plate (or number plate), which is later used for applying and mailing the ticket. Many jurisdictions in the U.S. use this technology as well.

A mechanism that was developed in Germany is the Grüne Welle, or &quot;green wave&quot;, which is an indicator that shows the optimal speed to travel for the synchronized green lights along that corridor. Driving faster or slower than the speed set by the behavior of the lights causes the driver to encounter many red lights. This discourages drivers from speeding or impeding the flow of traffic. See related traffic wave and Pedestrian Crossings, above.

===Overtaking===
&quot;Overtaking&quot; (or &quot;passing&quot;) refers to a maneuver by which one or more vehicles traveling in the same direction are passed by another vehicle. On two-lane roads, when there is a split line or a dashed line on the side of the overtaker, drivers may overtake when it is safe. On multi-lane roads in most jurisdictions, overtaking is permitted in the &quot;slower&quot; lanes, though many require a special circumstance. See &quot;Lanes&quot; below.

In the United Kingdom and Canada, notably on extra-urban roads, a solid white or yellow line closer to the driver is used to indicate that no overtaking is allowed in that lane. A double white or yellow line means that neither side may overtake.

In the United States, a solid white line means that lane changes are discouraged and a double white line means that the lane change is prohibited.

====Lanes====
When a street is wide enough to accommodate several vehicles traveling side-by-side, it is usual for traffic to organize itself into &quot;lanes&quot;, that is, parallel corridors of traffic. Some roads have one lane for each direction of travel and others have multiple lanes for each direction. Most countries apply pavement markings to clearly indicate the limits of each lane and the direction of travel that it must be used for. In other countries lanes have no markings at all and drivers follow them mostly by intuition rather than visual stimulus.

On roads that have multiple lanes going in the same direction, drivers may usually shift amongst lanes as they please, but they must do so in a way that does not cause inconvenience to other drivers. Driving cultures vary greatly on the issue of &quot;lane ownership&quot;: in some countries, drivers traveling in a lane will be very protective of their right to travel in it while in others drivers will routinely expect other drivers to shift back and forth.

Designation and overtaking

The usual designation for lanes on divided highways is the fastest lane is the one closest to the center of the road, and the slowest to the edge of the road. Drivers are usually expected to keep in the slowest lane unless overtaking, though with more traffic congestion all lanes are often used.

When driving on the left:

* The lane designated for faster traffic is on the right.
* The lane designated for slower traffic is on the left.
* Most freeway exits are on the left.
* Overtaking is permitted to the right, and sometimes to the left.

When driving on the right:

* The lane designated for faster traffic is on the left.
* The lane designated for slower traffic is on the right.
* Most freeway exits are on the right.
* Overtaking is permitted to the left, and sometimes to the right.

Countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic have uniform rules about overtaking and lane designation. The convention details (amongst other things) that &quot;Every driver shall keep to the edge of the carriageway appropriate to the direction of traffic&quot;, and the &quot;Drivers overtaking shall do so on the side opposite to that appropriate to the direction of traffic&quot;, notwithstanding the presence or absence of oncoming traffic. Allowed exceptions to these rules include turning or heavy traffic, traffic in lines, or situation in which signs or markings must dictate otherwise. These rules must be more strictly adhered to on roads with oncoming traffic, but still apply on multi-lane and divided highways. Many countries in Europe are party to the Vienna Conventions on traffic and roads. In Australia (which is not a contracting party), traveling in any lane other than the &quot;slow&quot; lane on a road with a speed limit at or above is an offence, unless signage is posted to the contrary or the driver is overtaking.

Many areas in North America do not have any laws about staying to the slowest lanes unless overtaking. In those areas, unlike many parts of Europe, traffic is allowed to overtake on any side, even in a slower lane. This practice is known as &quot;passing on the right&quot; in the United States and &quot;overtaking on the inside&quot; and &quot;undertaking&quot; in the United Kingdom.
When referring to individual lanes on dual carriageways, one does not consider traffic travelling the opposite direction. The inside lane (in the British English sense, i.e. the lane beside the hard shoulder) refers to the lane used for normal travel, while the middle lane is used for overtaking cars on the inside lane. The outside lane (i.e. closest to oncoming traffic) is used for overtaking vehicles in the middle lane. The same principle lies with dual carriageways with more than three lanes.

U.S.-state-specific practices

In some US states (such as Louisiana, Massachusetts and New York), although there are laws requiring all traffic on a public way to use the right-most lane unless overtaking, this rule is often ignored and seldom enforced on multi-lane roadways. Some states, such as Colorado, use a combination of laws and signs restricting speeds or vehicles on certain lanes to emphasize overtaking only on the left lane, and to avoid a psychological condition commonly called road rage.

In California, cars may use any lane on multi-lane roadways. Drivers moving slower than the general flow of traffic are required to stay in the right-most lanes (by California Vehicle Code (CVC) 21654) to keep the way clear for faster vehicles and thus speed up traffic. However, faster drivers may legally pass in the slower lanes if conditions allow (by CVC 21754). But the CVC also requires trucks to stay in the right lane, or in the right two lanes if the roadway has four or more lanes going in their direction. The oldest freeways in California, and some freeway interchanges, often have ramps on the left, making signs like &quot;TRUCKS OK ON LEFT LANE&quot; or &quot;TRUCKS MAY USE ALL LANES&quot; necessary to override the default rule. Lane splitting, or riding motorcycles in the space between cars in traffic, is permitted as long as it is done in a safe and prudent manner.

===One-way roadways===

In order to increase traffic capacity and safety, a route may have two or more separate roads for each direction of traffic. Alternatively, a given road might be declared &quot;one-way&quot;.

====High-speed roads====
In large cities, moving from one part of the city to another by means of ordinary streets and avenues can be time-consuming since traffic is often slowed by at-grade junctions, tight turns, narrow marked lanes and lack of a minimum speed limit. Therefore, it has become common practice for larger cities to build roads for faster through traffic. There are two different types of roads used to provide high-speed access across urban areas:
*The controlled-access highway (&quot;freeway&quot; or &quot;motorway&quot;) is a divided multi-lane highway with fully controlled access and grade-separated intersections (no cross traffic). Some freeways are called &quot;expressways&quot;, &quot;super-highways&quot;, or &quot;turnpikes&quot;, depending on local usage. Access to freeways is fully controlled; entering and leaving the freeway is permitted only at grade-separated interchanges.
*The limited-access road (often called &quot;expressway&quot; in areas where the name does not refer to a freeway or motorway) is a lower-grade type of road with some or many of the characteristics of a controlled-access highway: usually a broad multi-lane avenue, frequently divided, with some grade separation at intersections.

Motor vehicle drivers wishing to travel over great distances within the city will usually take the freeways or expressways in order to minimize travel time. When a crossing road is at the same grade as the freeway, a bridge (or, less often, an underpass) will be built for the crossing road. If the freeway is elevated, the crossing road will pass underneath it.

Minimum speed signs are sometimes posted (although increasingly rare) and usually indicate that any vehicle traveling slower than should indicate a slower speed of travel to other motor vehicles by engaging the vehicle&#x27;s four-way flashing lights. Alternative slower-than-posted speeds may be in effect, based on the posted speed limit of the highway/freeway.

Systems of freeways and expressways are also built to connect distant and regional cities, notable systems include the Interstate highways, the Autobahnen and the Expressway Network of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In more sophisticated systems such as large cities, this concept is further extended: some streets are marked as being &quot;one-way&quot;, and on those streets all traffic must flow in only one direction. Pedestrians on the sidewalks are generally not limited to one-way movement. Drivers wishing to reach a destination they have already passed must return via other streets. One-way streets, despite the inconveniences to some individual drivers, can greatly improve traffic flow since they usually allow traffic to move faster and tend to simplify intersections.

==Congested traffic==

In some places traffic volume is consistently, extremely large, either during periods of time referred to as &quot;rush hour&quot; or perpetually. Exceptionally, traffic upstream of a vehicular collision or an obstruction, such as construction, may also be constrained, resulting in a traffic jam. Such dynamics in relation to traffic congestion is known as traffic flow. Traffic engineers sometimes gauge the quality of traffic flow in terms of level of service.

In measured traffic data, common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion have been found that are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries. Some of these common features distinguish the wide moving jam and synchronized flow phases of congested traffic in Kerner&#x27;s three-phase traffic theory.

===Rush hour===
During business days in most major cities, traffic congestion reaches great intensity at predictable times of the day due to the large number of vehicles using the road at the same time. This phenomenon is called &quot;rush hour&quot; or &quot;peak hour&quot;, although the period of high traffic intensity often exceeds one hour. Since the advent of car radios, radio programming during rush hour is likely to be called drive time.

==Congestion mitigation==
===Rush hour policies===
Some cities adopt policies to reduce rush-hour traffic and pollution and encourage the use of public transportation. For example, in São Paulo, Manila and in Mexico City, each vehicle has a specific day of the week in which it is forbidden from traveling the roads during rush hour. The day for each vehicle is taken from the license plate number, and this rule is enforced by traffic police and also by hundreds of strategically positioned traffic cameras backed by computerized image-recognition systems that issue tickets to offending drivers.

In the United States and Canada, several expressways have a special lane (called an &quot;HOV Lane&quot; – High Occupancy Vehicle Lane) that can only be used by cars carrying two (some locations-three) or more people. Also, many major cities have instituted strict parking prohibitions during rush hour on major arterial streets leading to and from the central business district. During designated weekday hours, vehicles parked on these primary routes are subject to prompt ticketing and towing at owner expense. The purpose of these restrictions is to make available an additional traffic lane in order to maximize available traffic capacity. Additionally, several cities offer a public telephone service where citizens can arrange rides with others depending on where they live and work. The purpose of these policies is to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads and thus reduce rush-hour traffic intensity.

Metered freeways are also a solution for controlling rush hour traffic. In Phoenix, Arizona and Seattle, Washington, among other places, metered on-ramps have been implemented. During rush hour, traffic signals are used with green lights to allow one car per blink of the light to proceed on to the freeway.

Rush hour is typically caused by multiple cars all going to once place at the same time. There is no way to fix the issue because the economy has set times for work, school, and running errands all during the same hours. There is no avoiding this problem because it exists in every major metropolitan area in the world. 

===Pre-emption===
In some areas, emergency responders are provided with specialized equipment, such as a Mobile Infrared Transmitter, which allows emergency response vehicles, particularly fire-fighting apparatus, to have high-priority travel by having the lights along their route change to green. The technology behind these methods has evolved, from panels at the fire department (which could trigger and control green lights for certain major corridors) to optical systems (which the individual fire apparatus can be equipped with to communicate directly with receivers on the signal head). In certain jurisdictions, public transport buses and government-operated winter service vehicles are permitted to use this equipment to extend the length of a green light.

During emergencies where evacuation of a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, in which all lanes of a road lead away from a danger zone regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may also be used to ease traffic congestion during rush hour or at the end of a sports event (where a large number of cars are leaving the venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three outbound to a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect São Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The reversibility of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.

===Intelligent transportation systems===
An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a system of hardware, software, and operators-in-the-loop that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and as the number of vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.

== Aviation ==
In aviation, right-of-way rules are established over the principle that the least maneuverable aircraft takes priority. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations ranks air traffic in the following passage order:
* Any aircraft in distress
* Air balloon
* Glider
* Airship
** An aircraft towing or refueling other aircraft has the right-of-way over all other engine-driven aircraft
* Powered parachute, weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, and rotorcraft
In addition, head-on approaching aircraft shall alter course to the right. An aircraft being overtaken has the right-of-way. A landing aircraft has the right-of-way over other surface-operating aircraft.

<doc id="43084" wikidata="Q62975" url="?curid=43084" title="Sharon Stone">
<text>Sharon Vonne Stone (born March 10, 1958) is an American actress and film producer. Known for primarily playing femmes fatales and women of mystery on film and television, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1990s. She is the recipient of various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a nomination for an Academy Award. She was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France in 2005 (Commander in 2021).

After modeling in television commercials and print advertisements, Stone made her film debut as an extra in &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980) and played her first speaking part in the horror film &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; (1981). In the 1980s, she appeared in such films as &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; (1984), &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1985), &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1985), and &quot;Above the Law&quot; (1988). She had a breakthrough with her part in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), before rising to international recognition when she portrayed Catherine Tramell in Verhoeven&#x27;s erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992), for which she earned her first Golden Globe Award nomination.

Stone&#x27;s performance as a trophy wife in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Casino&quot; (1995) earned her a Golden Globe Award along with a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her other notable films include &quot;Sliver&quot; (1993), &quot;The Specialist&quot; (1994), &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995), &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004), &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005), &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;Fading Gigolo&quot; (2013), &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot; (2017), &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Laundromat&quot; (2019).

On television, Stone has featured in the ABC miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1987), the HBO television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; (2000), Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Mosaic&quot; (2017) and Ryan Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Ratched&quot; (2020). She made guest appearances in &quot;The Practice&quot; (2004) and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2010), winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for the former.

==Early life==
Sharon Vonne Stone was born on March 10, 1958, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, to Dorothy Marie (née Lawson), an accountant, and Joseph William Stone II, a tool and die manufacturer and former factory worker. She has three siblings: Michael, Kelly, and Patrick Joseph (died in 2023). She has some Irish ancestry. In a 2013 interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien, she stated that her Irish ancestors arrived in the United States during the Great Famine. She has a reported IQ of 154. Stone was considered academically gifted as a child and entered the second grade when she was five years old. Stone said that she and her sister were both sexually abused as children by their maternal grandfather, in an interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in March 2021, while promoting her memoir &quot;The Beauty of Living Twice&quot;. At 14, her neck was badly injured while breaking a horse when the animal bucked as it charged toward a washing line.

She graduated from Saegertown High School in Saegertown, Pennsylvania, in 1975. Stone was admitted to Edinboro State College on a creative writing scholarship at age 15, but quit college and moved to New York City to become a fashion model. Inspired by Hillary Clinton, in 2016 Stone went back to Edinboro University of Pennsylvania to complete her degree.

==Career==
===Modeling and early screen appearances (1976–1989)===
While attending Edinboro State College, Stone won the title of Miss Crawford County, Pennsylvania, and in 1976, was a candidate for Miss Pennsylvania. One of the pageant judges told her to quit college and move to New York City to become a fashion model. Stone left Meadville and moved in with an aunt in New Jersey, and by 1977, she had been signed by Ford Modeling Agency in New York City. She soon moved to Europe, living for a year in Milan and then in Paris. While living there, she decided to quit modeling and pursue acting. &quot;So I packed my bags, moved back to New York, and stood in line to be an extra in a Woody Allen movie&quot;, she later recalled. At 20, Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980) and had a speaking part a year later in the horror film &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; (1981).

French director Claude Lelouch cast Stone in the musical epic &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot; (1982), starring James Caan, but she was on screen for two minutes and did not appear in the credits. She secured guest-spots on the television series &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; (1982), &quot;Bay City Blues&quot; (1983), &quot;Remington Steele&quot; (1983), &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1984), and &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; (1985); played a starlet who breaks up the marriage of a successful director and his screenwriter wife in the drama &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; (1984), opposite Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Shelley Long and a young Drew Barrymore; and starred as a resourceful woman teaming up with a fortune hunter (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the action-centered &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1985) and &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot; (1986), a light, comedic take on the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series, which were poorly received by critics and audiences. In his review for &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered that Stone was &quot;up to date as a spunky, sexy, smart-talking heroine with an effective right hook&quot; but felt that the story was &quot;lost in the effects&quot;. For her performance in &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot;, she received her first Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress.

Stone obtained the role of Janice Henry in the ABC miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1987), the sequel to the 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, based on the 1978 novel of the same name written by Herman Wouk. Through the remainder of the 1980s, she appeared as a reporter in the comedy &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; (1987), an attractive but mysterious woman with a hidden agenda in the thriller &quot;Cold Steel&quot; (1987), the wife of an ex-CIA agent in the crime film &quot;Above the Law&quot; (1988) and the ill-fated wife of a successful businessman in the action film &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1988).

===Breakthrough and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1990–1992)===

In Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), a science fiction action film opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stone played the seemingly loving wife of a construction worker. The film received favorable reviews and made $261.2 million worldwide, giving Stone&#x27;s career a major boost, leading to her being cast in five feature films released throughout 1991. She played what Roger Ebert described as the &quot;bad girl&quot; in the romantic comedy &quot;He Said, She Said&quot;, a sexually repressed woman in the psychological thriller &quot;Scissors&quot;, a wealthy blonde in the crime drama &quot;Diary of a Hitman&quot;, a provocative young photojournalist in the thriller &quot;Year of the Gun&quot; and the agent and former lover of a writer in the neo-noir &quot;Where Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot;.

In another Verhoeven film, the erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992), she took on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant bisexual and alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. 
Critical response towards &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; was mixed, but Stone received critical acclaim for her &quot;star-making performance&quot;; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;Verhoeven&#x27;s cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen,&quot; and observed of the actress&#x27; portrayal: &quot;Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Ah-nold in Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Total Recall&quot;. But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (&quot;He Said, She Said&quot;; &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot;) stalled her career. Though &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; establishes Stone as a bombshell for the 1990s, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb.&quot; Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called the film &quot;one of the best films of the early 1990s, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone – in her star-making performance – is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold.&quot; For the part, Stone earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, four MTV Movie Awards nominations, and a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst New Star for her &quot;tribute to Theodore Cleaver&quot;. The film also became one of the most financially successful productions of the 1990s, grossing US$352.9 million worldwide.

===Leading lady status (1993–1999)===
In 1993, Stone played a femme fatale in the erotic thriller &quot;Sliver&quot;, based on Ira Levin&#x27;s eponymous novel about the mysterious occurrences in a privately owned New York City high-rise apartment building. The film was heavily panned by critics and earned Stone a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress but became a commercial success, grossing US$116.3 million at the international box office. She also made a cameo appearance in the action film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993), reuniting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1994, Stone appeared as the wife of an architect opposite Richard Gere in the drama &quot;Intersection&quot;, and as a woman who entices a bomb expert she is involved with into destroying the criminal gang that killed her family, alongside Sylvester Stallone, in the action thriller &quot;The Specialist&quot;. While &quot;Intersection&quot; found limited success, &quot;The Specialist&quot; made US$170.3 million worldwide. For her work in both films, she won a Golden Raspberry Award and a Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Actress, but was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Most Desirable Female for &quot;The Specialist&quot;.

In &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995), Stone took on the role of a gunfighter who returns to a frontier town in an effort to avenge her father&#x27;s death. She served as a producer on the film and had some creative control over the production; she chose director Sam Raimi, after being impressed by his work on &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, and co-star Russell Crowe after watching &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;. She paid Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s salary herself after a reluctance from Sony, the film&#x27;s studio, over his casting. &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; was a modest profit and earned Stone a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Stone starred opposite Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s epic crime drama &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), where she took on the role of Ginger McKenna, the scheming, self-absorbed wife of a top gambling handicapper (De Niro). The film, based on the non-fiction book &quot;&quot; by Nicholas Pileggi, received widespread critical acclaim, made US$116.1 million globally, and earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. During an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, published on January 28, 1996, Stone said of the response: &quot;Thank God. I mean just finally, wow [...] I am not getting any younger. It couldn&#x27;t have happened at a better time&quot;. That year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd, and was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.

Stone portrayed the mistress of a cruel school master in the psychological thriller &quot;Diabolique&quot; (1996), a woman waiting on death row for a brutal double murder in the drama &quot;Last Dance&quot; (1996), and a biologist in the suspense film &quot;Sphere&quot; (1998). The three aforementioned films were panned by critics and failed to find an audience in theaters. In 1998, Stone also lent her voice for the successful animated film &quot;Antz&quot;, and played the mother of a 13-year-old boy suffering from Morquio syndrome in the drama &quot;The Mighty&quot;, which garnered a positive critical response. Stone was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the lattermost.

Her turn as a street-wise, middle-aged moll in &quot;Gloria&quot; (1999), a remake of the 1980 film of the same name, proved to be a critical and commercial misfire. A titular role followed in 1999 with the comedy &quot;The Muse&quot;, playing the inspiration of an esteemed screenwriter. Wade Major, a critic for &quot;Boxoffice&quot;, found her portrayal of a &quot;dizzy Muse&quot; to be &quot;the film&#x27;s most delightful surprise&quot;, but most reviews were ultimately lukewarm. Helmut Voss, then president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which gave the annual Golden Globe Awards, ordered all 82 of its members to return gift luxury watches sent by either Stone or October Films (now merged into Focus Features) as these were considered to be promotions for a nomination for Stone&#x27;s performance in the film. She ultimately received the nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical.

===Hiatus and downturn (2000–2004)===

In 2000, Stone played a lesbian trying to start a family, opposite Ellen DeGeneres, in the HBO television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; and starred as an exotic dancer, alongside Billy Connolly, in the comedy &quot;Beautiful Joe&quot;. While she was recognized by Women in Film with her second Lucy Award for her performance in &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Jo&quot; premiered on cable television instead of receiving a theatrical release in North America. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, who had been critical of Stone&#x27;s previous films, wrote that &quot;nothing she&#x27;s done has been quite as shameless or appalling as &quot;Beautiful Joe&quot;, a toxic piece of whimsy that ranks among the worst films of 2000&quot;.

Following her September 2001 hospitalization for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, Stone took a hiatus from screen acting. She faced professional challenges as she was in the process of recovery. She felt that she had &quot;lost [her] place&quot; in Hollywood, and during a 2015 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, she remarked: &quot;[When] you find yourself at the back of the line in your business, as I did, [you] have to figure yourself out all over again.&quot; She returned to the screen in 2003, when she took on a three-episode arc as Sheila Carlisle, an attorney who believes she can communicate with God, in the eighth season of &quot;The Practice&quot;. For her performance, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

Stone attempted a return to the mainstream with roles in the films &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot; (2003), with Dennis Quaid, and &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004), with Halle Berry. In the mystery psychological thriller &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot;, she and Quaid played a couple terrorized by the former owner of the rural estate they bought in foreclosure. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine remarked in its review for the film that both actors &quot;fish in vain to find any angles to play in their dimension-free characters&quot;. The superhero film &quot;Catwoman&quot; saw her play the age-obsessed CEO of a cosmetic company and the story&#x27;s antagonist. While both films flopped at the box office, &quot;Catwoman&quot; is considered by many critics to be one of the worst movies of all time.

===Independent films and ensemble dramas (2005–2017)===
Her next film release was Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005), in which Stone took on the role of a grasping and overly eager closet organizer who re-connects with a former womanizer (played by Bill Murray). Unlike her previous few film outings, &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; was met with critical acclaim, upon its premiere at Cannes, where it was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or and won the Grand Prix. &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; ranked Stone&#x27;s role among one of her &quot;10 best performances&quot;, while &quot;New York Magazine&quot; remarked: &quot;Sharon Stone, playing a widow who&#x27;s half-hippie, half-working-class-tough, demonstrates that, given the right part, she&#x27;s still not merely sexy but knockabout funny and sly&quot;. In 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France.

After years of litigation, &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone&#x27;s dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more while they wanted less. Stone told an interviewer, &quot;We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn&#x27;t that be great?&quot;. Despite an estimated budget of US$70 million, &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; placed only tenth in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$3.2 million and finished with a total domestic gross of under US$6 million. Stone appeared in Nick Cassavetes&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006), opposite Bruce Willis, playing Olivia Mazursky, the mother of a real-life murder victim; she wore a fatsuit for the role. The film premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. She made part of an ensemble cast in Emilio Estevez&#x27;s drama &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006), about the hours leading up to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Stone received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Lindsay Lohan. As a member of the cast, she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, but won in the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast.

Stone took on the role of a clinically depressed woman in the independent drama &quot;When a Man Falls in the Forest&quot; (2007), which premiered in competition at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. All of her late 2000s films —&quot;If I Had Known I Was a Genius&quot; (2007), &quot;The Year of Getting to Know Us&quot; (2008), &quot;Five Dollars a Day&quot; (2009) and &quot;Streets of Blood&quot; (2009)— were direct-to-DVD releases in North America. In 2010, Stone made guest-appearances in four episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, portraying Jo Marlowe, a former cop turned prosecutor. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included in a review such descriptions of her performance as a &quot;great presence&quot;, and having &quot;had to revive her best [...] tone to sell hokey lines&quot; in a series it described as &quot;mawkish and overwrought&quot;. She took on the leading female role in the French action sequel &quot;Largo Winch II&quot; as a United Nations investigator named Diane Francken. Her first theatrical-released production since 2007, the film premiered on February 16, 2011, in France, where it opened in second place at the box office. She next starred as a hard-hitting journalist in the thriller &quot;Border Run&quot; (2012), which received a direct-to-DVD release.

In 2013, Stone played the mother of porn actress Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) in the biographical drama &quot;Lovelace&quot;, and a dermatologist seeking a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; in the Woody Allen–John Turturro comedy &quot;Fading Gigolo&quot;. Both films were released in limited theaters to a decent critical reception; Glenn Kenny, in his review for &quot;Fading Gigolo&quot;, found Stone to be &quot;splendidly understated&quot; in what he described as &quot;a New York story through and through [...] often funny, sometimes moving, occasionally goofy as hell&quot;. In 2014, she starred as an actress-turned-publisher, opposite Riccardo Scamarcio, in the Italian dramedy &quot;A Golden Boy&quot; (&quot;Un ragazzo d&#x27;oro&quot;), directed by Pupi Avati, and portrayed America&#x27;s first female Vice President in the TNT action drama series &quot;Agent X&quot;, which only aired for one season. Stone next played an adoptive mother in the drama &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot; (2016), a &quot;lineman widow&quot; and the &quot;alcoholic mom&quot; of a high-wire worker in the action film &quot;Life on the Line&quot; (2016), and a greedy billionaire in the drama &quot;Running Wild&quot; (2017). These three films all received a VOD release, to varying responses. James Franco&#x27;s biographical comedy &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot; (2017), which featured Stone as Iris Burton, the agent of actor Greg Sestero, was a critical and commercial success, and was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017.

===Film and television balance (2018–present)===
Stone returned to television in 2018, when she portrayed a murdered children&#x27;s book author and illustrator in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s HBO mystery production &quot;Mosaic&quot;, which was released as an iOS/Android mobile app serving as an interactive film and as a television drama. She received positive reviews for her performance. Maureen Ryan of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that the actress &quot;displays terrific range and depth&quot; and &quot;holds the screen with effortless charisma&quot;, and Nick Schager of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote that &quot;Stone&#x27;s turn is something close to masterful.&quot; She earned the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.

In &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese&quot; (2019), a pseudo-documentary film covering Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue concert tour, Stone played an exaggerated version of herself. The film was released on Netflix, to critical acclaim. Owen Gleiberman described her appearance as a &quot;marketing hook&quot; and further stated: &quot;The presence of Sharon Stone embodies the spirit of [the Hollywood] machine. She has always been a good actress (probably better than many know; just watch her in &quot;Casino&quot;), but her fame will forever rest on a certain crudely riveting but debased high-budget exploitation thriller&quot;. She reunited with Soderbergh for &quot;The Laundromat&quot; (2019), in which she played a harried realtor, opposite Meryl Streep.

In Netflix&#x27;s psychological thriller series &quot;Ratched&quot; (2020), a prequel to Miloš Forman&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; developed by Ryan Murphy, Stone portrayed a wealthy heiress who hires a hit man to kill a doctor for disfiguring her son. Intrigued by Murphy&#x27;s pitch for her character, which he wrote for her, Stone described the part as &quot;completely insane. And at the same time she thinks she&#x27;s really a loving mother who has her shit together&quot;. The series garnered a decent critical response and was viewed by 48 million people in its first four weeks of release. In 2020 Stone appeared as herself in an introduction to the fifth episode of The New Pope, where she had an audience with John Malkovich as Pope John Paul III.

In 2021, she also appeared as herself in the dramedy &quot;Here Today&quot;, directed by Billy Crystal, and was cast in the romantic drama &quot;Beauty&quot;, directed by Andrew Dosunmu for Netflix.

===In media and fashion===
For her leading roles in erotic and adult-themed feature films such as &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, and &quot;The Specialist&quot;, Stone cemented what was described as a &quot;tough-talking, no-underwear, voyeuristic, cool-as-ice, sex symbol&quot; status during the 1990s. She has appeared on the covers and pictorials of over 300 celebrity and fashion magazines throughout her four-decade acting career. She graced the June–July 1986 cover of French &quot;Vogue&quot;, and to coincide with the release of &quot;Total Recall&quot;, she posed nude for the July 1990 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, flaunting the muscles she had developed in preparation for the film. Following &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of Stone, Sherilyn Fenn, Julian Sands, Raquel Welch, Eric Roberts, and Sean Penn. Stone, who was Hurrell&#x27;s reportedly last sitting before his death in 1992, is also a collector of the photographer&#x27;s original prints and wrote the foreword to the book &quot;Hurrell&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. In 1993, she appeared in Pirelli&#x27;s commercial, &quot;Driving Instinct&quot;, in 2005, became the face of Dior&#x27;s Capture skincare line, and in 2016, starred with Paul Sculfor in Airfield&#x27;s (de) &quot;Fashion Is a Lovestory&quot; short film.

Stone&#x27;s public and professional profiles have been strongly tied to her appearance and sex appeal. She has ranked among the &quot;50 most beautiful people in the world&quot; by &quot;People&quot; in 1992, the &quot;100 sexiest stars in film history&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot; in 1995 and 1997, and the &quot;25 sexiest stars of the century&quot; by &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1999. She has also been the subject of four television documentary specials, and several biographies have been written about her.
 On her sex symbol image, Stone told Oprah Winfrey on &quot;Oprah Prime&quot; in 2014: &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure for me now. I mean, I&#x27;m gonna be 56 years old. If people want to think I&#x27;m a sex symbol, it&#x27;s, like, yeah. Think it up. You know. I mean, like, good for me&quot;. She posed nude for the September 2015 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, in which she stated: &quot;At a certain point you start asking yourself, &#x27;What really is sexy?&#x27; It&#x27;s not just the elevation of your boobs. It&#x27;s being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that&#x27;s with you&quot;.

===Criticism===

On January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1 million in five minutes for mosquito nets in Tanzania, turning a panel on African poverty into an impromptu fundraiser at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Many observers, including UNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences, and methods of preventing malaria. Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000. This diverted funds from other UNICEF projects. According to prominent economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets. Some were delivered to the local airport. These reportedly were stolen and later resurfaced as wedding dresses on the local black market.

Stone was criticized over her comments in an exchange on the red carpet with Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Cable Entertainment News&quot; during the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 25, 2008. When asked about the 2008 Sichuan earthquake she remarked:

One of China&#x27;s biggest cinema chains reacted to Stone&#x27;s comments by declaring it would not show her films in its theaters. The founder of the UME Cineplex chain and the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, Ng See-yuen, called Stone&#x27;s comments &quot;inappropriate&quot;, and said the UME Cineplex chain would no longer present her films. Dior advertisements featuring Stone&#x27;s image were dropped from all ads in China amid the public uproar. Stone was removed from the 2008 Shanghai International Film Festival guest list, and the event&#x27;s organizers considered banning the actress permanently. Dior China had originally posted an apology in Stone&#x27;s name, but Stone later denied making the apology during an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not going to apologize. I&#x27;m certainly not going to apologize for something that isn&#x27;t real and true – not for face creams,&quot; although she did admit that she had &quot;sounded like an idiot.&quot; However, after the interview, Stone released a statement entitled &quot;In my own words by Sharon Stone&quot; in which she said &quot;I could not be more regretful of that mistake. It was unintentional. I apologize. Those words were never meant to be hurtful to anyone.&quot; While Stone cited the Dalai Lama as her &quot;good friend&quot; when she made the remark at the Cannes film festival, the Dalai Lama has reportedly distanced himself by saying of her only, &quot;yes, I&#x27;ve met that lady&quot;.

==Personal life==

Stone is a Tibetan Buddhist, having been converted to Buddhism when Richard Gere introduced her to the Dalai Lama. She has said she believes in God. On September 29, 2001, Stone was hospitalized for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was diagnosed as a vertebral artery dissection rather than the more common ruptured aneurysm, and treated with an endovascular coil embolization. She has stated while she was sick people took advantage of her and stole $18 million from her. She nearly went broke.

===Relationships and family===
In 1984, she met television producer Michael Greenburg on the set of &quot;The Vegas Strip War&quot;, a television film he produced and she starred in. They married the same year. In 1986, Greenburg was her line producer on &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot;. The couple separated three years later, and their divorce was finalized in 1990.

Stone and comedian Garry Shandling were students of acting coach Roy London and dated briefly. She appeared on his show &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; in the episode &quot;The Mr. Sharon Stone Show&quot;. They remained close friends until Shandling&#x27;s death in 2016. In the documentary &quot;Special Thanks to Roy London&quot;, interviews with Stone and Shandling discuss their relationship.

In 1993, Stone met William J. MacDonald on the set of the film &quot;Sliver&quot;, which he co-produced. MacDonald left his wife Naomi Baka for Stone and became engaged to her. They separated one year later in 1994. After they separated, Stone returned the engagement ring via FedEx. While working on the film &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; in 1994, Stone met Bob Wagner, a first assistant director, and they became engaged.

On February 14, 1998, Stone married Phil Bronstein, executive editor of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; and later &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Stone suffered several miscarriages due to an autoimmune disease and endometriosis and was unable to have biological children. They adopted a son, Roan Joseph Bronstein, in 2000. Bronstein filed for divorce in 2003, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became final in 2004, with a judge ruling that Roan would remain primarily with Bronstein and Stone would have visitation rights.

Stone adopted her second son, Laird Vonne, in 2005 and her third son, Quinn Kelly Stone, in 2006. As of 2018, Stone resides with her three sons in West Hollywood, California, in a home once owned by the actor Montgomery Clift.

===Activism===
In March 2006, Stone traveled to Israel to promote peace in the Middle East through a press conference with Nobel Peace Prize winner and former prime minister of Israel Shimon Peres. In 2013, she referred to Peres, who was then serving as the president of Israel, as her &quot;mentor&quot;. On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work for people with HIV/AIDS.

In 2015, Stone was guest of honor at the Pilosio Building Peace Award in Milan. She began an impromptu auction on stage in front of a crowd of CEOs from the construction industry and other dignitaries. She gained enough pledges to build 28 schools in Africa.

==Selected filmography and accolades==

In a career spanning over four decades, Stone has had over one hundred acting credits in film and on television. She has won 10 awards from 41 nominations, including one Golden Globe Award (for &quot;Casino&quot;), one Primetime Emmy Award (for &quot;The Practice&quot;), and two MTV Movie Awards (for &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;). Her top-billing roles and most notable films include:

In December 2024, Sharon Stone was included on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Women&quot; list.

<text>Rutile is an oxide mineral composed of titanium dioxide (TiO2), the most common natural form of TiO2. Rarer polymorphs of TiO2 are known, including anatase, akaogiite, and brookite.

Rutile has one of the highest refractive indices at visible wavelengths of any known crystal and also exhibits a particularly large birefringence and high dispersion. Owing to these properties, it is useful for the manufacture of certain optical elements, especially polarization optics, for longer visible and infrared wavelengths up to about 4.5 micrometres. Natural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum.

Rutile derives its name from the Latin (&#x27;red&#x27;), in reference to the deep red color observed in some specimens when viewed by transmitted light. Rutile was first described in 1803 by Abraham Gottlob Werner using specimens obtained in Horcajuelo de la Sierra, Madrid (Spain), which is consequently the type locality.

==Occurrence==

Rutile is a common accessory mineral in high-temperature and high-pressure metamorphic rocks and in igneous rocks.

Thermodynamically, rutile is the most stable polymorph of TiO2 at all temperatures, exhibiting lower total free energy than metastable phases of anatase or brookite. Consequently, the transformation of the metastable TiO2 polymorphs to rutile is irreversible. As it has the lowest molecular volume of the three main polymorphs, it is generally the primary titanium-bearing phase in most high-pressure metamorphic rocks, chiefly eclogites.
Within the igneous environment, rutile is a common accessory mineral in plutonic igneous rocks, though it is also found occasionally in extrusive igneous rocks, particularly those such as kimberlites and lamproites that have deep mantle sources. Anatase and brookite are found in the igneous environment, particularly as products of autogenic alteration during the cooling of plutonic rocks; anatase is also found in placer deposits sourced from primary rutile.

The occurrence of large specimen crystals is most common in pegmatites, skarns, and granite greisens. Rutile is found as an accessory mineral in some altered igneous rocks, and in certain gneisses and schists. In groups of acicular crystals it is frequently seen penetrating quartz as in the from Graubünden, Switzerland. In 2005 the Republic of Sierra Leone in West Africa had a production capacity of 23% of the world&#x27;s annual rutile supply, which rose to approximately 30% in 2008.

==Crystal structure==
The structure of rutile is so classic that it is discussed in textbooks as a reference motif, much like sodium chloride and nickel arsenide. The structure is adopted by not only TiO2, but also by GeO2, RuO2, SnO2, MnO2, VO2, IrO2, and CrO2. Somewhat curiously, ZrO2 and HfO2 adopt another classical structural motif, the fluorite structure.

In the rutile motif, the metal &quot;cations&quot; have a coordination number of 6, meaning they are surrounded by an octahedron of 6 oxygen atoms. The oxygen anions have a coordination number of 3, in a trigonal planar coordination. Rutile also shows a screw axis when its octahedra are viewed sequentially. When formed under reducing conditions, oxygen vacancies can occur, coupled to Ti3+ centers. Hydrogen can enter these gaps, existing as an individual vacancy occupant (pairing as a hydrogen ion) or creating a hydroxide group with an adjacent oxygen.

Rutile crystals are most commonly observed to exhibit a prismatic or acicular growth habit with preferential orientation along their &quot;c&quot; axis, the [001] direction. This growth habit is favored as the {110} facets of rutile exhibit the lowest surface free energy and are therefore thermodynamically most stable. The &quot;c&quot;-axis oriented growth of rutile appears clearly in nanorods, nanowires and abnormal grain growth phenomena of this phase.

==Application==

In large enough quantities in beach sands, rutile forms an important constituent of heavy minerals and ore deposits. Miners extract and separate the valuable minerals – e.g., rutile, zircon, and ilmenite. The main uses for rutile are the manufacture of refractory ceramic, as a pigment, and for the production of titanium metal.

Finely powdered rutile is a brilliant white pigment and is used in paints, plastics, paper, foods, and other applications that call for a bright white color. Titanium dioxide pigment is the single greatest use of titanium worldwide. Nanoscale particles of rutile are transparent to visible light but are highly effective in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (sunscreen). The UV absorption of nano-sized rutile particles is blue-shifted compared to bulk rutile so that higher-energy UV light is absorbed by the nanoparticles. Hence, they are used in sunscreens to protect against UV-induced skin damage.

Small rutile needles present in gems are responsible for an optical phenomenon known as asterism. Asteriated gems are known as &quot;star&quot; gems. Star sapphires, star rubies, and other star gems are highly sought after and are generally more valuable than their normal counterparts.

Rutile is widely used as a welding electrode covering. It is also used as a part of the ZTR index, which classifies highly weathered sediments.

=== Semiconductor ===
Rutile, as a large band-gap semiconductor, has in recent decades been the subject of significant research towards applications as a functional oxide for applications in photocatalysis and dilute magnetism. Research efforts typically utilize small quantities of synthetic rutile rather than mineral-deposit derived materials.

==Synthetic rutile==
Synthetic rutile was first produced in 1948 and is sold under a variety of names. It can be produced from the titanium ore ilmenite through the Becher process. Very pure synthetic rutile is transparent and almost colorless, being slightly yellow, in large pieces. Synthetic rutile can be made in a variety of colors by doping. The high refractive index gives an adamantine luster and strong refraction that leads to a diamond-like appearance. The near-colorless diamond substitute is sold as &quot;Titania&quot;, which is the old-fashioned chemical name for this oxide. However, rutile is seldom used in jewellery because it is not very hard (scratch-resistant), measuring only about 6 on the Mohs hardness scale.

As the result of growing research interest in the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide, in both anatase and rutile phases (as well as biphasic mixtures of the two phases), rutile TiO2 in powder and thin film form is frequently fabricated in laboratory conditions through solution based routes using inorganic precursors (typically TiCl4) or organometallic precursors (typically alkoxides such as titanium isopropoxide, also known as TTIP). Depending on synthesis conditions, the first phase to crystallize may be the metastable anatase phase, which can then be converted to the equilibrium rutile phase through thermal treatment. The physical properties of rutile are often modified using dopants to impart improved photocatalytic activity through improved photo-generated charge carrier separation, altered electronic band structures and improved surface reactivity.

<text>Project Mogul (sometimes referred to as Operation Mogul) was a top secret project by the US Army Air Forces involving microphones flown on high-altitude balloons, whose primary purpose was long-distance detection of sound waves generated by Soviet atomic bomb tests. 

While successful, the balloon method was soon superseded by seismic detectors. In popular culture, the legacy of Project Mogul has been the Roswell incident, in which a crashed Mogul balloon was mistaken for an extraterrestrial spacecraft, giving rise to a persistent UFO legend.

== Project history ==
The project was carried out from 1947 until early 1949. It was a classified portion of an unclassified project by New York University (NYU) atmospheric researchers. The project was moderately successful, but was very expensive and was superseded by a network of seismic detectors and air sampling for fallout, which were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to deploy and operate.

Project Mogul was conceived by Maurice Ewing who had earlier researched the deep sound channel in the oceans and theorized that a similar sound channel existed in the upper atmosphere: a certain height where the air pressure and temperature result in minimal speed of sound, so that sound waves would propagate and stay in that channel due to refraction. The project involved arrays of balloons carrying disc microphones and radio transmitters to relay the signals to the ground. It was supervised by James Peoples, who was assisted by Albert P. Crary.

One of the requirements of the balloons was that they maintain a relatively constant altitude over a prolonged period of time. Thus instrumentation had to be developed to maintain such constant altitudes, such as pressure sensors controlling the release of ballast.

The early Mogul balloons consisted of large clusters of rubber meteorological balloons, however, these were quickly replaced by enormous balloons made of polyethylene plastic. These were more durable, leaked less helium, and also were better at maintaining a constant altitude than the early rubber balloons. Constant-altitude-control and polyethylene balloons were the two major innovations of Project Mogul.

==Subsequent programs==

Project Mogul was the forerunner of the Skyhook balloon program, which started in the late 1940s, as well as two other espionage programs involving balloon overflights and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Union during the 1950s, Project Moby Dick and Project Genetrix. The spy balloon overflights raised storms of protest from the Soviets. The constant-altitude balloons also were used for scientific purposes such as cosmic ray experiments. 

Further development of nuclear detonation detection systems was extensive for decades afterward, culminating in worldwide systems by various countries to keep eyes and ears on detecting and verifying the others&#x27; nuclear weapon developments. 

There would also be fixed-wing United States aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. Overflights would end in 1960 once an aircraft had been shot down by SAMs. Reconnaissance would for decades afterward be handled mostly by reconnaissance satellites and to some extent by aircraft, such as the A-12 OXCART and SR-71 Blackbird (photography and radar) and RC-135U and similar aircraft (SIGINT including ELINT and COMINT).

==Roswell incident==


In 1947, a Project Mogul balloon &quot;NYU Flight 4&quot;, launched June 4, crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. The subsequent military cover-up of the true nature of the balloon and burgeoning conspiracy theories from UFO enthusiasts led to a celebrated &quot;UFO&quot; incident.

Unlike a weather balloon, the Project Mogul paraphernalia were massive and contained unusual types of materials, according to research conducted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;...squadrons of big balloons ... It was like having an elephant in your backyard and hoping that no one would notice it. ... To the untrained eye, the reflectors looked extremely odd, a geometrical hash of lightweight sticks and sharp angles made of metal foil. .. photographs of it, taken in 1947 and published in newspapers, show bits and pieces of what are obviously collapsed balloons and radar reflectors.&quot;

==Legacy==
Implementation of Mogul&#x27;s experimental infrasound detection of nuclear tests exist today in ground-based detectors, part of so-called Geophysical MASINT (measurement and signal intelligence). In 2013, this world-wide network of sound detectors picked up the large explosion of the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia. The strength of the sound waves was used to estimate the size of the explosion.

<text>Lawrence Peter &quot;Yogi&quot; Berra (born Lorenzo Pietro Berra; May 12, 1925 – September 22, 2015) was an American professional baseball catcher who later took on the roles of manager and coach. He played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) (1946–1963, 1965), all but the last for the New York Yankees. He was an 18-time All-Star and won 10 World Series championships as a player—more than any other player in MLB history. Berra had a career batting average of .285, while hitting 358 home runs and 1,430 runs batted in. He is one of only six players to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award three times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest catchers in baseball history and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.

Berra was born in St. Louis, in an Italian community, and signed with the Yankees in 1943 before serving in the United States Navy as a gunner&#x27;s mate in the Normandy landings during World War II. He made his major-league debut at age 21 in 1946 and was a mainstay in the Yankees&#x27; lineup during the team&#x27;s championship years beginning in 1949 and continuing through 1962. Berra was a power hitter and strong defensive catcher, despite being shorter than most in the league at tall. Berra played 18 seasons with the Yankees before retiring after the 1963 season. He spent the next year as their manager, then joined the New York Mets in 1965 as coach (and briefly a player again). Berra remained with the Mets for the next decade, serving the last four years as their manager. He returned to the Yankees in 1976, coaching them for eight seasons and managing for two, before coaching the Houston Astros. Berra appeared as a player, coach or manager in 13 of 15 World Series that New York baseball teams won from 1947 through 1981. Overall, he played or coached in 21 World Series, 13 on the winning side. Berra caught Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in game five of the 1956 World Series. He also holds the all-time record for shutouts caught with 173.

The Yankees retired his uniform number 8 in 1972; Bill Dickey had previously worn number 8, and both catchers had that number retired by the Yankees. The club honored him with a plaque in Monument Park in 1988. Berra was named to the MLB All-Century Team in a vote by fans in 1999. For the remainder of his life, he was closely involved with the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which he opened on the campus of Montclair State University in 1998. Berra quit school after the eighth grade. He was known for his malapropisms as well as pithy and paradoxical statements, such as &quot;It ain&#x27;t over &#x27;til it&#x27;s over&quot; and &quot;I really didn&#x27;t say everything I said.&quot;

==Early life==
Berra was born as Lorenzo Pietro Berra in a primarily Italian neighborhood of St. Louis called The Hill on May 12, 1925. His parents were Italian immigrants Pietro and Paolina () Berra. Pietro was originally from Malvaglio near Milan; he arrived at Ellis Island on October 18, 1909, at the age of 23. In a 2005 interview for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Berra said, &quot;My father came over first. He came from the old country. And he didn&#x27;t know what baseball was. He was ready to go to work. And then I had three other brothers and a sister. My brother and my mother came over later on. My two oldest brothers, they were born there—Mike and Tony. John and I and my sister Josie were born in St. Louis.&quot;

Berra&#x27;s parents originally gave him the nickname &quot;Lawdie&quot;, which was derived from his mother&#x27;s difficulty pronouncing &quot;Lawrence&quot; or &quot;Larry&quot; correctly. He grew up on Elizabeth Avenue, across the street from boyhood friend and later competitor Joe Garagiola. That block was also home to Jack Buck early in his Cardinals broadcasting career, and it was later renamed &quot;Hall of Fame Place&quot;. Berra was a Catholic, and he attended South Side Catholic, now called St. Mary&#x27;s High School, in south St. Louis with Garagiola. Berra left school after the eighth grade due to a desire to work and assist the family’s finances. He has been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

He began playing baseball in local American Legion Baseball leagues, where he learned the basics of catching while playing both outfield and infield positions. While playing in American Legion Baseball, he received the nickname &quot;Yogi&quot; from his friend Jack Maguire, who, after seeing a newsreel about India, said that he resembled a yogi from India whenever he sat around with arms and legs crossed waiting to bat or while looking sad after a losing game.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
In 1942, the St. Louis Cardinals overlooked Berra in favor of his boyhood best friend, Joe Garagiola. On the surface, the Cardinals seemed to think that Garagiola was the superior prospect, but team president Branch Rickey actually had an ulterior motive. Rickey already knew that he was going to leave St. Louis to take over the operation of the Brooklyn Dodgers and was more impressed with Berra than he let on; he apparently had planned to hold Berra off until he could sign him for the Dodgers. However, the Yankees signed Berra for the same $500 bonus ($ in current dollar terms) the Cardinals offered Garagiola before Rickey could sign Berra to the Dodgers. Berra played for the Norfolk Tars in 1943.

====World War II and subsequent return to baseball====
Berra joined the United States Navy in 1943, and served as a gunner&#x27;s mate on the attack transport during the Normandy landings. A Second Class Seaman, Berra was one of a six-man crew on a Navy rocket boat, firing machine guns and launching rockets at the German defenses on Omaha Beach. He was wounded and awarded a Purple Heart medal. During an interview on the 65th Anniversary of D-Day, Berra confirmed that he was sent to Utah Beach during the D-Day invasion as well. His military records were burned in the St. Louis Archives fire in 1973.

Following Operation Dragoon, he was sent to Tunisia before returning to the United States in January 1945 and being stationed at Naval Submarine Base New London. While there, he played for the base&#x27;s semi-pro baseball team. He also bribed guards to allow him to sneak off base and play for the Cranston, Rhode Island, Chiefs for $50 a game under an assumed name, as he was already signed with the Yankees. He was honorably discharged in May 1946.

Following his military service, Berra played minor-league baseball with the Newark Bears, surprising the team&#x27;s manager with his talent despite his short stature. He was mentored by Hall of Famer Bill Dickey, whose uniform number Berra took. He later said, &quot;I owe everything I did in baseball to Bill Dickey.&quot;

===Major leagues===

Berra was called up to the Yankees and played his first game on September 22, 1946; he played 7 games that season and 83 games in 1947. He played in more than a hundred games in each of the following 14 years. Berra appeared in 14 World Series, including 10 World Series championships, both of which are records. In part because Berra&#x27;s playing career coincided with the Yankees&#x27; most consistent period of World Series participation, he established Series records for the most games (75), at bats (259), hits (71), doubles (10), singles (49), games caught (63), and catcher putouts (457). In Game 3 of the 1947 World Series, Berra hit the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history, off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca (who later gave up Bobby Thomson&#x27;s famous Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World in 1951).

Berra was an All-Star for 15 seasons, and was selected to 18 All-Star Games (MLB held two All-Star Games in 1959 through 1962). He won the American League (AL) MVP award in 1951, 1954, and 1955; Berra never finished lower than fourth in the MVP voting from 1950 to 1957. He received MVP votes in 15 consecutive seasons, tied with Barry Bonds and second only to Hank Aaron&#x27;s 19 straight seasons with MVP support. From 1949 to 1955, on a team filled with stars such as Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio, it was Berra who led the Yankees in RBI for seven consecutive seasons. Probably the most notable game of Berra&#x27;s playing career came when he caught Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series, the first of only three no-hitters, and lone &quot;perfecto&quot; ever thrown in MLB postseason play. The picture of Berra leaping into Larsen&#x27;s arms following Dale Mitchell&#x27;s called third strike to end the game is one of the sport&#x27;s most memorable images.

====Playing style====
Berra was excellent at hitting pitches outside of the strike zone, covering all areas of the strike zone (as well as beyond) with great extension. In addition to this wide plate coverage, he also had great bat control. He was able both to swing the bat like a golf club to hit low pitches for deep home runs and to chop at high pitches for line drives. Whether changing speeds or location, pitcher Early Wynn soon discovered that &quot;Berra moves right with you.&quot; Five times, Berra had more home runs than strikeouts in a season, striking out just twelve times in 597 at-bats in 1950. The combination of bat control and plate coverage made Berra a feared &quot;clutch hitter&quot;, proclaimed by rival manager Paul Richards &quot;the toughest man in the league in the last three innings&quot;. Contrasting him with teammate Mickey Mantle, Wynn declared Berra &quot;the real toughest clutch hitter&quot;, grouping him with Cleveland slugger Al Rosen as &quot;the two best clutch hitters in the game&quot;.

As a catcher Berra was outstanding: quick, mobile, and a great handler of pitchers, Berra led all American League catchers eight times in games caught and in chances accepted, six times in double plays (a major-league record), eight times in putouts, three times in assists, and once in fielding percentage. Berra left the game with the AL records for catcher putouts (8,723) and chances accepted (9,520). He was also one of only four catchers ever to field 1.000 in a season, playing 88 errorless games in 1958. He was the first catcher to leave one finger outside his glove, a style that most other catchers eventually emulated. Tom Sturdivant, who pitched for the Yankees from 1955 to 1959, said &quot;I can&#x27;t say enough for Yogi Berra. It gives a young pitcher a lot of confidence to have a fellow like Berra calling the pitches. No one could set up the hitters better.&quot;

At age 37 in June 1962, Berra showed his superb physical endurance by catching an entire 22-inning, seven-hour game against the Detroit Tigers. Casey Stengel, Berra&#x27;s manager during most of his playing career with the Yankees and with the Mets in 1965, once said, &quot;I never play a game without my man.&quot; Later in his career, Berra became a good defensive outfielder in Yankee Stadium&#x27;s notoriously difficult left field.

====Yankee manager and harmonica incident====

After spending as a player-coach—he appeared in 64 games (35 as a catcher and 29 as a pinch hitter, batting .293 in 164 at bats), and held down the Yankee&#x27;s first-base coaching job otherwise—Berra retired as an active player after the 1963 World Series and was immediately named to succeed Ralph Houk as manager of the Yankees.

The so-called Harmonica Incident occurred aboard the team bus in August 1964. Following a loss, infielder Phil Linz was playing his harmonica, and Berra ordered him to stop. Seated on the other end of the bus, Linz could not hear what Berra had said, and Mickey Mantle impishly informed Linz, &quot;He said to play it louder.&quot; When Linz did so, an angry Berra slapped the harmonica out of his hands.

All was apparently forgotten when the Yankees rode a September surge to return to the World Series, but the team lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, after which Berra was fired. Houk, who was general manager at the time, later said the decision to fire Berra was made in late August and that the incident with Linz had nothing to do with it. Although he did not elaborate, Houk said that he and the rest of the Yankee brain trust did not feel Berra was ready to manage. Players, however, said the incident actually solidified his managerial authority and helped him lead them to the Series.

====Coach of the New York Mets and Houston Astros====
Berra was immediately signed by the crosstown New York Mets as a coach. He also put in four cameo appearances as a catcher early in the season. His last at-bat came on May 9, 1965, three days shy of his 40th birthday. Berra stayed with the Mets as a coach under Stengel, Wes Westrum, Salty Parker, and Gil Hodges for the next seven seasons, including their 1969 World Series Championship season. He then became the team&#x27;s manager in 1972, following Hodges&#x27; unexpected death in spring training.

The following season looked like a disappointment at first. Injuries plagued the Mets throughout the season. Midway through the 1973 season, the Mets were stuck in last place but in a very tight divisional race. In July, when a reporter asked Yogi if the season was over, he replied, &quot;It ain&#x27;t over &#x27;til it&#x27;s over.&quot;

As the Mets&#x27; key players came back to the lineup, a late surge allowed them to win the NL East despite an 82–79 record, making it the only time from 1970 through 1980 that the NL East was not won by either their rival Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. When the Mets faced the 99-win Cincinnati Reds in the 1973 National League Championship Series, a memorable fight erupted between Bud Harrelson and Pete Rose in the top of the fifth inning of game three. After the incident and the ensuing bench-clearing brawl had subsided, fans began throwing objects at Rose when he returned to his position in left field in the bottom half of the inning. Sparky Anderson pulled Rose and his Reds off the field until order was restored. When National League president Chub Feeney threatened the Mets with a forfeit, Berra walked out to left field with Willie Mays, Tom Seaver, Rusty Staub, and Cleon Jones in order to plead with the fans to desist. Yogi&#x27;s Mets went on to defeat the highly favored &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; in five games to capture the NL pennant. It was Berra&#x27;s second as a manager, one in each league. The Mets fell to the Oakland Athletics in the 1973 World Series, but they went the distance in a close, seven-game, series.
Berra&#x27;s tenure as Mets manager ended with his firing on August 5, 1975. He had a record of 298 wins and 302 losses, which included the 1973 postseason. In 1976, he rejoined the Yankees as a coach. The team won its first of three consecutive AL titles, as well as the 1977 World Series and 1978 World Series, and (as had been the case throughout his playing days) Berra&#x27;s reputation as a lucky charm was reinforced. Casey Stengel once said of his catcher, &quot;He&#x27;d fall in a sewer and come up with a gold watch.&quot; Berra was named Yankees manager before the 1984 season. Berra agreed to stay in the job for 1985 after receiving assurances that he would not be terminated, but impatient George Steinbrenner reneged, firing Berra anyway after the 16th game of the season. Moreover, instead of firing him personally, Steinbrenner dispatched Clyde King to deliver the news for him. The incident caused a rift between Berra and Steinbrenner that was not mended for almost 15 years.

Berra joined the Houston Astros as bench coach in 1985, where he again made it to the NLCS in 1986. The Astros lost the series in six games to the Mets. Berra remained a coach in Houston for three more years, retiring after the 1989 season. He finished his managerial career with a regular-season record of 484–444 and a playoff record of 9–10.

After George Steinbrenner ventured to Berra&#x27;s home in New Jersey to apologize in person for having mishandled Berra&#x27;s firing as Yankee manager, Berra ended his 14-year estrangement from the Yankee organization in 1999 and worked in spring-training camp with catcher Jorge Posada.

====Managerial record====
==Honors==
===Military===
During World War II, Berra served in the Navy as machine gunner participating in the D-Day invasion and earned a Distinguished Unit Citation, two battle stars and a European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.

===Major League Baseball===
Berra was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in , on his second ballot. That same year, his No. 8 was retired in 1972 by the Yankees, jointly honoring both Berra and Bill Dickey, his predecessor as the Yankees&#x27; star catcher.

On August 22, 1988, Berra and Dickey were honored with plaques to be hung in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Berra&#x27;s plaque calls him &quot;A legendary Yankee&quot; and cites his most frequent quote, &quot;It ain&#x27;t over till it&#x27;s over&quot;. However, the honor was not enough to shake Berra&#x27;s conviction that Steinbrenner had broken their personal agreement; Berra did not set foot in the stadium for another decade, until Steinbrenner publicly apologized to Berra.

In 1996, Berra received an honorary doctorate from Montclair State University, which also named its own campus stadium Yogi Berra Stadium, opened in 1998, in his honor. The stadium is also used by the New Jersey Jackals, an independent minor league baseball team that has also paid homage to Berra by never issuing his jersey number, 8, to anyone.

In 1998, Berra appeared at No. 40 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and fan balloting elected him to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Berra at number 43 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, compiled by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

On July 18, 1999, Berra was honored with &quot;Yogi Berra Day&quot; at Yankee Stadium. Don Larsen threw the ceremonial first pitch to Berra to honor the perfect game of the 1956 World Series. The celebration marked the return of Berra to the stadium, after the end of his 14-year feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. The feud had started in 1985 when Steinbrenner, having promised Berra the job of Yankees&#x27; manager for the entire season, fired him after just 16 games. Berra then vowed never to return to Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owned the team. On that day, Yankees pitcher David Cone threw a perfect game against the Montreal Expos, only the 16th time it had ever been done in Major League history.

In 2005, Berra received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2008, Berra was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

Berra was the inaugural recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award in 2013.

===Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, and Yogi Berra Stadium===
In 1998, the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center and Yogi Berra Stadium (home of the Montclair State University baseball team and formerly home to the New Jersey Jackals) opened on the campus of Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, New Jersey. The museum is the home of various artifacts, including the mitt with which Yogi caught the only perfect game in World Series history, several autographed and &quot;game-used&quot; items, and nine of Yogi&#x27;s championship rings.
Berra was involved with the project and frequently visited the museum for signings, discussions, and other events. It was his intention to teach children values such as sportsmanship and dedication on and off the baseball diamond.

On October 8, 2014, a break-in and theft occurred at the museum, and several of Berra&#x27;s World Series rings and other memorabilia were stolen.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom===
On November 24, 2015, Berra was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House attended by members of Berra&#x27;s family, who accepted the award on his behalf. At the ceremony, the President said: &quot;Today we celebrate some extraordinary people. Innovators, artists and leaders who contribute to America&#x27;s strength as a nation.&quot; Celebrating Berra&#x27;s military service and remarkable baseball career, Obama used one of Berra&#x27;s famous &quot;Yogi-isms&quot;, saying, &quot;One thing we know for sure: If you can&#x27;t imitate him, don&#x27;t copy him.&quot;

===USPS stamp===
On July 1, 2021, the United States Postal Service officially issued its Yogi Berra commemorative stamp outside of Berra&#x27;s museum. Berra is only the 30th baseball player to have his picture on a stamp, and he is the first player to appear on a USPS stamp in nine years. Berra is also the first player since Lou Gehrig in 1989 to receive an issuance all his own, where a great majority of those stamps have been part of multiplayer &quot;issuances&quot;.

==Other activities==

Berra and former teammate Phil Rizzuto were partners in a bowling alley venture in Clifton, New Jersey, originally called Rizzuto-Berra Lanes. The two eventually sold their stakes in the alley to new owners, who changed its name to Astro Bowl before selling the property to a developer, who closed the bowling alley in 1999 and converted it into retail space.

Yogi Berra&#x27;s Fitness &amp; Racquetball Club in Fairfield, NJ was popular back in the 1980s during the Racquetball craze.

Berra was also involved in causes related to his Italian American heritage. He was a longtime supporter of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) and helped fund raise for the Foundation. He was inducted into the Italian American Hall of Fame in 2004.

Berra was a recipient of the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s highest adult award, the Silver Buffalo Award.

Based on his style of speaking, Yogi was named &quot;Wisest Fool of the Past 50 Years&quot; by &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine in January 2005.

In the 2007 television miniseries &quot;The Bronx is Burning&quot;, Berra was portrayed by actor Joe Grifasi. In the HBO sports docudrama &quot;61*&quot;, Berra was portrayed by actor Paul Borghese, and Hank Steinberg&#x27;s script included more than one of Berra&#x27;s famous &quot;Yogi-isms&quot;. In 2009, Berra appeared in the documentary film &quot;A Time for Champions&quot;, recounting his childhood memories of soccer in his native St. Louis. The 2022 documentary &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over&quot; focuses on Berra&#x27;s life and career.

Yogi and his wife Carmen were played by real-life newly married actors Peter Scolari and Tracey Shayne in the 2013 Broadway play &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot;.

Yogi joined Athlete Ally as a champion for inclusion in sports and as an Athlete Ally Pro Ambassador in 2013. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center also collaborated with Athlete Ally on the innovative &quot;Championing Respect&quot; museum exhibit, which charted how sports has contributed to social change, such as athletes working for LGBT equality.

==Personal life==
Berra married Carmen Short on January 26, 1949. They had three sons and were longtime residents of Montclair, New Jersey, until Carmen&#x27;s declining health caused them to move into a nearby assisted living facility in West Caldwell. Berra&#x27;s sons also played professional sports: Dale Berra played shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees (managed by Yogi in 1984–85), and Houston Astros; Tim Berra played pro football for the Baltimore Colts in the 1974 NFL season; and Larry Berra played for three minor league teams in the New York Mets organization. Carmen Berra died on March 6, 2014, of complications from a stroke, at age 85; the couple had recently celebrated their 65th anniversary. Following Carmen&#x27;s death, the house in Montclair was listed for sale at $888,000, a reference to Yogi&#x27;s uniform number.

==Death==
Berra died in his sleep at the age of 90 of natural causes in West Caldwell, New Jersey, on September 22, 2015.

The Yankees added a number &quot;8&quot; patch to their uniforms in honor of Berra, and the Empire State Building was lit with vertical blue and white Yankee &quot;pinstripes&quot; on September 23. New York City lowered all flags in the city to half-staff for a day in tribute. A moment of silence was held before the September 23 games of the Yankees, Dodgers, Astros, Mets, Nationals, Tigers, Pirates, and his hometown St. Louis Cardinals, as well as the ALPB&#x27;s Long Island Ducks. The Yogi Berra Museum held a tribute on October 4.

Berra&#x27;s funeral services were held on September 29, and were broadcast by the YES Network. His ashes were interred next to his wife, Carmen, at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey. Berra&#x27;s longtime friend, Joe Garagiola, who lived directly across the street from Berra when they were young, died six months later on March 23, 2016. Berra&#x27;s Yankee teammate Don Larsen, who pitched the only perfect game in World Series history and was the only surviving member of the 1956 game at the time of Berra&#x27;s death, died on January 1, 2020.

==&quot;Yogi-isms&quot;==
Berra was known for his impromptu pithy comments, malapropisms, and seemingly unintentional witticisms, known as &quot;Yogi-isms&quot;. These often took the form of either an apparent tautology or a contradiction, but often with underlying humor and wisdom. Allen Barra has described them as &quot;distilled bits of wisdom which, like good country songs and old John Wayne movies, get to the truth in a hurry.&quot;
===Examples===
* &quot;It ain&#x27;t over &#x27;til it&#x27;s over.&quot; The Mets trailed the Chicago Cubs by 9½ games in the National League East in July 1973. They rallied to clinch the division title and eventually reached the World Series. This line inspired the song &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;til It&#x27;s Over&quot; by Lenny Kravitz. Though widely attributed to Berra and becoming the title of a film about him, there is doubt he said the words in the first place.
* &quot;It&#x27;s déjà vu all over again.&quot; Berra explained that this originated when he witnessed Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris repeatedly hitting back-to-back home runs in the Yankees&#x27; seasons in the early 1960s.
* &quot;You can observe a lot by watching.&quot;
* When giving directions to Joe Garagiola to his New Jersey home, which was accessible by two routes: &quot;When you come to a fork in the road, take it.&quot;
* On why he no longer went to Ruggeri&#x27;s, a St. Louis restaurant: &quot;Nobody goes there anymore. It&#x27;s too crowded.&quot;
* At Yogi Berra Day at Sportsman Park in St. Louis: &quot;Thank you for making this day necessary.&quot;
* When complimented by a woman in the grandstands at Wrigley Field on how he seemed to be enduring the heat well on a hot summer&#x27;s day: &quot;Thanks, ma&#x27;am. You don&#x27;t look so hot yourself.&quot;
* &quot;Always go to other people&#x27;s funerals; otherwise they won&#x27;t go to yours.&quot;
* On declining attendance in Kansas City: &quot;If people don&#x27;t want to come to the ballpark, how the hell are you gonna stop them?&quot;
* &quot;Texas has a lot of electrical votes.&quot;
* &quot;The future ain&#x27;t what it used to be.&quot;
* &quot;A nickel ain&#x27;t worth a dime anymore.&quot;
* &quot;If you can&#x27;t imitate him, don&#x27;t copy him.&quot;
* &quot;Ninety percent of the game is half mental.&quot; (This is sometimes rendered as &quot;Baseball is 90 percent mental. The other half is physical.&quot;)
* &quot;I really didn&#x27;t say everything I said.&quot;
Berra is often incorrectly credited with the saying &quot;It ain&#x27;t over till the fat lady sings,&quot; which was first attributed to Texas Tech University sports information director Ralph Carpenter in 1976. When asked about the quotation in 1998, Berra told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, &quot;That&#x27;s one of the things that I said that I never said.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 1950s, Berra hired Frank Scott as his agent for off-the-field appearances and endorsements. Scott was the first sports agent to focus on an athlete&#x27;s off-the-field earnings. Berra appeared in advertisements for products and companies including Yoo-Hoo, Visa, Pringles, Stove Top stuffing, Aflac, Camel cigarettes, Ballantine Beer, Kraft Italian salad dressing, Prest-O-Lite batteries, Wheaties, Shelby bicycles, Diamond Chemicals, Spencer Chemicals, AMF Bowling, Miller Lite, Kinney Shoes, Pepsi, Jockey underwear, wristwatches, orange juice, foot spray, and cat food.

The cartoon character Yogi Bear first appeared in 1958. The name was similar enough to Berra&#x27;s name that he considered suing Hanna-Barbera, but Hanna-Barbera claimed that the similarity was just a coincidence. Berra&#x27;s obituary by the Associated Press initially said that Yogi Bear had died.

<text>The Discovery Institute (DI) is a politically conservative think tank that advocates the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design (ID). It was founded in 1991 in Seattle as a non-profit offshoot of the Hudson Institute.

Its &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign aims to permit the teaching of anti-evolution, intelligent-design beliefs in United States public high school science courses in place of accepted scientific theories, positing that a scientific controversy exists over whether evolution is a reality, when in fact there is none.

==History==
The institute was cofounded in 1991 by Bruce Chapman and George Gilder as a non-profit educational foundation and think tank.
It was started as a branch organization of the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based conservative think tank. It is named after the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; in which George Vancouver explored Puget Sound in 1792. The organization was incorporated in 1991.

===Discovery Institute Press===
Discovery Institute Press is the institute&#x27;s publishing arm and has published intelligent design books by its fellows including David Berlinski&#x27;s &quot;Deniable Darwin &amp; Other Essays&quot; (2010), Jonathan Wells&#x27; &quot;The Myth of Junk DNA&quot; (2011) and an edited volume titled &quot;Signature Of Controversy&quot;, which contains apologetics in defense of the institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture director Stephen C. Meyer.

===Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity===
The Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity (PSSI), formally registered as PSSI International Inc., is a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit anti-evolution organization, based in Clearwater, Florida, promoting the pseudoscience of intelligent design associated with the Discovery Institute. While in the past, the organization sponsored events promoting intelligent design and fundamentalist Christianity, it is currently largely inactive. The PSSI was established in early 2006 by Rich Akin. Geoffrey Simmons, Discovery Institute fellow, is one of the directors of the PSSI.

The PSSI created a public list of medical professionals who dissent from Darwinism. This list is used by the Discovery Institute in its anti-evolution campaigns. The list is used in support of the Discovery Institute claims that intelligent design is scientifically valid while asserting that evolution lacks broad scientific support.

The PSSI, which was active between 2006 and 2008, held a &quot;Doctors Doubting Darwin&quot; rally at the University of South Florida&#x27;s Sun Dome in September 2006. Attendance was estimated at 3,500 to 4,000 people by a local reporter. Apologetic organizations promoting the event had hoped to fill all 7,700 seats in the Sun Dome. This meeting featured the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Jonathan Wells and fellow Michael Behe, and received local radio coverage. This rally was opposed by the Florida Citizens for Science.

===Teach the Controversy===

Teach the Controversy is a campaign conducted by the Discovery Institute to promote the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design, a variant of traditional creationism, while attempting to discredit the teaching of evolution in United States public high school science courses.

The scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy is a religious and political one. A federal court, along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, say the institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a &quot;false perception&quot; that evolution is &quot;a theory in crisis&quot; by falsely claiming it is the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community. In the December 2005 ruling of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science and &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents&quot;.

=== Wedge strategy===

The Wedge Strategy is a political and social action plan authored by the institute. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute manifesto known as the &quot;Wedge Document&quot;. Its goal is to change American culture by shaping public policy to reflect politically conservative, fundamentalist, evangelical Protestant values. The wedge metaphor is attributed to Phillip E. Johnson and depicts a metal wedge splitting a log. In &quot;Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)&quot; the authors wrote &quot;Although its religious orientation is explicit, the long-term plan outlined in the Wedge Document also displays the Discovery Institute&#x27;s political agenda very clearly. In ten years, the Wedge strategy was to be extended to ethics, politics, theology; the humanities, and the arts. The ultimate goal of the Discovery Institute is to &quot;overthrow&quot; materialism and &quot;renew&quot; American culture to reflect right-wing Christian values.&quot;

===Center for Science and Culture===

The Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC), is part of the Discovery Institute, beside other connected sites, such as Mind Matters, operated by the non-profit Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Discovery Institute. It publishes the blog &quot;Evolution News &amp; Science Today&quot; (formerly &quot;Evolution News &amp; Views&quot; and often shortened to &quot;Evolution News&quot; (EN)), that promotes &quot;a rigorously God-centered view of creation, including a new &#x27;science&#x27; based solidly on theism.&quot;

===Other issues===
====Homelessness====
Christopher Rufo, an activist who later became famous for opposing the teaching of critical race theory, wrote frequently on the subject of homelessness while he worked for the Discovery Institute. In his 2018 Discovery Institute-funded policy paper &quot;Seattle Under Siege: How Seattle&#x27;s Homelessness Policy Perpetuates the Crisis and How We Can Fix It,&quot; Rufo said that four groups&quot;socialist intellectuals&quot;, &quot;compassion brigades&quot;, the &quot;homeless-industrial complex&quot;, and the &quot;addiction evangelists&quot;had successfully framed the debate on homelessness and diverted funding to their projects. He described how the &quot;compassion brigade&quot; had called for social justice using terms such as &quot;compassion, empathy, bias, inequality, root causes, systemic racism.&quot; Rufo brought negative attention to All Home, which at the time was King County, Washington&#x27;s homelessness agency, by sharing a video of an adult entertainer performing at a conference on homelessness. All Home&#x27;s director was placed on administrative leave and resigned shortly thereafter.

Caitlin Bassett of the Discovery Institute has contributed opinion articles that criticize governmental response to homelessness as wasteful and counterproductive to the goal of ending homelessness. The Discovery Institute opposes the Housing First approach, preferring to prioritize treating homeless people for mental illness or drug addiction.

====2020 United States presidential election====
Scott S. Powell, a senior fellow of the Institute, has promoted the false claim that the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen.

=== Climate change ===
The Discovery Institute website has posted articles denying the scientific consensus on climate change.

<text>A flagellum (; : flagella) (Latin for &#x27;whip&#x27; or &#x27;scourge&#x27;) is a hair-like appendage that protrudes from certain plant and animal sperm cells, from fungal spores (zoospores), and from a wide range of microorganisms to provide motility. Many protists with flagella are known as flagellates.

A microorganism may have from one to many flagella. A gram-negative bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, for example, uses its flagella to propel itself through the stomach to reach the mucous lining where it may colonise the epithelium and potentially cause gastritis, and ulcers – a risk factor for stomach cancer. In some swarming bacteria, the flagellum can also function as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to wetness outside the cell.

Across the three domains of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota, the flagellum has a different structure, protein composition, and mechanism of propulsion but shares the same function of providing motility. The Latin word means &quot;whip&quot; to describe its lash-like swimming motion. The flagellum in archaea is called the archaellum to note its difference from the bacterial flagellum.

Eukaryotic flagella and cilia are identical in structure but have different lengths and functions. Prokaryotic fimbriae and pili are smaller, and thinner appendages, with different functions. Cilia are attached to the surface of flagella and are used to swim or move fluid from one region to another. 

==Types==

The three types of flagella are bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic.

The flagella in eukaryotes have dynein and microtubules that move with a bending mechanism. Bacteria and archaea do not have dynein or microtubules in their flagella, and they move using a rotary mechanism.

Other differences among these three types are:

*Bacterial flagella are helical filaments, each with a rotary motor at its base which can turn clockwise or counterclockwise. They provide two of several kinds of bacterial motility.
*Archaeal flagella (archaella) are superficially similar to bacterial flagella in that it also has a rotary motor, but are different in many details and considered non-homologous.
*Eukaryotic flagella—those of animal, plant, and protist cells—are complex cellular projections that lash back and forth. Eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia are identical in structure, but have different lengths, waveforms, and functions. Primary cilia are immotile, and have a structurally different 9+0 axoneme rather than the 9+2 axoneme found in both flagella and motile cilia.

===Bacterial flagella===

====Structure and composition====
The bacterial flagellum is made up of protein subunits of flagellin. Its shape is a 20-nanometer-thick hollow tube. It is helical and has a sharp bend just outside the outer membrane; this &quot;hook&quot; allows the axis of the helix to point directly away from the cell. A shaft runs between the hook and the basal body, passing through protein rings in the cell&#x27;s membrane that act as bearings. Gram-positive organisms have two of these basal body rings, one in the peptidoglycan layer and one in the plasma membrane. Gram-negative organisms have four such rings: the L ring associates with the lipopolysaccharides, the P ring associates with peptidoglycan layer, the M ring is embedded in the plasma membrane, and the S ring is directly attached to the cytoplasm. The filament ends with a capping protein.

The flagellar filament is the long, helical screw that propels the bacterium when rotated by the motor, through the hook. In most bacteria that have been studied, including the gram-negative &quot;Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Caulobacter crescentus&quot;, and &quot;Vibrio alginolyticus&quot;, the filament is made up of 11 protofilaments approximately parallel to the filament axis. Each protofilament is a series of tandem protein chains. However, &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; has seven protofilaments.

The basal body has several traits in common with some types of secretory pores, such as the hollow, rod-like &quot;plug&quot; in their centers extending out through the plasma membrane. The similarities between bacterial flagella and bacterial secretory system structures and proteins provide scientific evidence supporting the theory that bacterial flagella evolved from the type-three secretion system (TTSS).

The atomic structure of both bacterial flagella as well as the TTSS injectisome have been elucidated in great detail, especially with the development of cryo-electron microscopy. The best understood parts are the parts between the inner and outer membrane, that is, the scaffolding rings of the inner membrane (IM), the scaffolding pairs of the outer membrane (OM), and the rod/needle (injectisome) or rod/hook (flagellum) sections.

====Motor====
The bacterial flagellum is driven by a rotary engine (Mot complex) made up of protein, located at the flagellum&#x27;s anchor point on the inner cell membrane. The engine is powered by proton-motive force, i.e., by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell&#x27;s metabolism (&quot;Vibrio&quot; species have two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump). The rotor transports protons across the membrane, and is turned in the process. The rotor alone can operate at 6,000 to 100,000 rpm, but with the flagellar filament attached usually only reaches 200 to 1000 rpm. The direction of rotation can be changed by the flagellar motor switch almost instantaneously, caused by a slight change in the position of a protein, FliG, in the rotor. The torque is transferred from the MotAB to the torque helix on FliG&#x27;s D5 domain and with the increase in the requirement of the torque or speed more MotAB are employed. Because the flagellar motor has no on-off switch, the protein epsE is used as a mechanical clutch to disengage the motor from the rotor, thus stopping the flagellum and allowing the bacterium to remain in one place.

The production and rotation of a flagellum can take up to 10% of an &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; cell&#x27;s energy budget and has been described as an &quot;energy-guzzling machine&quot;. Its operation generates reactive oxygen species that elevate mutation rates. 

The cylindrical shape of flagella is suited to locomotion of microscopic organisms; these organisms operate at a low Reynolds number, where the viscosity of the surrounding water is much more important than its mass or inertia.

The rotational speed of flagella varies in response to the intensity of the proton-motive force, thereby permitting certain forms of speed control, and also permitting some types of bacteria to attain remarkable speeds in proportion to their size; some achieve roughly 60 cell lengths per second. At such a speed, a bacterium would take about 245 days to cover 1 km; although that may seem slow, the perspective changes when the concept of scale is introduced. In comparison to macroscopic life forms, it is very fast indeed when expressed in terms of number of body lengths per second. A cheetah, for example, only achieves about 25 body lengths per second.

Through use of their flagella, bacteria are able to move rapidly towards attractants and away from repellents, by means of a biased random walk, with runs and tumbles brought about by rotating its flagellum counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively. The two directions of rotation are not identical (with respect to flagellum movement) and are selected by a molecular switch. Clockwise rotation is called the &quot;traction mode&quot; with the body following the flagella. Counterclockwise rotation is called the &quot;thruster mode&quot; with the flagella lagging behind the body.

====Assembly====
During flagellar assembly, components of the flagellum pass through the hollow cores of the basal body and the nascent filament. During assembly, protein components are added at the flagellar tip rather than at the base. &quot;In vitro&quot;, flagellar filaments assemble spontaneously in a solution containing purified flagellin as the sole protein.

====Evolution====
At least 10 protein components of the bacterial flagellum share homologous proteins with the type three secretion system (T3SS) found in many gram-negative bacteria, hence one likely evolved from the other. Because the T3SS has a similar number of components as a flagellar apparatus (about 25 proteins), which one evolved first is difficult to determine. However, the flagellar system appears to involve more proteins overall, including various regulators and chaperones, hence it has been argued that flagella evolved from a T3SS. However, it has also been suggested that the flagellum may have evolved first or the two structures evolved in parallel. Early single-cell organisms&#x27; need for motility (mobility) support that the more mobile flagella would be selected by evolution first, but the T3SS evolving from the flagellum can be seen as &#x27;reductive evolution&#x27;, and receives no topological support from the phylogenetic trees. The hypothesis that the two structures evolved separately from a common ancestor accounts for the protein similarities between the two structures, as well as their functional diversity.

====Flagella and the intelligent design debate====

Some authors have argued that flagella cannot have evolved, assuming that they can only function properly when all proteins are in place. In other words, the flagellar apparatus is &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;. However, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, though sometimes at reduced efficiency. Moreover, with many proteins unique to some number across species, diversity of bacterial flagella composition was higher than expected. Hence, the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components. For instance, a number of mutations have been found that &quot;increase&quot; the motility of &quot;E. coli&quot;. Additional evidence for the evolution of bacterial flagella includes the existence of vestigial flagella, intermediate forms of flagella and patterns of similarities among flagellar protein sequences, including the observation that almost all of the core flagellar proteins have known homologies with non-flagellar proteins. Furthermore, several processes have been identified as playing important roles in flagellar evolution, including self-assembly of simple repeating subunits, gene duplication with subsequent divergence, recruitment of elements from other systems (&#x27;molecular bricolage&#x27;) and recombination.

====Flagellar arrangements====
Different species of bacteria have different numbers and arrangements of flagella, named using the term &quot;tricho&quot;, from the Greek &quot;trichos&quot; meaning &quot;hair&quot;.
*Monotrichous bacteria such as &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; have a single polar flagellum.
*Amphitrichous bacteria have a single flagellum on each of two opposite ends (e.g., &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; or &quot;Alcaligenes faecalis&quot;)—both flagella rotate but coordinate to produce coherent thrust.
*Lophotrichous bacteria (&quot;lopho&quot; Greek combining term meaning &quot;crest&quot; or &quot;tuft&quot;) have multiple flagella located at the same spot on the bacterial surface such as &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, which act in concert to drive the bacteria in a single direction. In many cases, the bases of multiple flagella are surrounded by a specialized region of the cell membrane, called the polar organelle.
*Peritrichous bacteria have flagella projecting in all directions (e.g., &quot;E. coli&quot;).
Counterclockwise rotation of a monotrichous polar flagellum pushes the cell forward with the flagellum trailing behind, much like a corkscrew moving inside cork. Water on the microscopic scale is highly viscous, unlike usual water.

Spirochetes, in contrast, have flagella called endoflagella arising from opposite poles of the cell, and are located within the periplasmic space as shown by breaking the outer-membrane and also by electron cryotomography microscopy. The rotation of the filaments relative to the cell body causes the entire bacterium to move forward in a corkscrew-like motion, even through material viscous enough to prevent the passage of normally flagellated bacteria.

In certain large forms of &quot;Selenomonas&quot;, more than 30 individual flagella are organized outside the cell body, helically twining about each other to form a thick structure (easily visible with the light microscope) called a &quot;&quot;.

In some &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. (particularly &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot;) and related bacteria such as &quot;Aeromonas&quot;, two flagellar systems co-exist, using different sets of genes and different ion gradients for energy. The polar flagella are constitutively expressed and provide motility in bulk fluid, while the lateral flagella are expressed when the polar flagella meet too much resistance to turn. These provide swarming motility on surfaces or in viscous fluids.

===== Bundling =====
Bundling is an event that can happen in multi-flagellated cells, bundling the flagella together and causing them to rotate in a coordinated manner.

Flagella are left-handed helices, and when rotated counter-clockwise by their rotors, they can bundle and rotate together. When the rotors reverse direction, thus rotating clockwise, the flagellum unwinds from the bundle. This may cause the cell to stop its forward motion and instead start twitching in place, referred to as tumbling. Tumbling results in a stochastic reorientation of the cell, causing it to change the direction of its forward swimming.

It is not known which stimuli drive the switch between bundling and tumbling, but the motor is highly adaptive to different signals. In the model describing chemotaxis (&quot;movement on purpose&quot;) the clockwise rotation of a flagellum is suppressed by chemical compounds favorable to the cell (e.g. food). When moving in a favorable direction, the concentration of such chemical attractants increases and therefore tumbles are continually suppressed, allowing forward motion; likewise, when the cell&#x27;s direction of motion is unfavorable (e.g., away from a chemical attractant), tumbles are no longer suppressed and occur much more often, with the chance that the cell will be thus reoriented in the correct direction.

Even if all flagella would rotate clockwise, however, they often cannot form a bundle due to geometrical and hydrodynamic reasons.

===Eukaryotic flagella===


====Terminology====
Aiming to emphasize the distinction between the bacterial flagella and the eukaryotic cilia and flagella, some authors attempted to replace the name of these two eukaryotic structures with &quot;undulipodia&quot; (e.g., all papers by Margulis since the 1970s) or &quot;cilia&quot; for both (e.g., Hülsmann, 1992; Adl et al., 2012; most papers of Cavalier-Smith), preserving &quot;flagella&quot; for the bacterial structure. However, the discriminative usage of the terms &quot;cilia&quot; and &quot;flagella&quot; for eukaryotes adopted in this article (see below) is still common (e.g., Andersen et al., 1991; Leadbeater et al., 2000).

====Internal structure====
The core of a eukaryotic flagellum, known as the axoneme is a bundle of nine fused pairs of microtubules known as &quot;doublets&quot; surrounding two central single microtubules (&quot;singlets&quot;). This 9+2 axoneme is characteristic of the eukaryotic flagellum. At the base of a eukaryotic flagellum is a basal body, &quot;blepharoplast&quot; or kinetosome, which is the microtubule organizing center for flagellar microtubules and is about 500 nanometers long. Basal bodies are structurally identical to centrioles. The flagellum is encased within the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane, so that the interior of the flagellum is accessible to the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm.

Besides the axoneme and basal body, relatively constant in morphology, other internal structures of the flagellar apparatus are the transition zone (where the axoneme and basal body meet) and the root system (microtubular or fibrilar structures that extend from the basal bodies into the cytoplasm), more variable and useful as indicators of phylogenetic relationships of eukaryotes. Other structures, more uncommon, are the paraflagellar (or paraxial, paraxonemal) rod, the R fiber, and the S fiber. For surface structures, see below.

====Mechanism====
Each of the outer 9 doublet microtubules extends a pair of dynein arms (an &quot;inner&quot; and an &quot;outer&quot; arm) to the adjacent microtubule; these produce force through ATP hydrolysis. The flagellar axoneme also contains radial spokes, polypeptide complexes extending from each of the outer nine microtubule doublets towards the central pair, with the &quot;head&quot; of the spoke facing inwards. The radial spoke is thought to be involved in the regulation of flagellar motion, although its exact function and method of action are not yet understood.

====Flagella versus cilia====
The regular beat patterns of eukaryotic cilia and flagella generate motion on a cellular level. Examples range from the propulsion of single cells such as the swimming of spermatozoa to the transport of fluid along a stationary layer of cells such as in the respiratory tract.

Although eukaryotic cilia and flagella are ultimately the same, they are sometimes classed by their pattern of movement, a tradition from before their structures have been known. In the case of flagella, the motion is often planar and wave-like, whereas the motile cilia often perform a more complicated three-dimensional motion with a power and recovery stroke. Yet another traditional form of distinction is by the number of 9+2 organelles on the cell.

====Intraflagellar transport====
Intraflagellar transport, the process by which axonemal subunits, transmembrane receptors, and other proteins are moved up and down the length of the flagellum, is essential for proper functioning of the flagellum, in both motility and signal transduction.

====Evolution and occurrence====
Eukaryotic flagella or cilia, probably an ancestral characteristic, are widespread in almost all groups of eukaryotes, as a relatively perennial condition, or as a flagellated life cycle stage (e.g., zoids, gametes, zoospores, which may be produced continually or not).

The first situation is found either in specialized cells of multicellular organisms (e.g., the choanocytes of sponges, or the ciliated epithelia of metazoans), as in ciliates and many eukaryotes with a &quot;flagellate condition&quot; (or &quot;monadoid level of organization&quot;, see Flagellata, an artificial group).

Flagellated lifecycle stages are found in many groups, e.g., many green algae (zoospores and male gametes), bryophytes (male gametes), pteridophytes (male gametes), some gymnosperms (cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, as male gametes), centric diatoms (male gametes), brown algae (zoospores and gametes), oomycetes (assexual zoospores and gametes), hyphochytrids (zoospores), labyrinthulomycetes (zoospores), some apicomplexans (gametes), some radiolarians (probably gametes), foraminiferans (gametes), plasmodiophoromycetes (zoospores and gametes), myxogastrids (zoospores), metazoans (male gametes), and chytrid fungi (zoospores and gametes).

Flagella or cilia are completely absent in some groups, probably due to a loss rather than being a primitive condition. The loss of cilia occurred in red algae, some green algae (Zygnematophyceae), the gymnosperms except cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, angiosperms, pennate diatoms, some apicomplexans, some amoebozoans, in the sperm of some metazoans, and in fungi (except chytrids).

====Typology====
A number of terms related to flagella or cilia are used to characterize eukaryotes. According to surface structures present, flagella may be:
*whiplash flagella (= smooth, acronematic flagella): without hairs, e.g., in Opisthokonta
*hairy flagella (= tinsel, flimmer, pleuronematic flagella): with hairs (= mastigonemes &quot;sensu lato&quot;), divided in:
**with fine hairs (= non-tubular, or simple hairs): occurs in Euglenophyceae, Dinoflagellata, some Haptophyceae (Pavlovales)
**with stiff hairs (= tubular hairs, retronemes, mastigonemes &quot;sensu stricto&quot;), divided in:
***bipartite hairs: with two regions. Occurs in Cryptophyceae, Prasinophyceae, and some Heterokonta
***tripartite (= straminipilous) hairs: with three regions (a base, a tubular shaft, and one or more terminal hairs). Occurs in most Heterokonta
*stichonematic flagella: with a single row of hairs
*pantonematic flagella: with two rows of hairs
*acronematic: flagella with a single, terminal mastigoneme or flagellar hair (e.g., bodonids); some authors use the term as synonym of whiplash
*with scales: e.g., Prasinophyceae
*with spines: e.g., some brown algae
*with undulating membrane: e.g., some kinetoplastids, some parabasalids
*with proboscis (trunk-like protrusion of the cell): e.g., apusomonads, some bodonids

According to the number of flagella, cells may be: (remembering that some authors use &quot;ciliated&quot; instead of &quot;flagellated&quot;)
*uniflagellated: e.g., most Opisthokonta
*biflagellated: e.g., all Dinoflagellata, the gametes of Charophyceae, of most bryophytes and of some metazoans
*triflagellated: e.g., the gametes of some Foraminifera
*quadriflagellated: e.g., some Prasinophyceae, Collodictyonidae
*octoflagellated: e.g., some Diplomonada, some Prasinophyceae
*multiflagellated: e.g., Opalinata, Ciliophora, &quot;Stephanopogon&quot;, Parabasalida, Hemimastigophora, Caryoblastea, &quot;Multicilia&quot;, the gametes (or zoids) of Oedogoniales (Chlorophyta), some pteridophytes and some gymnosperms

According to the place of insertion of the flagella:
*opisthokont: cells with flagella inserted posteriorly, e.g., in Opisthokonta (Vischer, 1945). In Haptophyceae, flagella are laterally to terminally inserted, but are directed posteriorly during rapid swimming.
*akrokont: cells with flagella inserted apically
*subakrokont: cells with flagella inserted subapically
*pleurokont: cells with flagella inserted laterally

According to the beating pattern:
*gliding: a flagellum that trails on the substrate
*heterodynamic: flagella with different beating patterns (usually with one flagellum functioning in food capture and the other functioning in gliding, anchorage, propulsion or &quot;steering&quot;)
*isodynamic: flagella beating with the same patterns

Other terms related to the flagellar type:
*isokont: cells with flagella of equal length. It was also formerly used to refer to the Chlorophyta
*anisokont: cells with flagella of unequal length, e.g., some Euglenophyceae and Prasinophyceae
*heterokont: term introduced by Luther (1899) to refer to the Xanthophyceae, due to the pair of flagella of unequal length. It has taken on a specific meaning in referring to cells with an anterior straminipilous flagellum (with tripartite mastigonemes, in one or two rows) and a posterior usually smooth flagellum. It is also used to refer to the taxon Heterokonta
*stephanokont: cells with a crown of flagella near its anterior end, e.g., the gametes and spores of Oedogoniales, the spores of some Bryopsidales. Term introduced by Blackman &amp; Tansley (1902) to refer to the Oedogoniales
*akont: cells without flagella. It was also used to refer to taxonomic groups, as Aconta or Akonta: the Zygnematophyceae and Bacillariophyceae (Oltmanns, 1904), or the Rhodophyceae (Christensen, 1962)

===Archaeal flagella===
The archaellum possessed by some species of Archaea is superficially similar to the bacterial flagellum; in the 1980s, they were thought to be homologous on the basis of gross morphology and behavior. Both flagella and archaella consist of filaments extending outside the cell, and rotate to propel the cell. Archaeal flagella have a unique structure which lacks a central channel. Similar to bacterial type IV pilins, the archaeal proteins (archaellins) are made with class 3 signal peptides and they are processed by a type IV prepilin peptidase-like enzyme. The archaellins are typically modified by the addition of N-linked glycans which are necessary for proper assembly or function.

Discoveries in the 1990s revealed numerous detailed differences between the archaeal and bacterial flagella. These include:

*Bacterial flagella rotation is powered by the proton motive force – a flow of H+ ions or occasionally by the sodium-motive force – a flow of Na+ ions; archaeal flagella rotation is powered by ATP. 
*While bacterial cells often have many flagellar filaments, each of which rotates independently, the archaeal flagellum is composed of a bundle of many filaments that rotates as a single assembly.
*Bacterial flagella grow by the addition of flagellin subunits at the tip; archaeal flagella grow by the addition of subunits to the base.
*Bacterial flagella are thicker than archaella, and the bacterial filament has a large enough hollow &quot;tube&quot; inside that the flagellin subunits can flow up the inside of the filament and get added at the tip; the archaellum is too thin (12-15 nm) to allow this.
*Many components of bacterial flagella share sequence similarity to components of the type III secretion systems, but the components of bacterial flagella and archaella share no sequence similarity. Instead, some components of archaella share sequence and morphological similarity with components of type IV pili, which are assembled through the action of type II secretion systems (the nomenclature of pili and protein secretion systems is not consistent).

These differences support the theory that the bacterial flagella and archaella are a classic case of biological analogy, or convergent evolution, rather than homology. Research into the structure of archaella made significant progress beginning in the early 2010s, with the first atomic resolution structure of an archaella protein, the discovery of additional functions of archaella, and the first reports of archaella in Nanoarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota.

===Fungal===
The only fungi to have a single flagellum on their spores are the chytrids. In &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; the flagellum is 19–20 μm long. A nonfunctioning centriole lies adjacent to the kinetosome. Nine interconnected props attach the kinetosome to the plasmalemma, and a terminal plate is present in the transitional zone. An inner ring-like structure attached to the tubules of the flagellar doublets within the transitional zone has been observed in transverse section.

<text>A gender role, or sex role, are social norms deemed appropriate or desirable for individuals based on their gender or sex. 

Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of masculinity and femininity. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. In addition, gender roles (and perceived gender roles) vary based on a person&#x27;s race or ethnicity.

Gender roles influence a wide range of human behavior, often including the clothing a person chooses to wear, the profession a person pursues, manner of approach to things, the personal relationships a person enters, and how they behave within those relationships. Although gender roles have evolved and expanded, they traditionally keep women in the &quot;private&quot; sphere, and men in the &quot;public&quot; sphere.

Various groups, most notably feminist movements, have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive, inaccurate, and sexist.

==Background==
A gender role, also known as a sex role, is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for a person based on that person&#x27;s sex. Gender roles can be linked with essentialism, the idea that humans have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity based on their gender. Sociologists tend to use the term &quot;gender role&quot; instead of &quot;sex role&quot;, because the sociocultural understanding of gender is distinguished from biological conceptions of sex.

In the sociology of gender, the process whereby an individual learns and acquires a gender role in society is termed &quot;gender socialization&quot;.

Gender roles are culturally specific, and while most cultures distinguish only two (boy/man and girl/woman), others recognize more. Some non-Western societies have three genders: men, women, and a third gender. Buginese society has identified five genders. Androgyny has sometimes also been proposed as a third gender. An androgyne or androgynous person is someone with qualities pertaining to both the male and female gender. Some individuals identify with no gender at all.

Many transgender people identify simply as men or women, and do not constitute a separate third gender. Biological differences between (some) trans women and cisgender women have historically been treated as relevant in certain contexts, especially those where biological traits may yield an unfair advantage, such as sport.

&quot;Gender role&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;gender identity&quot;, which refers to the internal sense of one&#x27;s own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these internalized gender identities become externalized into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.

==Theories of gender as a social construct==

According to social constructionism, gendered behavior is mostly due to social conventions. Theories such as &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; disagree with that position.

Most children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three. From birth, in the course of gender socialization, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. Traditionally, boys learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed. Social constructionists argue that differences between male and female behavior are better attributable to gender-segregated children&#x27;s activities than to any essential, natural, physiological, or genetic predisposition.

As an aspect of role theory, gender role theory &quot;treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, [and posits that] their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes.&quot; According to Gilbert Herdt, gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labor division was extended to gender roles.

Social constructionists consider gender roles to be hierarchical and patriarchal. The term patriarchy, according to researcher Andrew Cherlin, defines &quot;a social order based on the domination of women by men, especially in agricultural societies&quot;.

According to Eagly et al., the consequences of gender roles and stereotypes are sex-typed social behavior because roles and stereotypes are both socially-shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms.

Judith Butler, in works such as &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; and &quot;Undoing Gender&quot;, contends that being female is not &quot;natural&quot; and that it appears natural only through repeated performances of gender; these performances, in turn, reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.

==Major theorists==
===Talcott Parsons===
Working in the United States in 1955, Talcott Parsons developed a model of the nuclear family, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure. The model compared a traditional contemporaneous view of gender roles with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles, i.e., gender roles described in the sense of Max Weber&#x27;s ideal types (an exaggerated and simplified version of a phenomenon, used for analytical purposes) rather than how they appear in reality. Model A described a total separation of male and female roles, while Model B described the complete dissolution of gender roles.
The model is consciously a simplification; individuals&#x27; actual behavior usually lies somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, gender roles are not fixed but are constantly renegotiated between individuals.

===Geert Hofstede===

Geert Hofstede, a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture, sees culture as &quot;broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting&quot; in a society In Hofstede&#x27;s view, most human cultures can themselves be classified as either masculine or feminine. Masculine culture clearly distinguishes between gender roles, directing men to &quot;be assertive, tough, and focused on material success,&quot; and women to &quot;be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life.&quot; Feminine cultures tolerate overlapping gender roles, and instruct that &quot;both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life.&quot;

Hofstede&#x27;s &quot;Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions&quot; states:

Masculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, define relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow.

In feminine cultures, modesty and relationships are important characteristics. This differs from masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships.

&#x27;The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life&#x27;.

===John Money===
&quot;In the 1950s, John Money and his colleagues took up the study of intersex individuals, who, Money realized, &#x27;would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and psychosexual orientation&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination.&quot;

They concluded that gonads, hormones, and chromosomes did not automatically determine a child&#x27;s gender role. Among the many terms Money coined was &quot;gender role,&quot; which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as &quot;all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman.&quot;

In recent years, the majority of Money&#x27;s theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the inaccurate reporting of success in the &quot;John/Joan&quot; case, later revealed to be David Reimer.

=== West and Zimmerman ===
Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction of &quot;roles.&quot; For them, gender is &quot;the product of social doings of some sort undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production.&quot; This approach is described by Elisabeth K. Kelan as an &quot;ethnomethodological approach&quot; which analyzes &quot;micro interactions to reveal how the objective and given nature of the world is accomplished,&quot; suggesting that gender does not exist until it is empirically perceived and performed through interactions. West and Zimmerman argued that the use of &quot;role&quot; to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, they stated that roles are situated identities, such as &quot;nurse&quot; and &quot;student,&quot; which are developed as the situation demands, while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, &quot;conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality.&quot; West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.

==Biological factors==
Historically, gender roles have been largely attributed to biological differences in men and women. Although research indicates that biology plays a role in gendered behavior, the extent of its effects on gender roles is less clear.

One hypothesis attributes differences in gender roles to evolution. The sociobiological view argues that men&#x27;s fitness is increased by being aggressive, allowing them to compete with other men for access to females, as well as by being sexually promiscuous and trying to father as many children as possible. Women are benefited by bonding with infants and caring for children. Sociobiologists argue that these roles are evolutionary and led to the establishment of traditional gender roles, with women in the domestic sphere and men dominant in every other area. However, this view pre-assumes a view of nature that is contradicted by the fact that women engage in hunting in 79% of modern hunter-gatherer societies. However, an attempted verification of this study found &quot;that multiple methodological failures all bias their results in the same direction...their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies&quot;.

Another hypothesis attributes differences in gender roles to prenatal exposure to hormones. Early research examining the effect of biology on gender roles by John Money and Anke Ehrhardt primarily focused on girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), resulting in higher-than-normal prenatal exposure to androgens. Their research found that girls with CAH exhibited tomboy-like behavior, were less interested in dolls, and were less likely to make-believe as parents. A number of methodological problems with the studies have been identified. A study on 1950s American teenage girls who had been exposed to androgenic steroids by their mothers &quot;in utero&quot; exhibited more traditionally masculine behavior, such as being more concerned about their future career than marriage, wearing pants, and not being interested in jewelry.

Sociologist Linda L. Lindsey critiqued the notion that gender roles are a result of prenatal hormone exposure, saying that while hormones may explain sex differences like sexual orientation and gender identity, they &quot;cannot account for gender differences in other roles such as nurturing, love, and criminal behavior&quot;. By contrast, some research indicates that both neurobiological and social risk factors can interact in a way that predisposes one to engaging in criminal behavior (including juvenile delinquency).

With regard to gender stereotypes, the societal roles and differences in power between men and women are much more strongly indicated than is a biological component.

==In culture==

Ideas of appropriate gendered behavior vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. In the &quot;World Values Survey&quot;, responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.

Attitudes have also varied historically. For example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing. Because of the rise of witch-hunts across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men. In the last few decades, these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.

Vern Bullough stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles. For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o&#x27;clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an Adam&#x27;s apple, wearing a woman&#x27;s dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.

Because the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employers, according to a 2011 report from the Center for American Progress.

Gender roles may be a means through which one expresses one&#x27;s gender identity, but they may also be employed as a means of exerting social control, and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.

===Changing roles===
Throughout history spouses have been charged with certain societal functions. With the rise of the New World came the expected roles that each spouse was to carry out specifically. Husbands were typically working farmers - the providers. Wives were caregivers for children and the home. However, the roles are now changing, and even reversing.

Societies can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives may earn more than their husbands.

With the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their educations. Women have also started to get more involved in recreation activities such as sports, which in the past were regarded to be for men. Family dynamic structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing. Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.

According to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million. This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden. However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.

Gender equality allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason &quot;men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images.&quot; The LGBT rights movement has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.

Besides North America and Europe, there are other regions whose gender roles are also changing. In Asia, Hong Kong is very close to the USA because the female surgeons in these societies are focused heavily on home life, whereas Japan is focused more on work life. After a female surgeon gives birth in Hong Kong, she wants to cut her work schedule down, but keeps working full time (60–80 hours per week). Similar to Hong Kong, Japanese surgeons still work long hours, but they try to rearrange their schedules so they can be at home more (end up working less than 60 hours). Although all three places have women working advanced jobs, the female surgeons in the US and Hong Kong feel more gender equality at home where they have equal, if not more control of their families, and Japanese surgeons feel the men are still in control.

A big change was seen in Hong Kong because the wives used to deal with unhappy marriage. Now, Chinese wives have been divorcing their husbands when they feel unhappy with their marriages, and are stable financially. This makes the wife seem more in control of her own life, instead of letting her husband control her. Other places, such as Singapore and Taipei are also seeing changes in gender roles. In many societies, but especially Singapore and Taipei, women have more jobs that have a leadership position (i.e. A doctor or manager), and fewer jobs as a regular worker (i.e. A clerk or salesperson). The males in Singapore also have more leadership roles, but they have more lower level jobs too. In the past, the women would get the lower level jobs, and the men would get all the leadership positions. There is an increase of male unemployment in Singapore, Taipei, and Hong Kong, so the women are having to work more in order to support their families. In the past, the males were usually the ones supporting the family.

In India, the women are married young, and are expected to run the household, even if they did not finish school. It is seen as shameful if a woman has to work outside of the house in order to help support the family. Many women are starting jewelry businesses inside their houses and have their own bank accounts because of it. Middle aged women are now able to work without being shameful because they are no longer childbearing.

=== Gender stereotype differences in cultures: East and West ===
According to Professor Lei Chang, gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles, can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or &quot;instruments&quot;) that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:
* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,
* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and
* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.
Through such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual&#x27;s culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose &#x27;cultures&#x27; are a few hundred miles apart.

Although existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede&#x27;s 1980 findings, that &quot;high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment&quot;, test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans. This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.

A study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions. The United States was considered a more &#x27;independence-based culture&#x27;, while China was considered ″interdependence-based&#x27;. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that &quot;gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture&quot;. The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the socialization in work experiment, proving that &quot;women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means&quot;. The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups — for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.

==In religion==
Different religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to &quot;police&quot; within their own groups, including gender norms.

===Christianity===

The roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today (as they have varied historically since the first century church). This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations.

Many leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons, and in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Some mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. Many subsets of the Charismatic and Pentecostal movements have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.

Christian &quot;saints&quot;, persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the beatific vision (heaven), can include female saints. Most prominent is Mary, mother of Jesus who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the &quot;Theotokos&quot;, i.e. &quot;Mother of God&quot;. Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, doctors of the church, founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. Paul the Apostle held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the New Testament household codes, also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or &quot;Haustafelen&quot;, of Greco-Roman law in the first century.

===Islam===

According to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society. Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.

Many Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws. In the United Arab Emirates, non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more modestly when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.

In some Muslim-majority countries, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. (Women visiting from other countries sometimes object to this norm and sometimes decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interest of their own safety , such as &quot;modest&quot; dress codes which failing to abide by risk being perceived as a prostitute.)

Islamic prophet Muhammad described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:
&quot;A man asked the Prophet: &#x27;Whom should I honor most?&#x27; The Prophet replied: &#x27;Your mother&#x27;. &#x27;And who comes next?&#x27; asked the man. The Prophet replied: &#x27;Your mother&#x27;. &#x27;And who comes next?&#x27; asked the man. The Prophet replied: &#x27;Your mother!&#x27;. &#x27;And who comes next?&#x27; asked the man. The Prophet replied: &#x27;Your father&#x27;&quot;The Qur&#x27;an prescribes that the status of a woman should be nearly as high as that of a man.

How gender roles are honored is largely cultural. While some cultures encourage men and women to take on the same roles, others promote a more traditional, less dominant role for the women.

===Hinduism===

Hindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than the deities of other world religions. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood. However, in a religious cosmology like Hinduism, which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the hijras, and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. Women&#x27;s fertility is given great value, but female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.

==In relationships==
===Communication of sexual desire===
Metts, et al. explain that sexual desire is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and &quot;complicated emotional states&quot;, and is also the &quot;mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of sexual activity and emotional meanings&quot;. Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express sexual interest.

This may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by social norms for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectations of their cultures. When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in almost all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the Challenge hypothesis.

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person&#x27;s sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen, show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

===In marriage===
The institution of marriage influences gender roles, inequality, and change. In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill from a young age the stereotypical gender roles in a heterosexual marriage. Roles traditionally distributed according to biological sex are increasingly negotiated by spouses on an equal footing.

In the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society&#x27;s expectations and the influence of the media. Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles, dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles. Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male.

In the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men, though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.

The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase. In regions with recent conflict, such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.

In a cross-cultural study by David Buss, men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long-term partner. Both men and women ranked &quot;kindness&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.

Gendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one&#x27;s role-model or parent of the same biological sex. Imitation in the physical world that impacts one&#x27;s gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one&#x27;s life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person&#x27;s gendered roles are determined by his or her parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different. One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine. Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.

====Changing gender roles in marriage====
Over the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family. However, in today&#x27;s society the division of roles is starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriages in order to share responsibilities. This view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today&#x27;s society, it is more likely that a husband and wife are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.

After around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized. Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian. Traditional attitudes uphold designated responsibilities for the sexes – wives raise the children and keep the home nice, and husbands are the breadwinners. Egalitarian attitudes uphold responsibilities being carried out equally by both sexes – wives and husbands are both breadwinners and they both take part in raising the children and keeping the home nice. Over the past 40 years, attitudes in marriages have become more egalitarian. Two studies carried out in the early 2000s have shown strong correlation between egalitarian attitudes and happiness and satisfaction in marriage, which scholars believe lead to stabilization in divorce rates. The results of a 2006 study performed by Gayle Kaufman, a professor of sociology, indicated that those who hold egalitarian attitudes report significantly higher levels of marital happiness than those with more traditional attitudes. Another study executed by Will Marshall in 2008 had results showing that relationships with better quality involve people with more egalitarian beliefs. It has been assumed by Danielle J. Lindemann, a sociologist who studies gender, sexuality, the family, and culture, that the shift in gender roles and egalitarian attitudes have resulted in marriage stability due to tasks being carried out by both partners, such as working late-nights and picking up ill children from school. Although the gap in gender roles still exists, roles have become less gendered and more equal in marriages compared to how they were traditionally.

==Communication==

Gender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.

Communication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication. Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.

For example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, but males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.

As found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women in leadership could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s years in power.

===Nonverbal communication===
Hall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences. In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.

Men, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.

McQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women&#x27;s nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.

===Communication and gender cultures===

According to author Julia Wood, there are distinct communication &#x27;cultures&#x27; for women and men in the US. She believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in her opinion the root of these differences is gender.

Maltz and Broker&#x27;s research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into masculine and feminine gender roles: for example, girls being encouraged to play &quot;house&quot; may promote stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.

==Gender stereotypes==
A 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children in the United States. Fagot &quot;et al.&quot; divided this into two different studies; the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.

Within the first study, 23 children between the ages of two and seven underwent a series of gender labeling and gender stereotyping tests: the children viewed either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom, then identified or labeled those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under three years could make gender-stereotypic associations.

The second study looked at gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender-specific toys.

The third study used a series of questionnaires such as an &quot;Attitude Toward Women Scale&quot;, &quot;Personal Attributes Questionnaire&quot;, and &quot;Schaefer and Edgerton Scale&quot; which looked at the family values of the mother.

The results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labeling and stereotyping.

They also identified in the second method that the mothers&#x27; positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the &quot;Gender Labeling Test&quot; had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O&#x27;Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.

Virginia Woolf, in the 1920s, made the point: &quot;It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail&quot;, remade sixty years later by psychologist Carol Gilligan who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less &#x27;mature&#x27;. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;, holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.

Gender stereotypes are extremely common in society. One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see Heuristics).

The brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing. Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children&#x27;s mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a &#x27;boy&#x27;s subject&#x27;. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.

According to the 1972 study by Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender-roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result indicates that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.

In a later study, Deaux and her colleagues (1984) found that most people think women are &quot;more&quot; &quot;nurturant&quot;, but &quot;less self-assertive&quot; than men, and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women&#x27;s &quot;role&quot;. To put it another way, women do not have an &quot;inherently&quot; nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.

A study of gender stereotypes by Jacobs (1991) found that parents&#x27; stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents&#x27; beliefs about the child&#x27;s abilities. In turn, parents&#x27; beliefs about their child directly influence their child&#x27;s self-perceptions, and both the parents&#x27; stereotypes and the child&#x27;s self-perceptions influence the child&#x27;s performance.

Stereotype threat involves the risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&#x27;s group. In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.

A review article of stereotype threat research (2012) relating to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded &quot;that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics&quot;.

In 2018, Jolien A. van Breen and colleagues conducted research into subliminal gender stereotyping. Researchers took participants through a fictional &quot;Moral Choice Dilemma Task&quot;, which presented eight scenarios &quot;in which sacrificing one person can save several others of unspecified gender. In four scenarios, participants are asked to sacrifice a man to save several others (of unspecified gender), and in four other scenarios they are asked to sacrifice a woman.&quot; The results showed that women who identified as feminists were more willing to &#x27;sacrifice&#x27; men than women who did not identify as feminists. &quot;If a person wanted to counteract that and &#x27;level the playing field&#x27;, that can be done either by boosting women or by downgrading men&quot;, said van Breen. &quot;So I think that this effect on evaluations of men arises because our participants are trying to achieve an underlying aim: counteracting gender stereotypes.&quot;

===Economic and social consequences===

Traditional gender roles assume women will serve as the primary caregivers for children and the elderly, regardless of whether they also work outside of the home. Sociology scholar Arlie Hochschild delves into this phenomenon in her book, &quot;The Second Shift&quot;. This &quot;second shift&quot; refers to the unpaid work women take on in the private sphere—housework, cooking, cleaning, and caring for the family unit. Economically, this restricts a women&#x27;s ability to advance in her career due to her added (unpaid) responsibilities at home. Gender roles have influenced the idea that women are well suited for more feminine roles such as housekeeping and domestic duties. The OECD found &quot;Around the world, women spend two to ten times more time on unpaid care work than men.&quot; In 2020 alone, women provided over $689 billion in unpaid labor to the U.S. economy. Lee and Fang found, &quot;Compared with Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian Americans took more extensive caregiving responsibilities.&quot;

Across all demographics, women are more likely to live in poverty compared to men. This is largely due to the gender wage gap between men and women. Correcting these wage gaps would increase women&#x27;s salaries from an annual average earning of $41,402 to $48,326 increasing the income of the U.S economy. The gender wage gap is largely racial—in the U.S., American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) women, Black women, and Latina women disproportionately experience poverty and larger wage gaps compared with White and Asian women. Women are also more likely to live in poverty if they are single mothers and solely responsible for providing for their children. Poverty among single working mothers would fall 40% or more if women earn equal wages to men.

Specifically, in the immigrant demographic, migrant women are subject to lesser benefits and wage gaps compared to that of what migrant men receive. Preceding 1984 to 1994–2004, Mexican migrant women earned $6.0 to $7.40 per hour alongside their unpaid domestic responsibilities. Similarly, gender roles apply for immigrant women in the workplace as their skill level does not guarantee equitable participation in the economy. The 1986 immigration policy, impacted the employment of migrant men and women, specifically women with lower wages and higher demands. This trend continued in the United States as immigration policy has persistently been grouped into political affiliations alongside various other social, economic, and geographical factors.

===Implicit gender stereotypes===
Gender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. Implicit stereotypes are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not even be aware that he or she holds. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.

These implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the Implicit-association test (IAT).

One example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.

These associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.

This particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.

The same test found that the strength of a Singaporean child&#x27;s mathematics-gender stereotype and gender identity predicted the child&#x27;s association between individuals and mathematical ability.

It has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders&#x27; scores on the TIMSS, a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.

== In the workplace ==
Gender stereotypes can disadvantage women during the hiring process. It is one explanation for the lack of women in key organizational positions. Management and similar leader positions are often perceived to be &quot;masculine&quot; in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype. (This is often referred to as the &quot;lack of fit&quot; model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these &quot;masculine&quot; qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.

One&#x27;s performance at work is also evaluated based on one&#x27;s gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person&#x27;s gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations. Female performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.

A study in 2001 found that if a woman does act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does not act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more masculine, it is likely to cause backlash through third-party punishment or further job discrimination. This puts women in the workforce in a precarious, &quot;double bind&quot; situation. A proposed step to protect women is the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would prohibit gender-based discrimination regardless of if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes, or in defiance of them.

Consequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the glass ceiling. While the number of women in the workforce occupying management positions is slowly increasing, women currently fill only 2.5% of the higher managerial positions in the United States. The fact that most women are being allocated to occupations that pay less, is often cited as a contributor to the existing gender pay gap.

In relation to white women, women of color are disproportionally affected by the negative influence their gender has on their chances in the labor market. In 2005, women held only 14.7% of Fortune 500 board seats with 79% of them being white and 21% being women of color. This difference is understood through intersectionality, a term describing the multiple and intersecting oppressions an individual might experience. Activists during second-wave feminism have also used the term &quot;horizontal oppressions&quot; to describe this phenomenon. It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a &quot;concrete wall&quot; or a &quot;sticky floor&quot; to better visualize the barriers.

Liberal feminist theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.

While activists have tried calling on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide an equal hiring and promotional process, that practice has had limited success. The pay gap between men and women is slowly closing. Women make approximately 21% less than her male counterpart according to the Department of Labor. This number varies by age, race, and other perceived attributes of hiring agents. A proposed step towards solving the problem of the gender pay gap and the unequal work opportunities is the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment which would constitutionally guarantee equal rights for women. This is hoped to end gender-based discrimination and provide equal opportunities for women.

==In sports==
As strength has been strongly associated to masculinity for many years, sports have evolved into a significant representation of expressions of masculinity and hence, are commonly perceived as a predominantly male domain. However, this does not completely neglect the position and role of women in sports. This is evident from the number of females participating in sport has increasing in recent years.

As the belief in gender stereotypes is continuously upheld in society, sporting events have been divided according to how the sport is characterised, which leads to the conceptualisation of male and female sports. Certain traits and sporting events in the sport domain have conventionally been attributed to males and the rest to females. Female sports, expressing the concepts of femininity, are often characterised with flexibility and balance, such as gymnastics or aesthetic sports like dance. Conversely, male sports constitute the idea of masculinity, which is portrayed through strength, speed, aggression and power, such as in football and basketball.

The element of beauty in women&#x27;s sport seems to play a crucial role in the perceived femininity of a sport. This could be due to it being a vital facet in the general concept of femininity itself. The objectification of the female form persists, with women being conditioned to utilize their bodies for the satisfaction of others and to measure their looks against the prevailing feminine standard. The devaluation of female athleticism due their bodies can be seen in the sport uniforms, where in some sports, such as beach volleyball, gymnastics and figure skating, males and females don different uniforms in competitions. In the aforementioned sports, female uniforms expose more of their bodies than the male uniforms do despite the lack of evidence that such uniforms would significantly improve their skills.

While the distinction between male and female sports exist, females participating in male sports is more socially acceptable than the reverse, as questions would arise regarding the masculinity of males competing in the female sports. In a study conducted by Klomsten et al. (2005), they discovered that a majority of the females believed that certain sports are better suited for girls than for boys. Hence, they inferred that females do not prefer the idea of males, known to be strong and masculine, participating in feminine sports.

Sport media coverage of males and females differ significantly and this could attribute to the perpetuation of stereotypical gender roles as well as adversely influencing perceptions of women&#x27;s abilities. Male athletes are often portrayed based on their strength and physical prowess, while female athletes are more frequently depicted in relation to their physical attractiveness and, at times, their sexualized attributes.

Despite the increasing participation and remarkable achievements of female athletes, media coverage of women&#x27;s sport have yet to catch up with this significant advancement. Female athletes and women&#x27;s sport receive notably less media attention compared to their male counterparts across various forms of media, and this underrepresentation has worsened over the years, despite the rising levels of female participation and performance.

The depiction of female athletes and women&#x27;s sport in the media also tends to vary in terms of tone, production quality in a manner that minimises their efforts and performance. One prevalent practice in sport media coverage is the use of gender marking. The presentation of male athletes and men&#x27;s sport is regarded as the standard, while their female counterparts are often considered as the &quot;other&quot; or outside of this norm, as seen in the naming of events, such as &quot;Women&#x27;s World Cup&quot; while the men&#x27;s event being simply named as the &quot;World Cup&quot;. The use of first names and being referred to as &quot;girls&quot; or &quot;young ladies&quot; for female athletes is also seen as infantilizing, which reinforces the lower regard for female athletes and perpetuates pre-existing negative perceptions of women&#x27;s sport. The quality of production and filming of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sport, such as the use of on-screen graphics, shot variations, duration of video frames and camera angles, are also significantly distinct. This influences the audience perceptions by illustrating women&#x27;s sport as less significant and engaging. Thus, female athletes not only face a lack of media coverage, but the little amount of coverage tends to reinforce the hegemonic masculinity present in sport.

While online sites that promote and cover female athletes exist, these coverages are primarily only found in &quot;niche&quot; sites, which continues to pose challenges in overcoming the prevailing ideology of hegemonic masculinity deeply rooted in sports. Therefore, despite the growing participation and outstanding athletic achievements of girls and women, female athletes and women&#x27;s sports still have a long way to go in achieving equal treatment and fair representation in sports media coverage.

==In media==
In today&#x27;s society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one&#x27;s life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying. Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages. Traditional gendered roles view the man as a &quot;pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,&quot; and the woman as &quot;pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.&quot; Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the Internet, etc. Michael Messner argues that &quot;gendered interactions, structure, and cultural meanings are intertwined, in both mutually reinforcing and contradictory ways.&quot;

Women are also largely under-represented across multiple types of media. A statistical disparity of the male to female ratio shown on television has existed for decades and is constantly changing and improving. Three decades ago findings highlight that males outnumbered females on a ratio of 2.5 to 1. A decade later this number was at 1.66 men for every woman, and in 2008 the ratio was 1.2 to 1 in the US. In 2010 it was found that the ratio of men to women in successful G-rate movies is 2.57 to 1. Notable social theory such as Bandura&#x27;s social cognitive theory highlights the importance of seeing people in media that are similar to oneself. In other words it is valuable for girls to see similarities to those represented in media. 

Television&#x27;s influence on society, specifically the influence of television advertisements, is shown in studies such as that of Jörg Matthes, Michael Prieler, and Karoline Adam. Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings. This underrepresentation in television advertising is seen in many countries around the world, but is very present in developed countries. In another study in the &quot;Journal of Social Psychology,&quot; many television advertisements in countries around the world are seen targeting women at different times of the day than men. Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.

It has been presented in a journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited that adolescent girls have been affected by the stereotypical view of women in media. Girls feel pressured and stressed to achieve a particular appearance, and there have been negative consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. In an experiment described in this journal article, young girls described pictures of women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake; the women were dressed in revealing clothing which sexualised them and exposed their thin figures, which were gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.

It has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children&#x27;s preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children. Another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited examined the underrepresentation of women in children&#x27;s television shows between 1930 and 1960. While studies between 1960 and 1990 showed an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children&#x27;s television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children&#x27;s television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.

=== Gender Roles in Social Media ===
Social media has become an integral part of daily life for nearly everyone, serving as a dominant source of information and communication. Women&#x27;s presentation on social media is directly influenced, with platforms utilizing metrics like numbers and publicity to endorse certain ideals in posts. Perceptions propagated through social media significantly shape real-life thinking and opinions regarding gender. According to professor Brook Duffy at Cornell University, social media operates as a meritocracy, yet women&#x27;s voices are often underrepresented and carry less weight in the public sphere.

The creation of an online identity on social media can also lead to the perpetuation of false narratives about gender, setting unrealistic standards for both women and men. Body image plays a significant role in this, particularly affecting the mental health of young women and men who internalize beauty standards portrayed online, leading to dissatisfaction and harassment. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that women are more likely to have multiple social media accounts, making them more likely to internalize their body image and be influenced by the cultural stereotypes of female beauty. The emphasis on body image on social media platforms fosters daily comparisons and exposes individuals to sexualized media, increasing self-image insecurity. Furthermore, social media has also contributed to the spread of sexist beliefs and sexualized images of men. However, hashtags like #loveyourself and #allbodiesarebeautiful have sparked movements to challenge these standards.

Despite these challenges, social media has also created new opportunities for women in the workplace, particularly as influencers. However, gender disparities persist, with male influencers generally outperforming their female counterparts. Additionally, media contents across various platforms perpetuate gender stereotypes, with women often portrayed in cosmetic and fashion advertisements, while men are associated with gaming and knowledge. On an economic aspect, social media is driven by gendered advertisements and commercials, often reinforcing stereotypical representations of gender. Algorithms on social media platforms can further exacerbate discriminatory recommendations, reflecting the biases of programmers. Overall, social media&#x27;s influence on gender norms is profound, shaping perceptions, behaviors, and opportunities in both virtual and real-life settings.

==Online==
An example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more &#x27;tech savvy&#x27; and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai &amp; Shafer, shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.

In the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an &#x27;ideal&#x27; figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Women have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quite sexist in their appearances. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples&#x27; beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the male and female characters in different games.

The concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters, providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in online gaming where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming that regardless of actual gender those who are perceived as female are treated differently.

In contrast to the traditional stereotype that gamers are mostly male, a study in 2014 of U.K. residents showed that 52% of the gaming audience was made up of women. The study counted players of mobile games as part of the gaming audience, but still found that 56% of female gamers had played on a console. However, only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers were women.

Despite the growing number of women who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet, issues such as gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.

== Politics and gender issues ==

===Political ideologies===
Modern social conservatives tend to support traditional gender roles. Right wing political parties often oppose women&#x27;s rights and transgender rights. These familialist views are often shaped by the religious fundamentalism, traditional family values, and cultural values of their voter base.

Modern social liberals tend to oppose traditional gender roles, especially for women. Left wing political parties tend to support women&#x27;s rights and transgender rights. In contrast to social conservatives, their views are more influenced by secularism, feminism, and progressivism.

=== In political office ===
Even though the number of women running for elected office in the United States has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives. Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait. Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.

Elections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate&#x27;s gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling women&#x27;s rights and poverty, whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with crime and foreign affairs. That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.

It has also been predicted that gender highly matters only for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaigns or the focal point of media coverage. This has been refuted by multiple scholars, often based on Hillary Clinton&#x27;s multiple campaigns for the office of President of the United States.

Additionally, when voters have little information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.

===Feminism and women&#x27;s rights===


Throughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, WWI and WWII, women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from &quot;homemakers&quot; and &quot;caregivers&quot;, women were now factory workers and &quot;breadwinners&quot; for the family.

However, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American Suburbia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, middle-class families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the &quot;private sphere&quot;. Though frequently sold and idealized as &quot;perfect living&quot;, many women had difficulty adjusting to the new &quot;private sphere&quot;. Writer Betty Friedan described this discontent as &quot;the feminine mystique&quot;. The &quot;mystique&quot; was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the &quot;public sphere&quot;, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.

One major concern of feminism, is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housework. A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, &quot;The Shriver Report: A Woman&#x27;s Nation Changes Everything&quot; tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and &quot;mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families&quot; (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).
Another recent article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, &quot;Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.&quot;

Feminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors. An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female&#x27;s duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in Londa Schiebinger&#x27;s &quot;Has Feminism Changed Science&quot;, in which she states, &quot;Gendered characteristics – typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.&quot;

One example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in Sally Shuttleworth&#x27;s &quot;Female Circulation&quot; in which the, &quot;abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.&quot; In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.

===Men&#x27;s rights===


The men&#x27;s rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger men&#x27;s movement. It branched off from the men&#x27;s liberation movement in the early-1970s. The men&#x27;s rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, discrimination and oppression. The movement focuses on issues in numerous areas of society (including family law, parenting, reproduction, domestic violence) and government services (including education, compulsory military service, social safety nets, and health policies) that they believe discriminate against men.

Scholars consider the men&#x27;s rights movement or parts of the movement to be a backlash to feminism. The men&#x27;s rights movement denies that men are privileged relative to women. The movement is divided into two camps: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding female privilege.

Men&#x27;s rights groups have called for male-focused governmental structures to address issues specific to men and boys including education, health, work and marriage. Men&#x27;s rights groups in India have called for the creation of a Men&#x27;s Welfare Ministry and a National Commission for Men, as well as the abolition of the National Commission for Women. In the United Kingdom, the creation of a Minister for Men analogous to the existing Minister for Women, have been proposed by David Amess, MP and Lord Northbourne, but were rejected by the government of Tony Blair. In the United States, Warren Farrell heads a commission focused on the creation of a &quot;White House Council on Boys and Men&quot; as a counterpart to the &quot;White House Council on Women and Girls&quot; which was formed in March 2009.

Related to this is the Father&#x27;s Rights Movement, whose members seek social and political reforms that affect fathers and their children. These individuals contest that societal institutions such as family courts, and laws relating to child custody and child support payments, are gender biased in favor of mothers as the default caregiver. They therefore are systemically discriminatory against males regardless of their actual caregiving ability, because males are typically seen as the bread-winner, and females as the care-giver.

===Gender neutrality===

Gender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of gender neutral language, the end of sex segregation and other means.

=== Transgender and cross-dressing ===

Transgender is the state of one&#x27;s gender identity or gender expression not matching one&#x27;s assigned sex. Transgender is independent of sexual orientation; transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, etc.; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The definition of &quot;transgender&quot; includes:
* &quot;Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.&quot;
* &quot;People who were assigned a sex, usually at birth and based on their genitals, but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves.&quot;
* &quot;Non-identification with, or non-presentation as, the sex (and assumed gender) one was assigned at birth.&quot;

While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include transsexual; cross-dresser; genderqueer; androgyne; and bigender. Usually not included are transvestic fetishists (because it is considered to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification), and drag kings and drag queens, who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society&#x27;s ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. &quot;A friend of mine recently did the &quot;Oprah&quot; show about transgender youth&quot;, said RuPaul. &quot;It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar.&quot;

==Sexual orientation==

Sexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person&#x27;s emotional and physical attraction toward others. Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes. Sexual orientation can be variously defined based on sexual identity, sexual behavior and sexual attraction. People can fall anywhere on a spectrum from strictly heterosexual to strictly homosexual.

Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation.

An active conflict over the cultural acceptability of non-heterosexuality rages worldwide. The belief or assumption that heterosexual relationships and acts are &quot;normal&quot; is described as heterosexism or in queer theory, heteronormativity. Gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate aspects of individual identity, although they are often mistaken in the media.

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the &quot;wife&quot; handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women&#x27;s clothing. This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.

Cohabitating same-sex partners are typically egalitarian when they assign domestic chores. Sometimes these couples assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other. Same-sex domestic partners challenge traditional gender roles in their division of household responsibilities, and gender roles within homosexual relationships are flexible. For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally regarded by many as both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Carrington observed the daily home lives of 52 gay and lesbian couples and found that the length of the work week and level of earning power substantially affected the assignment of housework, regardless of gender or sexuality.

In many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different &quot;rules&quot; they are expected to follow by society.

These modified &quot;rules&quot; for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking asylum from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for &quot;not being gay enough&quot;; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.

Conversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine, respectively, may be assumed to be, or suspected to be, homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality.

==In criminal justice==

A number of studies conducted since the mid-90s have found direct correlation between a female criminal&#x27;s ability to conform to gender role stereotypes and the severity of her sentencing, particularly among female murderers. &quot;In terms of the social realities of justice in America, the experiences of diverse groups of people in society have contributed to the shaping of the types of criminals and victims that we have had. Like Andersen and Hill Collins (1998: 4) in their discussion of what they refer to as a &#x27;matrix of domination,&#x27; we too conceive that class, race, and gender represent &quot;multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configurations of these structural relationships. These patterned actions, in turn, affecting individual consciousness, group interaction, and individual and group access to institutional power and privileges. &quot;Patterns of offending by men and by women are notable both for their similarities and for their differences. Both men and women are more heavily involved in minor property and substance abuse offenses than in serious crimes like robbery or murder. However, men offend at much higher rates than women for all crime categories except prostitution. This gender gap in crime is greatest for serious crime and least for mild forms of lawbreaking such as minor property crimes.&quot;

===Gender roles in family violence===
The &#x27;Family Violence Framework&#x27; applies gender dynamics to family violence. &quot;Families are constructed around relationships that involve obligations and responsibilities, but also status and power&quot;. According to Hattery and Smith, when &quot;masculinity and femininity are constructed...to generate these rigid and narrow gender roles, it contributes to a culture of violence against women&quot; &quot;People with more resources are more likely to be abusive towards those without resources&quot;, meaning that the stronger member of the relationship abuses the weaker partner or family member. However, the fight for power and equality remains – &quot;Intimate partner violence in same-sex couples reveals that the rates are similar to those in the heterosexual community&quot;.
