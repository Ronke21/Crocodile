<text>נטע-לי הרשלג}}) and later, her first name was [[Americanized]] to &quot;Natalie&quot;. However, Portman herself has stated that her name has &quot;always been Natalie&quot; and that she doesn&#x27;t know where &quot;Neta-Lee&quot; came from.}} (born {{birth date|1981|6|9}}), known professionally as Natalie Portman, is an Israeli-born American actress. She has had a prolific screen career from her teenage years and has starred in various blockbusters and independent films, receiving multiple accolades, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. 
Portman was born in West Jerusalem and raised on Long Island, New York, where she began her acting career at twelve, starring as the young protégée of a hitman in &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994). While still in high school, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot; (1998) and gained international recognition for her role as Padmé Amidala in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999). From 1999 to 2003, Portman attended Harvard University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology. During this time, she took fewer acting roles but continued to appear in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy (2002 and 2005) and performed in a 2001 revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; at The Public Theater.

Her career gained further momentum in 2004 when she won a Golden Globe and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Closer&quot;. She then played Evey Hammond in &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2005), Anne Boleyn in &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008), and a troubled ballerina in &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In the following years, Portman starred in the romantic comedy &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2011) and portrayed Jacqueline Kennedy in &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016), which earned her a third Academy Award nomination. She also became a prominent figure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Jane Foster in &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2013), and &quot;&quot; (2022), which established her as one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses.

Portman has also directed the short film &quot;Eve&quot; (2008) and the biographical drama &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; (2015), in which she also starred. In 2021, she co-founded the production company MountainA, under which she produced and starred in the film &quot;May December&quot; (2023) and the miniseries &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; (2024). Portman is an advocate for various causes, including women’s rights, environmental issues, and animal welfare, supporting organizations like the Human Rights Foundation and the Jane Goodall Institute.

==Early life ==
Natalie Hershlag was born on June 9, 1981, in West Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, to Jewish parents. Her mother’s ancestors immigrated from Austria and Russia to the U.S., while her father’s parents immigrated to Israel from Poland after World War II. One of her paternal great-grandmothers, who is said to have been a spy for British Intelligence during World War II, was born in Romania. She is the only child of Shelley Stevens, an Ohio-born artist, and Avner Hershlag, an Israeli-born gynecologist. Portman is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States.

Portman and her family first lived in Washington, D.C., but relocated to Connecticut in 1988 and then moved to Long Island in 1990. While living in Washington, Portman attended Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland. Her native language is Hebrew. While living on Long Island, she attended a Jewish elementary school, the Solomon Schechter Day School of Nassau County. She studied ballet and modern dance at the American Theater Dance Workshop, and regularly attended the Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts. Describing her early life, Portman has said that she was &quot;different from the other kids. I was more ambitious. I knew what I liked and what I wanted, and I worked very hard. I was a very serious kid.&quot;

When Portman was ten years old, a Revlon agent spotted her at a pizza restaurant and asked her to become a child model. She turned down the offer but used the opportunity to get an acting agent. She auditioned for the 1992 off-Broadway &quot;Ruthless!&quot;, a musical about a girl who is prepared to commit murder to get the lead in a school play.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=32}} Portman and Britney Spears were chosen as understudies for star Laura Bell Bundy.

==Career==
===1994–1998: Early work===
Six months after &quot;Ruthless!&quot; ended, Hershlag auditioned for and secured a leading role in Luc Besson&#x27;s action drama &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994). She adopted her paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, Portman, as her stage name. She played Mathilda, an orphan child who befriends a middle-aged hitman (played by Jean Reno). Her parents were reluctant to let her do the part due to the explicit sexual and violent nature of the script, but agreed after Besson took out the Mathilda character&#x27;s nudity and killings that she committed.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|pp=44-45}} Portman herself said that after those scenes were removed, she found nothing objectionable about the content. Even so, her mother was displeased with some of the &quot;sexual twists and turns&quot; in the finished film, which were not part of the script. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commended Portman for bringing a &quot;genuine sense of tragedy&quot; to her part, but Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; believed that she wasn&#x27;t &quot;enough of an actress to unfold Mathilda&#x27;s pain&quot; and criticized Besson&#x27;s sexualization of her character.

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|quote=&quot;[T]here&#x27;s a surprising preponderance of that kind of role for young girls. Sort of being fantasy objects for men, and especially this idealised purity combined with the fertility of youth, and all this in one. ... It was definitely interesting to think about – why men write the female characters they do. Just like the way they write the male character. How much is wish-fulfilment fantasy, and why.&quot;|source={{mdash}}Portman on playing sexualized youngsters as a child, 2007}}

After filming &quot;The Professional&quot;, Portman went back to school and during the summer break of 1994, she filmed a part in Marya Cohn&#x27;s short film &quot;Developing&quot;. In it she played a young girl coping with her mother&#x27;s (played by Frances Conroy) cancer.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=52–53}} She also enrolled at the Stagedoor Manor performing arts camp, where she played Anne Shirley in a staging of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=53}} Michael Mann offered her the small part of the suicidal stepdaughter of Al Pacino&#x27;s character in the action film &quot;Heat&quot; (1995) for her ability to portray dysfunction without hysteria.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=61}} Impressed by her performance in &quot;The Professional&quot;, the director Ted Demme cast her as a precocious teenager who flirts with her much-older neighbor (played by Timothy Hutton) in the ensemble comedy-drama &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; (1996). Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Portman, a budding knockout, is scene-stealingly good even in an overly showy role.&quot; She subsequently went back to Stagedoor Manor to appear in a production of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=77}} Also in 1996, Portman had brief roles in Woody Allen&#x27;s musical &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; and Tim Burton&#x27;s comic science fiction film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=81}}

Portman was cast opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), but she dropped out during rehearsals when studio executives found her too young for the role. Luhrmann said &quot;Natalie was amazing in the footage, but it was too much of a burden for her at that age&quot;. She was also offered Adrian Lyne&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;, based on the novel of the same name, but she turned down the part due to its excessive sexual content. She later bemoaned that her parts in &quot;The Professional&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; prompted a series of offers to play a sexualized youngster, adding that it &quot;dictated a lot of my choices afterwards &#x27;cos it scared me ... it made me reluctant to do sexy stuff&quot;. 

Portman instead signed on to star as Anne Frank in a Broadway revival of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, which was staged at the Music Box Theatre from December 1997 to May 1998. In preparation, she twice visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and interacted with Miep Gies, who had preserved Anne&#x27;s diary after the family was captured; she found a connection with Frank&#x27;s story, given her own family&#x27;s history with the Holocaust.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=102–103}} Reviewing the production for &quot;Variety&quot;, Greg Evans disliked her portrayal, which he thought had &quot;little of the charm, budding genius or even brittle intelligence that the diary itself reveals&quot;. Conversely, Ben Brantley found an &quot;ineffable grace in her awkwardness&quot;. The experience of performing the play was emotionally draining for her, as she attended high school during the day and performed at night; she wrote personal essays in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazines about her experience.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=104, 107}}

===1999–2006: &quot;Star Wars&quot;, education, and transition to mature roles===
Portman began filming the part of Padmé Amidala in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy in 1997, which marked her first big-budget production. The first film of the series, &quot;Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was released in 1999, when she was in her senior year of high school.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=130}} Portman was unfamiliar with the franchise when she was cast, and watched the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy before filming began. She worked closely with the director George Lucas on her character&#x27;s accent and mannerisms, and watched the films of Lauren Bacall, Audrey Hepburn, and Katharine Hepburn to draw inspiration from their voice and stature. Filming in arduous locations in Algeria proved challenging for Portman. She did not attend the film&#x27;s premiere so she could study for her high school finals. The critical response to the film was mixed, but with earnings of $924 million worldwide it was the second highest-grossing film of all time to that point, and it established Portman as a global star.

Portman graduated from Syosset High School in 1999. Her high school paper, &quot;A Simple Method to Demonstrate the Enzymatic Production of Hydrogen from Sugar&quot;, co-authored with scientists Ian Hurley and Jonathan Woodward, was entered in the Intel Science Talent Search. Following production on &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Portman initially turned down a lead role in the coming-of-age film &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot; (1999) after learning it would involve a sex scene, but the director Wayne Wang and actress Susan Sarandon (who played Portman&#x27;s mother in the film) demanded a rewrite of the script. She was shown a new draft, and decided to accept the part. Mary Elizabeth Williams of &quot;Salon&quot; called Portman&#x27;s performance &quot;astonishing&quot; and added that &quot;unlike any number of actresses her age, she&#x27;s neither too maudlin nor too plucky&quot;. She received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for it.

Portman&#x27;s sole screen appearance in 2000 was in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, a romantic drama filmed in Texas, in which she played a pregnant teenager.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=132}} After finishing work on the film, she began attending Harvard University to pursue her bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology, and significantly reduced her acting roles over the next few years. She studied advanced Hebrew literature and neurobiology, and she served as Alan Dershowitz&#x27;s research assistant. In the summer of 2001, she returned to Broadway (at the Delacorte Theater) to perform Chekhov&#x27;s drama &quot;The Seagull&quot;, which was directed by Mike Nichols and co-starred Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Linda Winer of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that the &quot;major surprises come from Portman, whose Nina transforms with astonishing lyricism from the girl with ambition to Chekhov&#x27;s most difficult symbol of destruction&quot;. Also in 2001, Portman was among several celebrities who made cameo appearances in the comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot;. The following year she reprised her role of Amidala in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, which she had filmed in Sydney and London during her summer break of 2000.{{sfn|Dickerson|2002|p=167–171}} She was excited by the opportunity to play a confident young woman who did not depend on the male lead. When asked about balancing her career and education, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if [college] ruins my career. I&#x27;d rather be smart than a movie star.&quot; In 2002, she contributed to a study on memory called &quot;Frontal lobe activation during object permanence: data from near-infrared spectroscopy&quot;. Portman graduated from Harvard in 2003 and her sole screen appearance that year was in the brief part of a young mother in the war film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. She described this period as the &quot;most difficult time&quot; in her life, noting that she wasn&#x27;t getting work and felt criticized for her performances in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. After taking time off, she begged for the &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; role, which Mike Nichols helped secure, offering her a letter of support that helped her regain confidence.

Portman began 2004 by featuring in the romantic comedy &quot;Garden State&quot;, which was written and directed by its star Zach Braff. She was the first actor to sign on to the film after finding a connection with her part: a spirited young girl suffering from epilepsy. Her role in it was described by Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;. as a prime example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl character type – a stereotypical female role designed to spiritually help a male protagonist. Portman later said she found it upsetting to have contributed to the trope. She followed it by playing a mysterious stripper in &quot;Closer&quot;, a romantic drama directed by Mike Nichols based on the play of the same name, and co-starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, and Clive Owen. Portman agreed to her first sexually explicit adult role after turning down such parts in the past, saying it reflected her own maturity as a person. She had also performed her first nude scenes for the film, but they were deleted from the final cut when she insisted that they were inessential to the story. &quot;Closer&quot; grossed over $115 million worldwide against a $27 million budget, and the critic Peter Travers took note of Portman&#x27;s &quot;blazing, breakthrough performance&quot;, writing that she &quot;digs so deep into the bruised core of her character that they seem to wear the same skin.&quot; She won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and received an Academy Award nomination in the same category.

&quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the final installment of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, was Portman&#x27;s first film release of 2005. It earned over $848 million to rank as the second-highest-grossing film of the year. She next played a Jewish-American girl in &quot;Free Zone&quot;, a drama from Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai. To prepare, she studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and read memoirs of Yitzhak Rabin, which she said allowed her to explore both the role and her own heritage. Controversy arose when she filmed a kissing scene at the Western Wall, where gender segregation is enforced, and she later issued an apology. Critics disliked the film for its heavy-handed approach to the conflicts in the Middle East. Portman&#x27;s final film role in 2005 was that of Evey Hammond in the political thriller &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, based on the comics of the same name, about an alternative future where a neo-fascist regime has subjugated the United Kingdom. She was drawn to the provocative nature of the script, and worked with a dialect coach to speak in an English accent. In a scene in which her character is tortured, her head was shaved on camera; she considered it an opportunity to rid herself of vanity. Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; deemed it Portman&#x27;s strongest performance to that point, and remarked that she &quot;keeps you focused on her words and actions instead of her bald head.&quot; She was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

Portman began 2006 by hosting an episode of the television sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. One of her sketches, a song named &quot;Natalie&#x27;s Rap&quot;, was released later in 2009 on &quot;Incredibad&quot;, an album by the Lonely Island. In the anthology film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;, consisting of eighteen short films, she had a role in the segment named &quot;Faubourg Saint-Denis&quot; from director Tom Tykwer. Later that year, she starred in Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Goya&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;, about the painter Francisco Goya. Forman cast her in the film after finding a resemblance between her and Goya&#x27;s portrait &quot;The Milkmaid of Bordeaux&quot;. She insisted on using a body double for her nude scenes after discovering on set that she had to perform them when they were not originally in the script. It received predominantly negative reviews, but Roger Ebert was appreciative of Portman for playing her dual role &quot;with fearless conviction&quot;.

===2007–2015: Career expansion and &quot;Black Swan&quot;===
Portman began 2007 by replacing Jodie Foster in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot;, which was his first English-language film. For her role as a gambler, she trained with a poker coach. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine believed that &quot;for once she&#x27;s not playing a waif or a child princess but a mature, full-bodied woman&quot; and commended her &quot;vibrancy, grittiness and ache, all performed with a virtuosa&#x27;s easy assurance&quot;. Her next appearance was in &quot;Hotel Chevalier&quot;, a short film from Wes Anderson, which served as a prolog to his feature &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (in which Portman had a cameo). In the short, she and Jason Schwartzman play former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room. For the first time, Portman performed an extended nude scene; she was later disappointed at the undue focus on it and she subsequently swore off appearing nude again. Keen to work in different genres, Portman accepted a role in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium&quot;, playing an employee of a magical toy store. She also appeared in Paul McCartney&#x27;s music video &quot;Dance Tonight&quot; from his album &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot;, directed by Michel Gondry.

Scarlett Johansson and Portman portrayed rival sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn, respectively, in the period film &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008). She was excited by the opportunity to work opposite another actress her age, bemoaning that such casting was rare in film. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; was critical of Portman&#x27;s English accent and wrote that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite bring the necessary heft to make Anne a truly dominant power player&quot;. The film had modest box-office earnings. She served as a jury member of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and also launched her own production company, named handsomecharlie films, after her late dog. Portman&#x27;s directorial debut, the short film &quot;Eve&quot;, opened the short-film screenings at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. It is about a young woman who goes to her grandmother&#x27;s romantic date, and Portman drew inspiration for the older character (played by Lauren Bacall) from her own grandmother.

A poorly received adaptation of Ayelet Waldman&#x27;s novel &quot;Love and Other Impossible Pursuits&quot;, entitled &quot;The Other Woman&quot;, marked Portman&#x27;s first film role of 2009. She appeared in a faux perfume commercial called &quot;Greed&quot;, directed by Roman Polanski, and in the anthology film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, she directed a segment and also starred in a different segment directed by Mira Nair. Portman next took on a role opposite Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in the drama film &quot;Brothers&quot;, a remake of the 2004 Danish film of the same name. Her role was that of a war widow, for which she spoke with military wives to prepare. The film was shot during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, and Portman found it challenging to shoot certain scenes without a written script. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; found her to be &quot;subdued and reactive in a part that doesn&#x27;t call for her to do much else&quot;.

After producing and co-starring alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the black comedy &quot;Hesher&quot; (2010), Portman played a ballerina overwhelmed with the prospect of performing &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s psychological horror film &quot;Black Swan&quot;. She was trained by the professional ballerina Mary Helen Bowers, and in preparation, she trained for five to eight hours daily for six months and lost {{convert|20|lb|kg|0}}. Her performance was acclaimed; writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, Dan Jolin found her to be &quot;simultaneously at her most vulnerable and her most predatory, at once frostily brittle and raunchily malleable [...] before peaking at the film&#x27;s denouement with a raw, alluring showstopper of a performance.&quot; &quot;Black Swan&quot; emerged as a sleeper hit, grossing over $329 million worldwide against a $13 million budget, and earned Portman several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Following her Oscar win, controversy arose over who performed the bulk of the on-screen dancing in the film. Sarah Lane, one of Portman&#x27;s dancing doubles in the film, claimed that the actress performed only about five percent of the full-body shots, adding that she was asked by the film&#x27;s producers not to speak publicly about it during awards season. Aronofsky defended Portman by insisting that she had performed 80 percent of the on-screen dancing.

Portman next served as an executive producer for &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2011), a romantic comedy in which she starred with Ashton Kutcher as a young couple in a casual sex relationship. She described the experience of making it as a &quot;palate cleanser&quot; from the intensity of &quot;Black Swan&quot;. It received unfavorable reviews but was a commercial success. She next agreed to the film &quot;Your Highness&quot; for the opportunity of playing an athletic and foul-mouthed character, which she believed was rare for actresses. Critics were dismissive of the film&#x27;s reliance on scatological humor and it proved to be a box-office bomb. In her final film release of 2011, Portman took on the part of Jane Foster, a scientist and love-interest of the titular character (played by Chris Hemsworth) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;Thor&quot;. She liked the idea of Kenneth Branagh directing a big-budget film that emphasized character; she signed on to it before receiving a script, and helped develop her part by reading the biography of scientists such as Rosalind Franklin. Richard Kuipers of &quot;Variety&quot; commended Portman&#x27;s &quot;sterling work in a thinly written role&quot; for adding dimension to the film&#x27;s romantic subplot. &quot;Thor&quot; earned $449.3 million worldwide to emerge as the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.

In 2012, Portman topped &quot;Forbes&quot;{{&#x27;}} listing of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. Her sole screen appearance that year was in Paul McCartney&#x27;s music video &quot;My Valentine&quot;, alongside Johnny Depp. The following year, she reprised the role of Jane Foster in &quot;&quot;, which earned over $644 million worldwide to emerge as the 10th highest-grossing film of 2013. &quot;Forbes&quot; featured her in their Celebrity 100 listing of 2014, and estimated her income from the previous year to be $13 million.

In 2015, Portman appeared alongside an ensemble cast, including Christian Bale, in Terrence Malick&#x27;s experimental drama film &quot;Knight of Cups&quot;, which marked her first project after giving birth. She shot for it within a week of returning to work and she did not receive a traditional script or dialogues, improvising most of her scenes with Bale. She said that shooting with Malick influenced her own directorial venture, &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; which was released in the same year. Based on Israeli author Amos Oz&#x27;s autobiographical novel of the same name which is set in Jerusalem during the last years of the British Mandate of Palestine, the Hebrew-language film starred Portman who also produced and co-wrote it. She had wanted to adapt the book since she first read it a decade ago, but postponed it until she was old enough to play the leading role of a mother herself. She collaborated closely with Amos, showing him drafts of her script as she adapted the book. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it to be a &quot;conscientious adaptation of a difficult book&quot; and was appreciative of Portman&#x27;s potential as a filmmaker. She next produced and starred in the western film &quot;Jane Got a Gun&quot; about a young mother seeking vengeance. Initially scheduled to be directed by Lynne Ramsay, the production was plagued with numerous difficulties. Ramsay did not turn up on set for the first day of filming and was eventually replaced with Gavin O&#x27;Connor. Michael Fassbender, Jude Law, and Bradley Cooper were all cast as the male lead, before Ewan McGregor played the part. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed that Portman&#x27;s &quot;stately performance&quot; was not enough to save the &quot;laborious and solemn western&quot;, and it grossed less than $4 million against its $25 million budget.

===2016–present: &quot;Jackie&quot; and production ventures ===
Portman portrayed Jacqueline Kennedy in the Pablo Larraín-directed biopic &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016), about Kennedy&#x27;s life immediately after the 1963 assassination of her husband. She was initially intimidated to take on the part of a well-known public figure, and eventually researched Kennedy extensively by watching videos of her, reading books, and listening to audiotapes of her interviews. She also worked with a dialect coach to adopt Kennedy&#x27;s unique speaking style. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; termed it an &quot;incandescent performance&quot; and added that &quot;her Jackie is both inscrutable and naked, broken but unquestionably resilient, a mess and yet fiercely dignified&quot;. She won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She also served as producer for the comedy horror film &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&quot;, directed by Burr Steers, and starred in Rebecca Zlotowski&#x27;s French-Belgian drama &quot;Planetarium&quot;. The 2017 experimental romance &quot;Song to Song&quot; marked Portman&#x27;s second collaboration with Terrence Malick, which like their previous film polarized critics.

In 2018, Portman starred in the science fiction film &quot;Annihilation&quot;, based on Jeff VanderMeer&#x27;s novel. She played a biologist and former soldier who studies a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating organisms. She was pleased to headline a rare female-led science fiction film, and she moved her family near Pinewood Studios during filming. For the action sequences, she underwent movement training with the dancer Bobbi Jene Smith. Benjamin Lee of &quot;The Guardian&quot; took note of Portman&#x27;s &quot;strong, fiercely compelling presence&quot; and commended her for playing the part without unnecessary sentimentality. It only received a limited theatrical release and was distributed on Netflix internationally. Her next appearance was in Xavier Dolan&#x27;s first English-language film, the ensemble drama &quot;The Death &amp; Life of John F. Donovan&quot; (2018), which was termed a &quot;shocking misfire&quot; by Eric Kohn of IndieWire. She then starred as a troubled pop singer in &quot;Vox Lux&quot;, sharing the part with Raffey Cassidy. She was drawn to the idea of showcasing the negative effects of fame, and in preparation, she watched documentaries on musicians and listened to the music of Sia, who wrote her songs in the film. For the climactic dance routines, she trained with her then-husband, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the sequence. It received mixed reviews from critics, but Portman&#x27;s performance earned praise. Comparing it to her performances in &quot;Black Swan&quot; and &quot;Jackie&quot;, Robbie Collin of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;this role has a similar audacity and extravagance that few actresses would dare attempt, let alone be allowed to get away with&quot;.

Unused footage from &quot;Thor: The Dark World&quot; and a new voice-over were used for Portman&#x27;s brief appearance in the 2019 superhero film &quot;&quot;. She then portrayed a psychologically troubled astronaut (based on Lisa Nowak) in the drama &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot;, directed by Noah Hawley. She replaced the film&#x27;s producer Reese Witherspoon, who backed out due to a scheduling conflict. The film was poorly received, though Portman&#x27;s performance was praised. The following year, she narrated the Disney+ nature documentary &quot;Dolphin Reef&quot; and voiced Jane Foster in the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;. In 2022, Portman reprised her role as Foster in the sequel &quot;&quot;, in which her character becomes Mighty Thor. She agreed to return to the franchise after meeting with director Taika Waititi, who offered to portray her character in an &quot;adventurous and fun and funny&quot; way. In preparation, Portman took the Mjolnir prop home to practice using it for her stunts. Nick Allen at RogerEbert.com opined, &quot;In both her human and her heroic state, Portman’s performance conveys why it&#x27;s great to see Jane again.&quot; Portman received a nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Super Award for Best Actress in a Superhero Movie. In a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Portman was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time.

Portman and her producing partner, Sophie Mas, founded the production company MountainA in 2021, and signed a first-look television deal with Apple TV+. The company&#x27;s first project was &quot;May December&quot;, a drama from filmmaker Todd Haynes, starring Portman and Julianne Moore, which premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Portman played an actress researching for her role as a woman (played by Moore) whose marriage to a much younger man was highly controversial. She was pleased to work with Haynes, whose work she admired, and to play a morally ambiguous character. Geoffrey Macnab of &quot;The Independent&quot; believed that the film had been &quot;galvanised by the tremendous performances from Portman and Moore&quot;. Portman received another Golden Globe nomination for her performance. The company next produced the HBO documentary series &quot;Angel City&quot;, about the inaugural season of Angel City FC, which was co-founded by Portman. 

MountainA&#x27;s third project was &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; (2024), an Apple TV+ miniseries adaptation of Laura Lippman&#x27;s thriller novel. Portman played a 1960s housewife in Baltimore who turns into an investigative journalist following an unsolved murder. Production in Baltimore was briefly paused when the crew received threats of violence. Continuing her collaboration with Apple TV+, Portman will next star in &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot;, an adventure film directed by Guy Ritchie. She will also star alongside Jenna Ortega in Cathy Yan&#x27;s thriller film &quot;The Gallerist&quot;.

== Endorsements ==
Beyond her acting career, Portman has been a longtime ambassador for Dior. She signed with the brand in 2010 and has starred in multiple advertising campaigns. In March 2011, Portman began voluntarily promoting a fundraising campaign for Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The campaign was aimed at raising funds for the construction of the Sarah Wetsman Davidson Tower, a new hospitalization tower at the hospital&#x27;s Ein Kerem campus, which was open in 2012. The campaign was a joint effort with the Hadassah Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America, which owns the hospital. Later in October 2012, Britain&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority banned a Dior advertisement that featured Portman wearing Dior mascara after a complaint from Dior&#x27;s competitor, L&#x27;Oreal, saying that the advert &quot;misleadingly exaggerated the likely effects of the product&quot;. The ASA ruled that &quot;the ad was likely to mislead&quot;. Portman is the face of one of the company&#x27;s fragrances, Miss Dior, inspired by Catherine Dior. She has starred in campaign videos for the fragrance, and promoted a new version of the fragrance, Rose N&#x27;Roses, in 2021.

==Activism==

=== Animal and human rights ===
Portman has long been an advocate for various causes, including animal rights, where she became a vegetarian at age eight after witnessing a demonstration of laser surgery on a chicken during a medical conference with her father. This experience deeply influenced her decision and has been a key part of her commitment to animal welfare. She became a vegan in 2009 after reading Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s &quot;Eating Animals&quot; and later produced a documentary on factory farming systems in the U.S. by the same title. In September 2017, she was recognized for her work on the film by the Environmental Media Association Awards with the Ongoing Commitment Award. She does not wear animal products and has praised animal-friendly products designed by Stella McCartney and Target. In 2007, she launched her own brand of animal-friendly footwear. In 2007, Portman traveled to Rwanda with Jack Hanna to film the documentary &quot;Gorillas on the Brink&quot;. Portman has been an advocate of environmental causes since childhood, when she joined an environmental song and dance troupe known as World Patrol Kids.

Portman has also supported anti-poverty causes. In 2004 and 2005, she traveled to Uganda, Guatemala, and Ecuador as the Ambassador of Hope for FINCA International, an organization that promotes micro-lending to help finance women-owned businesses in developing countries. In an interview appearing on the PBS program &quot;Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria&quot;, she discussed microfinance. Host Fareed Zakaria said that he was &quot;generally wary of celebrities with fashionable causes&quot;, but included the segment with Portman because &quot;she really knew her stuff&quot;. On &quot;This Week with George Stephanopoulos&quot; in April 2007, Portman discussed her work with FINCA and how it can benefit women and children in Third World countries. In fall-2007, she visited several university campuses, including Harvard, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, New York University, and Columbia, to inspire students with the power of microfinance and to encourage them to join the Village Banking Campaign to help families and communities lift themselves out of poverty.

Portman is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and for the 2004 presidential election she campaigned for Senator John Kerry. Prior to the 2008 presidential election, she supported Senator Hillary Clinton of New York in the Democratic primaries. Portman later campaigned for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. In a 2008 interview, she also stated: &quot;I even like John McCain. I disagree with his war stance – which is a really big deal – but I think he&#x27;s a very moral person.&quot; In 2010, her activist work and popularity with young people earned her a nomination for VH1&#x27;s Do Something Awards, which is dedicated to honoring individuals who do good. In 2011, Portman and her then-fiancé Benjamin Millepied were among the signers of a petition to President Obama in support of same-sex marriage. She supported Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign in 2012.

In 2009, Portman signed a petition that defended Roman Polanski, who was charged with drugging and raping a thirteen-year-old girl in 1977, and has been a fugitive for decades. In February 2018, she expressed regret over signing the petition.

In January 2011, Portman was appointed an ambassador of WE Charity (formerly known as Free The Children), an international charity and educational partner, spearheading their Power of a Girl campaign. She hosted a contest challenging girls in North America to fundraise for one of WE Charity&#x27;s all-girl schools in Kenya. As incentives for the contest winner, Portman offered the designer Rodarte dress she wore to the premiere of &quot;Black Swan&quot;, along with tickets to her next film premiere. It was announced in May 2012 that Portman would be working with watch designer Richard Mille to develop a limited-edition timepiece with proceeds supporting WE Charity. During WE Day California 2019 Portman gave a pro vegan speech in front of the student audience, linking vegan lifestyle and feminism. In December 2019, she visited Kenya a second time with WE Charity and spoke with young girls determined to improve their lives through access to education.

In 2006, Portman served as a guest lecturer at Columbia University for a course in terrorism and counterterrorism, where she spoke about her film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. In February 2015, Portman was among other alumni of Harvard University including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Darren Aronofsky and Susan Faludi who wrote an open letter to the school demanding it divest its $35,900,000,000 endowment from coal, gas, and oil companies. Later that year in May, she spoke at the annual Harvard Class Day to the graduating class of 2015. 

In January 2018, she donated $50,000 to the Time&#x27;s Up initiative. Portman took part in the 2018 Women&#x27;s March in Los Angeles, where she spoke about the &quot;sexual terrorism&quot; she experienced at age thirteen after the release of her film &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;. She told the crowd, &quot;I understood very quickly, even as a 13-year-old, that if I were to express myself sexually I would feel unsafe and that men would feel entitled to discuss and objectify my body to my great discomfort.&quot; She drew attention to the MeToo movement, revealing that her first fan letter was a &quot;rape fantasy&quot; from a man and that her local radio station created a countdown until her eighteenth birthday (when she would reach legal age to consent to have intercourse). In September 2023, Portman spoke at an event for the United Nations Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls, where she urged member states to reinvest in the Initiative and ending gender-based violence.

In 2020, Portman endorsed the &quot;defund the police&quot; movement. In 2020, Portman collaborated with JusticeLA to create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2020, Portman was announced as one of the co-founders and investors in an almost all-female group that was awarded a new franchise in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, the top level of the women&#x27;s sport in the U.S. The new team, since unveiled as Angel City FC, began play in the 2022 NWSL season.

=== Advocacy for Israel ===
Portman has been described by &quot;Haaretz&quot; as &quot;one of Israel&#x27;s outspoken supporters.&quot; Even when global public opinion turns against her, she remains steadfast in her support of &quot;the Holy Land, advocating both through academic articles, lectures, and public declarations.&quot; Most notably, she raised funds for the reconstruction of northern Israel after the Second Lebanon War. 

In 2002, at Harvard, Portman wrote a letter to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; in response to an essay critical of Israeli actions toward Palestinians, arguing that it misleadingly compared the situation to racial apartheid and that instead &quot;most Israelis and Palestinians are indistinguishable physically&quot;. She has criticized the Israeli government, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, being critical of his re-election in 2015, saying she was &quot;disappointed&quot; and found his comments racist. In November 2017, Portman was announced as the Genesis Prize recipient for 2018, which includes $2,000,000 in prize money. The following April, Portman announced that she did not plan to attend the awards ceremony scheduled for June, citing &quot;recent events in Israel&quot; that left her feeling uncomfortable attending public events there, leading to the ceremony being canceled. 

The statement did not specify which events, but was suggested as referencing the killings and wounding of Palestinian protestors by Israeli fire during the 2018–2019 Gaza border protests. Portman’s decision sparked backlash from Israeli politicians, including Culture Minister Miri Regev, Minister of Public Security and Strategic Affairs Gilad Erdan and American rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who accused the actress of falling into the hands of the BDS movement. The Likud party condemned Portman’s position, with Knesset member Oren Hazan calling for her Israeli citizenship to be revoked. 

Portman clarified that she was not boycotting Israel, stating, &quot;I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it. Like many Israelis and Jews, I can be critical of Israel&#x27;s leadership without wanting to boycott the nation.&quot; She explained that she did not want to &quot;appear as endorsing&quot; Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was scheduled to speak at the ceremony, and emphasized that &quot;the mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is not in line with my Jewish values.&quot; She added, &quot;Because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power&quot;. Later in 2018, Portman criticized the passing of the highly controversial and widely criticized Nation-State Bill, describing the law as &quot;racist, and there’s nothing else to say about that.&quot; She is also a member of the One Voice movement. 

October 18, 2023, Portman called for the release of hostages held by Hamas and condemned their actions. She also advocated for Israeli children who have been kidnapped, urging support for their release. Additionally, she publicized information about Dror Israel on Instagram to raise funds for children near the Gaza border and called on the Red Cross to address ongoing breaches of International Humanitarian Law within Israel. On November 12, 2023, she took part in the &quot;March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism&quot; in Paris in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel–Hamas war. 

==Personal life==

Portman is a polyglot, and speaks English, Hebrew, French, German, Japanese and Arabic, to various degrees. In 2006, Portman expressed a strong connection to her Jewish identity, particularly in Israel, and shared her desire to raise her children Jewish: &quot;A priority for me is definitely that I&#x27;d like to raise my kids Jewish, but the ultimate thing is to have someone who is a good person and who is a partner.&quot; Portman has discreetly dated actors Zach Braff and Jake Gyllenhaal. She married French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, with whom she shares two children. The couple met in 2009 while working together on &quot;Black Swan&quot;, and wed on August 4, 2012, in a Jewish ceremony in Big Sur, California. 

In 2013, she was living in Los Angeles. After Millepied was appointed director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, the family relocated to Paris in the autumn of 2014, where Portman also expressed interest in obtaining French citizenship. In January 2014, Millepied announced that he was in the process of converting to Judaism. In 2017, she bought a Montecito mansion, which she sold in 2021 for $8 million. In early 2023, reports surfaced alleging an extramarital affair by Millepied. The couple never publicly addressed the claims. On March 8, 2024, it was officially announced that Portman and Millepied had divorced.

<doc id="38461" wikidata="Q16848915" url="?curid=38461" title="Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote">
<text>Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s sleeping giant quotation is a film quote attributed to Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto regarding the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by forces of Imperial Japan.
The quotation is portrayed at the very end of the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; as:
Vermont Royster offers a possible origin to the phrase attributed to Napoleon, &quot;China is a sickly, sleeping giant. But when she awakes the world will tremble&quot;.

An abridged version of the quotation is also featured in the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. The 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot; also features Yamamoto speaking aloud the sleeping giant quote.

==Overview==
The director of &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, Richard Fleischer, stated that while Yamamoto may never have said those words, the film&#x27;s producer, Elmo Williams, had found the line written in Yamamoto&#x27;s diary. Williams, in turn, has stated that Larry Forrester, the screenwriter, found a 1943 letter from Yamamoto to the Admiralty in Tokyo containing the quotation. However, Forrester cannot produce the letter, nor can anyone else, American or Japanese, recall it or find it. Randall Wallace, the screenwriter of the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, readily admitted that he copied the line from &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;

Yamamoto did believe that Japan could not win a protracted war with the United States. Moreover, he seemed later to have believed that the Pearl Harbor attack had been a blunder strategically, morally, and politically, even though he was the person who originated the idea of a surprise attack on the military installation. It is recorded that while all his staff members were celebrating, &quot;Yamamoto alone&quot; spent the day after Pearl Harbor &quot;sunk in apparent depression&quot;. Yamamoto was upset by the bungling of the Foreign Ministry, which led to the attack happening while the countries were still at peace, thus, along with other factors, making the incident an unprovoked surprise attack that enraged American public opinion.

On December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, an inspirational statement was made by Don McNeill during the NBC radio broadcast of Don McNeill’s Breakfast Club. His statement ended: 
A portion of the broadcast was replayed on the Pearl Harbor attack-themed episode of the Smithsonian Channel documentary program, &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; (S1:E1). 

In &quot;The Reluctant Admiral&quot;, Hiroyuki Agawa gives a quotation from a reply by Yamamoto to Ogata Taketora on January 9, 1942, which is similar to the famous version: &quot;A military man can scarcely pride himself on having &#x27;smitten a sleeping enemy&#x27;; it is more a matter of shame, simply, for the one smitten. I would rather you made your appraisal after seeing what the enemy does, since it is certain that, angered and outraged, he will soon launch a determined counterattack.&quot;
The other common quotation attributed to Yamamoto predicting the future outcome of a naval war against the United States is, &quot;I can run wild for six months... after that, I have no expectation of success&quot;. As it happened, the Battle of Midway, the critical naval battle considered to be the turning point of the War in the Pacific, concluded exactly 6 months after the Pearl Harbor attack.

Similar to the above quotation was another quotation: Yamamoto, when once asked his opinion on the war, pessimistically said that the only way for Japan to win the war was to dictate terms in the White House. Yamamoto&#x27;s meaning was that military victory, in a protracted war against an opponent with as much of a population and industrial advantage as the United States possessed, was completely impossible, a rebuff to the &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; Decisive Battle Doctrine of those who thought that winning a single major battle against the United States Navy would end the war, just as the Japanese victory in the Battle of Tsushima had ended the Russo-Japanese War in 1905.

Yamamoto&#x27;s quote about peace terms in the White House was abridged by Japanese propaganda to make it seem like an optimistic prediction; this version was promptly picked up by American propaganda to look even more boastful (see illustration).

<text>Fall back is a feature of a modem protocol in data communication whereby two communicating modems which experience data corruption (due to line noise, for example) can renegotiate with each other to use a lower-speed connection. Fall forward is a corresponding feature whereby two modems which have &quot;fallen back&quot; to a lower speed can later return to the higher speed if the connection improves.

A common feature modems was the concept of fallback, allowing them to talk to less-capable modems. During the call initiation the modem would play a series of signals into the line and wait for the remote modem to &quot;answer&quot; them. They would start at high speeds and progressively get slower and slower until they heard an answer. Thus, two USR modems would be able to connect at 9600 bit/s, but, when a user with a 2400-bit/s modem called in, the USR would &quot;fall back&quot; to the common 2400-bit/s speed. This would also happen if a V.32 modem and a HST modem were connected. Because they used a different standard at 9600 bit/s, they would fall back to their highest commonly supported standard at 2400 bit/s. The same applies to V.32bis and 14400 bit/s HST modem, which would still be able to communicate with each other at only 2400 bit/s.

A modem that can fall back in order to communicate with an older, slower modem is an example of backward compatibility, while one that can fall back in order to communicate when the line becomes noisy is an example of graceful degradation.

<doc id="38468" wikidata="Q208118" url="?curid=38468" title="Psilocybin">
<text>Psilocybin, also known as 4-phosphoryloxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (4-PO-DMT), is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by more than 200 species of mushrooms. Effects include euphoria, hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and perceived spiritual experiences. It can also cause adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks. Its effects depend on set and setting and one&#x27;s expectations.
Psilocybin is a prodrug of psilocin. That is, the compound itself is biologically inactive but quickly converted by the body to psilocin. Psilocybin is transformed into psilocin by dephosphorylation mediated via phosphatase enzymes. Psilocin is chemically related to the neurotransmitter serotonin and acts as a non-selective agonist of the serotonin receptors. Activation of one serotonin receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, is specifically responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of psilocin and other serotonergic psychedelics. Psilocybin is usually taken orally. By this route, its onset is about 20 to 50minutes, peak effects occur after around 60 to 90minutes, and its duration is about 4 to 6hours.
Imagery in cave paintings and rock art of modern-day Algeria and Spain suggests that human use of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In Mesoamerica, the mushrooms had long been consumed in spiritual and divinatory ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In 1958, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann isolated psilocybin and psilocin from the mushroom &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot;. His employer, Sandoz, marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in psychedelic therapy. Increasingly restrictive drug laws of the 1960s and the 1970s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, but its popularity as an entheogen (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.

Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and psilocybin has been classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Psilocybin is being studied as a possible medicine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression and obsessive–compulsive disorder and other conditions such as cluster headaches. It is in late-stage clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression.

==History==
===Early===
There is evidence to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. The Tassili Mushroom Figure was discovered in Tassili, Algeria, and is believed to depict psychedelic mushrooms and the transformation of the user under their influence. The paintings are said to date back to 9000-7000 BC.

6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as &quot;Psilocybe hispanica&quot;, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.

Some scholars have also interpreted archaeological artifacts from Mexico and the so-called Mayan &quot;mushroom stones&quot; of Guatemala as evidence of ritual and ceremonial use of psychoactive mushrooms in the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica. In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the mushrooms were called &quot;teonanácatl&quot;—literally &quot;divine mushroom&quot;: the agglutinative form of teō(tl) (&quot;god&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;) and nanācatl (&quot;mushroom&quot;) in Nahuatl. After Spanish explorers of the New World arrived in the 16th century, chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes. According to the Dominican friar Diego Durán in &quot;The History of the Indies of New Spain&quot; (published c. 1581), mushrooms were eaten in festivities conducted on the occasion of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1502. The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún wrote of witnessing mushroom use in the Florentine Codex (published 1545–1590), and described how some merchants would celebrate upon returning from a successful business trip by consuming mushrooms to evoke revelatory visions. After the defeat of the Aztecs, the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered &quot;pagan idolatry&quot;, including ceremonial mushroom use. For the next four centuries, the Indians of Mesoamerica hid their use of entheogens from the Spanish authorities.

Dozens of species of psychedelic mushrooms are found in Europe, but there is little documented usage of them in Old World history besides the use of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; among Siberian peoples. The few existing accounts that mention psilocybin mushrooms typically lack sufficient information to allow species identification, focusing on their effects. For example, Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius (1526–1609) described the &quot;bolond gomba&quot; (&quot;crazy mushroom&quot;), used in rural Hungary to prepare love potions. English botanist John Parkinson included details about a &quot;foolish mushroom&quot; in his 1640 herbal &quot;Theatricum Botanicum&quot;. The first reliably documented report of intoxication with &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;—Europe&#x27;s most common and widespread psychedelic mushroom—involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London&#x27;s Green Park.

===Modern===

American banker and amateur ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson and his wife, Valentina P. Wasson, a physician, studied the ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by the native population in the Mazatec village Huautla de Jiménez, Mexico. In 1957, Wasson described the psychedelic visions he experienced during these rituals in &quot;Seeking the Magic Mushroom&quot;, an article published in the American weekly &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Later the same year they were accompanied on a follow-up expedition by French mycologist Roger Heim, who identified several of the mushrooms as &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species.

Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France and sent samples for analysis to Albert Hofmann, a chemist employed by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz (now Novartis). Hofmann—who had synthesized lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in 1938—led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin from &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot;, publishing their results in 1958. The team was aided in the discovery process by Hofmann&#x27;s willingness to ingest mushroom extracts to help verify the presence of the active compounds.

Next, Hofmann&#x27;s team synthesized several structural analogs of these compounds to examine how these structural changes affect psychoactivity. This research led to the development of ethocybin and CZ-74. Because these compounds&#x27; physiological effects last only about three and a half hours (about half as long as psilocybin&#x27;s), they proved more manageable for use in psycholytic therapy. Sandoz also marketed and sold pure psilocybin under the name Indocybin to clinicians and researchers worldwide. There were no reports of serious complications when psilocybin was used in this way.

In the early 1960s, Harvard University became a testing ground for psilocybin through the efforts of Timothy Leary and his associates Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (who later changed his name to Ram Dass). Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz Pharmaceuticals. Some studies, such as the Concord Prison Experiment, suggested promising results using psilocybin in clinical psychiatry. But according to a 2008 review of safety guidelines in human hallucinogenic research, Leary&#x27;s and Alpert&#x27;s well-publicized termination from Harvard and later advocacy of hallucinogen use &quot;further undermined an objective scientific approach to studying these compounds&quot;. In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public, psilocybin and other hallucinogenic drugs were unfavorably covered in the press and faced increasingly restrictive laws. In the U.S., laws passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year. In 1970, Congress passed &quot;The Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act&quot; that made LSD, peyote, psilocybin, and other hallucinogens illegal to use for any purpose, including scientific research. United States politicians&#x27; agenda against LSD usage had swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit drugs. Such restrictions on the use of these drugs in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being &quot;professionally marginalized&quot;. Although Hofmann tested these compounds on himself, he never advocated their legalization or medical use. In his 1979 book &quot;LSD—mein Sorgenkind&quot; (&quot;LSD—My Problem Child&quot;), he described the problematic use of these hallucinogens as inebriants.

Despite the legal restrictions on psilocybin use, the 1970s witnessed the emergence of psilocybin as the &quot;entheogen of choice&quot;. This was due in large part to wide dissemination of information on the topic, which included works such as those by Carlos Castaneda and several books that taught the technique of growing psilocybin mushrooms. One of the most popular of the latter group, &quot;Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower&#x27;s Guide&quot;, was published in 1976 under the pseudonyms O. T. Oss and O. N. Oeric by Jeremy Bigwood, Dennis J. McKenna, K. Harrison McKenna, and Terence McKenna. Over 100,000 copies were sold by 1981. As ethnobiologist Jonathan Ott explains, &quot;These authors adapted San Antonio&#x27;s technique (for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate; San Antonio 1971) to the production of &quot;Psilocybe [Stropharia] cubensis&quot;. The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements, and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his own home, without access to sophisticated technology, equipment or chemical supplies.&quot; San Antonio&#x27;s technique describes a method to grow the common edible mushroom &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;.

Because of lack of clarity about laws concerning psilocybin mushrooms, specifically in the form of sclerotia (also known as &quot;truffles&quot;), in the late 1990s and early 2000s European retailers commercialized and marketed them in smartshops in the Netherlands, the UK, and online. Several websites emerged that contributed to the accessibility of information on the mushrooms&#x27; description, use, and effects, and users exchanged mushroom experiences. Since 2001, six EU countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage. In the 1990s, hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again the subject of scientific study, particularly in Europe. Advances in neuropharmacology and neuropsychology and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe the &quot;neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations&quot;. Recent studies in the U.S. have attracted attention from the popular press and brought psilocybin back into the limelight.

==Reported effects==
The effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on the mindset and environment in which the user has the experience: factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers (from various backgrounds) in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. 98 of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those in groups of more than eight felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six) were seen as more supportive and reported more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists&#x27; creativity.

After ingesting psilocybin, the user may experience a wide range of emotional effects which can include: feelings of disorientation, lethargy, giddiness, euphoria, joy, and depression. In one study, 31% of volunteers given a high dose reported feelings of significant fear and 17% experienced transient paranoia. In studies at Johns Hopkins, among those given a moderate dose (but still enough to &quot;give a high probability of a profound and beneficial experience&quot;), negative experiences were rare, whereas one-third of those given a high dose experienced anxiety or paranoia. Low doses can induce hallucinatory effects. Closed-eye hallucinations may occur, where the affected individual sees multicolored geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences. Some individuals report synesthesia, such as tactile sensations when viewing colors. At higher doses, psilocybin can lead to &quot;intensification of affective responses, enhanced ability for introspection, regression to primitive and childlike thinking, and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional undertones&quot;. Open-eye visual hallucinations are common, and may be very detailed, although rarely confused with reality.

===Physical effects===
Common responses include pupil dilation (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes in blood pressure (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). Psilocybin&#x27;s sympathomimetic or cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, are usually mild. On average, peak heart rate is increased by 5bpm, peak systolic blood pressure is increased by 10 to 15mmHg, and peak diastolic blood pressure is increased by 5 to 10mmHg. But temporary increases in blood pressure can be a risk factor for users with preexisting hypertension. Psilocybin&#x27;s somatic effects have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of clubgoers in the UK found that over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the preceding year experienced nausea or vomiting, although this was caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.

===Psychiatric effects and perceptual disturbances===
Psilocybin is known to strongly influence the subjective experience of the passage of time. Users often feel as if time is slowed down, resulting in the perception that &quot;minutes appear to be hours&quot; or &quot;time is standing still&quot;. Studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects&#x27; ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2.5 seconds, impairs their ability to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 seconds, and reduces their preferred tapping rate. These results are consistent with the drug&#x27;s role in affecting prefrontal cortex activity, and the role that the prefrontal cortex is known to play in time perception. However, the neurochemical basis of psilocybin&#x27;s effects on the perception of time are not known with certainty.

Users having a pleasant experience can feel a sense of connection to others, nature, and the universe; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified. Users having an unpleasant experience (a &quot;bad trip&quot;) describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase &quot;bad trip&quot; is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just a transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including &quot;tripping&quot; during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: set and setting). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip. Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or mescaline. However, in the &quot;Psychedelics Encyclopedia&quot;, author Peter Stafford noted, &quot;The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating. It tends to build connections between people, who are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD.&quot;

=== Theory of mind network and default mode network ===
Psychedelics, including psilocybin, have been shown to affect different clusters of brain regions known as the &quot;theory of mind network&quot; (ToMN) and the default mode network (DMN). The ToMN involves making inferences and understanding social situations based on patterns whereas, the DMN relates more to introspection and one&#x27;s sense of self. The DMN in particular is related to increased rumination and worsening self-image in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In studies done with single use psilocybin, areas of the DMN showed decreased functional connectivity (communication between areas of the brain). This provides functional insight into the work of psilocybin in increasing one&#x27;s sense of connection to one&#x27;s surroundings, as the areas of the brain involved in introspection decrease in functionality under the effects of the drug. Conversely, areas of the brain involved in the ToMN showed increased activity and functional activation in response to psychedelics. These results were not unique to psilocybin and there was no significant difference in brain activation found in similar trials of mescaline and LSD. Information and studies into the DMN and ToMN are relatively sparse and their connections to other psychiatric illnesses and the use of psychedelics is still largely unknown.

=== Group perceptions ===
Through further anthropological studies regarding &quot;personal insights&quot; and the psychosocial effects of psilocybin, it can be seen in many traditional societies that powerful mind-active substances such as psilocybin are regularly &quot;consumed ritually for therapeutic purposes or for transcending normal, everyday reality&quot;. Positive effects that psilocybin has on individuals can be observed by taking on an anthropological approach and moving away from the Western biomedical view; this is aided by the studies done by Leary. Within certain traditional societies, where the use of psilocybin is frequent for shamanic healing rituals, group collectives praise their guide, healer and shaman for helping alleviate their pains, aches and hurt. They do this through a group ritual practice where the group, or just the guide, ingests psilocybin to help extract any &quot;toxic psychic residues or sorcerous implants&quot; found in one&#x27;s body.

Group therapies using &quot;classic&quot; psychedelics are becoming more commonly used in the Western world in clinical practice. This is speculated to grow, provided the evidence remains indicative of their safety and efficacy. In social sense, the group is shaped by their experiences surrounding psilocybin and how they view the plant collectively. As mentioned in the anthropology article, the group partakes in a &quot;journey&quot; together, thus adding to the spiritual, social body where roles, hierarchies and gender are subjectively understood.

=== Adverse effects ===
Most of the comparatively few fatal incidents that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs, especially alcohol. A common adverse effect resulting from psilocybin mushroom use involves &quot;bad trips&quot; or panic reactions, in which affected individuals become anxious, confused, agitated, or disoriented. Accidents, self-injury, or suicide attempts can result from serious cases of acute psychotic episodes. Although no studies have linked psilocybin with birth defects, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid its usage.

==== Toxicity ====
Psilocybin has low toxicity, indicating that it has low potential for inducing life-threatening events like breathing or heart problems. Research shows that health risks may develop with use of psilocybin. Nonetheless, hospitalizations from it are rare, and overdoses are generally mild and self-limiting.

A review regarding the management of psychedelic overdoses suggested that psilocybin-related overdose management should prioritize managing the immediate adverse effects, such as anxiety and paranoia, rather than specific pharmacological interventions, as psilocybin&#x27;s physiological toxicity tends to be rather limited. One analysis of people hospitalized from psilocybin poisoning found high urine concentrations of phenethylamine (PEA), indicating that PEA may contribute to the effects of psilocybin poisoning.

In rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), approximately one and a half times that of caffeine. The lethal dose of psilocybin when administered intravenously in mice is 285mg/kg and in rats is 280 mg/kg. When administered intravenously in rabbits, psilocybin&#x27;s LD50 is approximately 12.5 mg/kg. Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; mushrooms, and so nearly of dried mushrooms, or of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams, 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams. The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances assigns psilocybin a relatively high therapeutic index of 641 (higher values correspond to a better safety profile); for comparison, the therapeutic indices of aspirin and nicotine are 199 and 21, respectively. The lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown, and has rarely been documented—, only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms (without concurrent use of other drugs) have been reported in the scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin.

==== Psychiatric ====
Panic reactions can occur after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, especially if the ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions have been reported in the literature. A 2005 survey, conducted in the United Kingdom, found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects, less frequently reported, include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.

The similarity of psilocybin-induced symptoms to those of schizophrenia has made the drug a useful research tool in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of this psychotic disorder. In both cases, psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a &quot;deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information&quot; in the brain that ultimately lead to &quot;cognitive fragmentation and psychosis&quot;. Flashbacks (spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience) can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is characterized by a continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by psychedelic substances. Neither flashbacks nor HPPD are commonly associated with psilocybin usage, and correlations between HPPD and psychedelics are further obscured by polydrug use and other variables.

==== Tolerance and dependence ====
Tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin more than about once a week can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.

Repeated use of psilocybin does not lead to physical dependence. A 2008 study concluded that, based on US data from the period 2000–2002, adolescent-onset (defined here as ages 11–17) usage of hallucinogenic drugs (including psilocybin) did not increase the risk of drug dependence in adulthood; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, anxiolytic medicines, and stimulants, all of which were associated with &quot;an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence&quot;. Likewise, a 2010 Dutch study ranked the relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 recreational drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, and tobacco. Psilocybin mushrooms were ranked as the illicit drug with the lowest harm, corroborating conclusions reached earlier by expert groups in the United Kingdom.

==Cultural significance and &quot;mystical&quot; experiences==
Psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in Indigenous American cultures in religious, divinatory, or spiritual contexts. Reflecting the meaning of the word &quot;entheogen&quot; (&quot;the god within&quot;), the mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual sacraments that provide access to sacred worlds. Typically used in small group community settings, they enhance group cohesion and reaffirm traditional values. Terence McKenna documented the worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural ethos relating to the Earth and mysteries of nature, and suggested that mushrooms enhanced self-awareness and a sense of contact with a &quot;Transcendent Other&quot;—reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature.

Psychedelic drugs can induce states of consciousness that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined; these states are called mystical experiences. Some scholars have proposed that many of the qualities of a drug-induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through non-drug techniques, such as meditation or holotropic breathwork. In the 1960s, Walter Pahnke and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences (which they called &quot;mystical consciousness&quot;) by categorizing their common features. These categories, according to Pahnke, &quot;describe the core of a universal psychological experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations&quot;, and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative, numerical scale.

In the 1962 Marsh Chapel Experiment, which was run by Pahnke at the Harvard Divinity School under the supervision of Timothy Leary, almost all of the graduate degree divinity student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences. One of the participants was religious scholar Huston Smith, author of several textbooks on comparative religion; he later described his experience as &quot;the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced.&quot; In a 25-year followup to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of &quot;a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life&quot;. Psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the double-blind procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, he said that the study cast &quot;a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist William A. Richards, who in a 2007 review stated &quot;[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry.&quot;

A group of researchers from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine led by Roland Griffiths conducted a study to assess the immediate and long-term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience, using a modified version of the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double-blind procedure. When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary&#x27;s, Griffiths explained the difference: &quot;We are conducting rigorous, systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s.&quot; The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a &quot;complete mystical experience&quot; after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme &quot;experience of fear&quot; or dysphoria (i.e., a &quot;bad trip&quot;) at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject&#x27;s sense of well-being.

A follow-up study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.

While many recent studies have concluded that psilocybin can cause mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance, not all the medical community agree. Paul R. McHugh, formerly director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Johns Hopkins, responded as follows in a book review: &quot;The unmentioned fact in &quot;The Harvard Psychedelic Club&quot; is that LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and the like produce not a &quot;higher consciousness&quot; but rather a particular kind of &quot;lower consciousness&quot; known well to psychiatrists and neurologists—namely, &#x27;toxic delirium.&#x27;&quot;

===Available forms===
Although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically, outside of the research setting it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing an herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.

==Chemistry==
===Physical properties===
Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring substituted tryptamine that features an indole ring linked to an aminoethyl substituent. It is structurally related to serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter which is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. Psilocybin is a member of the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenin, found in the skin of certain amphibians, especially the Colorado River toad.

Psilocybin is a white, crystalline solid that is soluble in water, methanol and ethanol but insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as chloroform and petroleum ether. It has a melting point between , and an ammonia-like taste. Its pKa values are estimated to be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate hydroxy groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so it typically exists as a zwitterionic structure. There are two known crystalline polymorphs of psilocybin, as well as reported hydrated phases. Psilocybin rapidly oxidizes upon exposure to light—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard.

===Structural analogues===
Structural analogues of psilocybin (4-PO-DMT; &quot;O&quot;-phosphorylpsilocin) and psilocin (4-HO-DMT) include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin; &quot;O&quot;-acetylpsilocin), 4-PrO-DMT (&quot;O&quot;-propionylpsilocin), psilomethoxin (4-HO-5-MeO-DMT; 5-methoxypsilocin), ethocybin (4-PO-DET), baeocystin (4-PO-NMT), aeruginascin (4-PO-TMT), and norbaeocystin (4-PO-T), among others.

===Laboratory synthesis===
Albert Hofmann et al. were the first team to synthesize psilocybin in 1958. Since that time, various chemists have improved the methods for the laboratory synthesis and purification of psilocybin. In particular, Shirota et al. reported a novel method in 2003 for the synthesis of psilocybin at the gram scale from 4-hydroxyindole that does not require chromatographic purification. Fricke et al. described an enzymatic pathway for the synthesis of psilocybin and psilocin, publishing their results in 2017. Sherwood et al. significantly improved upon Shirota&#x27;s method (producing at the kilogram scale while employing less expensive reagents), publishing their results in 2020.

===Biosynthesis===
Isotopic labeling experiments from the 1960s suggested that the biosynthesis of psilocybin was a four-step process:

# Decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine
# &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethylation of tryptamine at the N9 position to dimethyltryptamine
# 4-Hydroxylation of dimethyltryptamine to psilocin
# &quot;O&quot;-Phosphorylation of psilocin to psilocybin

This process can be seen in the following diagram:

More recent research has demonstrated that—at least in &quot;P. cubensis&quot;—&quot;O&quot;-phosphorylation is in fact the third step, and that neither dimethyltryptamine nor psilocin are intermediates. The sequence of the intermediate steps has been shown to involve four enzymes (PsiD, PsiH, PsiK, and PsiM) in &quot;P. cubensis&quot; and &quot;P. cyanescens&quot;, although it is possible that the biosynthetic pathway differs between species. These enzymes are encoded in gene clusters in &quot;Psilocybe, Panaeolus,&quot; and &quot;Gymnopilus&quot;.

&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; has been genetically modified to manufacture large amounts of psilocybin. Psilocybin can be produced &quot;de novo&quot; in GM yeast.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic that acts as a prodrug of psilocin, the active form of the drug. Psilocin is a close analogue of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin and, like serotonin, acts as a non-selective agonist of the serotonin receptors, including behaving as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It shows high affinity for most of the serotonin receptors, with the notable exception of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Psilocin&#x27;s affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is 15-fold higher in humans than in rats due to species differences. In addition to interacting with the serotonin receptors, psilocin is a partial serotonin releasing agent with lower potency. Unlike certain other psychedelics such as LSD, it appears to show little affinity for many other targets, such as dopamine receptors. Psilocin is an agonist of the mouse and rat but not human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).

Psilocybin&#x27;s and psilocin&#x27;s psychedelic effects are mediated specifically by agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like volinanserin block the head-twitch response (HTR), a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, induced by psilocybin in rodents, and the HTR is similarly absent in serotonin 5-HT2A receptor knockout mice. There is a significant relationship between psilocybin&#x27;s hallucinogenic effects and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor occupancy in humans. Psilocybin&#x27;s psychedelic effects can be blocked by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like ketanserin and risperidone in humans. Activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in layer V of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and consequent glutamate release in this area has been especially implicated in the hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin and other serotonergic psychedelics. In addition, region-dependent alterations in brain glutamate levels may be related to the experience of ego dissolution. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activation seems to inhibit the hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics.

Although serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism mediates the hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin and psilocin, activation of other serotonin receptors also appears to contribute to these compounds&#x27; psychoactive and behavioral effects. Some of psilocybin&#x27;s non-hallucinogenic behavioral effects in animals can be reversed by antagonists of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. Psilocybin produces profoundly decreased locotomotor and investigatory behavior in rodents, and this appears to be dependent on serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activation but not on activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors. In addition, the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor has been found to be required for psilocybin&#x27;s persisting antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects as well as acute hypolocomotion in animals. In humans, ketanserin blocked psilocybin&#x27;s hallucinogenic effects but not all of its cognitive and behavioral effects. Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor activation and downstream inhibition of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway may be involved in the limited addictive potential of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin.

In addition to its psychedelic effects, psilocin has been found to produce psychoplastogenic effects in animals, including dendritogenesis, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis. It has been found to promote neuroplasticity in the brain in a rapid, robust, and sustained manner with a single dose. These effects appear to be mediated by intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. The psychoplastogenic effects of psilocybin and other serotonergic psychedelics may be involved in their potential therapeutic benefits in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression. They may also be involved in the effects of microdosing. Psilocin has also been reported to act as a highly potent positive allosteric modulator of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), one of the receptors of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). But psilocybin has been found to inhibit hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents.

Psilocybin produces profound anti-inflammatory effects mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation in preclinical studies. These effects have a potency similar to that of (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI, and its anti-inflammatory effects occur at far lower doses than those that produce hallucinogen-like effects in animals. Psilocybin&#x27;s anti-inflammatory effects might be involved in its potential antidepressant benefits and might also have other therapeutic applications, such as treatment of asthma and neuroinflammation. They may also be involved in microdosing effects. But psychedelics have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects only in the setting of preexisting inflammation and may be pro-inflammatory outside that context. Psilocybin has been found to have a large, long-lasting impact on the intestinal microbiome and to influence the gut–brain axis in animals. These effects are partially but not fully dependent on its activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A and/or 5-HT2C receptors. Some of psilocybin&#x27;s behavioral and potential therapeutic effects may be mediated by changes to the gut microbiome. Transplantation of intestinal contents of psilocybin-treated rodents to untreated rodents resulted in behavioral changes consistent with those of psilocybin administration.

Psilocybin and other psychedelics produce sympathomimetic effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, by activating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Long-term repeated use of psilocybin may result in risk of cardiac valvulopathy and other complications by activating serotonin 5-HT2B receptors.

There is little or no acute tolerance with psilocybin, and hence its duration is dictated by pharmacokinetics rather than by pharmacodynamics. Conversely, tolerance and tachyphylaxis rapidly develop to psilocybin&#x27;s psychedelic effects with repeated administration in humans. In addition, there is cross-tolerance with the hallucinogenic effects of other psychedelics such as LSD. Psilocybin produces downregulation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in the brain in animals, an effect thought to be responsible for the development of tolerance to its psychedelic effects. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptors appear to slowly return over the course of days to weeks after psilocybin administration.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
There has been little research on psilocybin&#x27;s bioavailability. Its oral bioavailability, as its active form psilocin, was about 55.0% (± ~20%) relative to intravenous administration in one small older study (n=3). After oral administration, psilocybin is detectable in the blood circulation within 20 to 40minutes, and psilocin is detectable after 30minutes. The mean time to peak levels for psilocin is 1.05 to 3.71hours in different studies, with most around 2hours and the upper limit of 3.71hours being an outlier.

Psilocybin, in terms of psilocin, shows clear linear or dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. Maximal concentrations of psilocin were 11ng/mL, 17ng/mL, and 21ng/mL with oral psilocybin doses of 15, 25, and 30mg psilocybin, respectively. The maximal levels of psilocin have been found to range from 8.2ng/mL to 37.6ng/mL across a dose range of 14 to 42mg. The dose-normalized peak concentration of psilocin is about 0.8ng/mL/mg. The interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin is relatively small. There is a very strong positive correlation between dose and psilocin peak levels (R2 = 0.95). The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin have not been reported and are unknown, but no clear sign of food effects has been observed in preliminary analyses. It has also been said that food might delay absorption, reduce peak levels, and reduce bioavailability.

====Distribution====
Psilocin, the active form of psilocybin, is extensively distributed to all tissues through the bloodstream. Its volume of distribution is 505 to 1,267L. Psilocybin itself is hydrophilic due to its phosphate group and cannot easily cross the blood–brain barrier. Conversely, psilocin is lipophilic and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier to exert effects in the central nervous system. The plasma protein binding of psilocybin is 66% and hence it is moderately plasma protein-bound.

Psilocin (4-HO-DMT) is a close positional isomer of bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), which shows peripheral selectivity, and might be expected to have similarly restricted lipophilicity and blood–brain barrier permeability. But psilocin appears to form a tricyclic pseudo-ring system wherein its hydroxyl group and amine interact through hydrogen bonding. This in turn makes psilocin much less polar, more lipophilic, and more able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert central actions than it would be otherwise. It may also protect psilocin from metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO). In contrast, bufotenin is not able to achieve this pseudo-ring system. Accordingly, bufotenin is less lipophilic than psilocin in terms of partition coefficient. But bufotenin does still show significant central permeability and, like psilocybin, can produce robust hallucinogenic effects in humans.

====Metabolism====
Psilocybin is dephosphorylated into its active form psilocin in the body. Psilocybin is metabolized in the intestines, liver, kidneys, blood, and other tissues and bodily fluids. There is significant first-pass metabolism of psilocybin and psilocin with oral administration. No psilocybin has been detected in the blood in humans after oral administration, suggesting virtually complete dephosphorylation into psilocin with the first pass. It is also said to be converted 90% to 97% into psilocin. The competitive phosphatase inhibitor β-glycerolphosphate, which inhibits psilocybin dephosphorylation, greatly attenuates the behavioral effects of psilocybin in rodents. Psilocybin undergoes dephosphorylation into psilocin via the acidic environment of the stomach or the actions of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and non-specific esterases in tissues and fluids.

Psilocin is demethylated and oxidatively deaminated by monoamine oxidase (MAO), specifically monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), into 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde (4-HIAL or 4-HIA). 4-HIAL is then further oxidated into 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (4-HIAA) by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) or into 4-hydroxytryptophol (4-HTOL or 4-HTP) by alcohol dehydrogenase (ALD). Deamination of psilocin by MAO-A appears to be responsible for about 4% or 33% of its metabolism in different studies. In contrast to psilocin, its metabolites 4-HIAA and 4-HTP showed no affinity for or activation of multiple serotonin receptors and are considered inactive. Based on &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, it has been estimated that MAO-A is responsible for about 81% of psilocin&#x27;s phase I hepatic metabolism. Psilocin and its metabolites are also glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs). UGT1A10 and UGT1A9 appear to be the most involved. Psilocybin&#x27;s glucuronidated metabolites include psilocin-&quot;O&quot;-glucuronide and 4-HIAA-&quot;O&quot;-glucuronide. Approximately 80% of psilocin in blood plasma is in conjugated form, and conjugated psilocin levels are about fourfold higher than levels of free psilocin. Plasma 4-HIAA levels are also much higher than those of free psilocin.

Norpsilocin (4-HO-NMT), formed from psilocin via demethylation mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, is known to occur in mice &quot;in vivo&quot; and with human recombinant CYP2D6 &quot;in vitro&quot; but was not detected in humans &quot;in vivo&quot;. An oxidized psilocin metabolite of unknown chemical structure is also formed by hydroxyindole oxidase activity of CYP2D6. Oxidized psilocin is possibly a quinone-type structure like psilocin iminoquinone (4-hydroxy-5-oxo-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-DMT) or psilocin hydroquinone (4,5-dihydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-DMT). Additional metabolites formed by CYP2D6 may also be present. Besides CYP2D6, CYP3A4 showed minor activity in metabolizing psilocin, though the produced metabolite is unknown. Other cytochrome P450 enzymes besides CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 appear unlikely to be involved in psilocin metabolism. CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes do not modify psilocin exposure in humans, suggesting that CYP2D6 is not critically involved in psilocin metabolism and is unlikely to result in interindividual differences in psilocin kinetics or effects. Psilocybin and psilocin might inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 to some extent, respectively.

====Elimination====
Psilocybin is eliminated 80% to 85% in urine and 15 to 20% in bile. It is excreted mainly in urine as psilocin-&quot;O&quot;-glucuronide. The drug was eliminated approximately 20% and 80% as psilocin &quot;O&quot;-glucuronide in different studies. The amount excreted as unchanged psilocin in urine is 1.5 to 3.4%. Studies conflict on the deaminated metabolites of psilocin, with one study finding that only 4% of psilocin is metabolized into 4-HIAA, 4-HIAL, and 4-HTOL and another that psilocybin is excreted 33% in urine as 4-HIAA. Findings also conflict on whether psilocybin can be detected in urine, with either no psilocybin excreted or 3% to 10% excreted as unchanged psilocybin. A majority of psilocybin and its metabolites is excreted within three hours with oral administration and elimination is almost complete within 24hours.

The elimination half-life of psilocybin, as psilocin, is 2.1 to 4.7hours on average (range 1.2–18.6hours) orally and 1.2hours (range 1.8–4.5hours) intravenously. Psilocin&#x27;s elimination half-life in mice is 0.9hours, much faster than in humans. Psilocin &quot;O&quot;-glucuronide&#x27;s half-life is about 4hours in humans and approximately 1hour in mice.

No dose adjustment of psilocin is thought to be required as psilocin is inactivated mainly via metabolism as opposed to renal elimination. Accordingly, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin.

====Miscellaneous====
The onset of action of psilocybin taken orally is about 20 to 50minutes and peak subjective effects occur at about 1.0 to 2.2hours (60–130minutes). The time to offset of psilocybin orally is about 6 to 7hours on average. The duration of action of psilocybin is about 4 to 6hours (range 3–12hours) orally. A small dose of 1mg by intravenous injection had a duration of 15 to 30minutes. The psychoactive effects and duration of psilocybin are strongly correlated with psilocin levels.

Single doses of psilocybin of 3 to 30mg have been found to dose-dependently occupy the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in humans as assessed by imaging studies. The for occupancy of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by psilocin in terms of circulating levels has been found to be 1.97ng/mL.

Body weight and body mass index do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin. This suggests that body weight-adjusted dosing of psilocybin is unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive and that fixed-dosing should be preferred. Similarly, age does not affect the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin. Sex has not been tested.

===Analytical methods===
Several relatively simple chemical tests—commercially available as reagent testing kits—can be used to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin reagent. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich&#x27;s reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin—making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.

Various chromatographic methods have been developed to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.

==Natural occurrence==
Psilocybin is present in varying concentrations in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: &quot;Psilocybe&quot; (116 species), &quot;Gymnopilus&quot; (14), &quot;Panaeolus&quot; (13), &quot;Copelandia&quot; (12), &quot;Hypholoma&quot; (6), &quot;Pluteus&quot; (6), &quot;Inocybe&quot; (6), &quot;Conocybe&quot; (4), &quot;Panaeolina&quot; (4), &quot;Gerronema&quot; (2), and &quot;Galerina&quot; (1 species). Guzmán increased his estimate of the number of psilocybin-containing &quot;Psilocybe&quot; to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the United States and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). The diversity of psilocybin mushrooms is reported to have been increased by horizontal transfer of the psilocybin gene cluster between unrelated mushroom species. In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species commonly found in the tropics include &quot;P. cubensis&quot; and &quot;P. subcubensis&quot;. &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;—considered by Guzmán to be the world&#x27;s most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom—is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although the presence or absence of psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.

Both the caps and the stems contain psychoactive compounds, although the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms do not contain psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early in the formation of fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 2.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.

The psilocybin contents of dried herbarium specimens of &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; in one study were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom&#x27;s potency.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===

====Advocacy for tolerance====
Despite being illegal to possess without authorization in many Western countries, such as the UK, Australia, and some U.S. states, less conservative governments nurture the legal possession and supply of psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs. In Amsterdam, authorities provide education on and promote the safe use of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, to reduce public harm. Similarly, religious groups like America&#x27;s Uniao do Vegetal (UDV) use psychedelics in traditional ceremonies. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that people may petition the DEA for exemptions to use psilocybin for religious purposes.

From 1 July 2023, the Australian medicines regulator has permitted psychiatrists to prescribe psilocybin for the therapeutic treatment of treatment-resistant depression.

Advocates of legalization argue there is a lack of evidence of harm, and potential use in treating certain mental health conditions. Research is difficult to conduct because of the legal status of psychoactive substances. Advocates of legalization also promote the utility of &quot;ego dissolution&quot; and argue bans are cultural discrimination against traditional users.

In 2024, after calls for regulatory and legal change to expand terminally ill populations&#x27; access to controlled substances, two legal cases related to expanded access began moving through the federal courts under right-to-try law. The Advanced Integrative Medicine Science (AIMS) Institute in concert with the NPA filed a series of lawsuits seeking both the rescheduling of and expanded right-to-try access to psilocybin.

===Usage===
A 2009 national survey of drug use by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the number of first-time psilocybin mushroom users in the United States was roughly equivalent to the number of first-time users of cannabis. A June 2024 report by the RAND Corporation suggests the total number of use days for psychedelics is two orders of magnitude smaller than it is for cannabis, and unlike people who use cannabis and many other drugs, infrequent users of psychedelics account for most of the total days of use. The 2024 report by the RAND Corporation suggests psilocybin mushrooms may be the most prevalent psychedelic drug among adults in the United States.

In European countries, the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults (15–34 years) range from 0.3% to 14.1%.

In modern Mexico, traditional ceremonial use survives among several indigenous groups, including the Nahuas, the Matlatzinca, the Totonacs, the Mazatecs, Mixes, Zapotecs, and the Chatino. Although hallucinogenic &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species are abundant in low-lying areas of Mexico, most ceremonial use takes places in mountainous areas of elevations greater than . Guzmán suggests this is a vestige of Spanish colonial influence from several hundred years earlier, when mushroom use was persecuted by the Catholic Church.

==Research==
Psilocybin has been a subject of clinical research since the early 1960s, when the Harvard Psilocybin Project evaluated the potential value of psilocybin as a treatment for certain personality disorders. Beginning in the 2000s, psilocybin has been investigated for its possible role in the treatment of nicotine dependence, alcohol dependence, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), cluster headache, cancer-related existential distress, anxiety disorders, and certain mood disorders. It is also being studied in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A systematic review published in 2021 found that the use of psilocybin as a pharmaceutical substance was associated with reduced intensity of depression symptoms. The role of psilocybin as a possible psychoplastogen is also being examined. It is under development by Compass Pathways, Cybin, and several other companies.

===Depression===
Clinical trials, including both open-label trials and double-blind randomized controlled trials, have found that single doses of psilocybin produce rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects outperforming placebo in people with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Combined with brief psychological support in a phase 2 trial, it has been found to produce dose-dependent improvements in depressive symptoms, with 25mg (a moderate dose) more effective than 10mg (a low dose) and 10mg more effective than 1mg (non-psychoactive and equivalent to placebo). The antidepressant effects of psilocybin with psychological support have been found to last at least 6weeks following a single dose.

However, some trials have not found psilocybin to significantly outperform placebo in the treatment of depression. In addition, a phase 2 trial found that two 25mg doses of psilocybin 3weeks apart versus daily treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (Lexapro) for 6weeks (plus two putatively non-psychoactive 1mg doses of psilocybin 3weeks apart) did not show a statistically significant difference in reduction of depressive symptoms between groups. However, reductions in depressive symptoms were numerically greater with psilocybin, some secondary measures favored psilocybin, and the rate of remission was statistically higher with psilocybin (57% with psilocybin vs. 28% with escitalopram). In any case, the antidepressant effect size of psilocybin over escitalopram appears to be small.

Functional unblinding by their psychoactive effects and positive psychological expectancy effects (i.e., the placebo effect) are major limitations and sources of bias of clinical trials of psilocybin and other psychedelics for treatment of depression. Relatedly, most of the therapeutic benefit of conventional antidepressants like the SSRIs for depression appears to be attributable to the placebo response. It has been proposed that psychedelics like psilocybin may in fact act as active &quot;super placebos&quot; when used for therapeutic purposes. As of September 2024, psilocybin and other psychedelics (excluding MDMA) have only been assessed in up to phase 2 clinical trials for psychiatric disorders and have not yet completed larger and more rigorous phase 3 trials or received regulatory approval for medical use.

A potential risk of frequent repeated use of psilocybin and other serotonergic psychedelics for psychiatric disorders is cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy caused by serotonin 5-HT2B receptor activation. However, single high doses or widely spaced doses (e.g., months) are widely thought to be safe and concerns about cardiac toxicity apply more to chronic psychedelic microdosing or very frequent use (e.g., weekly).

<text>Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as &quot;histories&quot; in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—&quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;—are also based on historical figures, but because their sources were foreign and ancient, they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare&#x27;s romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy, insofar as they feature a high-status central character, but they end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Almost three centuries after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, the scholar F. S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the &quot;problem play,&quot; for plays that do not fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. Scholars continue to disagree on how to categorize some Shakespearean plays.

==Chronology==

Below is the list of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays listed as tragedies in the First Folio, along with the date range in which each play is believed to have been written.
==Influences and sources==

The English Renaissance, when Shakespeare was writing, was fueled by a renewed interest in Roman and Greek classics and neighboring renaissance literature written years earlier in Italy, France, and Spain. Shakespeare wrote the majority of his tragedies under the rule of James I, and their darker contents may reflect the general mood of the country following the death of Elizabeth I, as well as James&#x27;s theatrical preferences. Shakespeare, as was customary for other playwrights in his day, used history, other plays, and non-dramatic literature as sources for his plays. Additionally, tragedy was a new and exciting theatrical phenomenon in the late 16th century, rather than an established and self-evident dramatic form; because of this, Shakespeare and his contemporaries&#x27; plays did not necessary fit into a single genre. In Elizabethan England there was no copyright law or protections against plagiarism, so characters, plots, and even whole phrases of poetry were considered common property. The majority of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies are based on historical figures, with the exception of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;, which are based on narrative fictions by Giraldi Cintio. The historical basis for Shakespeare&#x27;s Roman plays comes from &quot;The Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans&quot; by Plutarch, whereas the source of Shakespeare&#x27;s Britain-based plays and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (based on the Danish Prince Amleth) derive from &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;. Furthermore, the French author Belleforest published &quot;The Hystorie of Hamblet, Prince of Denmarke&quot; in 1582, which includes specifics from how the prince pretended madness, to how the prince stabbed and killed the King&#x27;s counsellor who was eavesdropping on Hamlet and his mother behind the arras in the Queen&#x27;s chamber. The story of Lear appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia regium Britanniae&quot; , and then in John Higgins&#x27; poem &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot; in 1574, as well as appearing in Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; in 1587. Some events that happen in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; were inspired by various episodes of Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; from 1590, while the nonsensical musings of Edgar&#x27;s &quot;poor Tom&quot; heavily reference Samuel Harsnett&#x27;s 1603 book, &quot;A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&quot;.

==Contemporary tragedy==

Tragedies from these eras traced their philosophical essence back to the Senecan tragedy, grounded in nobles who have a tragic flaw or commit a grave error (&quot;hamartia&quot;) which leads to their reversal of fortune (&quot;peripeteia&quot;). (However, some critics have argued that the &quot;pseudo-Aristotelian&quot; concept of the tragic flaw does not apply to Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic figures.) Revenge tragedy was another increasingly popular genre in this age; Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; is one example of this. Plays of this age were also decidedly secular, in contrast to the religious morality plays which, by this time, were outlawed by Elizabeth I. One marked difference between English renaissance tragedies and the classics that inspired them was the use and popularity of violence and murder on stage.

<text>Fidelio (; ), originally titled (&quot;Leonore, or The Triumph of Marital Love&quot;), Op. 72, is the sole opera by German composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The libretto was originally prepared by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly. The opera premiered at Vienna&#x27;s Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805. The following year, Beethoven&#x27;s friend Stephan von Breuning rewrote the libretto, shortening the work from three acts to two. After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke, a final version was performed at the Kärntnertortheater on 23 May 1814. As these libretto revisions were going on, Beethoven was also revising some of the music. By convention, only the final version is called &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and the others are referred to as &quot;Leonore&quot;.

The libretto tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard named &quot;Fidelio&quot;, rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison. Bouilly&#x27;s scenario fits Beethoven&#x27;s aesthetic and political outlook: a story of personal sacrifice, heroism, and eventual triumph. With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;middle period&quot;. Notable moments in the opera include the &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Chorus&quot; (&quot;O welche Lust&quot;—&quot;O what a joy&quot;), an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan&#x27;s vision of Leonore who comes as an angel to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place. The finale celebrates Leonore&#x27;s bravery with alternating contributions of soloists and chorus.

==Backdrop==
In its time, &quot;Fidelio&quot; was Beethoven&#x27;s contribution to an ongoing and successful tradition of operatic composition; a tradition harder to discern today because none of the operas involved, other than Beethoven&#x27;s, has survived into the modern reportory. The tradition was imported to Beethoven&#x27;s Vienna from Revolutionary France and involved work of many composers, most notably Luigi Cherubini, whose work Beethoven (unusually) strongly admired. The new French school arrived in Vienna in 1802 with the performance of Cherubini&#x27;s Lodoïska, and led, per Dean, to &quot;an avalanche of French operas, many of which became more popular in Vienna than in Paris.&quot; Many of these operas were so-called &quot;rescue operas&quot;, which Dean describes thus:
The ... singspiel form, the background of domestic realism tinged with comedy, the superposition of a heroic or patriotic story involving violence and often a spectacular catastrophe, a happy end produced not by a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; but by an act of superhuman courage, a strong ethical content tending to divide the characters into sheep and goats: this was the pattern of rescue opera ... Beethoven adopted it lock, stock, and barrel.
This new kind of heroic opera appealed far more to Beethoven than the (to him) frivolous-seeming dramas of character that had impelled Mozart&#x27;s earlier work. Beethoven, who heard Cherubini&#x27;s work in Vienna, joined the new trend with enthusiasm; and indeed &quot;Fidelio&quot; borrows its plot, characters, and (according to Dean) even certain musical devices from the work of Beethoven&#x27;s predecessors in the French rescue-opera tradition. These include Pierre Gaveaux&#x27;s opera &quot;Léonore, ou L&#x27;amour conjugal&quot; (1798) and Ferdinando Paer&#x27;s &quot;Leonora&quot; (1804).

==Composition and 19th century performance history==

&quot;Fidelio&quot; had a long and complicated history of composition. Beethoven revised &quot;Fidelio&quot; three times; the work caused Beethoven so much vexation that he vowed never to compose another opera.

The distant origin of &quot;Fidelio&quot; dates from 1803, when the librettist and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder worked out a contract with Beethoven to write an opera. The contract included free lodging for Beethoven in the apartment complex that was part of Schikaneder&#x27;s large suburban theater, the Theater an der Wien. Beethoven was to set a new libretto by Schikaneder, entitled &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot;; however, this libretto was not to Beethoven&#x27;s liking. He spent about a month composing music for it, then abandoned it when the possibility presented itself of joining the new, to Beethoven more meaningful, French heroic tradition.

The time Beethoven spent on &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot; was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Pizarro&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Ha! Welch&#x27; ein Augenblick!&quot; and the duet &quot;O namenlose Freude&quot; for Leonore and Florestan, both originated as music for &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot;. Beethoven continued to live at the Theater an der Wien for some time after he had abandoned &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot; for &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and was eventually freed from his obligations to Schikaneder after the latter was fired from his post as theater director in 1804.
&quot;Fidelio&quot; itself, which Beethoven began in 1804 immediately after giving up on &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot;, was first performed in 1805 and was extensively revised by the composer for subsequent performances in 1806 and 1814. Although Beethoven used the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;Leonore, or The Triumph of Married Love&quot;), the 1805 performances were billed as &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the theatre&#x27;s insistence, to avoid confusion with the operas by Gaveaux and Paer mentioned above. 

Beethoven published the 1806 libretto and, in 1810, a vocal score under the title &quot;Leonore&quot;. The current convention is to use the name &quot;Leonore&quot; for both the 1805 (three-act) and 1806 (two-act) versions and &quot;Fidelio&quot; only for the final 1814 revision.

The first version, with a three-act German libretto adapted by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, premiered at the Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805, with additional performances the following two nights. The success of these performances was hindered by the fact that Vienna was under French military occupation, and most of the audience were French military officers who had little interest in German opera.

After this premiere, Beethoven&#x27;s friends suggested he revise and shorten the opera into just two acts, and he did so with the help of his close friend, Stephan von Breuning. The composer also wrote a new overture (now known as &quot;Leonore No.3&quot;; see below). In this form, the opera was first performed on 29 March and 10 April 1806, with greater success. Further performances were prevented by a disagreement between Beethoven and the theatre management.

In 1814, Beethoven revised his opera yet again, with additional work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke. This version was first performed at the Kärntnertortheater on 23 May 1814, again under the title &quot;Fidelio&quot;. The 17-year-old Franz Schubert was in the audience, having sold his school books to obtain a ticket. The increasingly deaf Beethoven conducted the performance, &quot;assisted&quot; by Michael Umlauf, who later performed the same task for Beethoven at the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. The role of Pizarro was taken by Johann Michael Vogl, who later became known for his collaborations with Schubert. This version of the opera was a great success, and &quot;Fidelio&quot; has been part of the operatic repertory ever since.

Although critics have noted the similarity in plot with Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (1762) — another underground rescue mission in which the protagonist must control, or conceal, his emotions in order to retrieve his spouse — it is not known whether Beethoven or any of the librettists had this in mind while constructing the opera.

No other work of Beethoven&#x27;s caused him so much frustration and disappointment. He found the difficulties posed by writing and producing an opera so disagreeable, he vowed never to compose another. In a letter to Treitschke he said, &quot;I assure you, dear Treitschke, that this opera will win me a martyr&#x27;s crown. You have by your co-operation saved what is best from the shipwreck. For all this I shall be eternally grateful to you.&quot;

The full score was not published until 1826, and all three versions are known as Beethoven&#x27;s Opus 72.

The first performance outside Vienna took place in Prague on 21 November 1814, with a revival in Vienna on 3 November 1822. In its two-act version, the opera was staged in London on 18 May 1832 at the King&#x27;s Theatre, and in New York on 9 September 1839 at the Park Theatre.

==20th-century performance history==
&quot;Fidelio&quot; was Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s first complete opera performance given in the United States since 1915 and the first to be broadcast on radio, over the NBC network, in December 1944. Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra, featuring soloists Rose Bampton, Jan Peerce and Eleanor Steber, with the performance divided into two consecutive broadcasts. The recording of the opera was later issued by RCA Victor on LP and CD.

&quot;Fidelio&quot; was the first opera performed in Berlin after the end of World War II, with the Deutsche Oper staging it under the baton of Robert Heger at the only undamaged theatre, the Theater des Westens, in September 1945. At the time, Thomas Mann remarked: &quot;What amount of apathy was needed [by musicians and audiences] to listen to &quot;Fidelio&quot; in Himmler&#x27;s Germany without covering their faces and rushing out of the hall!&quot;

Not long after the end of World War II and the fall of Nazism, conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler remarked in Salzburg in 1948:

[T]he conjugal love of Leonore appears, to the modern individual armed with realism and psychology, irremediably abstract and theoretical... Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, thanks to the music of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage... Certainly, &quot;Fidelio&quot; is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the &#x27;imprisonment&#x27;; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this &#x27;nostalgia of liberty&#x27; he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His &quot;Fidelio&quot; has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a &#x27;religion of humanity&#x27; which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of &quot;Fidelio&quot; touches deeply.

We realize that for us Europeans, as for all men, this music will always represent an appeal to our conscience.
On 5 November 1955, the Vienna State Opera was re-opened with &quot;Fidelio&quot;, conducted by Karl Böhm. This performance was the first live television broadcast by ORF at a time when there were about 800 television sets in Austria.

The first night of &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Semperoper in Dresden on 7 October 1989 on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the DDR (East Germany) coincided with violent demonstrations at the city&#x27;s main train station. The applause after the &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Chorus&quot; interrupted the performance for considerable time, and the production by Christine Mielitz had the chorus appear in normal street clothes at the end, signifying their role as representatives of the audience. Four weeks later, on 9 November 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of East Germany&#x27;s regime.

==Overtures==
Beethoven struggled to produce an appropriate overture for &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and ultimately went through four versions. His first attempt, for the 1805 premiere, is believed to have been the overture now known as &quot;Leonore No. 2&quot; in C major. Beethoven then focused this version for the performances of 1806, creating &quot;Leonore No. 3&quot;, also in C major. The latter is considered by many listeners as the greatest of the four overtures, and indeed it is often performed outside the context of the opera, as a concert piece. But as an intensely dramatic, full-scale symphonic movement it had the effect of overwhelming the (rather light) initial scenes of the opera. Beethoven accordingly experimented with cutting it back somewhat, for a planned 1808 performance in Prague; this is believed to be the version now called &quot;Leonore No. 1&quot;. Finally, for the 1814 revival Beethoven began anew, and with fresh musical material wrote what is now known as the &quot;Fidelio&quot; overture, in E major. As this somewhat lighter overture seems to work best of the four as a start to the opera, Beethoven&#x27;s final intentions are generally respected in contemporary productions.

The two scenes of the last act require a major scene change, and it has long been a temptation for conductors to integrate the acclaimed &quot;Leonore No. 3&quot; overture into the opera by performing it during this interval. According to David Cairns, the practice goes back to the middle of the 19th century. Gustav Mahler is particularly remembered for adhering to this practice when he led a performance. When performed at this point in the opera, the overture acts as a kind of musical reprise of the rescue scene that has just taken place.

==Synopsis==
Two years prior to the opening scene, the Spanish nobleman Florestan has exposed or attempted to expose certain crimes of a rival nobleman, Pizarro. In revenge, Pizarro has secretly imprisoned Florestan in the prison over which he is governor. Simultaneously, Pizarro has spread false rumors about Florestan&#x27;s death.
The warden of the prison, Rocco, has a daughter, Marzelline, and an assistant, Jaquino, who is in love with Marzelline. The faithful wife of Florestan, Leonore, suspects that her husband is still alive. Disguised as a boy, under the alias &quot;Fidelio&quot;, she gains employment working for Rocco. As the boy Fidelio, she earns the favor of her employer, Rocco, and also the affections of his daughter Marzelline, much to Jaquino&#x27;s chagrin.

On orders, Rocco has been giving the imprisoned Florestan diminishing rations until he is nearly starved to death.

:Place: A Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville
:Time: Late 17th century

===Act 1===

Jaquino and Marzelline are alone in Rocco&#x27;s house. Jaquino asks Marzelline when she will agree to marry him, but she says that she will never marry him now that she has fallen in love with Fidelio, unaware that Fidelio is actually Leonore in disguise (&quot;Jetzt, Schätzchen, jetzt sind wir allein&quot;—&quot;Now, darling, now we are alone&quot;). Jaquino leaves, and Marzelline expresses her desire to become Fidelio&#x27;s wife (&quot;O wär ich schon mit dir vereint&quot;—&quot;If only I were already united with thee&quot;). Rocco enters, looking for Fidelio, who then enters carrying a heavy load of newly repaired chains. Rocco compliments Fidelio, and misinterprets her modest reply as hidden attraction to his daughter. Marzelline, Fidelio, Rocco, and Jaquino sing a quartet about the love Marzelline has for Fidelio (&quot;Mir ist so wunderbar&quot;—&quot;A wondrous feeling fills me&quot;, also known as the Canon Quartet).

Rocco tells Fidelio that as soon as the governor has left for Seville, Marzelline and Fidelio can be married. He tells them, however, that unless they have money, they will not be happy (&quot;Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben&quot;—&quot;If you don&#x27;t have any money&quot;). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Fidelio away from such a terrible sight, but Fidelio claims courage sufficient to cope with it. Rocco and Fidelio sing of courage (&quot;Gut, Söhnchen, gut&quot;—&quot;All right, sonny, all right&quot;), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.
All but Rocco leave. A march is played as Pizarro enters with his guards. Rocco warns Pizarro that the minister plans a surprise visit tomorrow to investigate accusations of Pizarro&#x27;s cruelty. Pizarro exclaims that he cannot let the minister discover the imprisoned Florestan, who has been thought dead. Instead, Pizarro will have Florestan murdered (&quot;Ha, welch ein Augenblick&quot;—&quot;Hah! What a moment!&quot;). As a signal, Pizarro orders that a trumpet be sounded at the minister&#x27;s arrival. He offers Rocco money to kill Florestan, but Rocco refuses (&quot;Jetzt, Alter, jetzt hat es Eile!&quot;—&quot;Now, old man, we must hurry!&quot;). Pizarro says he will kill Florestan himself instead, and orders Rocco to dig a grave for him in the floor of the dungeon. Once the grave is ready, Rocco is to sound the alarm, upon which Pizarro will come into the dungeon and kill Florestan. Fidelio, hearing Pizarro&#x27;s plot, is agitated, but hopes to rescue Florestan (&quot;Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin?&quot; and&quot; Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern&quot;—&quot;Monster! Where are you off to so fast?&quot; and &quot;Come, hope, let the last star&quot;).

Jaquino once again begs Marzelline to marry him, but she continues to refuse. Fidelio, hoping to discover Florestan, asks Rocco to let the poor prisoners roam in the garden and enjoy the beautiful weather. Marzelline similarly begs him, and Rocco agrees to distract Pizarro while the prisoners are set free. The prisoners, ecstatic at their temporary freedom, sing joyfully (&quot;O welche Lust&quot;—&quot;O what a joy&quot;), but remembering that they might be caught by the prison&#x27;s governor Pizarro, are soon quiet.

After meeting with Pizarro, Rocco reenters and tells Fidelio that Pizarro will allow the marriage, and Fidelio will also be permitted to join Rocco on his rounds in the dungeon (&quot;Nun sprecht, wie ging&#x27;s?&quot;—&quot;Speak, how did it go?&quot;). Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan&#x27;s cell, with the knowledge that he must be killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners have been allowed to roam, and is furious (&quot;Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!&quot;—&quot;O, father, father, hurry!&quot;).

Before they can leave, Pizarro enters and demands an explanation. Rocco, thinking quickly, answers that the prisoners were given a little freedom in honor of the Spanish king&#x27;s name day, and quietly suggests that Pizarro should save his anger for the prisoner in the dungeon below. Pizarro tells him to hurry and dig the grave, and then announces that the prisoners will be locked up again. Rocco, Leonore, Jacquino, and Marzelline reluctantly usher the prisoners back to their cells (&quot;Leb wohl, du warmes Sonnenlicht&quot;—&quot;Farewell, you warm sunshine&quot;).

===Act 2===
Florestan is alone in his cell, deep inside the dungeons. He sings first of his trust in God, and then has a vision of his wife Leonore coming to save him (&quot;Gott! Welch Dunkel hier!&quot;—&quot;God! What darkness here&quot; and &quot;In des Lebens Frühlingstagen&quot;—&quot;In the spring days of life&quot;). Florestan collapses and falls asleep, while Rocco and Fidelio come to dig his grave. As they dig, Rocco urges Fidelio to hurry (&quot;Wie kalt ist es in diesem unterirdischen Gewölbe!&quot;—&quot;How cold it is in this underground chamber&quot; and &quot;Nur hurtig fort, nur frisch gegraben&quot;—&quot;Come get to work and dig&quot;, the &quot;Gravedigging Duet&quot;).

Florestan awakes and Fidelio recognizes him. When Florestan learns that the prison he is in belongs to Pizarro, he asks that a message be sent to his wife, Leonore, but Rocco says that it is impossible. Florestan begs for a drop to drink, and Rocco tells Fidelio to give him one. Florestan does not recognize Fidelio, his wife Leonore in disguise, but tells Fidelio that there will be reward for the good deed in Heaven (&quot;Euch werde Lohn in bessern Welten&quot;—&quot;You shall be rewarded in better worlds&quot;). Fidelio further begs Rocco to be allowed to give Florestan a crust of bread, and Rocco consents.

Rocco obeys his orders and sounds the alarm for Pizarro, who appears and asks if all is ready. Rocco says that it is, and instructs Fidelio to leave the dungeon, but Fidelio hides instead. Pizarro reveals his identity to Florestan, who accuses him of murder (&quot;Er sterbe! Doch er soll erst wissen&quot;—&quot;Let him die! But first he should know&quot;). As Pizarro brandishes a dagger, Fidelio leaps between him and Florestan and reveals her identity as Leonore, the wife of Florestan. Pizarro raises his dagger to kill her, but she pulls a gun and threatens to shoot him.

Just then, the trumpet is heard, announcing the arrival of the minister. Jaquino enters, followed by soldiers, to announce that the minister is waiting at the gate. Rocco tells the soldiers to escort Governor Pizarro upstairs. Florestan and Leonore sing to their victory as Pizarro declares that he will have revenge, while Rocco expresses his fear of what is to come (&quot;Es schlägt der Rache Stunde&quot;—&quot;Revenge&#x27;s bell tolls&quot;). Together, Florestan and Leonore sing a love duet (&quot;O namenlose Freude!&quot;—&quot;O unnamed joy!&quot;).

Here, the overture &quot;Leonore No. 3&quot; is sometimes played.

The prisoners and townsfolk sing to the day and hour of justice which has come (&quot;Heil sei dem Tag!&quot;—&quot;Hail to the day!&quot;). The minister, Don Fernando, announces that tyranny has ended. Rocco enters, with Leonore and Florestan, and he asks Don Fernando to help them (&quot;Wohlan, so helfet! Helft den Armen!&quot;—&quot;So help! Help the poor ones!&quot;). Rocco explains how Leonore disguised herself as Fidelio to save her husband. Previously in love with Fidelio, Marzelline is shocked. Rocco describes Pizarro&#x27;s murder plot, and Pizarro is led away to prison. Florestan is released from his chains by Leonore, and the crowd sings the praises of Leonore, the loyal savior of her husband (&quot;Wer ein holdes Weib errungen&quot;—&quot;Who has got a good wife&quot;).

==Instrumentation==
The orchestra consists of 1 piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, timpani, and strings. There is also an offstage trumpet.

<text>Franche-Comté (, ; ; Frainc-Comtou: &quot;Fraintche-Comtè&quot;; ; also ; ; all ) is a cultural and historical region of eastern France. It is composed of the modern departments of Doubs, Jura, Haute-Saône and the Territoire de Belfort. In 2021, its population was 1,179,601.

From 1956 to 2015, the Franche-Comté was a French administrative region. Since 1 January 2016, it has been part of the new region Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.

The region is named after the &quot;&quot; (Free County of Burgundy), definitively separated from the region of Burgundy proper in the fifteenth century. In 2016, these two-halves of the historic Kingdom of Burgundy were reunited, as the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It is also the 6th biggest region in France. The name &quot;Franche-Comté&quot; is feminine because the word &quot;comté&quot; in the past was generally feminine, although today it is masculine.

The principal cities are the capital Besançon, Belfort and Montbéliard. Other important cities are Dole (the capital before the region was conquered by Louis XIV in the late seventeenth century), Vesoul (capital of Haute-Saône), Arbois (the &quot;wine capital&quot; of the Jura), and Lons-le-Saunier (the capital of Jura).

==History==
The region has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age and was occupied by the Gauls. It was then heavily settled by Germanic peoples during the Germanic migrations, most notably the Burgundians, who settled in the region after the Gauls had vacated the area. Later, it was part of the territory of the Alemanni in the fifth century, then the Kingdom of Burgundy from 457 to 534. The Burgundians adopted Chalcedonian Christianity, Christianizing the region. In 534, it became part of the Frankish kingdom. In 561 it was included in the Merovingian Kingdom of Burgundy under Guntram, the third son of Clotaire I. In 613, Clotaire II reunited the Frankish Kingdom under his rule, and the region remained a part of the Kingdom of Burgundy under the later Merovingians and Carolingians.

===County of Burgundy=== 
The name &quot;&quot; or &quot;Freigrafschaft Burgund&quot; in German (Free County of Burgundy) did not appear officially until 1366. It had been a territory of the County of Burgundy from 888, the province becoming subject to the Holy Roman Empire in 1034. It was definitively separated from the neighboring Duchy of Burgundy upon the latter&#x27;s incorporation into the Kingdom of France in 1477. That year at the Battle of Nancy during the Burgundian Wars, the last duke, Charles the Bold, was killed in battle. Although the county, along with the Duchy, was seized by King Louis XI of France, in 1492 his son Charles VIII ceded it to Philip of Austria, the grandson and heir of Charles the Bold. When Philip&#x27;s son, Emperor Charles V, inherited the Spanish throne in 1516, the Franche-Comté, along with the rest of the Burgundian lands (except Burgundy itself), passed to the Spanish.

===Province of the Kingdom of France===

Franche-Comté was captured by France in 1668, but returned to Spain under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It was conquered a second time in 1674, and finally was ceded to France in the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), leaving the Holy Roman Empire as a result. Enclaves such as Montbéliard remained outside French control.
The Franche-Comté was one of the last parts of France to have serfdom. In 1784, half of the population consisted of serfs, accounting for 400,000 out of the 1 million French serfs. Landowners took one-twelfth of the sale&#x27;s price if a serf (&quot;mainmortable&quot;) wanted to sell up. Serfs were not forced to stay on the land, but the lord could claim &quot;droit de suite&quot;, whereby a peasant who died away from his holding left it to the lord, even if he had heirs. A runaway serf&#x27;s land was forfeit after ten years. Louis XVI issued a decree banning these practices on 8 August 1779, but the Parlement of Besançon blocked this until 1787.

===After 1790===
The population of the region fell by a fifth from 1851 to 1946, reflecting low French natural growth and migration to more urbanized parts of the country. Most of the decline occurred in Haute-Saône and Jura, which remain among the country&#x27;s more agriculture-dependent areas.

==Environment==
This region borders Switzerland and shares much of its architecture, cuisine, and culture with its neighbour. Between the Vosges range of mountains to the north and the Jura range to the south, the landscape consists of rolling cultivated fields, dense pine forest, and rampart-like mountains. Not so majestic as the Alps, the Jura mountains are more accessible and are France&#x27;s first cross-country skiing area. It is also a superb place to hike, and there are some fine nature trails on the more gentle slopes. The Doubs and Loue valleys, with their timbered houses perched on stilts in the river, and the high valley of Ain, are popular visitor areas. The &quot;&quot; is a land of gorges and waterfalls dotted with tiny villages, each with a domed belfry decorated with mosaic of tiles or slates or beaten from metal. The lakes are perfect for swimming in the warmer months. The summits of Haut Jura have wonderful views across (Lake Geneva) and toward the Alps.

Forty percent of the region&#x27;s GDP is dependent on manufacturing activities, and most of its production is exported. Construction of automobiles and their parts is one of the most buoyant industries there. Forestry exploitation is steadily growing, and 38% of the agriculture is dairy and 17% cattle farming. The region has a large and lucrative cheese-making industry, with 40 million tonnes of cheese produced here each year, much of which is made by &quot;fruitières&quot; (traditional cheese dairies of Franche-Comté); for instance, Comté cheese comes from this region.

==Language==
Among the regional languages of France, the term &quot;Franc-comtois&quot; refers to two dialects of two different languages. Franc-comtois is the name of the dialect of Langue d&#x27;Oïl spoken by people in the northern part of the region. The dialect of Arpitan has been spoken in its southern part since as early as the thirteenth century (the southern two-thirds of Jura and the southern third of Doubs). Both are recognized as languages of France.

== Education ==
215,178 students were in school in Franche-Comté at the start of the 2018 school year. The region has potential in the research sector. We find in Besançon the National School of Mechanics and Microtechnology (ENSMM) or the UTBM, the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard in Belfort and Montbéliard.

The University of Franche-Comté is mainly located in Besançon. It has 24,000 students spread over six training and research areas (UFR), including five in Besançon and one in Belfort and Montbéliard, two university institutes of technology (IUT) (Besançon-Vesoul and Nord Franche-Comté), 920 students engineers at ENSMM and 2,550 students at UTBM.

<text>Singer Corporation is an American manufacturer of consumer sewing machines, first established as I. M. Singer &amp; Co. in 1851 by Isaac M. Singer with New York lawyer Edward C. Clark. Best known for its sewing machines, it was renamed Singer Manufacturing Company in 1865, then the Singer Company in 1963. The global headquarters are based in Nashville, Tennessee. Its first large factory for mass production was built in 1863 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

==History==
Singer&#x27;s original design was the first practical sewing machine for general domestic use. It incorporated the basic eye-pointed needle and lock stitch, developed by Elias Howe, who won a patent-infringement suit against Singer in 1854.

Singer obtained in August 1851 for an improved sewing machine that included a circular feed wheel, thread controller, and power transmitted by gear wheels and shafting.

Singer consolidated enough patents in the field to enable him to engage in mass production, and by 1860 his company was the largest manufacturer of sewing machines in the world. 

In 1885 Singer built a new works at Kilbowie (designed by Robert Ewan) which produced its first &quot;vibrating shuttle&quot; sewing machine, an improvement over contemporary transverse shuttle designs (see bobbin drivers). The Singer company began to market its machines internationally in 1855 and won first prize at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair that year. The company demonstrated the first workable electric sewing machine in 1910. Singer was also a marketing innovator and a pioneer in promoting the use of installment payment plans.

===Early sales figures===

By 1876, Singer was claiming cumulative sales of two million sewing machines and had put the two millionth machine on display in Philadelphia.

===Singer in Scotland===
In 1867, the Singer Company decided that the demand for their sewing machines in the United Kingdom was sufficiently high to open a local factory in Glasgow on John Street. The Vice President of Singer, George Ross McKenzie selected Glasgow because of its iron making industries, cheap labour, and shipping capabilities. Demand for sewing machines outstripped production at the new plant and by 1873, a new larger factory was completed on James Street, Bridgeton. By that point, Singer employed over 2,000 people in Scotland, but they still could not produce enough machines.

In 1882, McKenzie, by then President-elect of the Singer Manufacturing Company, undertook the ground breaking ceremony on of farmland at Kilbowie, Clydebank. Originally, two main buildings were constructed, each long, wide and three storeys high. These were connected by three wings. Built above the middle wing was a tall clock tower with the &quot;Singer&quot; name clearly displayed for all to see for miles around. A total of of railway lines were laid throughout the factory to connect the different departments such as the boiler room, foundry, shipping and the lines to main railway stations. Sir Robert McAlpine was the building contractor and the factory was designed to be fire proof with water sprinklers, making it the most modern factory in Europe at that time.

With nearly a million square feet of space and almost 7,000 employees, it was possible to produce on average 13,000 machines a week, making it the largest sewing machine factory in the world. The Clydebank factory was so productive that in 1905, the U.S. Singer Company set up and registered the Singer Manufacturing Company Ltd. in the United Kingdom. Demand continued to exceed production, so each building was extended upwards to 6 storeys high. A railway station with the company name was established in 1907 with connections to adjoining towns and central Glasgow to assist in transporting the workforce to the facility. Increased productivity came from &#x27;scientific management&#x27; techniques which increased workloads whilst keeping salary overheads low, and in 1911, a mass walk out of 10,000 workers, the &#x27;Singer Strike&#x27;, took place in support of twelve women polishers, who had seen three staff dismissed, but the workload remained the same with no extra pay. It was significant in its recognition of the rights of women workers and &#x27;collective bargaining&#x27; and predated the labour movement known as &#x27;Red Clydeside&#x27;. A centenary film was made by the BBC about the female workers who stood up to the American management.

In the First World War, sewing machine production gave way to munitions. The Singer Clydebank factory received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuses, and aeroplane parts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70% female at war&#x27;s end.

From its opening in 1884 until 1943, the Kilbowie factory produced approximately 36,000,000 sewing machines. Singer was the world leader and sold more machines than all the other makers added together. In 1913, the factory shipped 1.3 million machines. The late 1950s and 1960s saw a period of significant change at the Clydebank factory. In 1958, Singer reduced production at their main American plant and transferred 40% of this production to the Clydebank factory in a bid to reduce costs. Between 1961 and 1964, the Clydebank factory underwent a £4 million modernisation programme which saw the Clydebank factory cease the production of cast iron machines and focus on the production of aluminium machines for western markets. As part of this modernisation programme, the famous Singer Clock was demolished in 1963. At the height of its productiveness in the mid-1960s, Singer employed over 16,000 workers but by the end of that decade, compulsory redundancies were taking place and 10 years later the workforce was down to 5,000. Financial problems and lack of orders forced the world&#x27;s largest sewing machine factory to close in June 1980, bringing to an end over 100 years of sewing machine production in Scotland. The complex of buildings was demolished in 1998.

An archive about the factory, the strike and the history of its business in Scotland, is regarded as a recognised collection of national significance by Museums Galleries Scotland.


===Marketing before the World Wars===
The Singer sewing machine was the first complex standardised technology to be mass marketed. It was not the first sewing machine, and its patent in 1851 led to a patent battle with Elias Howe, inventor of the lockstitch machine. This eventually resulted in a patent sharing accord among the major firms. Marketing strategies included focusing on the manufacturing industry, gender identity, credit plans, and &quot;hire purchases.&quot;

Singer&#x27;s marketing emphasized the role of women and their relationship to the home, evoking ideals of virtue, modesty, and diligence. Though the sewing machine represented liberation from arduous hand sewing, it chiefly benefited those sewing for their families and themselves. Tradespeople relying on sewing as a livelihood still suffered from poor wages, which dropped further in response to the time savings gained by machine sewing. Singer offered credit purchases and rent-to-own arrangements, allowing people to rent a machine with the rental payments applied to the eventual purchase of the machine, and sold globally through the use of direct-sales door-to-door canvassers to demonstrate and sell the machines.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the company suspended sewing machine production to take on government contracts for weapons manufacturing. Factories in the United States supplied the American forces with Norden bomb sights and M1 Carbine rifle receivers, while factories in Germany provided their armed forces with weapons.

In 1939, the company was given a production study by the government to draw plans and develop standard raw material sizes for building M1911A1 pistols. The following April 17, Singer was given an educational order of 500 units with serial numbers S800001 – S800500. The educational order was a programme set up by the Ordnance Board in the U.S. to teach companies without gun-making experience to manufacture weapons.

Singer delivered 500 units to the U.S. government. Although Singer was unable to produce 100 guns a day, which the government contract required, the War Department was impressed with the quality of their pistols and asked the company to produce navigation and targeting equipment components. The pistol tooling and manufacturing machines were transferred to Remington Rand whilst some went to the Ithaca Gun Company. Approximately 1.75 million 1911A1 pistols were produced during World War II, making original Singer pistols relatively rare and collectable. In 2017, one sold at auction for $414,000.

In December 1940, Singer won a contract to produce the M5 Antiaircraft Director, a version of the UK-designed Kerrison Predictor. The US Army had previously adopted the M7 Computing Sight for their 37 mm gun M1 anti-aircraft guns, but the gun proved temperamental and Sperry Corporation was too busy producing other systems to build the required number of M7&#x27;s. After testing in September 1940, the Army accepted the Kerrison as the M5, and later, the Bofors 40 mm gun in place of the M1.

=== Post-war ===
Singer resumed developing sewing machines in 1946. They introduced one of their most popular, highest-quality and fully-optioned machines in 1957, the 401 Slant-o-Matic.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Singer sponsored rock and roll concerts to help advertise a variety of products including a line of Singer record players. The 1971 concert series was broadcast by WPLJ New York from the A&amp;R Recording Studios and included the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Seatrain, Procol Harum, Incredible String Band, Mother Earth, and Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. In 1968, Singer sponsored &quot;Singer Presents ... Elvis&quot;, commonly referred to as the &#x27;68 Comeback Special.

=== Singer in Asia ===
While Singer commenced operations in Sri Lanka as branch of Singer Sewing Machine Company, USA in 1877 the diversification and expansion in Asia started in 1957 when Singer introduced home appliances to complement its sewing machine sales in Asian markets. By 1963, Singer Industries (Ceylon) PLC was incorporated for the assembly of sewing machines and the manufacture of cabinets and stands. Singer Sri Lanka became a public company in 1974 and was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1981. The company commenced refrigerator manufacturing in 1988 at Regnis (Lanka) PLC and sponsored world series cricket in 1994. The first Singer Mega store opened in 1998, and the company launched its pioneering e-commerce website in 2001, a first for a consumer durable company in Sri Lanka.

Singer Finance was incorporated in 2004 and began accepting public deposits in 2005, followed by the introduction of new financial services in 2008. In 2010, Singer implemented an online real-time ERP system and incorporated Regnis Appliances (Private) Limited to manufacture home appliances. The Singer Finance IPO in 2011 was oversubscribed over 100 times, and the company launched the Life Style Exhibition, the largest consumer durable exhibition. In 2012, Singer created a dedicated channel for smartphone sales under Singer Digital Media, and in 2013, its subsidiary Regnis began manufacturing refrigerators using environmentally friendly R600a gas, among the first in South Asia to do so.

The company celebrated the opening of its 400th retail store in 2014 and made history in 2015 when Singer Finance launched Sri Lanka&#x27;s first VISA credit cards issued by a non-banking financial institution. In 2016, Singer underwent a group restructure, acquiring Regnis and Singer Industries from Singer Asia. The company was acquired by Hayleys PLC in 2017, marking a new chapter in its history. Subsequent milestones included changing the financial year in 2018, relocating the head office to Colombo in 2019, and relaunching its website and introducing the Singer Care App in 2020. In 2022, Singer redefined its brand proposition and visual identity, reaffirming its position as a leader in innovation and customer engagement.

Currently Singer is the market leader in Sri Lanka’s consumer durables industry, with an unmatched reach of over 5.7 million customers and a penetration of nearly 30% of the country’s population.

===Diversification===

In the 1960s, the company diversified, acquiring the Friden calculator company in 1965 and General Precision Equipment Corporation in 1968. GPE included Librascope, The Kearfott Company, Inc, and Link Flight Simulation. In 1968 also, Singer bought out GPS Systems and added it to the Link Simulations Systems Division (LSSD). This unit produced nuclear power plant control room simulators in Silver Spring, Maryland: Tech Road building for Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), Parkway building for Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) and later moved to Broken Land Parkway in Columbia, Maryland while flight simulators were produced in Binghamton, New York.

Friden became &quot;Singer Business Machines&quot; which produced the Singer System 10. In January 1976, Singer announced its withdrawal from the data processing market, offering the division to other companies. In March 1976, TRW Inc. and Singer announced an agreement whereby TRW would assume &quot;managerial responsibilities&quot; for Singer&#x27;s System 10 and point-of-sale products, perceived as a way for TRW to expand its market presence. Maintenance and customer support for Singer&#x27;s products were transferred to TRW, accompanied by a pledge for TRW to continue manufacturing at Singer&#x27;s Cogar facility in Utica, New York. Concurrently with these arrangements, ICL assumed the corresponding &quot;management responsibilities&quot; to Singer&#x27;s international operations and acquired the rights to products marketed internationally, including the System 10. ICL would later acquire the Cogar subsidiary and its manufacturing facility, continuing to manufacture the System 10 for its own customers. Despite Singer&#x27;s original announcement, its international operations continued to win orders and show signs of profitability. As some existing Singer customers contemplated legal action against the company for failing to fulfil its obligations, ICL sought to expand its US presence, attracting new business for both its own products as well as those acquired from Singer.

By 1971 Singer was also producing portable/home audio/visual equipment as evidenced by the Singer-branded record and cassette tape players and film-strip viewers that can be found on e.g., eBay. In order to support this venture, Singer sponsored concerts such as the 1971 A&amp;R Studio concerts on WPLJ-New York mentioned above.

For several years in the 1970s, Singer set up a national sales force for CAT phototypesetting machines (of UNIX troff fame) made by another Massachusetts company, Graphic Systems Inc. This division was purchased by Wang Laboratories in 1978.

In 1987, corporate raider Paul Bilzerian made a &quot;greenmail&quot; run at Singer, and ended up owning the company when no &quot;White Knight&quot; rescuer appeared. To recover his money, Bilzerian sold off parts of the company. Kearfott was split, the Kearfott Guidance &amp; Navigation Corporation was sold to the Astronautics Corporation of America in 1988 and the Electronic Systems Division was purchased by the Plessey Company in 1988 and renamed Plessey Electronic Systems (and then acquired by GEC-Marconi in 1990, renamed GEC-Marconi Electronic Systems, and later incorporated into BAE Systems). The four Link divisions developing and supporting industrial and flight simulation were sold to Canadian Avionics Electronics (CAE) and became CAE-Link. The nuclear power simulator division became S3 Technologies, and later GSE Systems, and relocated to Eldersburg, MD. The Sewing Machine Division was sold in 1989 to Semi-Tech Microelectronics, a publicly traded Toronto-based company.

Sales and profits grew until the 1940s. The market was affected in several ways. The US market matured after WWII. European and Japanese manufacturers ate into the market with zig-zag sewing machines. Under the leadership of Donald P. Kircher, Singer diversified into markets such as office equipment, defense, and aerospace. While 90% of Singer&#x27;s revenue was from sewing machines before diversification, this was reduced to 35% after the change.

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===

In 1978 Singer moved its HQ from Rockefeller Plaza to Stamford, Connecticut. 430 jobs were moved to the new location.

During the 1980s Singer sewing machine markets were being hit with Japanese machines and European brands including Bernina, Pfaff, and Viking. In 1986 Singer purchased Dalmo Victor for $174m from Textron, It would subsequently be resold in 1989 for $175m in cash to General Instrument. The original Singer company announced in July 1986 that it would be spinning off its sewing machine business under the name SSMC Ltd. In 1989 Semi-Tech Global purchased SSMC along with the rights to the Singer name, allowing for the renaming of SSMC back to Singer. As a result the former Singer Corporation was renamed to Bicoastal Corporation. Semi-Tech Global incorporated Singer (former SSMC Ltd.) into Singer N.V. based in Netherlands Antilles owned by the Hong Kong holding company.

Singer N.V. filed bankruptcy in 1999 and was acquired by Kohlberg &amp; Company. In 1997, Singer (Singer N.V.) US operations moved its consumer products to LaVergne, Tennessee. This location also served its wholesale distribution of sewing machines and parts. In 2006 The parent company of Singer – Kohlberg &amp; Company, acquired Husqvarna and Pfaff brands. This merged the three brands into the current company the SVP Group. Its main competitors are Baby Lock, Bernina, Brother, Janome, Juki and Aisin Seiki.

Singer was heavily involved in Manhattan real estate in the 1800s through Edward C. Clark, a founder of the company. Clark had built The Dakota apartments and other Manhattan buildings in the 1880s. In 1900, the Singer company retained Ernest Flagg to build a 12-story loft building at Broadway and Prince Street in Lower Manhattan. The building is now considered architecturally notable, and it has been restored.

The 47-story Singer Building, completed in 1908, was also designed by Flagg, who designed two landmark residences for Bourne. Constructed during Bourne&#x27;s tenure, the Singer Building (demolished in 1968 for the One Liberty Plaza development) was then the tallest building in the world and was the tallest building to be intentionally demolished until the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed in the September 11 attacks.

At their Clydebank factory, Singer built a clock tower, which stood over the central wing and had the reputation of being the largest four-faced clock in the world. Each face weighed five tons, and it took four men fifteen minutes twice a week to keep it wound. The tower was demolished in 1963, and the factory itself was closed in 1980. Singer railway station, built to serve the factory, is only one of two railway stations in the UK named after a factory, and is still in operation today.

The famous Singer House, designed by architect Pavel Suzor, was built in 1902–1904 at Nevsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg as headquarters of the Russian branch of the company. This modern style building (situated just opposite the Kazan Cathedral) is officially recognised as an object of Russian historical-cultural heritage.

In 2017, they launched their new Singer Sewing Assistant App. 

In 2018, a large factory fire destroyed a Singer distribution office and warehouse in Seven Hills, Sydney. Singer had manufactured sewing machines in Australia at a purpose-built plant in the western Sydney suburb of Penrith, from 1959 until 1967.

<text>The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract, including talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, humming or yelling. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.)

Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx (voice box), and the articulators. The lungs, the &quot;pump&quot; must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds. The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source. The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to &#x27;fine-tune&#x27; pitch and tone. The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen or weaken it as a sound source.

The vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate arrays of sound. The tone of voice may be modulated to suggest emotions such as anger, surprise, fear, happiness or sadness. The human voice is used to express emotion, and can also reveal the age and sex of the speaker. Singers use the human voice as an instrument for creating music.

==Voice types and the folds (cords) themselves==
Adult men and women typically have different sizes of vocal fold; reflecting the male–female differences in larynx size. Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched and have larger folds. The male vocal folds (which would be measured vertically in the opposite diagram), are between 17 mm and 25 mm in length. The female vocal folds are between 12.5 mm and 17.5 mm in length.

The folds are within the larynx. They are attached at the back (side nearest the spinal cord) to the &quot;arytenoids cartilages&quot;, and at the front (side under the chin) to the thyroid cartilage. They have no outer edge as they blend into the side of the breathing tube (the illustration is out of date and does not show this well) while their inner edges or &quot;margins&quot; are free to vibrate (the hole). They have a three layer construction of an epithelium, vocal ligament, then muscle (vocalis muscle), which can shorten and bulge the folds. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the vocal cord is the vestibular fold or &quot;false vocal cord&quot;, which has a small between its two folds.

The difference in vocal fold size between men and women means that they have differently pitched voices. There is also genetic variation amongst the same sex, with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singing voices being categorized into types. For example, among men, there are bass, bass-baritone, baritone, baritenor, tenor and countertenor (ranging from E2 to C♯7 and higher), and among women, contralto, alto, mezzo-soprano and soprano (ranging from F3 to C6 and higher). There are additional categories for operatic voices, see voice type. This is not the only source of difference between male and female voice. Men, generally speaking, have a larger vocal tract, which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding timbre. This is mostly independent of the vocal folds themselves.

==Voice modulation in spoken language==
Human spoken language makes use of the ability of almost all people in a given society to dynamically modulate certain parameters of the laryngeal voice source in a consistent manner. The most important communicative, or phonetic, parameters are the voice pitch (determined by the vibratory frequency of the vocal folds) and the degree of separation of the vocal folds, referred to as vocal fold adduction (coming together) or abduction (separating).

The ability to vary the ab/adduction of the vocal folds quickly has a strong genetic component, since vocal fold adduction has a life-preserving function in keeping food from passing into the lungs, in addition to the covering action of the epiglottis. Consequently, the muscles that control this action are among the fastest in the body. Children can learn to use this action consistently during speech at an early age, as they learn to speak the difference between utterances such as &quot;apa&quot; (having an abductory–adductory gesture for the p) as &quot;aba&quot; (having no abductory–adductory gesture). They can learn to do this well before the age of two by listening only to the voices of adults around them who have voices much different from their own, and even though the laryngeal movements causing these phonetic differentiations are deep in the throat and not visible to them.

If an abductory movement or adductory movement is strong enough, the vibrations of the vocal folds will stop (or not start). If the gesture is abductory and is part of a speech sound, the sound will be called voiceless. However, voiceless speech sounds are sometimes better identified as containing an abductory gesture, even if the gesture was not strong enough to stop the vocal folds from vibrating. This anomalous feature of voiceless speech sounds is better understood if it is realized that it is the change in the spectral qualities of the voice as abduction proceeds that is the primary acoustic attribute that the listener attends to when identifying a voiceless speech sound, and not simply the presence or absence of voice (periodic energy).

An adductory gesture is also identified by the change in voice spectral energy it produces. Thus, a speech sound having an adductory gesture may be referred to as a &quot;glottal stop&quot; even if the vocal fold vibrations do not entirely stop.

Other aspects of the voice, such as variations in the regularity of vibration, are also used for communication, and are important for the trained voice user to master, but are more rarely used in the formal phonetic code of a spoken language.

==Physiology and vocal timbre==
The sound of each individual&#x27;s voice is thought to be entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual&#x27;s vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person&#x27;s body, especially the vocal tract, and the manner in which the speech sounds are habitually formed and articulated. (It is this latter aspect of the sound of the voice that can be mimicked by skilled performers.) Humans have vocal folds that can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume, timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body, and an individual&#x27;s size and bone structure can affect somewhat the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as vocal resonation. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx, which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of vocal registers. The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the singer&#x27;s formant, which has been shown to be a resonance added to the normal resonances of the vocal tract above the frequency range of most instruments and so enables the singer&#x27;s voice to carry better over musical accompaniment.

===Vocal registration===

Vocal registration refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in &quot;laryngeal&quot; functioning. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular &quot;Vocal range&quot; of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract. The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:
* A particular part of the vocal range such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice.
* A phonatory process.
* A certain vocal timbre.
* A region of the voice that is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.
* A subset of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.

In linguistics, a register language is a language that combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system.

Within speech pathology, the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists.

===Vocal resonation===

Vocal resonation is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation; although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.
There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.

==Influences of the human voice==

The twelve-tone musical scale, upon which a large portion of all music (western popular music in particular) is based, may have its roots in the sound of the human voice during the course of evolution, according to a study published by the New Scientist. Analysis of recorded speech samples found peaks in acoustic energy that mirrored the distances between notes in the twelve-tone scale.

==Voice disorders==
There are many disorders that affect the human voice; these include speech impediments, and growths and lesions on the vocal folds. Talking improperly for long periods of time causes vocal loading, which is stress inflicted on the speech organs. When vocal injury is done, often an ENT specialist may be able to help, but the best treatment is the prevention of injuries through good vocal production. Voice therapy is generally delivered by a speech-language pathologist.

==Vocal cord nodules and polyps==
Vocal nodules are caused over time by repeated abuse of the vocal cords which results in soft, swollen spots on each vocal cord. These spots develop into harder, callous-like growths called nodules. The longer the abuse occurs the larger and stiffer the nodules will become. Most polyps are larger than nodules and may be called by other names, such as polypoid degeneration or Reinke&#x27;s edema. Polyps are caused by a single occurrence and may require surgical removal. Irritation after the removal may then lead to nodules if additional irritation persists. Speech-language therapy teaches the patient how to eliminate the irritations permanently through habit changes and vocal hygiene.
Hoarseness or breathiness that lasts for more than two weeks is a common symptom of an underlying voice disorder such as nodes or polyps and should be investigated medically.

<text>Mardi Gras (, ; also known as [[Shrove Tuesday]]) is the final day of Carnival (also known as Shrovetide or Fastelavn); it thus falls on the day before the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday. is French for &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;, referring to it being the last day of consuming rich, fatty foods, most notably red meat, in preparation for the Christian fasting season of Lent, during which such foods are avoided.

Related popular practices are associated with Carnival celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more usually known as Pancake Day or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday, derived from the word &quot;shrive&quot;, meaning &quot;to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve&quot;.

==Background==
During the liturgical season of Lent, some Christians abstain from the consumption of certain foods such as meat, eggs, dairy products, and alcoholic beverages. Most Christian denominations observe the tradition of Lent; exceptions include many churches within the Anabaptist, Baptist, Methodist, and Reformed traditions. Shrovetide provided Christians with the opportunity to use up these foods prior to the start of the 40-day fasting season of Lent. Prior to the 6th century, Lent was normatively observed through the practice of the Black Fast, which enjoins fasting from food and liquids, with the allowance of one vegetarian meal and water after sunset. The tradition of pancake breakfasts during Shrovetide, as well as that of pancake races, owes itself to this practice of &quot;using up the surplus eggs, milk and butter&quot; prior to Lent. In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) &quot;to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent&quot; and for people to &quot;begin frying their pancakes&quot;. As such, a hallmark of Shrovetide is the opportunity for a last round of merrymaking associated with Mardis Gras before the start of the somber Lenten season. The last day of Shrovetide, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), is named as such &quot;because people felt bloated having eaten up all the rich foods before Lent&quot; in order to prepare for the coming season of repentance.

==Traditions==
The festival season varies from city to city; Mardis Gras often refers to the last day of Shrovetide (or Fastelavn or Carnival), thus being synonymous with Shrove Tuesday. Some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana, consider Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany) to Ash Wednesday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wild/Dufour/Cowan (seas/New Orl.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.

In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras–associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls New Year&#x27;s Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday. In earlier times, parades were held on New Year&#x27;s Day. Carnival (or Fastelavn or Shrovetide) is an important celebration in Lutheran, Anglican and Catholic European nations.


===Belgium===
The three-day Carnival of Binche, near Mons, is one of the best known in Belgium. It takes place around Shrove Tuesday (or Mardi Gras) just before Lent. Performers known as Gilles wear elaborate costumes in the national colours of red, black and yellow. During the parade, they throw oranges at the crowd. In 2003, it was recognized by UNESCO as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, it is a folk tradition to celebrate Mardi Gras, which is called Masopust (meat-fast, i.e. beginning of the fast there). There are celebrations in many places including Prague, but the tradition also prevails in villages such as Staré Hamry, whose door-to-door processions made it to the UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

===Germany===

The celebration on the same day in Germany knows many different terms, depending on the region, such as Fastnacht, meaning the eve of the fast that takes place during Lent, or Veilchensdienstag (Violet Tuesday), as it is called in the Lower Rhine region. The celebrations often stretch from Epiphany, known in sections of Germany as Heilige Drei Könige, through the night before Ash Wednesday, and is variously known by different names, such as Karneval or Fasching in Germany, Austria and German-speaking areas of Switzerland. It is also often referred to as the &quot;fifth season&quot;, which traditionally begins with Hoppeditz Erwachen (the waking of Hoppeditz, the Fool who embodies the Karneval season) on 11 November at 11:11 AM (11/11 11:11). and ends with his comic funeral mass on Fastnacht.

Karneval is filled with large banquets held by the various organizing societies and generally comes to a climax beginning on what is variously known as &quot;Schmutziger Donnerstag&quot; or &quot;Fetter Donnerstag&quot; (Fat Thursday), &quot;Unsinniger Donnerstag&quot; (Nonsense Thursday), &quot;Altweiberfastnacht&quot;, &quot;Greesentag&quot; and others. In standard German, &quot;schmutzig&quot; means &quot;dirty&quot;, but in the Alemannic dialects &quot;schmotzig&quot; means &quot;lard&quot; (Schmalz), or &quot;fat&quot;; thus &quot;Greasy Thursday&quot;, as remaining winter stores of lard and butter used to be consumed at that time, before the fasting began. Altweiberfastnacht often featured women wearing men&#x27;s clothing and assuming their roles. In many towns across the state of North Rhine Westphalia, a ritual &quot;takeover&quot; of the town halls by local women has become tradition.

===Italy===
In Italy Mardi Gras is called Martedì Grasso (Fat Tuesday). It is the main day of Carnival along with the Thursday before, called Giovedí Grasso (Fat Thursday), which ratifies the start of the celebrations. The most famous Carnivals in northern Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea, while in the southern part of Italy the Sardinian Sartiglia and the intriguing apotropaic masks, especially the mamuthones, issohadores, s&#x27;urtzu (and so on), are more popular, belonging to a very ancient tradition. Ivrea has the characteristic &quot;Battle of Oranges&quot; that finds its roots in medieval times. The Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale.

===Sweden===
In Sweden the celebration is called Fettisdagen, when fastlagsbulle is eaten, more commonly called Semla. The name comes from the words &quot;fett&quot; (fat) and &quot;tisdag&quot; (Tuesday). Originally, this was the only day one should eat fastlagsbullar.

===United States===
While not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of historically ethnically French cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations. Mardi Gras arrived in North America as a French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France&#x27;s claim on the territory of &quot;Louisiane&quot;, which included what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and part of eastern Texas.

The expedition, led by Iberville, entered the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of 2 March 1699 (new style), Lundi Gras. They did not yet know it was the river explored and claimed for France by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1683. The party proceeded upstream to a place on the east bank about downriver from where New Orleans is today, and made camp. This was on 3 March 1699, Mardi Gras, so in honour of this holiday, Iberville named the spot &quot;Point du Mardi Gras&quot; (French: &quot;Mardi Gras Point&quot;) and called the nearby tributary Bayou Mardi Gras.

Bienville went on to found the settlement of Mobile (now in Alabama) in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana. In 1703 French settlers in Mobile established the first organised Mardi Gras celebration tradition in what was to become the United States. The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was formed in Mobile in 1711, the &quot;Boeuf Gras Society&quot;. Then came the Striker&#x27;s Independent Society in 1842, followed by the oldest parading mystic society the Order of Myths or &quot;OOMs&quot; in 1867.

In 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana. The French Mardi Gras customs had accompanied the colonists who settled there.
In 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718. The first Mardi Gras parade held in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1833 with Bernard de Marigny funding the first organized parade, tableau, and ball. The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan &quot;Laissez les bons temps rouler&quot; (&quot;Let the good times roll&quot;), as floats &quot;roll.&quot;

Festivities formally began in 1853 when a group of Protestant Anglo-Americans, some members of Mobile Mystic Societies, formed the first &quot;old-line&quot; krewe, The Mistick Krewe of Comus, based on Bernard de Marigny&#x27;s 1833 parade of paper-mached wagons, a formal tableau vivant and presentation of debutants, followed by a formal ball. The Twelfth Night Revelers were formed in 1870, again with ties to Mobile, but no longer stage a parade, just tableau and ball. The Knights of Momus and Rex came about in 1872, with the last of the old-line krewes the Krewe of Proteus being formed 10 years later. Of these 5 groups only Rex and Proteus still formally parade, with the Knights of Chaos replacing Momus.

The parades of the largest krewes (colloquially known as &quot;super krewes&quot;) came later, during the 1960s/70&#x27;s, and traditionally occur immediately prior to and on Shrove Tuesday, including those of Endymion (Saturday, which also culminates with a concert event at Caesars Superdome), Bacchus (Sunday), and Zulu and Rex (Tuesday).

Other cities along the Gulf Coast with early French colonial heritage, from Pensacola, Florida, and Galveston, Texas, to Lake Charles and Lafayette, Louisiana, and north to Natchez, Mississippi, and Alexandria, Louisiana, have active Mardi Gras celebrations.

Galveston&#x27;s first recorded Mardi Gras celebration, in 1867, included a masked ball at Turner Hall (Sealy at 21st St.) and a theatrical performance from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Henry IV&quot; featuring Alvan Reed (a justice of the peace weighing in at 350 pounds) as Falstaff. The first year that Mardi Gras was celebrated on a grand scale in Galveston was 1871 with the emergence of two rival Mardi Gras societies, or &quot;Krewes&quot; called the Knights of Momus (known only by the initials &quot;K.O.M.&quot;) and the Knights of Myth, both of which devised night parades, masked balls, exquisite costumes and elaborate invitations. The Knights of Momus, led by some prominent Galvestonians, decorated horse-drawn wagons for a torch lit night parade. Boasting such themes as &quot;The Crusades&quot;, &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, and &quot;Ancient France&quot;, the procession through downtown Galveston culminated at Turner Hall with a presentation of tableaux and a grand gala.

In the rural Acadiana area, many Cajuns celebrate with the &quot;Courir de Mardi Gras&quot;, a tradition that dates to medieval celebrations in France.

St. Louis, Missouri, founded in 1764 by French fur traders, claims to host the second largest Mardi Gras celebration in the United States. The celebration is held in the historic French neighborhood, Soulard, and attracts hundreds of thousands of people from around the country. Although founded in the 1760s, the St. Louis Mardi Gras festivities only date to the 1980s. The city&#x27;s celebration begins with &quot;12th night,&quot; held on Epiphany, and ends on Fat Tuesday. The season is peppered with various parades celebrating the city&#x27;s rich French Catholic heritage.
==Costumes==

Mardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always involves the use of masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are purple, green, and gold. In New Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals, people from myths, or various Medieval costumes as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans).

Many costumes today are simply elaborate creations of colored feathers and capes. Unlike Halloween costumery, Mardi Gras costumes are not usually associated with such things as zombies, mummies, bats, blood, and the like, though death may be a theme in some. The Venice tradition has brought golden masks into the usual round of costumes.

=== Exposure by women ===

Although the Church teaches that it is sinful and that it contravenes the Christian standards of modesty, the practice of some women exposing their breasts during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, US, has been documented since 1889, when the &quot;Times-Democrat&quot; decried the &quot;degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets.&quot; The practice was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets.

In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists studying &quot;ritual disrobement&quot; found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other favors.

<text>Carnival or Shrovetide is a festive season that occurs at the close of the Christian pre-Lenten period, consisting of Quinquagesima or Shrove Sunday, Shrove Monday, and Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras.

Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus. Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent. Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed &quot;excessively&quot;, rather, their stock was fully consumed during Shrovetide as to reduce waste. This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, and various other activities of indulgence being performed. For example, pancakes, donuts, and other desserts are prepared and eaten for a final time. During Lent, dairy and animal products are eaten less, if at all, and individuals make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire.

As such, during the season of Shrovetide, it is customary for Christians to ponder what Lenten sacrifices they will make for the coming Lent. The traditions of carrying Shrovetide rods and consuming Shrovetide buns after attending church are celebrated. On the final day of the season, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, and Roman Catholics, &quot;make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God&#x27;s help in dealing with.&quot; During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year&#x27;s Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies. On Shrove Tuesday (the final day of Shrovetide), churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.

The term &quot;Carnival&quot; is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece. The celebration is known as Fastelavn in historically Evangelical Lutheran countries. It is called Shrovetide in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants. In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin&#x27;s Day. 

==Etymology==
The Latin-derived name of the holiday is sometimes also spelled Carnaval, typically in areas where Dutch, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are spoken, or Carnevale in Italian-speaking contexts. Alternative names are used for regional and local celebrations.

The word is said to come from the Late Latin expression , which means &quot;remove meat&quot;; a folk etymology derives it from , &quot;farewell to meat&quot;. In either case, this signifies the approaching fast. The word may also be translated as flesh, producing &quot;a farewell to the flesh&quot;, a phrase embraced by certain Carnival celebrants to embolden the festival&#x27;s carefree spirit. The etymology of the word &quot;Carnival&quot; thus points to a Christian origin of the celebratory period.

Other scholars argue that the origin of the word is a common meat-based country feast (in Latin ) or the festival of the (&quot;ship of Isis&quot;), where the image of Isis was carried to the seashore to bless the start of sailing season. The festival consisted of a parade of masks following an adorned wooden boat, called in Latin , possibly the source of both the name and the parade floats.

==History==

===Origins===
The characteristics of the celebration of Carnival take their origins from ancient European festivals, such as the Greek Dionysian (the Anthesteria) or the Roman Saturnalia. During these festivities, there was a temporary release from social obligations and hierarchies to make way for the overthrow of order, joking and even debauchery. From a historical and religious point of view, the Carnival therefore represented a period of celebration, but above all of symbolic renewal, during which chaos replaced the established order, which, however, once the festive period was over, re-emerged new or renewed and guaranteed for a cycle valid until the beginning of the following Carnival.

From an anthropological point of view, Carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended. During antiquity, winter was thought of as the reign of the winter spirits; these needed to be driven out in order for summer to return. Carnival can thus be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to summer: a fertility celebration, the first spring festival of the new year.

Several Germanic tribes celebrated the returning of the daylight. Winter would be driven out, to make sure that fertility could return in spring. A central figure of this ritual was possibly the fertility goddess Nerthus. Also, there are some indications that the effigy of Nerthus or Freyr was placed on a ship with wheels and accompanied by a procession of people in animal disguise and men in women&#x27;s clothes. Aboard the ship a marriage would be consummated as a fertility ritual.

Tacitus wrote in his &quot;Germania&quot;: &quot;Germania 9.6: Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrator&quot; – &quot;The Germans, however, do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls, or to liken them to the form of any human countenance.&quot; – &quot;Afterwards the car, the vestments, and, if you like to believe it, the divinity herself, are purified in a secret lake.&quot;

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, Carnival referred to a period following Epiphany season that reached its climax before midnight on Shrove Tuesday. British historian John Bossy, in writing on the origin of the practices during Carnival, states that &quot;These were, despite some appearances, Christian in character, and they were medieval in origin: although it has been widely supposed that they continued some kind of pre-Christian cult, there is in fact no evidence that they existed much before 1200.&quot; Because Lent was a period of fasting, &quot;Carnival therefore represented a last period of feasting and celebration before the spiritual rigors of Lent.&quot; Meat was plentiful during this part of the Christian calendar and it was consumed during Carnival as people abstained from meat consumption during the following liturgical season, Lent. During Carnival, also known as Shrovetide, people confessed (shrived) their sins in preparation for Lent as well. Shakespeare&#x27;s 1601 play, The Merchant of Venice, Scene 5 of Act 2, mentions Christians who painted their faces to celebrate the season: 
Traditionally, a Carnival feast was the last opportunity for common people to eat well, as there was typically a food shortage at the end of the winter as stores ran out. Until spring produce was available, people were limited to the minimum necessary meals during this period. On what nowadays is called &quot;vastenavond&quot; (the days before fasting), all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter, and meat which were left would be eaten, for these would otherwise soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had already been slaughtered in November and the meat would no longer be preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources.

Traditionally, the feast also was a time to indulge in sexual desires, which were supposed to be suppressed during the following period fasting. Before Lent began, all rich food and drink were consumed in what became a giant celebration that involved the whole community, and is thought to be the origin of Carnival.

In many Christian sermons and texts, the example of a vessel is used to explain Christian doctrine: &quot;the nave of the church of baptism&quot;, &quot;the ship of Mary&quot;, etc. The writings show that processions with ship-like carts were held and lavish feasts were celebrated on the eve of Lent or the greeting of spring in the early Middle Ages.

The Lenten period of the liturgical calendar, the six weeks directly before Easter, was historically marked by fasting, study, and other pious or penitential practices. During Lent, no parties or celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fat, and sugar. The first three classes were often totally unavailable during this period because of late winter shortages.

While Christian festivals such as Corpus Christi were Church-sanctioned celebrations, Carnival was also a manifestation of European folk culture. In the Christian tradition, fasting is to commemorate the 40 days that Jesus fasted in the desert, according to the New Testament, and also to reflect on Christian values. It was a time for catechumens (those converting to Christianity) to prepare for baptism at Easter.
Carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent. In those two months, Christian populations used their several holidays as an outlet for their daily frustrations.

Many synods and councils attempted to set things &quot;right&quot;. Caesarius of Arles (470–542) protested around 500 CE in his sermons against the pagan practices. Centuries later, his statements were adapted as the building blocks of the &quot;Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum&quot; (&quot;small index of superstitious and pagan practices&quot;), which was drafted by the Synod of Leptines in 742. It condemned the &quot;Spurcalibus en februario&quot;.

Pope Gregory the Great (590–604) decided that fasting would start on Ash Wednesday. The whole Carnival event was set before the fasting, to set a clear division between celebrations and penitence. He also dispatched missionaries to sanctify any excesses in popular Carnival customs. It was also the custom during Carnival that the ruling class would be playfully mocked using masks and disguises.

In the year 743, the synod in Leptines (located near Binche in Belgium) spoke out furiously against the excesses in the month of February. Also from the same period dates the phrase: &quot;Whoever in February by a variety of less honorable acts tries to drive out winter is not a Christian, but a pagan.&quot; Confession books from around 800 contain more information about how people would dress as an animal or old woman during the festivities in January and February, even though this was a sin with no small penance. Also in Spain in the seventh century, San Isidoro de Sevilla complained in his writings about people coming out into the streets disguised, in many cases, as the opposite sex.

===Development===


Gradually, ecclesiastical authority began to realize that the desired result could not be achieved by banning Carnivals, which eventually led to a degree of Christianization of the traditions. They then became part of the liturgy and the liturgical year. In the Middle Ages, &quot;Carnival and Lent were both necessary, inevitable episodes in the eternal cycle of the Church year.&quot; While forming an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, many Carnival traditions resemble those antedating Christianity.

While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive, and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks, and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period, and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, and a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven, and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. In early Christianity, Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgment, and is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (&quot;His blood is on us and on our children!&quot; ).

Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation, and laughter at a tragicomic effigy of God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, in festivies sponsored by Pope Paul II, Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. Clement IX stopped these practices and in their place assessed a heavy tax on the Jews to help pay for the costs of the city&#x27;s Carnival celebrations.

Some of the best-known traditions, including carnal parades and masquerade balls, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The Carnival of Venice was, for a long time, the most famous Carnival (although Napoleon abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal, and France, and from France to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal, it spread with colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America. In the early 19th century in the German Rhineland and Southern Netherlands, the weakened medieval tradition also revived. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual abuse of the Carnival in Rome, rabbis of the ghetto were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd. A petition of the Jewish community of Rome sent in 1836 to Pope Gregory XVI to stop the annual abuse was denied: &quot;It is not opportune to make any innovation.&quot;

In the Rhineland in 1823, the first modern Carnival parade took place in Cologne. Carnaval (&quot;Karneval&quot;, &quot;Fasching&quot; or &quot;Fastnacht&quot; in Germany) mixed pagan traditions with Christian traditions. Pre-Lenten celebrations featured parades, costumes and masks to endure Lent&#x27;s withdrawal from worldly pleasures.

Other areas developed their own traditions. In the United Kingdom, West Indian immigrants brought with them the traditions of Caribbean Carnival; however, the Carnivals now celebrated at Notting Hill, Leeds, Yorkshire, and other places became divorced from their religious origin and became secular events that take place in the summer months.

==Theories==
Interpretations of Carnival present it as a social institution that degrades or &quot;uncrowns&quot; the higher functions of thought, speech, and the soul by translating them into the grotesque body, which serves to renew society and the world, as a release for impulses that threaten the social order that ultimately reinforces social norms, as a social transformation, or as a tool for different groups to focus attention on conflicts and incongruities by embodying them in &quot;senseless&quot; acts.

Furthermore, some cultures use Carnival as a method of empowering themselves in spite of social conflicts. For example, when the Caribbean Carnival was established as a result of French settlers, even the slaves had their version of the masquerade, where they would reverse roles to mock those of higher social status. Along with empowering individuals for a period of time, despite their typical status, Carnival brings communities together. In a day where all are meant to perform a &quot;mask&quot; that differs from their typical identity, all members of a society are able to connect through their theatricality and satire.

Mircea Eliade, historian of religions, writes: &quot;Any new year is a revival of time at its beginning, a repetition of the cosmogony. Ritual fights between two groups of extras, the presence of the dead, Saturnalia and orgies, are all elements which indicate that at the end of the year and in the expectation of the new year the mythical moments of the passage of chaos to the cosmogony are repeated&quot;. Eliade also writes: &quot;Then the dead will come back, because all barriers between the dead and the living are broken (is the primordial chaos not revived?), and will come back since – at this paradoxical moment – time will be interrupted, so that the dead may be again contemporaries of the living.&quot; Eliade speculates that people have &quot;a deep need to regenerate themselves periodically by abolishing the elapsed time and making topical the cosmogony&quot;. As regards masks (monsters, animals, demons), he assigns them an apotropaic meaning.

==Geographic distribution==
===Africa===
For the Canary Islands, see its section under Europe.

====Cape Verde Islands====
Carnival was introduced by Portuguese settlers. It is celebrated on each of the archipelago&#x27;s nine inhabited islands. In Mindelo, São Vicente, groups challenge each other for a yearly prize. It has imported various Brazilian Carnival traditions. The celebration in São Nicolau is more traditional, where established groups parade through the Ribeira Brava, gathering in the town square, although it has adopted drums, floats and costumes from Brazil. In São Nicolau, three groups, Copa Cabana, Estrela Azul, and Brilho Da Zona, construct a painted float using fire, newspaper for the mold, and iron and steel for structure. Carnival São Nicolau is celebrated over three days: dawn Saturday, Sunday afternoon, and Tuesday. The celebrations are captured in the award-winning feature documentary Tchindas, nominated at the 12th Africa Movie Academy Awards.

====Namibia====
Carnival was introduced by German settlers. The celebration is based on the &quot;Rheinische&quot; Carnival tradition.

====Seychelles====
The Seychelles carnival began in 2011. It is held in the capital city of Victoria and takes place over three days. On Day 1, the grand opening is held in the city center near the clock tower. The second day is parade day. On Day 3, the closing ceremony is held, and a lottery winner is announced.

====Zimbabwe====

The Harare Carnival is held late in May. Events include fashion and music shows. The climax is a street party featuring costumes and music.

===Americas===
====Antigua====

The Antiguan Carnival is held from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the &quot;j&#x27;ouvert&quot; (or &quot;juvé&quot;), in which brass and steelpan bands perform. Barbuda&#x27;s Carnival, held in June, is known as &quot;Caribana&quot;. The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism.

====Argentina====

In Argentina, the most representative Carnival performed is the so-called Murga, although other famous Carnivals, more like Brazil&#x27;s, are held in Argentine Mesopotamia and the North-East. Gualeguaychú in the east of Entre Ríos Province is the most important Carnival city and has one of the largest parades. It adopts a musical background similar to Brazilian or Uruguayan Carnival. Corrientes is another city with a Carnival tradition. Chamamé is a popular musical style. In all major cities and many towns throughout the country, Carnival is celebrated.

The Humahuaca Carnival is a popular celebration, which takes place at the beginning of Lent (40 days before Holy Week), in the Quebrada de Humahuaca area, Jujuy province, Argentina.

As Carnival coincides with summer in the Southern Hemisphere, in many parts of Argentina children play with water. The 19th century tradition of filling empty egg shells with water has evolved into water games that include the throwing of water balloons.

====Aruba====
Carnival in Aruba means weeks of events that bring colourfully decorated floats, contagiously throbbing music, luxuriously costumed groups of celebrants of all ages, King and Queen elections, electrifying jump-ups and torchlight parades, the Jouvert morning: the Children&#x27;s Parades, and finally the Grand Parade. Aruba&#x27;s biggest celebration is a month-long affair consisting of festive &quot;jump-ups&quot; (street parades), spectacular parades, and creative contests. Music and flamboyant costumes play a central role, from the Queen elections to the Grand Parade. Street parades continue in various districts throughout the month, with brass band, steelpan and roadmarch tunes. On the evening before Lent, Carnival ends with the symbolic burning of King Momo.

====Bahamas====
Junkanoo is the principal street parade in the Bahamas, it has been practiced in the Bahamas before and after the 1834 emancipation of slavery in the British Empire.

The Bahamas announced the first Bahamas Junkanoo Carnival to commence in May 2015. Carnival in the Bahamas rivals various carnivals throughout the Caribbean in that it is a unique blend between the revered Junkanoo and traditional Carnival. This fairly new festival has been referred to as the ultimate celebration of everything Bahamian.

====Barbados====

&quot;Crop Over&quot; (formerly called &quot;Harvest Home&quot;) is a traditional harvest festival celebrated in Barbados. Its early beginnings were on the sugar cane plantations during the colonial period. Crop Over began in 1688, and featured singing, dancing, and accompaniment by shak-shak, banjo, triangle, fiddle, guitar, bottles filled with water, and bones. Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting, and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival. In the late 20th century, Crop Over began to closely mirror the Trinidad Carnival. Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, the Grand Kadooment.

Crop Over time for many islanders is one big party. Craft markets, food tents/stalls, street parties, and cavalcades fill every week.

A major feature is the calypso competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political exposés or rousing exhortations to &quot;wuk dah waistline&quot; and &quot;roll dat bumper&quot;. The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of Bajan cooking during the Bridgetown Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama, and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the &quot;Pic-o-de-Crop&quot; Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is Kadooment Day, celebrated with a national holiday, when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks.

====Belize====
San Pedro is one of Belize&#x27;s few cities to observe Carnaval before Lent. Elsewhere, Carnaval (sometimes referred to as Carnival) often occurs in September. The Fiesta de Carnaval is often the most popular celebration, usually held over three days prior to Ash Wednesday, but the festivities often extend to the full week. This festival &quot;always includes music, dancing, costumes and parades&quot;.

Comparsas are held throughout the week, consisting of large groups &quot;of dancers dancing and traveling on the streets, followed by a Carrosa (carriage) where the musicians play. The Comparsa is a development of African processions where groups of devotees follow a given saint or deity during a particular religious celebration.&quot; One of the most popular comparsas of Fiesta de Carnaval is the male group comparsa, usually composed of notable men from the community who dress up in outlandish costumes or cross-dress and dance to compete for money and prizes. Other popular activities include body painting and flour fighting. &quot;On the last day of Carnival painters flood the street to paint each other. This simply means that a mixture of water paint and water or raw eggs is used to paint people on the streets, the goal being to paint as many people as you can.&quot;

Street fights often occur during the festivities – some locals treat this festival as an opportunity to exact revenge on their enemies. Vandalism is common and &quot;businesses constantly have to prepare in covering or repainting their advertisements during Carnival season because of the mischief performed.&quot; The tradition continues despite critics who advocate the termination of these festivities.

====Bolivia====
&quot;La Diablada&quot; Carnival takes place in Oruro in central Bolivia. It is celebrated in honor of the miners&#x27; patron saint, &quot;Vírgen de Socavon&quot; (the Virgin of the Tunnels). Over 50 parade groups dance, sing, and play music over a five kilometre-long course. Participants dress up as demons, devils, angels, Incas, and Spanish conquistadors. Dances include caporales and tinkus. The parade runs from morning until late at night, 18 hours a day, for three days before Ash Wednesday. It was declared the 2001 &quot;Masterpieces of Oral Heritage and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; by UNESCO. Throughout the country, celebrations are held involving traditional rhythms and water parties. In Santa Cruz de la Sierra, on the east side of the country, tropical weather allows a Brazilian-type Carnival, with Comparsas dancing traditional songs in matching uniforms.

====Brazil====


The Carnival in Brazil (Portuguese: Carnaval) is a major part of Brazilian culture. The first expression of this festivity took place in Rio de Janeiro in 1641, with the &quot;préstitos&quot;, very similar to musical processions that were held on public streets when John IV of Portugal was crowned King.

=====Rio de Janeiro=====

The street carnival of Rio de Janeiro is designated by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest carnival in the world, with approximately two million people each day.

Samba schools are large, social entities with thousands of members and a theme for their song and parade each year. In Rio Carnival, samba schools parade in the Sambadrome (&quot;sambódromo&quot; in Portuguese). Some of the most famous include GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira, GRES Portela, GRES Acadêmicos do Salgueiro, GRES Imperatriz Leopoldinense, GRES Beija-Flor de Nilópolis, GRES Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel, and recently, Unidos da Tijuca and GRES União da Ilha do Governador. Local tourists pay $500–950, depending on the costume, to buy a samba costume and dance in the parade. &quot;Blocos&quot; are small informal groups with a definite theme in their samba, usually satirizing the political situation. About 30 schools in Rio gather hundreds of thousands of participants. More than 440 &quot;blocos&quot; operate in Rio. &quot;Bandas&quot; are samba musical bands, also called &quot;street carnival bands&quot;, usually formed within a single neighborhood or musical background. The Carnival industry chain amassed in 2012 almost US$1 billion in revenues.

=====Recife, Pernambuco=====
Recife is marked by the parade of the largest carnival block in the world, the Galo da Madrugada. This parade happens on the first Saturday of Carnival (Zé Pereira&#x27;s Saturday), passes through downtown Recife, and has as symbol a giant rooster that is positioned on the Duarte Coelho Bridge. In this block, there is a great variety of musical genres, but Frevo is the most common one; it is typical of both Recife and Olinda, and is considered an Intangible Heritage of Humanity by Unesco.

=====Salvador, Bahia=====

Salvador has large Carnival celebrations, including the Axé, a typical Bahia music. A truck with giant speakers and a platform, where musicians play songs of local genres such as Axé, samba-reggae, and Arrocha, drives through town with a crowd following while dancing and singing. It was originally staged by two Salvador musicians, Dodo &amp; Osmar, in the 1950s. After the Salvador Carnival, Porto Seguro continues the celebration.

Three circuits make up the festival. Campo Grande is the longest and most traditional. Barra-Ondina is the most famous, on the seaside of Pelourinho and the beaches Barra and Ondina.

International singers like David Guetta, will.i.am, Psy, and Bob Sinclar have performed in Salvador. Ivete Sangalo, Claudia Leitte, Daniela Mercury, Margareth Menezes, Chiclete com Banana, and Banda Eva are some traditional attractions. The party officially lasts six days, but may go on for longer.

==== Canada ====
Toronto Caribbean Carnival, held in Toronto on the first weekend of August to take advantage of more comfortable weather, has its origins in Caribbean Carnival traditions. Tourist attendance at the parade typically exceeds one million.

The Quebec Winter Carnival is one of the biggest winter-themed Carnivals in the world. It depends on snowfall and very cold weather, to keep snowy ski trails in good condition and ice sculptures frozen. The carnival is held during the last days of January and first days of February.

====Caribbean====
Most Caribbean islands celebrate Carnival. The largest and most well-known is in Trinidad and Tobago. Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Curaçao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Saba, Sint Eustatius (Statia), Sint Maarten, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts, Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Saint Vincent, and the Grenadines hold lengthy carnival seasons and large celebrations.

Carnival is an important cultural event in the Dutch Caribbean. Festivities include &quot;jump-up&quot; parades with beautifully colored costumes, floats, and live bands, as well as beauty contests and other competitions. Celebrations include a middle-of-the-night j&#x27;ouvert (&quot;juvé&quot;) parade that ends at sunrise with the burning of a straw King Momo, cleansing sins and bad luck. On Statia, he is called Prince Stupid.

Carnival has been celebrated in Cuba since the 18th century. Participants don costumes demonstrating the island&#x27;s cultural and ethnic variety.

====Colombia====

Carnival was introduced by the Spaniards and incorporated elements from European cultures. It has managed to reinterpret traditions that belonged to Colombia&#x27;s African and Amerindian cultures. Documentary evidence shows that Carnival existed in Colombia in the 18th century and had already been a cause for concern for colonial authorities, who censored the celebrations, especially in the main political centres such as Cartagena, Bogotá, and Popayán.

The Carnival continued its evolution in small/unimportant towns out of view of the rulers. The result was the uninterrupted celebration of Carnival festivals in Barranquilla (see Barranquilla&#x27;s Carnival), now recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Barranquilla Carnival includes several parades on Friday and Saturday nights beginning on 11 January and ending with a six-day non-stop festival, beginning the Wednesday prior to Ash Wednesday and ending Tuesday midnight. Other celebrations occur in villages along the lower Magdalena River in northern Colombia, and in Pasto and Nariño (see Blacks and Whites&#x27; Carnival) in the south of the country. In the early 20th century, attempts to introduce Carnival in Bogotá were rejected by the government. The Bogotá Carnival was renewed in the 21st century.

====Dominica====

Carnival in Dominica is held in the capital city of Roseau, and takes elements of Carnival that can be seen in the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, as well as Trinidad. Notable events leading up to Carnival include the Opening of Carnival celebrations, the Calypso Monarch music competition, the Queen of Carnival Beauty Pageant, and bouyon music bands. Celebrations last for the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.

====Dominican Republic====
Dominican Carnival is celebrated in most cities and towns in the main streets during February. Among its main characteristics are its flashy costumes and loud music. The one held in La Vega, which is one of the biggest in the country, and the national parade in Santo Domingo were where the first Carnival of the Americas was held.

Carnival masks are elaborate and colorful. The costumes used on the parades are satires of the Devil and are called &quot;Diablos Cojuelos&quot;. They dance, and run to the rhythm of merengue music mixed with techno, hip-hop, and reggaeton. Additional allegorical characters represent Dominican traditions such as &quot;Roba la Gallina&quot; and &quot;Califé&quot;.

One of the most international parades is in San Pedro de Macorís. It exhibits the &quot;Guloyas&quot; parade of costumed groups dancing in the streets. Revelers flee from the &quot;Diablos Cojuelos&quot; who try to hit them with &quot;Vejigas&quot;.

The timing of the festivals has grown apart from its original religious synchronization with the period of Lent. With National Independence Day on 27 February and the birthday of Juan Pablo Duarte, its founding father, on 26 January, the Carnival celebrations fill February regardless of the Lenten calendar.

====Ecuador====
In Ecuador, the celebrations began before the arrival of Catholicism. The Huarangas Indians (from the Chimbos nation) used to celebrate the second moon of the year with a festival at which they threw flour, flowers, and perfumed water. This indigenous tradition merged with the Catholic celebration of Carnival.

A common feature of Ecuadorian Carnival is the &quot;diablitos&quot; (little devils) who play with water. As with snowball fights, the practice of throwing or dumping water on unsuspecting victims is revered by children and teenagers although feared by some adults. Throwing water balloons, sometimes even eggs and flour both to friends and strangers is fun, but can also upset the uninformed.

Although the government as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a bishop in 1867 who threatened excommunication for the sin of playing Carnival games.

Festivals differ across the country. Locals wear disguises with colorful masks and dance. Usually, the celebrations begin with the election of &quot;Taita Carnival&quot; (Father Carnival) who heads the festivities and leads the parades in each city.

The most famed Carnival festivities are in Guaranda (Bolivar province) and Ambato (Tungurahua province). In Ambato, the festivities are called &quot;Fiesta de las Flores y las Frutas&quot; (Festival of the Flowers and Fruits). Other cities have revived Carnival traditions with colorful parades, such as in Azogues (Cañar Province). In Azogues and the Southern Andes in general, &quot;Taita Carnival&quot; is always an indigenous Cañari. Recently, a celebration has gained prominence in the northern part of the Andes in the Chota Valley in Imbabura which is a zone of a strong Afro-Ecuadorian population and so the Carnival is celebrated with bomba del chota music.

Latacunga celebrates Carnival in three manners: Carnival with water where people play with water, religious Carnival where people make religious festivity, and Carnival parade in the city in which people march on the Latacunga streets wearing masks while they dance with music bands.

====French Guiana====
The Carnival of French Guiana has roots in Creole culture. Everyone participates – mainland French, Brazilians (Guiana has a frontier with Brazil), and Chinese as well as Creoles.

Its duration is variable, determined by movable religious festivals: Carnival begins at Epiphany and ends on Ash Wednesday, and so typically lasts through most of January and February. During this period, from Friday evening until Monday morning the entire country throbs to the rhythm of masked balls and street parades.

Friday afternoons are for eating &quot;galette des rois&quot; (the cake of kings) and drinking champagne. The cake may be flavoured with frangipani, guava, or coconut.

On Sunday afternoons, major parades fill the streets of Cayenne, Kourou, and Saint-Laurent du Maroni. Competing groups prepare for months. Dressed to follow the year&#x27;s agreed theme, they march with Carnival floats, drums, and brass bands.

Brazilian groups are appreciated for their elaborate feathered and sequined costumes. However, they are not eligible for competition since the costumes do not change over time.

Mythical characters appear regularly in the parades:
* &quot;Karolin&quot; − a small person dressed in a magpie tail and top hat, riding on a shrew;
* &quot;Les Nèg&#x27;marrons&quot; − groups of men dressed in red loincloths, bearing ripe tomatoes in their mouths while their bodies are smeared with grease or molasses. They deliberately try to come in contact with spectators, soiling their clothes;
* &quot;Les makoumés&quot; − cross-dressing men (out of the Carnival context, &quot;makoumé&quot; is a pejorative term for a homosexual);
* &quot;Soussouris&quot; (the bat) − a character dressed in a winged leotard from head to foot, usually black in colour. Traditionally malevolent, this character is liable to chase spectators and &quot;sting&quot; them.
A uniquely Creole tradition are the &quot;touloulous&quot;. These women wear decorative gowns, gloves, masks, and headdresses that cover them completely, making them unrecognisable, even to the colour of their skin. On Friday and Saturday nights of Carnival, touloulou balls are held in so-called &quot;universities&quot;, large dance halls that open only at Carnival time. Touloulous get in free, and are even given condoms in the interest of the sexual health of the community. Men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised. The touloulous pick their dance partners, who may not refuse. The setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total anonymity. Undisguised women are not welcomed. By tradition, if such a woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is served at bars – the disguised women whisper to the men &quot;touloulou thirsty&quot;, at which a round of drinks is expected, to be drunk through a straw protect their anonymity.

In more modern times, Guyanais men have attempted to turn the tables by staging &quot;soirées tololo&quot;, in which it is the men who, in disguise, seek partners from undisguised women bystanders.

The final four days of Carnival follow a rigid schedule, and no work is done:
* Sunday − The Grand Parade, in which the groups compete.
* Monday − Marriage burlesque, with men dressed as brides and women as grooms.
* Tuesday − Red Devil Day in which everyone wears red or black.
* (Ash) Wednesday − Dress is black and white only, for the grand ceremony of burning the effigy of Vaval, King Carnival.

====Guatemala====
The Mazatenango carnival is a two- or three-day celebration that has been celebrated in this city for more than a century. Though secular in nature, it takes place immediately before Christian Lent begins. Early celebrations included bull fights, and modern celebrations include the wearing of masks and costumes, the selection of an Ugly King and the Queen of the Carnival, dances, and a variety of games.

====Haiti====

Carnival in Haiti started in 1804 in the capital Port-au-Prince after the declaration of independence. The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America. It is known as Kanaval in the Creole language. It starts in January, known as &quot;Pre-Kanaval&quot;, while the main carnival activities begin in February. In July 2012, Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur. Beautiful costumes, floats, Rara festival parades, masks, foods, and popular rasin music (such as Boukman Eksperyans, Foula Vodoule, Tokay, Boukan Ginen, and Eritaj) and kompa bands (such as T-Vice, Djakout No. 1, Sweet Micky, KreyòlLa, D.P. Express, Mizik Mizik, Ram, T-Micky, Carimi, Djakout Mizik, and Scorpio Fever) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of Champ-de-Mars, Port-au-Prince. An annual song competition takes place.

Other places in Haiti celebrate carnival, including Jacmel and Aux Cayes. In 2013, Kanaval was celebrated in Okap (Cap-Haïtien).

Carnival finishes on Ash Wednesday, followed by rara festival, another parading musical tradition known mainly in Haiti and in the Dominican Republic. This festival emphasises religion. Songs are composed each year, and bands play bamboo tubes (&quot;vaksin&quot;) and homemade horns (&quot;konèt&quot;). Rara is also performed in Prospect and Central Park in summertime New York.

====Honduras====
In La Ceiba in Honduras, Carnival is held on the third or fourth Saturday of every May to commemorate San Isidro. It is the largest Carnival celebration in Central America.

====Mexico====

In Mexico, &quot;Carnaval&quot; is celebrated in about 225 cities and towns. The largest are in Mazatlán and the city of Veracruz, with others in Baja California and Yucatán. The larger city Carnavals employ costumes, elected queens, and parades with floats, but Carnaval celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of European influence during Mexico&#x27;s colonial period. The largest of these is in Huejotzingo, Puebla, where most townspeople take part in mock combat with rifles shooting blanks, roughly based on the Battle of Puebla. Other important states with local traditions include Morelos, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala, and Chiapas. Carnaval of Campeche goes back 400 years, to 1582.

====Nicaragua====
On the Caribbean coast of Bluefields, Nicaragua, Carnival is better known as &quot;Palo de Mayo&quot; (or Mayo Ya!) and is celebrated every day of May.

In Managua, it is celebrated for two days. There it is named &quot;Alegria por la vida&quot; (&quot;Joy for Life&quot;) and features a different theme each year. Another festival in Managua celebrates patron saint Domingo de Guzman and lasts ten days.

====Panama====
Traditionally beginning on Friday and ending on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, &quot;los Carnavales&quot;, as Panamanians refer to the days of Carnival, are celebrated across the country. Carnival Week is especially popular in the sleepy town of Las Tablas. The population multiplies because of the opulent Carnival celebrations. Carnival celebrations in Panama City and almost all of the Azuero Peninsula are popular tourist attractions. Penonomé features a parade on the Rio Zarati as a unique Carnival event.

The Panamanian Carnival is also popular because of the concerts featuring popular artists in the most visited areas. Concerts are often carried out during the night, and continue until the next morning.

Carnival Week is a national holiday in Panama, with most businesses and government offices remaining closed during its duration, and with most Panamanians opting to go to the country&#x27;s rural areas to participate on the Carnivals and visit their relatives.

Carnivals in Panama also feature large repurposed fuel trucks that are used for soaking attendees through the use of firehoses that are controlled and directed by one or more people that stand in a platform that is mounted on top of the truck. This is known as &quot;culecos&quot; or &quot;los culecos&quot;. Trucks get their water from nearby, government-approved rivers, and the water is tested for cleanliness before use. Culecos are often performed from 10 am to 3 pm, when the sun is at its brightest. Children and pregnant women are banned from participating in the culecos, and the trucks are always sponsored by a well-known Panamanian company or brand. The culecos are also often accompanied by reggaeton concerts.

The open consumption of large amounts of cold, low-alcohol beer or Smirnoff, stored in ice-filled coolers, is common among attendees. Just like in Rio de Janeiro, some carnivals also feature floats, but they may have young women with elaborate costumes that stand as the &quot;Queens&quot; of &quot;Calle Arriba&quot; and &quot;Calle Abajo&quot;, representing rich and working-class people, respectively. The queens are chosen through a contest and announced on October of the previous year, and are replaced every year. The queens are introduced on the first carnival day, and are always accompanied by a music band, who are present whenever the queens are present. Fireworks are launched on the last carnival night, to signal the end of the carnival.

====Peru====
=====Cajamarca=====
The town of Cajamarca is considered the capital of Carnival in Peru. Local residents of all ages dance around the &quot;unsha&quot;, or , a tree adorned with ribbons, balloons, toys, fruits, bottles of liquor, and other prizes.

At a certain point, the &quot;Mayordomo&quot; (governor of the feast) walks into the circle. The governor chooses a partner to go to the &quot;unsha&quot;, which they attempt to cut down by striking it three times with a machete. The machete is passed from couple to couple as each strikes the tree three times. When the unsha finally falls, the crowd rushes to grab the prizes.

The person who successfully brings down the unsha becomes the following year&#x27;s governor.

=====Crime=====
While generally peaceful, there have been issues with people using Carnival as a pretext for crime, particularly robbery or vandalism, especially in certain areas of Lima.

====Trinidad and Tobago====
In Trinidad and Tobago, Carnival lasts months and culminates in large celebrations on the three days before Ash Wednesday with Dimanche Gras, J&#x27;ouvert, and Mas (masquerade). Tobago&#x27;s celebration culminates on Monday and Tuesday on a much smaller scale, however Tobago hosted its inaugural standalone carnival on October 28–30, 2022 Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum, and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include soca, calypso, rapso, and more recently chutney and chutney soca.

The annual Carnival steel pan competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as &quot;Conventional Steel Band&quot; or &quot;Single Pan Band&quot; by performing renditions of the year&#x27;s calypsos.

&quot;Dimanche Gras&quot; takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the Calypso Monarch is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes &#x27;wire-bending&#x27;.

J&#x27;ouvert, or &quot;Dirty Mas&quot;, takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means &quot;opening of the day&quot;. Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. &quot;Clean Mud&quot; (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J&#x27;ouvert. A common character is &quot;Jab-jabs&quot; (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J&#x27;ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.
Carnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands. Revelers wear only parts of their costumes, more for fun than display or competition. Monday Night Mas is popular in most towns and especially the capital, where smaller bands compete. There is also the &quot;Bomb Competition&quot;, a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.

Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually &quot;Mas Boots&quot; that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah to pass on &quot;The Stage&quot; for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen, earning prize money and usually a vehicle.

This parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches. The most popular are Maracas Beach and Manzanilla Beach, where huge beach parties take place on Ash Wednesday.

====United States====

Carnival celebrations, usually referred to as Mardi Gras (&quot;Fat Tuesday&quot; in French), were first celebrated in the Gulf Coast area, but now occur in many states. Customs originated in the onetime French colonial capitals of Mobile (now in Alabama), New Orleans (Louisiana), and Biloxi (Mississippi), all of which have celebrated for many years with street parades and masquerade balls. Other major American cities with celebrations include Washington, D.C.; St. Louis, Missouri; San Francisco and San Diego, California; Galveston, Texas; and Pensacola, Tampa,Orlando, and Miami in Florida.

The most widely known, elaborate, and popular U.S. events are in New Orleans, where krewes organize parades, balls, and other activities starting with Phunny Phorty Phellows streetcar parade on Twelfth Night and ending with the closing of Bourbon Street at midnight on Fat Tuesday. It is often called &quot;the greatest free party on earth&quot;. Many other Louisiana cities such as Lake Charles, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Lafayette, Mamou, Houma, and Thibodaux, most of which were under French control at one time or another, also hold Carnival celebrations. On the prairie country northwest of Lafayette, Louisiana, the Cajuns celebrate the traditional Courir de Mardi Gras, which has its roots in celebrations from rural Medieval France.

In Puerto Rico, the most popular festivals are the Carnaval de Loíza and Carnaval de Ponce. The Carnaval de Ponce (officially &quot;Carnaval Ponceño&quot;) is celebrated annually in Ponce. The celebration lasts one week and ends on the day before Ash Wednesday. It is one of the oldest carnivals of the Western Hemisphere, dating to 1858. Some authorities trace the Ponce Carnaval to the eighteenth century.

In New York City, a Caribbean Carnival known as the West Indian Day Parade is held in Crown Heights, Brooklyn on Labor Day. Founded by immigrants from Trinidad, the event was initially held at the beginning of Lent, but was later moved to Labor Day in order to allow an outdoor event in the summer.

Starting in 2013, the Slovenian-American community located in the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood of Cleveland began hosting a local version of Kurentovanje, the Carnival event held in the city of Ptuj, Slovenia. The event is conducted on the Saturday prior to Ash Wednesday.

====Uruguay====

The Carnival in Uruguay lasts more than 40 days, generally beginning towards the end of January and running through mid March. Celebrations in Montevideo are the largest. The festival is performed in the European parade style with elements from Bantu and Angolan Benguela cultures imported with slaves in colonial times. The main attractions of Uruguayan Carnival include two colorful parades called &quot;Desfile de Carnaval&quot; (Carnival Parade) and &quot;Desfile de Llamadas&quot; (Calls Parade, a candombe-summoning parade).

During the celebration, theaters called &quot;tablados&quot; are built in many places throughout the cities, especially in Montevideo. Traditionally formed by men and now starting to be open to women, the different Carnival groups (Murgas, Lubolos, or Parodistas) perform a kind of popular opera at the &quot;tablados&quot;, singing and dancing songs that generally relate to the social and political situation. The &#x27;Calls&#x27; groups, basically formed by drummers playing the tamboril, perform candombe rhythmic figures. The carnival in Uruguay have escolas de samba too, and the biggest samba parades are in Artigas and in Montevideo. Revelers wear their festival clothing. Each group has its own theme. Women wearing elegant, bright dresses are called vedettes and provide a sensual touch to parades.

European archetypes (Pierrot, Harlequin, and Columbina) merge with African ancestral elements (the Old Mother or &quot;Mama Vieja&quot;, the Medicine Man or &quot;Gramillero&quot; and the Magician or &quot;Escobero&quot;) in the festival.

====Venezuela====
Carnival in Venezuela covers two days, 40 days before Easter. It is a time when youth in many rural towns have water fights (including the use of water balloons and water guns). Any pedestrian risks getting soaked. Coastal towns and provinces celebrate Carnival more fervently than elsewhere in the country. Venezuelans regard Carnival about the same way they regard Christmas and Semana Santa (Holy Week; the week before Easter Sunday) when they take the opportunity to visit their families.

===Asia===

====India====
In India, Carnival is celebrated only in the state of Goa and was originally a local Roman Catholic tradition known as Intruz which means &quot;swindler&quot; in Konkani while &quot;Entrudo&quot; is the appropriate word in Portuguese for &quot;Carnival&quot;. The present commercial version of the Goan carnival (King Momo, floats, etc.) was created based on the Rio Carnival only in the 1960s as a means of attracting tourism. The largest celebration takes place in the capital Panaji. The commercial Carnival festivities occur during the three days and nights preceding Ash Wednesday. Sixtus Eric Dias from Candolim was the King Momo for the Carnival 2021. All-night parades occur throughout the state with bands, dances, and floats. Grand balls are held in the evenings.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, the word &quot;carnival&quot; or &quot;karnaval&quot; is not related to pre-Lent festivities, but more to festivals in general, especially those with processions and extravagant costumes. One of the largest carnivals in Indonesia is the Solo Batik Carnival, held in Solo, Central Java. The Jember Fashion Carnaval is held in Jember, East Java.

The Roman Catholic community of Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, held an Easter procession in form of an Easter Carnival called &quot;Pawai Paskah Kupang&quot;.

====Israel====
====Philippines====

In the Philippines, the Manila Carnival (Philippine Spanish: ) was formerly a major annual event in Manila during the early American colonial period up to the time before the Second World War. It was organized by the American colonial administration to showcase the economic development of the Philippines. The highlight of the event is the crowning of the Carnival Queens, which is the precursor of later national pageants like Miss Philippines. It is also notable for founding and hosting the first Far Eastern Championship Games (then known as the &quot;First Oriental Olympic Games&quot;) which became the precursor of the modern Asian Games.

The carnival lasted around two weeks in which a variety of shows were presented like circus, vaudeville, slapstick comedies, and theater. Five parades were also held, an opening parade, a military parade, a school parade, a business and industry parade (which included foreign participants), and the floral parade (which featured the Carnival Queen winner).

The carnival was first held in February 1908 and was initially only a city celebration. It expanded to a national scope by 1912, the year that it was held concurrently with the Philippine Exposition. It was discontinued in 1939, due to the outbreak of the Second World War. It was also not held during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1941 to 1944). After Philippine independence in 1946, it was never renewed.

In the modern Philippines, thousands of annual festivals and fiestas throughout the islands feature public celebrations and street parade competitions with elaborate costumes similar to the carnival. However, they are not tied to the Lenten period and are instead celebrations of a Catholic patron saint, of the local culture, or both.

===Europe===

====Albania====
Carnivals have begun to be celebrated in Korça before 1940, a period in which cultural life in this city has been varied. Although a pagan holiday, the Carnival was later celebrated on Feast Day in February. In addition to the many carnival-wearing individuals, there were bands with guitars, bows, and butaphoric masks such as animal heads and humans. The Korça Carnival took a big hit after the creation of cultural societies such as the &quot;Korça Youth&quot;. During this period carnivals were accompanied by mandolins, guitars and humorous songs. Carnival celebrations were discontinued after 1960, to resume in other social conditions after 1990. Korça is one of the first cities to revive the Carnival tradition by establishing the Carnival Association in 1992 as part of the National Carnival Association of Albania. On 10 April 1994, the first International Carnival Festival in Albania was organized in Korça. The following year, the second International Carnival Festival is even larger. Since this year and until 2008, the Korca Carnival group has been represented at a number of international festivals organized in various European countries.

====Belgium====
Many parts of Belgium celebrate Carnival, typically with costume parades, partying and fireworks. These areas include the province of Limburg with its cities Maasmechelen, Maaseik and Lanaken along the river Meuse, the cities of Aalst, Ninove, Binche, Eupen, Halle, Heist, Kelmis, Malmedy, and Stavelot.

The Carnival of Binche dates at least to the 14th century. Parades are held over the three days before Lent; the most important participants are the Gilles, who wear traditional costumes on Shrove Tuesday and throw blood oranges to the crowd. In 2003, the Carnival of Binche was recognised as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The Carnival of Aalst, celebrated during the three days preceding Ash Wednesday, received the same recognition in 2010.

Belgium&#x27;s oldest parade is the Carnival Parade of Maaseik, also held on Laetare Sunday, which originated in 1865.

The Carnival of Malmedy is locally called &quot;Cwarmê&quot;. Even if Malmedy is located in the east Belgium, near the German-speaking area, the &quot;Cwarmê&quot; is a pure Walloon and Latin carnival. The celebration takes place during the four days before Shrove Tuesday. The &quot;Cwarmê&quot; Sunday is the most important and interesting to see. All the old traditional costumes parade in the street. The &quot;Cwarmê&quot; is a &quot;street carnival&quot; and is not only a parade. People who are disguised pass through the crowd and perform a part of the traditional costume they wear. The famous traditional costumes at the &quot;Cwarmê&quot; of Malmedy are the &quot;Haguète&quot;, the &quot;Longuès-Brèsses&quot;, and the &quot;Long-Né.&quot;

Some Belgian cities hold Carnivals during Lent. One of the best-known is Stavelot, where the &quot;Carnival de la Laetare&quot; takes place on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent. The participants include the &quot;Blancs-Moussis&quot;, who dress in white, carry long red noses and parade through town attacking bystanders with confetti and dried pig bladders. The city of Halle also celebrates on Laetare Sunday. 

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croat-majority city of Ljubuški holds a traditional Carnival (). Ljubuški is a member of the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC).

====Croatia====
The most famous Croatian Carnival (Croatian: &quot;karneval&quot;, also called &quot;maškare&quot; or &quot;fašnik&quot;) is the Rijeka Carnival, during which the mayor of Rijeka hands over the keys to the city to the Carnival master (&quot;meštar od karnevala&quot;). The festival includes several events, culminating on the final Sunday in a masked procession. (A similar procession for children takes place on the previous weekend.)

Many towns in Croatia&#x27;s Kvarner region (and in other parts of the country, e.g. in Međimurje County in Northern Croatia) observe the Carnival period, incorporating local traditions and celebrating local culture. Some of the towns and places are Grobnik, Permani, Kastav and many others places near Rijeka, then Čakovec, Samobor etc. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a man-like doll called a &quot;Pust&quot;, who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The Zvončari, or bell-ringers push away winter and all the bad things in the past year and calling spring, they wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads). The traditional Carnival food is fritule, a pastry. This festival can also be called Poklade.

Masks are worn to many of the festivities, including concerts and parties. Children and teachers are commonly allowed to wear masks to school for a day, and also wear masks at school dances or while trick-or-treating. Carnivals also take place in summer. One of the most famous is the Senj Summer Carnival – first celebrated in 1968. The towns of Cres, Pag, Novi Vinodolski, and Fužine also organise Summer Carnivals.

====Cyprus====
Carnival has been celebrated in Cyprus for centuries. The tradition was likely established under Venetian rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as Dionysus. The celebration originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting friends. In the twentieth century, it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the Greek Orthodox calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of Limassol.

Three main parades take place during Carnival. The first is held on the first day, during which the &quot;Carnival King&quot; (either a person in costume or an effigy) rides through the city on his carriage. The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival, and the participants are mainly children. The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town&#x27;s longest avenue. The latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate.

====Czech Republic====

In the Czech Republic, the Masopust Festival takes place from Epiphany (&quot;Den tří králů&quot;) through Ash Wednesday (&quot;Popeleční středa&quot;). The word &quot;masopust&quot; translates literally from old Czech to mean &quot;meat fast&quot;, and the festival often includes a pork feast. The tradition is most common in Moravia but also occurs in Bohemia. While practices vary, masks and costumes are present everywhere.

====Denmark and Norway====
Carnival in Denmark is called &quot;Fastelavn&quot;, and is held on the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. The holiday is sometimes described as a Nordic Halloween, with children dressing in costume and gathering treats for the &quot;Fastelavn&quot; feast. One popular custom is the &quot;fastelavnsris&quot;, a switch that children use to flog their parents to wake them up on Fastelavns Sunday.

In Norway, students having seen celebrations in Paris introduced Carnival processions, masked balls, and Carnival balls to Christiana in the 1840s and 1850s. From 1863, the artist federation &quot;Kunstnerforeningen&quot; held annual Carnival balls in the old Freemasons lodge, which inspired Johan Svendsen&#x27;s compositions &quot;Norsk Kunstnerkarneval&quot; and &quot;Karneval in Paris&quot;. The following year, Svendsen&#x27;s &quot;Festpolonaise&quot; was written for the opening procession. Edvard Grieg attended and wrote &quot;Aus dem Karneval&quot; (&quot;Folkelivsbilleder&quot; Op. 19). Since 1988, the student organization has produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo, with masks, costumes, and processions after attending an opera performance. The Carnival season also includes &quot;Fastelavens søndag&quot; (with cream buns) and &quot;fastelavensris&quot; with decorated branches.

====Finland====
The Helsinki Samba Carnaval, modelled after the samba carnivals in Brazil, takes place every year in middle June. The carnival lacks a proper historical tradition and has instead mostly grown from experimenting.

====France====
Some major Carnivals of mainland France are the Nice Carnival, the Dunkirk Carnival and the Limoux Carnival. The Nice Carnival was held as far back as 1294, and annually attracts over a million visitors during the two weeks preceding Lent.

Since 1604, a characteristic masked Carnival is celebrated in Limoux.

The Dunkirk Carnival is among the greatest and most exuberant carnivals celebrated in Europe. Its traditions date back to the 17th century and are based on the &quot;vischerbende&quot; as fishermen went from one café to another accompanied by their relatives and friends just before departing to Icelandic fishing grounds.

In the French West Indies, it occurs between the Sunday of Epiphany and Ash Wednesday; this dates back to the arrival of French colonists in the islands.

====Germany, Switzerland, and Austria====
=====Germany=====
The earliest written record of Carnival in Germany was in 1296 in Speyer. The first worldwide Carnival parade took place in Cologne in 1823. The most active Carnival week begins on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, with parades during the weekend, and finishes the night before Ash Wednesday, with the main festivities occurring around &quot;Rosenmontag&quot; (Rose Monday). This time is also called the &quot;Fifth Season&quot;. Shrove Tuesday, called &quot;Fastnacht&quot; or &quot;Veilchendienstag&quot;, is celebrated in some cities.

Parties feature self-made and more fanciful costumes and occasional masks. The parties become more exuberant as the weeks progress and peak after New Year, in January and February. The final Tuesday features all-night parties, dancing, hugging, and smooching. Some parties are for all, some for women only and some for children. &quot;Fasnachtsküchle&quot; (similar to &quot;Kreppel&quot; or donuts) are the traditional Fasching food and are baked or fried.

In Germany, &quot;Rheinischer Karnival&quot; and &quot;Schwäbische Fastnacht&quot; are distinct; first is less formal and more political, second is much more traditional.

=====&quot;Rhenish Carnival&quot; (Rheinischer Karneval, Fasnacht, Fasnet, Fastabend, Fastelovend, Fasteleer, Fasching)=====
The &quot;Rheinische&quot; Carnival is held in the west of Germany, mainly in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, but also in Hesse (including Upper Hesse). Similar forms of the festival occur in Bavaria, and other states. Some cities are more famous for celebrations such as parades and costume balls. The Cologne Carnival, as well as those in Mainz, Eschweiler and Düsseldorf, are the largest and most famous. Other cities have their own, often less well-known celebrations, parades, and parties, such as Aachen, Bonn, Worms am Rhein, Speyer, Kaiserslautern, Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Duisburg, Dortmund, Essen, Mannheim, Münster, Krefeld, Ludwigshafen, Mönchengladbach, Stuttgart, Augsburg, Munich, and Nuremberg. The biggest German carnival club is located in the relatively small town of Dieburg in South Hesse. Festivities start as early as 11 November at 11:11am for some carnival organizations, but the main events usually take place after the Christmas season. On Carnival Thursday (called &quot;Old Women Day&quot; or &quot;The Women&#x27;s Day&quot; in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women), women storm city halls, cut men&#x27;s ties, and are allowed to kiss any passing man. Special acrobatic show dances in mock uniforms are a traditional contribution to most festive balls. They may or may not have been a source of inspiration to American cheerleading. The Fasching parades and floats make fun of individual politicians and other public figures. Many speeches do the same.

Traditions often also include the &quot;Faschingssitzung&quot; – a sit-only party with dancing and singing presentations, and often many speeches given that humorously criticize politics.

=====&quot;Swabian-Alemannic&quot; Carnival (&quot;Schwäbische Fastnacht&quot;)=====
The Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht, known as &quot;Schwäbische Fastnacht&quot;, takes place in Baden, Swabia, the Allgäu, Alsace, and Vorarlberg (western Austria). During the pagan era, it represented the time of year when the reign of the grim winter spirits is over, and these spirits are hunted and expelled. It then adapted to Catholicism. The first official record of Karneval, Fasching or Fastnacht in Germany dates to 1296. Often the costumes and masks on parades strictly follow traditional designs and represent specific historical characters, public figures – or specific daemons.

=====Swiss Fasnacht=====
In Switzerland, &quot;Fasnacht&quot; takes place in the Catholic cantons of Switzerland, e.g. in Lucerne (&quot;Lozärner Fasnacht&quot;), but also in Protestant Basel. However, the &quot;Basler Fasnacht&quot; begins on the Monday &quot;after&quot; Ash Wednesday. Both began in the Late Middle Ages. Smaller Fasnacht festivities take place across German Switzerland, e.g. in Bern and Olten, or in the eastern part (Zürich, St. Gallen, Appenzell).

====Greece====
In Greece, Carnival is known as (, &#x27;[goodbye] to meat&#x27;), and officially begins with the &quot;Opening of the Triodion&quot;, the liturgical book used by the Orthodox Church from then until Holy Week. Apokries is made up of three themed weeks of celebration known as (, &#x27;preannouncement week&#x27;), (, &#x27;meat week&#x27;), and (, &#x27;cheese week&#x27;). One of the season&#x27;s high points during Kreatini is ( &#x27;Smoky-Thursday&#x27;), when celebrants throw large outdoor parties and roast huge amounts of meat; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday, after which point meat is forbidden until Easter. The following week, Tirini, is marked by similar festivities revolving around the consumption of cheese, eggs, and dairy and culminates with a &quot;Cheese Sunday&quot;. Great Lent, and its restrictive fasting rules, begins in earnest the next day on Clean Monday. Throughout the Carnival season, festivals, parades, and balls are held all over the country. Many people disguise themselves as (&quot;masqueraders&quot;) and engage in pranks and revelry throughout the season.

Patras holds the largest annual Carnival in Greece, and one of the largest in the world. The famous Patras Carnival is a three-day spectacle replete with concerts, theatre performances, parading troupes, an elaborate treasure hunt game, three major parades, parallel celebrations specifically for children, and many masquerade balls including the famous Bourboúlia () ball in which women wear special robe-like costumes called a to hide their identy. The festivities come to a crescendo on &quot;Cheese Sunday&quot; when The Grand Parade of troupes and floats leads celebrators to the harbor for the ceremonial burning of the effigy of King Carnival.
The Carnival in Corfu is much influenced by the Carnival of Venice. During this period, various theatrical sketches are presented on the island, called &quot;Petególia&quot; or &quot;Petegolétsa&quot; (Πετεγολέτσα) in the local dialect. In previous centuries, existed also the custom of &quot;Giostra&quot; (jousting).

The second biggest Carnival in Greece takes place in Xanthi (Eastern Macedonia and Thrace) since 1966 and it is the major event of its kind in Northern Greece. The Xanthi Carnival manages to attract visitors from the nearby countries such as Bulgaria, Turkey, and Romania. Other regions host festivities of smaller extent, focused on the reenactment of traditional carnival customs, such as Tyrnavos (Thessaly), Kozani (Western Macedonia), Rethymno (Crete). Tyrnavos holds an annual Phallus festival, a traditional &quot;phallkloric&quot; event in which giant, gaudily painted effigies of phalluses made of papier-mâché are paraded, and which women are asked to touch or kiss. Their reward for so doing is a shot of the famous local tsipouro alcohol spirit.

Every year, from the 1st to the 8th of January, mostly in regions of Western Macedonia, traditional Carnival festivals erupt. Best known of these is the () festival in the city of Kastoria whose celebration may date back to antiquity and whose name derives from the Latin word &#x27;beggars&#x27;, in reference to the beggars who could mingle with the rich in their masks. It takes place from 6–8 January with mass participation and is noted for its brass bands, flutes, and Macedonian drums. It is an ancient celebration of nature&#x27;s rebirth akin to ancient festivals for Dionysus (Dionysia) and Kronos (Saturnalia).

====Hungary====
Carnival season called &quot;Farsang&quot; in Hungarian happens between Epiphany (January 6) and Shrove Tuesday and is the time when costume parties traditionally take place, primarily for children (similar to Halloween).

In Mohács, Hungary, the &quot;Busójárás&quot; is a celebration held at the end of the Carnival season. It involves locals dressing in woolly costumes, with scary masks and noise-makers. According to legend, the festival celebrates both the conclusion of the winter season and a victory by the local people over invading Ottomans in 1526.

====Italy====
The most famous Carnivals of Italy are held in Venice, Viareggio, and Ivrea.

The Carnival in Venice was first recorded in 1268. Its subversive nature is reflected in Italy&#x27;s many laws over the centuries attempting to restrict celebrations and the wearing of masks. Carnival celebrations in Venice were halted after the city fell under Austrian control in 1798, but were revived in the late 20th century.

The month-long Carnival of Viareggio is characterized mainly by its parade of floats and masks caricaturing popular figures. In 2001, the town built a new &quot;Carnival citadel&quot; dedicated to Carnival preparations and entertainment.


The Carnival of Ivrea is famous for its &quot;Battle of the Oranges&quot; fought with fruit between the people on foot and the troops of the tyrant on carts, to remember the wars of the Middle Ages.

In the most part of the Archdiocese of Milan, the Carnival lasts four more days, ending on the Saturday after Ash Wednesday, because of the Ambrosian Rite.

In Sardinia, the Carnival (in Sardinian language &quot;Carrasecare&quot; or &quot;Carrasegare&quot;) varies greatly from the one in the mainland of Italy: due to its close relation to the Dionysian Rites, the majority of the Sardinian celebrations features not only feasts and parades but also crude fertility rites such as bloodsheds to fertilize the land, the death and the resurrection of the Carnival characters and representations of violence and torture. The typical characters of the Sardinian Carnival are zoomorphic and/or androgynous, such as the &quot;Mamuthones and Issohadores&quot; from Mamoiada, the &quot;Boes and Merdules&quot; from Ottana and many more. The Carnival is celebrated with street performances that are typically accompanied by Sardinian dirges called , meaning literally &quot;cry of a baby when the mother doesn&#x27;t want nursed him/her anymore&quot; (from the word &quot;titta&quot; meaning breasts). Other particular and important Carnival instances in Sardinia are the Sartiglia in Oristano and the Tempio Pausania Carnival.

====Lithuania====
&quot;Užgavėnės&quot; is a Lithuanian festival that takes place on Shrove Tuesday. Its name in English means &quot;the time before Lent&quot;. The celebration corresponds to Carnival holiday traditions.

&quot;Užgavėnės&quot; begins on the night before Ash Wednesday, when an effigy of winter (usually named Morė) is burnt. A major element symbolizes the defeat of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a staged battle between Lašininis (&quot;porky&quot;) personifying winter and Kanapinis (&quot;hempen man&quot;) personifying spring. Devils, witches, goats, the grim reaper, and other joyful and frightening characters appear in costumes during the celebrations.

Eating pancakes is an important part of the celebration.

====Luxembourg====
In Luxembourg, the pre-Lenten holiday season is known as &quot;Fuesend&quot;. Throughout the Grand-Duchy, parades and parties are held.

Pétange is the home of the Grand-Duchy&#x27;s largest pre-Lenten Karneval celebration. Annually hosting a cavalcade with roughly 1,200 participants and thousand of celebrants, the official name is Karneval Gemeng Péiteng or &quot;Kagepe&quot; (the initials in Luxembourgish are pronounced &quot;Ka&quot;, &quot;Ge&quot; and &quot;Pe&quot;).

The town of Remich holds a three-day-long celebration, notable for two special events in addition to its parades. The first is the &quot;Stréimännchen&quot;, which is the burning of a male effigy from the Remich Bridge that crosses the Moselle River separating the Grand Duchy from Germany. The &quot;Stréimännchen&quot; symbolizes the burning away of winter. The other special event at the Remich Fuesend celebrations is the &quot;Buergbrennen&quot; or bonfire that closes the celebration.

Like Remich, the town of Esch-sur-Alzette holds a three-day celebration. Other major Fuesend parades in Luxembourg are held in the towns of Diekirch and Schifflange.

====Malta====


Carnival in Malta (Maltese: &quot;il-Karnival ta&#x27; Malta&quot;) was introduced to the islands by Grand Master Piero de Ponte in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dresses, and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: &quot;ir-Re tal-Karnival&quot;), marching bands, and costumed revellers.

The largest celebration takes place in and around the capital city of Valletta and Floriana; several more &quot;spontaneous&quot; Carnivals take place in more remote areas. The Nadur Carnival is notable for its darker themes. In 2005, the Nadur Carnival hosted the largest-ever gathering of international Carnival organizers for the FECC&#x27;s global summit.

Traditional dances include the &quot;parata&quot;, a lighthearted re-enactment of the 1565 victory of the Knights Hospitaller over the Turks, and an 18th-century court dance known as &quot;il-Maltija&quot;. Carnival food includes &quot;perlini&quot; (multi-coloured, sugar-coated almonds) and the &quot;prinjolata&quot;, which is a towering assembly of sponge cake, biscuits, almonds, and citrus fruits, topped with cream and pine nuts.

====Netherlands====
Carnival in the Netherlands is called &quot;Carnaval&quot;, &quot;Vastenavond&quot; (&quot;Eve of Lent&quot;) or, in Limburgish, , and is mostly celebrated in traditionally Catholic regions, particularly in the southern provinces of North Brabant and Limburg, but also in Overijssel, especially in Twente. While Dutch Carnaval is officially celebrated on the Sunday through Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, since the 1970s the feast has gradually started earlier and generally includes now the preceding weekend. Although traditions vary from town to town, Dutch carnaval usually includes a parade, a &quot;Prince Carnival&quot; plus cortège (&quot;Council of 11&quot;, sometimes with a Jester or Adjutant), sometimes also the handing over by the mayor of the symbolic keys of the town to Prince Carnival, the burning or burial of a symbolic figure, a peasant wedding (&quot;boerenbruiloft&quot;), and eating herring (&quot;haring happen&quot;) on Ash Wednesday.

Two main variants can be distinguished: the &quot;Rhineland carnaval&quot;, found in the province of Limburg, and the &quot;Bourgondische carnaval&quot;, found mainly in North Brabant. Maastricht, Limburg&#x27;s capital, holds a street carnaval that features elaborate costumes.

The first known documentation dates from the late 8th century (&quot;Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum&quot;), but Carnaval was already mentioned during the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and by Caesarius of Arles (470–542) around 500 CE. In the Netherlands itself, the first documentation is found in 1383 in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The oldest-known images of Dutch Carnaval festivities date from 1485, also in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

Normal daily life comes to a stop for about a week in the southern part of the Netherlands during the carnival, with roads temporary blocked and many local businesses closed for the week as a result of employees who are en masse taking the days off during and the day after the carnival.

====North Macedonia====
The most popular Carnivals in North Macedonia are in Vevčani and Strumica.

The Vevčani Carnival (Macedonian: Вевчански Kарневал, translated &quot;Vevchanski Karneval&quot;) has been held for over 1,400 years, and takes place on 13 and 14 January (New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day by the old calendar). The village becomes a live theatre where costumed actors improvise on the streets in roles such as the traditional &quot;August the Stupid&quot;.

The Strumica Carnival (Macedonian: Струмички Карневал, translated &quot;Strumichki Karneval&quot;) has been held since at least 1670, when the Turkish author Evlija Chelebija wrote while staying there, &quot;I came into a town located in the foothills of a high hillock and what I saw that night was masked people running house–to–house, with laughter, scream and song.&quot; The Carnival took an organized form in 1991; in 1994, Strumica became a member of FECC and in 1998 hosted the XVIII International Congress of Carnival Cities. The Strumica Carnival opens on a Saturday night at a masked ball where the Prince and Princess are chosen; the main Carnival night is on Tuesday, when masked participants (including groups from abroad) compete in various subjects. As of 2000, the Festival of Caricatures and Aphorisms has been held as part of Strumica&#x27;s Carnival celebrations.

====Poland====
The Polish Carnival season includes Fat Thursday (Polish: &quot;Tłusty Czwartek&quot;), when &quot;pączki&quot; (doughnuts) are eaten, and &quot;Śledzik&quot; (Shrove Tuesday) or Herring Day. The Tuesday before the start of Lent is also often called &quot;Ostatki&quot; (literally &quot;leftovers&quot;), meaning the last day to party before the Lenten season.

The traditional way to celebrate Carnival is the &quot;kulig&quot;, a horse-drawn sleigh ride through the snow-covered countryside. In modern times, Carnival is increasingly seen as an excuse for intensive partying and has become more commercialized, with stores offering Carnival-season sales.

====Portugal====
Carnival is Carnaval in Portugal, celebrated throughout the country, most famously in Ovar, Sesimbra, Madeira, Loulé, Nazaré, Mealhada, and Torres Vedras. Carnaval in Podence and Lazarim incorporates pagan traditions such as the careto, while the Torres Vedras celebration is probably the most typical.

=====Azores=====
On the islands of the Azores, local clubs and Carnival groups create colorful and creative costumes that jab at politics or culture.

On São Miguel Island, Carnival features street vendors selling fried dough, called a malassada. The festival on the biggest island starts off with a black tie grand ball, followed by Latin music at Coliseu Micaelense. A children&#x27;s parade fills the streets of Ponta Delgada with children from each school district in costume. A massive parade continues past midnight, ending in fireworks.

The event includes theatre performances and dances. In the &quot;Danças de Entrudo&quot;, hundreds of people follow the dancers around the island. Throughout the show the dancers act out scenes from daily life. The &quot;Dances de Carnival&quot; are allegorical and comedic tales acted out in the streets. The largest is in Angra do Heroísmo, with more than 30 groups performing. More Portuguese-language theatrical performances occur there than anywhere else.

Festivities end on Ash Wednesday, when locals sit down for the &quot;Batatada&quot; or potato feast, in which the main dish is salted cod with potatoes, eggs, mint, bread and wine. Residents then return to the streets for the burning of the &quot;Carnival clown&quot;, ending the season.

=====Madeira=====

On the island of Madeira, the island&#x27;s capital, Funchal, wakes up on the Friday before Ash Wednesday to the sound of brass bands and Carnival parades throughout downtown. Festivities continue with concerts and shows in the Praça do Município for five consecutive days. The main Carnival street parade takes place on Saturday evening, with thousands of samba dancers filling the streets. The traditional street event takes place on Tuesday, featuring daring caricatures.

Arguably, Brazil&#x27;s Carnival could be traced to the period of the Portuguese Age of Discoveries when their caravels passed regularly through Madeira, a territory that emphatically celebrated Carnival.

=====Ovar=====

Carnival in the town of Ovar, in the Aveiro Region, began in 1952 and is the region&#x27;s largest festivity, representing a large investment and the most important touristic event to the city. It is known for its creative designs, displayed in the Carnival Parade, which features troupes with themed costumes and music, ranging from the traditional to pop culture. Along with the Carnival Parade, there are five nights of partying, finishing with the famous &#x27;Magical night&#x27; where people come from all over the country, mostly with their handmade costumes, only to have fun with the locals.

===== Other regions =====
In Estarreja, in the Central region of Portugal, the town&#x27;s first references to Carnival were in the 14th century, with &quot;Flower Battles&quot;, richly decorated floats that paraded through the streets. At the beginning of the twentieth century, these festivities ended with the deaths of its main promoters, only to reappear again in the 1960s to become one of many important Carnival festivals in Portugal.

In the Northern region of Podence, children appear from Sunday to Tuesday with tin masks and colorful multilayered costumes made from red, green and yellow wool. In the Central Portugal towns of Nelas and Canas de Senhorim, Carnival is an important tourist event. Nelas and Canas de Senhorim host four festive parades that offer colorful and creative costumes: Bairro da Igreja and Cimo do Povo in Nelas and do Paço and do Rossio in Canas de Senhorim.

In Lisbon, Carnival offers parades, dances and festivities featuring stars from Portugal and Brazil. The Loures Carnival celebrates the country&#x27;s folk traditions, including the &quot;enterro do bacalhau&quot; or burial of the cod, which marks the end of Carnival and the festivities.

North of Lisbon is the famous Torres Vedras Carnival, described as the &quot;most Portuguese in Portugal&quot;. The celebration highlight is a parade of creatively decorated streetcars that satirize society and politics.

Other Central Portugal towns, such as Fátima and Leiria, offer colorful, family-friendly celebrations. In these towns, everyone dresses up as if it were Halloween. Children and adults wear masks.

In the Algarve region, several resort towns offer Carnival parades. Besides the themed floats and cars, the festivities include &quot;samba&quot; groups, bands, dances, and music.

In Lazarim, a civil parish in the municipality of Lamego, celebrations follow the pagan tradition of Roman Saturnalias. It celebrates by burning colorful effigies and dressing in home-made costumes. Locally-made wooden masks are worn. The masks are effigies of men and women with horns, but both roles are performed by men. They are distinguished by their clothes, with caricature attributes of both men and women.

The Lazarim Carnaval cycle encompasses two periods, the first starting on the fifth Sunday before Quinquagesima Sunday. Masked figures and people wearing large sculpted heads walk through the town. The locals feast on meats, above all pork. The second cycle, held on Sundays preceding Ash Wednesday, incorporates the tradition of the Compadres and Comadres, with men and women displaying light-hearted authority over the other.

Over the five weeks, men prepare large masked heads and women raise funds to pay for two mannequins that will be sacrificed in a public bonfire. This is a key event and is unique to Portugal. During the bonfire, a girl reads the Compadre&#x27;s will and a boy reads the Comadre&#x27;s will. The executors of the will are named, a donkey is symbolically distributed to both female and male &quot;heirs&quot;, and then there is the final reckoning in which the Entrudo, or Carnival doll, is burned.

====Russia====


Maslenitsa (, also called &quot;Pancake Week&quot; or &quot;Cheese Week&quot;) is a Russian folk holiday that incorporates some pagan traditions. It is celebrated during the last week before Lent. The essential element is bliny, Russian pancakes, popularly taken to symbolize the sun. Round and golden, they are made from the rich foods allowed that week by the Orthodox traditions: butter, eggs, and milk. (In the tradition of Orthodox Lent, the consumption of meat ceases one week before that of milk and eggs.)

Maslenitsa also includes masquerades, snowball fights, sledding, swinging on swings, and sleigh rides. The mascot is a brightly dressed straw effigy of Lady Maslenitsa, formerly known as Kostroma. The celebration culminates on Sunday evening, when Lady Maslenitsa is stripped of her finery and put to the flames of a bonfire.

====Slovakia====

In Slovakia, the Fašiangy (&quot;fašiang&quot;, &quot;fašangy&quot;) takes place from Three Kings Day (&quot;Traja králi&quot;) until the midnight before Ash Wednesday (&quot;Škaredá streda&quot; or &quot;Popolcová streda&quot;). At the midnight marking the end of &quot;fašiangy&quot;, a symbolic burial ceremony for the contrabass is performed, because music ceases for Lent.

====Slovenia====
The Slovenian name for carnival is &quot;pust&quot;. The Slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters, among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent (plural: &quot;Kurenti&quot;), a monstrous and demon-like, but fluffy figure. The most significant festival is held in Ptuj (see: Kurentovanje). Its special feature are the Kurents themselves, magical creatures from another world, who visit major events throughout the country, trying to banish the winter and announce spring&#x27;s arrival, fertility, and new life with noise and dancing. The origin of the Kurent is a mystery, and not much is known of the times, beliefs, or purposes connected with its first appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.

The Cerknica Carnival is heralded by a figure called &quot;Poganjič&quot; carrying a whip. In the procession, organised by the &quot;Pust society&quot;, a monstrous witch named Uršula is driven from the mountain Slivnica, to be burned at the stake on Ash Wednesday. Unique to this region is a group of dormice, driven by the Devil and a huge fire-breathing dragon. Cerkno and its surrounding area are known for the &quot;Laufarji&quot;, Carnival figures with artistically carved wooden masks.

The &quot;Maškare&quot; from Dobrepolje used to represent a triple character: the beautiful, the ugly (among which the most important represented by an old man, an old woman, a hunchback, and a &quot;Kurent&quot;), and the noble (imitating the urban elite).

The major part of the population, especially the young and children, dress up in ordinary non-ethnic costumes, going to school, work, and organized events, where prizes are given for the best and most original costumes. Costumed children sometimes go from house to house asking for treats.

====Spain====
Arguably the most famous Carnivals in Spain are Santa Cruz, Las Palmas, Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Tarragona, Águilas, Solsona, Cádiz, Badajoz, Bielsa (an ancestral Carnival celebration), Plan, San Juan de Plan, Laza, Verín, Viana, and Xinzo de Limia.

One of the oldest pre-Indo-European carnival in Europe takes place in Ituren and Zubieta in Navarre in late January/early February. The carnival symbolises the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, light and darkness, winter and spring.

=====Andalusia=====

In Cádiz, the costumes worn are often related to recent news, such as the bird flu epidemic in 2006, during which many people were disguised as chickens. The feeling of this Carnival is the sharp criticism, the funny play on words and the imagination in the costumes, more than the glamorous dressings. It is traditional to paint the face with lipstick as a humble substitute of a mask.

The most famous groups are the chirigotas, choirs, and comparsas. The chirigotas are well known witty, satiric popular groups who sing about politics, new times, and household topics, wearing the same costume, which they prepare for the whole year. The Choirs (&quot;coros&quot;) are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes. Their signature piece is the &quot;Carnival Tango&quot;, alternating comical and serious repertory. The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in Cádiz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients. They have a more elaborated polyphony that is easily recognizable by the typical countertenor voice.

=====Canary Islands=====
The Santa Cruz Carnival is, with the Carnival of Cadiz, the most important festival for Spanish tourism and Spain&#x27;s largest Carnival. In 1980, it was declared a Festival Tourist International Interest. Every February, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital of the largest of the Canary Islands, hosts the event, attracting around a million people.

In 1980, it was declared a Festival Tourist International Interest. In 1987, Cuban singer Celia Cruz with orchestra Billo&#x27;s Caracas Boys performed at the &quot;Carnival Chicharrero&quot;, attended by 250,000 people. This was registered in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the largest gathering of people in an outdoor plaza to attend a concert, a record she holds today.

The Carnival of Las Palmas (Gran Canaria) has a drag queen&#x27;s gala where a jury chooses a winner.

=====Catalonia=====
In Catalonia, people dress in masks and costume (often in themed groups) and organize a week-long series of parties, pranks, outlandish activities such as bed races, street dramas satirizing public figures, and raucous processions to welcome the arrival of &quot;Sa Majestat el Rei Carnestoltes&quot; (&quot;His Majesty King Carnival&quot;), known by various titles, including &quot;el Rei dels poca-soltes&quot; (&quot;King of the crackpots&quot;), &quot;Princep etern de Cornudella&quot; (&quot;eternal Prince of Cuckoldry&quot;), (&quot;Duke of the fool and corrupt&quot;), &quot;Marquès de la bona mamella&quot; (&quot;Marquis of the lovely breast&quot;), &quot;Comte de tots els barruts&quot; (&quot;Count of the insolent&quot;), &quot;Baró de les Calaverades&quot; (&quot;Baron of mocturnal debaucheries&quot;), and (&quot;Lord of the tall blooming Banana, of the voyeurs and punks and the artist of honor upon the bed&quot;).

The King presides over a period of misrule in which conventional social rules may be broken and reckless behavior is encouraged. Festivities are held in the open air, beginning with a &quot;cercavila&quot;, a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend. &quot;Rues&quot; of masked revelers dance alongside. On Thursday, &quot;Dijous Gras&quot; (Fat Thursday) is celebrated, also called &#x27;omelette day&#x27; (el &quot;dia de la truita&quot;), on which &quot;coques&quot; (), and omelettes are eaten. The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival, who is typically burned on a pyre in what is called the &quot;burial of the sardine&quot; (&quot;enterrament de la sardina&quot;), or, in Vilanova, as &quot;l&#x27;enterro&quot;.

The Carnival of Vilanova i la Geltrú has a documented history from 1790 and is one of the richest in the variety of its acts and rituals. It adopts an ancient style in which satire, the grotesque body (particularly cross-dressing and displays of exaggerated bellies, noses, and phalli), and, above all, active participation are valued over glamorous, media-friendly spectacles that Vilanovins mock as &quot;thighs and feathers&quot;. It is best known for &quot;Les Comparses&quot;, a tumultuous dance held on Sunday in which thousands of dancers in traditional dresses and &quot;Mantons de Manila&quot; (Manila Shawls), organized into groups of couples march in the street forming lines while throwing tons of hard candies at one another. Vilanovinians organize several rituals during the week. On &quot;Dijous Gras,&quot; Vilanovin children are excused from school to participate in the &quot;Merengada,&quot; a day-long scene of eating and fighting with sticky, sweet meringue while adults have a meringue battle at midnight at the historic &quot;Plaça de les Cols&quot;.

On Friday citizens are called to a parade for the arrival of King Carnival called &quot;l&#x27;Arrivo&quot; that changes every year. It includes a raucous procession of floats and dancers lampooning current events or public figures and a bitingly satiric sermon (&quot;el sermo&quot;) delivered by the King himself. On Saturday, the King&#x27;s procession and his concubines scandalize the town with their sexual behavior; the mysterious &quot;Moixo Foguer&quot; (Little-Bird-Bonfire) is shown accompanied by the &quot;Xerraire&quot; (jabberer), who try to convince the crowd about the wonders that this mighty bird carries in a box (which ends up being in fact a naked person covered in feathers); and other items such as: sport acts and barbecues in the streets; the &quot;talking-dance&quot; of the Mismatched Couples (&quot;Ball de Malcasats&quot;); the children&#x27;s King &quot;Caramel&quot; whose massive belly, long nose and sausage-like hair hint at his insatiable appetites; or the debauched &quot;Nit dels Mascarots&quot; dance.

After Sunday, vilanovinians continue its Carnival with the children&#x27;s party &quot;Vidalet&quot;, the satirical chorus of Carnestoltes songs and the last night of revelry, the &quot;Vidalot.&quot; For the King&#x27;s funeral, people dress in elaborate mourning costume, many of them cross-dressing men who carry bouquets of phallic vegetables. In the funeral house, the body of the King is surrounded by weeping concubines, crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death. The King&#x27;s body is carried to the &quot;Plaça de la Vila&quot; where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine, suggesting the symbolic cannibalism of the communion ritual. Finally, amid rockets and explosions, the King&#x27;s body is burned in a massive pyre.

Carnaval de Solsona takes place in Solsona, Lleida. It is one of the longest; free events in the streets and nightly concerts run for more than a week. The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell − because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that &quot;pisses&quot; above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night. For this reason, the inhabitants are called &quot;matarrucs&quot; (&quot;donkey killers&quot;).

&quot;Comparses&quot; groups organize free activities. These groups of friends create and personalize a uniformed suit to wear during the festivities.

In Sitges, special feasts include (&quot;xató&quot; is a traditional local salad of the Penedès coast) served with omelettes. Two important moments are the &quot;Rua de la Disbauxa&quot; (Debauchery Parade) on Sunday night and the &quot;Rua de l&#x27;Extermini&quot; (Extermination Parade) on Tuesday night. In 2022, the Rua de la Disbauxa hosted 34 floats and over 1,200 participants.

Tarragona has one of the region&#x27;s most complete ritual sequences. The events start with the building of a huge barrel and ends with its burning with the effigies of the King and Queen. On Saturday, the main parade takes place with masked groups, zoomorphic figures, music, and percussion bands, and groups with fireworks (the devils, the dragon, the ox, the female dragon). Carnival groups stand out for their clothes full of elegance, showing brilliant examples of fabric crafts, at the Saturday and Sunday parades. About 5,000 people are members of the parade groups.

=====Galicia=====
In Galicia, the celebration is commonly known as &quot;Entroido&quot;, or otherwise &quot;Antroido&quot;, &quot;Entroiro&quot;, &quot;Entruido&quot; or &quot;Entrudio&quot;. Throughout history, the cities, towns and villages of Galicia had poor connections between each other, so &quot;Entroidos&quot; are very diverse with different cultural traditions and characters based in the zone you&#x27;re in. Nine Entroido celebrations have been declared as places of touristic interest in Galicia: Xinzo de Limia, Cobres, Laza, Verín, Felos de Maceda, Xenerais do Ulla, Vilariño de Conso, Androlla and Viana do Bolo and Manzaneda.

In Galician cuisine, there are various traditional dishes of &quot;Entroido&quot;, such as &quot;Filloas&quot; (a dish similar to crêpes) and &quot;Orellas&quot; (A traditional dish of Catalonia and the Valencian Community, but also traditionally served in Galician and French carnivals). Other traditional foods include Chorizo, Lacón, Caldo, Androlla and Pig Heads.

===== Valencian Community =====
One of the most important Spanish Carnival Festivals is celebrated in Vinaròs, a small town situated in the northern part of the province of Castellón, Valencian Community.

The Carnival Festival in Vinaròs has been declared of Regional Touristic Interest and in 2017, this outstanding and ancient show celebrates 35 years of History. The Carnival Festival in Vinaròs became a forbidden celebration during the Spanish Civil War but after the dictatorship, the party regained importance with the democracy&#x27;s arrival.

Every year in February, forty days before the Spanish Cuaresma, thirty-three &quot;comparsas&quot; go singing, dancing and walking down the streets in a great costumes&#x27; parade in Vinaròs. In addition, many other festive, cultural and musical activities of all ages take place, such as an epic battle of confetti and flour, funny karaoke contests or the so-called &quot;Entierro de la Sardina&quot; (Burial of the Sardine).

Nevertheless, the most important event is the gala performance of the Carnival&#x27;s Queen. In this breathtaking show, it is elected the Queen of the Carnival, the major representative of the Carnival in Vinaròs all year round.

====Turkey====
For almost five centuries, local Greek Orthodox communities throughout Istanbul celebrated Carnival with weeks of bawdy parades, lavish balls, and street parties. This continued for weeks before Lent. Baklahorani took place on Shrove Monday or Clean Monday, the last day of the carnival season. The event was led by the Greek Orthodox community, but the celebrations were public and inter-communal. The final celebration was sited in the Kurtuluş district. In 2010, the festival was revived.

====United Kingdom====
In England, the three days before Lent were called Shrovetide. A time for confessing sins (&quot;shriving&quot;), it had fewer festivities than the continental Carnivals. Today, Shrove Tuesday is celebrated as Pancake Day, but little else of the Lent-related Shrovetide survived the 16th-century English Reformation. Since 2012, Hastings in East Sussex has celebrated with its own Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday.

Five days of music and street events culminating with a Grand Ball on Fat Tuesday itself. Loosely based on the New Orleans style of carnival, Hastings has taken its own course.

<text>Artois ( , ; ; Picard: &quot;Artoé;&quot; English adjective: &quot;Artesian&quot;) is a region of northern France. Its territory covers an area of about 4,000 km2 and it has a population of about one million. Its principal cities include Arras (Dutch: &quot;Atrecht&quot;), Saint-Omer, Lens, and Béthune. It is the eponym for the term &quot;Artesian&quot;.

==Location==
Artois occupies the interior of the Pas-de-Calais &quot;département&quot;, the western part of which constitutes the former Boulonnais. Artois roughly corresponds to the arrondissements of Arras, Béthune, Saint Omer, and Lens, and the eastern part of the arrondissement of Montreuil. It occupies the western end of the coalfield which stretches eastward through the neighbouring Nord &quot;département&quot; and across central Belgium.

==History==

Originally a feudal county itself, Artois was annexed by the county of Flanders. It came to France in 1180 as a dowry of a Flemish princess, Isabelle of Hainaut, and was again made a separate county in 1237 for Robert, a grandson of Isabelle. Through inheritance, Artois came under the rule of the dukes of Burgundy in 1384. At the death of the fourth duke, Charles the Bold, Artois was inherited by the Habsburgs and passed to the dynasty&#x27;s Spanish line. After the religious revolts of 1566 in the Netherlands, Artois briefly entered the Dutch Revolt in 1576, participating in the Pacification of Ghent until it formed the Union of Atrecht in 1579.

After the Union of Atrecht, Artois and Hainaut (Dutch: &quot;Henegouwen&quot;) reached a separate agreement with Philip II. Artois remained with the Spanish Netherlands until it was conquered by France during the Franco-Spanish War. The annexation was acknowledged during the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, and it became a French province. Artois had already been largely French-speaking, but it was part of the Southern Netherlands until the French annexation.

Artois experienced rapid industrial development during the second half of the 19th century, fueled by its rich coal resources. During World War I, the front line between the opposing Central Powers and Allied armies in France ran through the province, resulting in enormous physical damage. Since the second half of the 20th century, Artois has suffered along with nearby areas because of the decline of the coal industry.

==Notable residents==
* Pierre-Charles Le Sueur (c. 1657 – c. 1705), born in Artois, noted explorer and trader.
* Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), French revolutionary leader, born in Arras
* Carolus Clusius (1526–1609), early botanist
*Robert-François Damiens (1715–1757), failed regicide, born in La Thieuloye

<doc id="38486" wikidata="Q2905141" url="?curid=38486" title="List of Anuran families">
<text>This list of Anuran families shows all extant families of Anura. Anura is an order of animals in the class Amphibia that includes frogs and toads. More than 5,000 species are described in the order. The living anurans are typically divided into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, Mesobatrachia, and Neobatrachia. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles.

==Taxonomy==
The archaeobatrachians are the most primitive of frogs. These frogs have morphological characteristics which are found mostly in extinct frogs, and are absent in most of the modern frog species. Most of these characteristics are not common between all the families of Archaeobatrachia, or are not absent from all the modern species of frogs. However, all archaeobatrachians have free vertebrae, whereas all other species of frogs have their ribs fused to their vertebrae.

The Neobatrachia comprise the most modern species of frogs. Most of these frogs have morphological features which are more complex than those of the mesobatrachians and archaeobatrachians. The neobatrachians all have a palatine bone, which braces the upper jaw to the neurocranium. This is absent in all Archaeobatrachia and some Mesobatrachia. The third distal carpus is fused with the remaining carpal bones. The adductor longus muscle is present in the neobatrachians, but absent in the archaeobatrachians and some mesobatrachians. It is believed to have differentiated from pectineus muscle, and this differentiation has not occurred in the primitive frogs. 

The Mesobatrachia are considered the evolutionary link between the Archaeobatrachia and the Neobatrachia. The families within the mesobatrachian suborder generally contain morphological features typical of both the other suborders. For example, the palatine bone is absent in all archaeobatrachians, and present in all neobatrachians. However, within the mesobatrachians families, it can be dependent on the species as to whether the palatine bone is present.

Due to the many morphological features which separate the frogs, many different systems are used for the classification of the anuran suborders. These different classification systems usually split the Mesobatrachia suborder.

<text>A drummer is a percussionist who creates music using drums.

Most contemporary western bands that play rock, pop, jazz, or R&amp;B music include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. The drummer&#x27;s equipment includes a drum kit (or &quot;drum set&quot; or &quot;trap set&quot;), which includes various drums, cymbals and an assortment of accessory hardware such as pedals, standing support mechanisms, and drum sticks.

Particularly in the traditional music of many countries, drummers use individual drums of various sizes and designs rather than drum kits. Some use only their hands to strike the drums.

In larger ensembles, the drummer may be part of a rhythm section with other percussionists playing. These musicians provide the timing and rhythmic foundation which allow the players of melodic instruments, including voices, to coordinate their musical performance.

Some famous drummers include: Max Roach, Ringo Starr (the Beatles), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Ginger Baker (Cream), Keith Moon (the Who), Neil Peart (Rush), Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, Sheila E, Brian Blade, Jack DeJohnette, Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander (Primus), Phil Rudd (AC/DC), Roger Taylor (Queen), Charlie Watts (the Rolling Stones), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Bill Ward (Black Sabbath), Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Travis Barker (Blink-182), Phil Collins (Genesis), Rick Allen (Def Leppard), Alex Van Halen (Van Halen), Tré Cool (Green Day), Dave Grohl (Nirvana), Joey Jordison (Slipknot), Lars Ulrich (Metallica), Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe), James “The Rev” Sullivan (Avenged Sevenfold) and Cesar Zuiderwijk (Golden Earring).

As well as the primary rhythmic function, in some musical styles, such as world, jazz, classical, and electronica, the drummer is called upon to provide solo and lead performances, at times when the main feature of the music is the rhythmic development. Drummers tend to possess considerable stamina and hands-eyes-legs coordination.

There are many tools that a drummer can use for either timekeeping or soloing.
These include cymbals (china, crash, ride, splash, hi-hats, etc.), snare, toms, 
auxiliary percussion (bells, Latin drums, cowbells, temple blocks) and many others.
There are also single, double, and triple bass pedals that drummers may use for the bass drum.

==Military==
Before motorized transport became widespread, drummers played a key role in military conflicts. Military drummers provided s that set a steady marching pace and elevated troop morale on the battlefield. In some armies drums also assisted in combat by keeping cadence for firing and loading drills with muzzle loading guns. Military drummers were also employed on the parade field, when troops passed in review, and in various ceremonies including ominous drum rolls accompanying disciplinary punishments. Children also served as drummer boys well into the nineteenth century, though less commonly than is popularly assumed; due to the nature of the job, experienced older men were preferred.

In modern times, drummers are not employed in battle, but their ceremonial duties continue. Typically buglers and drummers mass under a sergeant-drummer and during marches alternately perform with the regiment or battalion ensembles.

Military-based musical percussion traditions were not limited exclusively to the western world. When Emir Osman I was appointed commander of the Turkish army on the Byzantine border in the late 13th century, he was symbolically installed via a handover of musical instruments by the Seldjuk sultan. In the Ottoman Empire, the size of a military band reflected the rank of its commander in chief: the largest band was reserved for the Sultan (viz. his Grand Vizier when taking the field). It included various percussion instruments, often adopted in European military music (as &#x27;Janissary music&#x27;). The pitched bass drum is still known in some languages as the Turkish Drum.

Military drumming is the origin of Traditional grip as opposed to Matched grip of drumsticks.

==Parades==
The drumline is a type of marching ensemble descended from military drummers, and can be arranged as a performance of a drum, a group of drummers, or as a part of a larger marching band. Their uniforms will often have a military style and a fancy hat. In recent times, it is more common to see drummers in parades wearing costumes with an African, Asian, Latin, Native American, or tribal look and sound.

==Cultural drumming==
Various indigenous cultures use the drum to create a sense of unity with others especially during recreational events. The drum also helps in prayers and meditations.

<doc id="38493" wikidata="Q34740" url="?curid=38493" title="Genus">
<text>Genus (; : genera ) is a taxonomic rank above species and below family as used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

:E.g. &quot;Panthera leo&quot; (lion) and &quot;Panthera onca&quot; (jaguar) are two species within the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;. &quot;Panthera&quot; is a genus within the family Felidae.

The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful:
# monophyly – all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together (i.e. phylogenetic analysis should clearly demonstrate both monophyly and validity as a separate lineage).
# reasonable compactness – a genus should not be expanded needlessly.
# distinctness – with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria, i.e. ecology, morphology, or biogeography; DNA sequences are a &quot;consequence&quot; rather than a &quot;condition&quot; of diverging evolutionary lineages except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g. postzygotic barriers).

Moreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;genus&quot; comes from Latin , a noun form cognate with &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to bear; to give birth to&#x27;). The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus popularized its use in his 1753 &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, but the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656–1708) is considered &quot;the founder of the modern concept of genera&quot;.

==Use==
The scientific name (or the scientific epithet) of a genus is also called the generic name; in modern style guides and science, it is always capitalised. It plays a fundamental role in binomial nomenclature, the system of naming organisms, where it is combined with the scientific name of a species: see Botanical name and Specific name (zoology).

=== Use in nomenclature ===

The rules for the scientific names of organisms are laid down in the nomenclature codes, which allow each species a single unique name that, for animals (including protists), plants (also including algae and fungi) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), is Latin and binomial in form; this contrasts with common or vernacular names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage.

Except for viruses, the standard format for a species name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the gray wolf&#x27;s scientific name is with &quot;Canis&quot; (Latin for &#x27;dog&#x27;) being the generic name shared by the wolf&#x27;s close relatives and (Latin for &#x27;wolf&#x27;) being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be &quot;Hibiscus arnottianus&quot;, a particular species of the genus &quot;Hibiscus&quot; native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by subspecies names in zoology or a variety of infraspecific names in botany.

When the generic name is already known from context, it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example, &quot;C. lupus&quot; in place of &quot;Canis lupus&quot;. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example, for the Eurasian wolf subspecies, or as a botanical example, . Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in italics.

The scientific names of virus species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example, the virus species &quot;Salmonid herpesvirus 1&quot;, &quot;Salmonid herpesvirus 2&quot; and &quot;Salmonid herpesvirus 3&quot; are all within the genus &quot;Salmonivirus&quot;; however, the genus to which the species with the formal names &quot;Everglades virus&quot; and &quot;Ross River virus&quot; are assigned is &quot;Alphavirus&quot;.

As with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form &quot;author, year&quot; in zoology, and &quot;standard abbreviated author name&quot; in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus &quot;Canis&quot; would be cited in full as &quot;&quot;Canis&quot; Linnaeus, 1758&quot; (zoological usage), while &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, also first established by Linnaeus but in 1753, is simply &quot;&quot;Hibiscus&quot; L.&quot; (botanical usage).

===The type concept===

Each genus should have a designated type, although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the type species, and the generic name is permanently associated with the type specimen of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a junior synonym and the remaining taxa in the former genus need to be reassessed.

===Categories of generic name===
In zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as &quot;available&quot; or &quot;unavailable&quot;. Available names are those published in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the &quot;valid&quot; (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question.

Consequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time; which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. &quot;Unavailable&quot; names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated. According to &quot;Glossary&quot; section of the zoological Code, suppressed &quot;names&quot; (per published &quot;Opinions&quot; of the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature) remain available but cannot be used as the valid name for a taxon; however, the names published in suppressed &quot;works&quot; are made unavailable via the relevant Opinion dealing with the work in question.

In botany, similar concepts exist but with different labels. The botanical equivalent of zoology&#x27;s &quot;available name&quot; is a validly published name. An invalidly published name is a or ; a rejected name is a or ; a later homonym of a validly published name is a or ; for a full list refer to the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010. In place of the &quot;valid taxon&quot; in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is &quot;correct name&quot; or &quot;current name&quot; which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.

Prokaryote and virus codes of nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of &quot;names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature&quot;.

An available (zoological) or validly published (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a synonym; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural code, and rejected or suppressed names.

A particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the World Register of Marine Species presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus &quot;Physeter&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, and 13 for the bivalve genus &quot;Pecten&quot; O.F. Müller, 1776.

===Identical names (homonyms)===
Within the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only. However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the platypus belongs to the genus &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; although George Shaw named it &quot;Platypus&quot; in 1799 (these two names are thus synonyms&quot;). However, the name &quot;Platypus&quot; had already been given to a group of ambrosia beetles by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1793. A name that means two different things is a homonym&quot;. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. Johann Friedrich Blumenbach published the replacement name &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; in 1800.

However, a genus in one kingdom is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called &quot;homonyms&quot;. Although this is discouraged by both the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance,
* &quot;Anura&quot; is the name of the order of frogs but also is the name of a non-current genus of plants;
* &quot;Aotus&quot; is the generic name of both golden peas and night monkeys;
* &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is the generic name of both wheatears and water dropworts;
* &quot;Prunella&quot; is the generic name of both accentors and self-heal; and
* &quot;Proboscidea&quot; is the order of elephants and the genus of devil&#x27;s claws.
* The name of the genus &quot;Paramecia&quot; (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus &quot;Paramecium&quot; (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.
A list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG).

===Use in higher classifications===
The type genus forms the base for higher taxonomic ranks, such as the family name (&quot;Canids&quot;) based on &quot;Canis&quot;. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the order to which dogs and wolves belong is (&quot;Carnivores&quot;).

==Numbers of accepted genera==
The numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year. &quot;Official&quot; registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses and prokaryotes, while for others there are compendia with no &quot;official&quot; standing such as &quot;Index Fungorum&quot; for fungi, &quot;Index Nominum Algarum&quot; and AlgaeBase for algae, &quot;Index Nominum Genericorum&quot; and the International Plant Names Index for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and &quot;Nomenclator Zoologicus&quot; and the Index to Organism Names for zoological names.

Totals for both &quot;all names&quot; and estimates for &quot;accepted names&quot; as held in the &quot;Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera&quot; (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:

* Animalia: 239,093 accepted genus names (± 55,350)
* Plantae: 28,724 (± 7,721)
* Fungi: 10,468 (± 182)
* Chromista: 11,114 (± 1,268)
* Protozoa: 3,109 (± 1,206)
* Bacteria: 3,433 (± 115)
* Archaea: 140 (± 0)
* Viruses: 851 (± 0)

The cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists &quot;uncertain&quot; names (not researched therein) in addition to known &quot;accepted&quot; names; the values quoted are the mean of &quot;accepted&quot; names alone (all &quot;uncertain&quot; names treated as unaccepted) and &quot;accepted + uncertain&quot; names (all &quot;uncertain&quot; names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.

Within Animalia, the largest phylum is Arthropoda, with 151,697 ± 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 ± 27,654 are insects (class Insecta). Within Plantae, Tracheophyta (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 ± 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 ± 4,494 are angiosperms (superclass Angiospermae).

By comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the Catalogue of Life (estimated &gt;90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 &quot;accepted&quot; genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species, also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.

==Genus size==
The number of species in genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups. For instance, among (non-avian) reptiles, which have about 1180 genera, the most (&gt;300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5–10 species, ~200 have 11–50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species. However, some insect genera such as the bee genera &quot;Lasioglossum&quot; and &quot;Andrena&quot; have over 1000 species each. The largest flowering plant genus, &quot;Astragalus&quot;, contains over 3,000 species.

Which species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary. Although all species within a genus are supposed to be &quot;similar&quot;, there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists about whether enormous, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus &quot;Anolis&quot; has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.

<doc id="38498" wikidata="Q53636" url="?curid=38498" title="Frog">
<text>A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (coming from the Ancient Greek , literally &#x27;without tail&#x27;). The oldest fossil &quot;proto-frog&quot; &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot; is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar (250million years ago), but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.

An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living underground or in trees.

Frogs typically lay their eggs in the water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialised rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on plant matter. Frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world&#x27;s ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalisations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.

Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion. They are also seen as environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often viewed as early warning signs of environmental damage. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The use of the common names &quot;frog&quot; and &quot;toad&quot; has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered &quot;true toads&quot;. The use of the term &quot;frog&quot; in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term &quot;toad&quot; generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (&quot;Bombina bombina&quot;) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog (&quot;Atelopus zeteki&quot;) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.

=== Etymology ===
The origin of the order name &quot;Anura&quot;—and its original spelling &quot;Anoures&quot;—is the Ancient Greek alpha privative prefix ( from before a vowel) &#x27;without&#x27;, and () &#x27;animal tail&#x27;. meaning &quot;tailless&quot;. It refers to the tailless character of these amphibians.

The origins of the word &quot;frog&quot; are uncertain and debated. The word is first attested in Old English as , but the usual Old English word for the frog was (with variants such as and ), and it is agreed that the word &quot;frog&quot; is somehow related to this. Old English remained in dialectal use in English as &quot;frosh&quot; and &quot;frosk&quot; into the nineteenth century, and is paralleled widely in other Germanic languages, with examples in the modern languages including German , Norwegian , Icelandic , and Dutch &quot;&quot;. These words allow reconstruction of a Common Germanic ancestor . The third edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; finds that the etymology of is uncertain, but agrees with arguments that it could plausibly derive from a Proto-Indo-European base along the lines of , meaning &#x27;jump&#x27;.

How Old English gave rise to is, however, uncertain, as the development does not involve a regular sound-change. Instead, it seems that there was a trend in Old English to coin nicknames for animals ending in -&quot;g&quot;, with examples—themselves all of uncertain etymology—including &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;hog&quot;, &quot;pig, stag&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Frog&quot; appears to have been adapted from as part of this trend.

Meanwhile, the word &quot;toad&quot;, first attested as Old English , is unique to English and is likewise of uncertain etymology. It is the basis for the word &quot;tadpole&quot;, first attested as Middle English , apparently meaning &#x27;toad-head&#x27;.

=== Taxonomy ===
About 88% of amphibian species are classified in the order Anura. These include over 7,700 species in 59 families, of which the Hylidae (1062 spp.), Strabomantidae (807 spp.), Microhylidae (758 spp.), and Bufonidae (657 spp.) are the richest in species.

The Anura include all modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The characteristics of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without teeth (with the exception of &quot;Gastrotheca guentheri&quot;) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea), an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye. The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.

Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, by far the largest group, which contains the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The suborder Neobatrachia is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.

Some species of anurans hybridise readily. For instance, the edible frog (&quot;Pelophylax esculentus&quot;) is a hybrid between the pool frog (&quot;P. lessonae&quot;) and the marsh frog (&quot;P. ridibundus&quot;). The fire-bellied toads &quot;Bombina bombina&quot; and &quot;B. variegata&quot; are similar in forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.
==Evolution==
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.

In 2008, &quot;Gerobatrachus hottoni&quot;, a temnospondyl with many frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was discovered in Texas. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link, a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other (forming a clade called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians. However, others have suggested that &quot;Gerobatrachus hottoni&quot; was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.

Salientia (Latin &quot;salire&quot; (&quot;salio&quot;), &quot;to jump&quot;) is the name of the total group that includes modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the &quot;proto-frogs&quot; or &quot;stem-frogs&quot;. The common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping ilium in the pelvis, the presence of a frontoparietal bone, and a lower jaw without teeth. The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are &quot;Triadobatrachus massinoti&quot;, from the early Triassic period of Madagascar (about 250 million years ago), and &quot;Czatkobatrachus polonicus&quot;, from the Early Triassic of Poland (about the same age as &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot;). The skull of &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot; is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. These include a longer body with more vertebrae. The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs. The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot; was not an efficient leaper. A 2019 study has noted the presence of Salientia from the Chinle Formation, and suggested that anurans might have first appeared during the Late Triassic.

On the basis of fossil evidence, the earliest known &quot;true frogs&quot; that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early Jurassic period. One such early frog species, &quot;Prosalirus bitis&quot;, was discovered in 1995 in the Kayenta Formation of Arizona and dates back to the Early Jurassic epoch (199.6 to 175 million years ago), making &quot;Prosalirus&quot; somewhat more recent than &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot;. Like the latter, &quot;Prosalirus&quot; did not have greatly enlarged legs, but had the typical three-pronged pelvic structure of modern frogs. Unlike &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot;, &quot;Prosalirus&quot; had already lost nearly all of its tail and was well adapted for jumping. Another Early Jurassic frog is &quot;Vieraella herbsti&quot;, which is known only from dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be from snout to vent. &quot;Notobatrachus degiustoi&quot; from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger, about 155–170 million years old. The main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail. Tadpoles of &quot;N. degiustoi&quot; constitute the oldest tadpoles found as of 2024, dating back to 168–161 million years ago. These tadpoles also showed adaptations for filter-feeding, implying residence in temporary pools by filter-feeding larvae was already commonplace. The evolution of modern Anura likely was complete by the Jurassic period. Since then, evolutionary changes in chromosome numbers have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs, which means speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammals.

According to genetic studies, the families Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.

Frog fossils have been found on all of the Earth&#x27;s continents. In 2020, it was announced that 40 million year old helmeted frog fossils had been discovered by a team of vertebrate palaeontologists in Seymour Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, indicating that this region was once home to frogs related to those now living in South American &quot;Nothofagus&quot; forest.

===Phylogeny===
A cladogram showing the relationships of the different families of frogs in the clade Anura can be seen in the table below. This diagram, in the form of a tree, shows how each frog family is related to other families, with each node representing a point of common ancestry. It is based on Frost &quot;et al.&quot; (2006), Heinicke &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) and Pyron and Wiens (2011).

== Morphology and physiology ==
Frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx). Frogs range in size from &quot;Paedophryne amauensis&quot; of Papua New Guinea that is in snout–vent length to the up to about and goliath frog (&quot;Conraua goliath&quot;) of central Africa. There are prehistoric, extinct species that reached even larger sizes.

===Feet and legs===
The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees, or in burrows. Adult anurans have four fingers on the hands and five toes on the feet, but the smallest species often have hands and feet where some of the digits are vestigial. Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The ilium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.


The muscular system has been similarly modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.

Many frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water. The completely aquatic African dwarf frog (&quot;Hymenochirus&quot; sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of White&#x27;s tree frog (&quot;Litoria caerulea&quot;), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed. Exceptions include flying frogs in the Hylidae and Rhacophoridae, which also have fully webbed toes used in gliding.

Arboreal frogs have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.

In many arboreal frogs, a small &quot;intercalary structure&quot; on each toe increases the surface area touching the substrate. Furthermore, many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking. Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes. This allows the frogs to &quot;parachute&quot; or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another.

Ground-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch&#x27;s spadefoot (&quot;Scaphiopus couchii&quot;) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle often referred to as a spade, that helps them to burrow.

Sometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (&quot;Ribeiroia ondatrae&quot;) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops one or more extra legs.

===Skin===
A frog&#x27;s skin is protective, has a respiratory function, can absorb water, and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, particularly on the head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and makes the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.

Being cold-blooded, frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog&#x27;s skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (&quot;Chiromantis xerampelina&quot;) is even able to turn white to minimise the chance of overheating.

Many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog&#x27;s skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialised to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Other frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse&#x27;s toad (&quot;Bufo woodhousii&quot;), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (&quot;Trichobatrachus robustus&quot;) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. These contain blood vessels and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respiration.

Some species have bony plates embedded in the skin, a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).

Camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract. Some are even able to control their skin texture. The Pacific tree frog (&quot;Pseudacris regilla&quot;) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. The Wood frog (&quot;Lithobates sylvaticus&quot;) uses disruptive coloration including black eye markings similar to voids between leaves, bands of the dorsal skin (dorsolateral dermal plica) similar to a leaf midrib as well as stains, spots and leg stripes similar to fallen leaf features.

===Respiration and circulation===
Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. Ribs are generally absent, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (&quot;Barbourula kalimantanensis&quot;) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.

Frogs have three-chambered hearts, a feature they share with lizards. Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood.

Some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. The Titicaca water frog (&quot;Telmatobius culeus&quot;) is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.

===Digestion and excretion===
Frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch insects and other small moving prey. The tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. In amphibians there are salvary glands on the tongue, which in frogs produce what is called a two-phase viscoelastic fluid. When exposed to pressure, like when the tongue is wrapping around a prey, it becomes runny and covers the prey&#x27;s body. As the pressure drops, it returns to a thick and elastic state, which gives the tongue an extra grip. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The African bullfrog (&quot;Pyxicephalus&quot;), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat.

The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.

Although adapted to terrestrial life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.

===Reproductive system===

In the male frog, the two testes are attached to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.

When frogs mate, the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This position is called amplexus and may be held for several days. The male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. These include the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold. The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.

===Nervous system===
Frogs have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions. The relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans. Frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord. By contrast, all amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.

===Sight===
The eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (&quot;Agalychnis callidryas&quot;) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (&quot;Bombina spp.&quot;) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (&quot;Dyscophus spp.&quot;) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (&quot;Anaxyrus terrestris&quot;) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.

The distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Although it was formerly debated, more recent research has shown that frogs can see in colour, even in very low light.
===Hearing===
Frogs can hear both in the air and below water. They do not have external ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.

===Call===


The call or croak of a frog is unique to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile (1.6km) away. Additionally, some species have been found to use man-made structures such as drain pipes for artificial amplification of their call. The coastal tailed frog (&quot;Ascaphus truei&quot;) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalise.

The main function of calling is for male frogs to attract mates. Males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. In many frog species, such as the common tree frog (&quot;Polypedates leucomystax&quot;), females reply to males&#x27; calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.

A different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorient the attacker so that it releases the frog.

Many species of frog have deep calls. The croak of the American bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbiana&quot;) is sometimes written as &quot;jug o&#x27; rum&quot;. The Pacific tree frog (&quot;Pseudacris regilla&quot;) produces the onomatopoeic &quot;ribbit&quot; often heard in films. Other renderings of frog calls into speech include &quot;brekekekex koax koax&quot;, the call of the marsh frog (&quot;Pelophylax ridibundus&quot;) in &quot;The Frogs&quot;, an Ancient Greek comic drama by Aristophanes. The calls of the Concave-eared torrent frog (&quot;Amolops tormotus&quot;) are unusual in many aspects. The males are notable for their varieties of calls where upward and downward frequency modulations take place. When they communicate, they produce calls that fall in the ultrasound frequency range. The last aspect that makes this species of frog&#x27;s calls unusual is that nonlinear acoustic phenomena are important components in their acoustic signals.

===Torpor===
During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (&quot;Bufo americanus&quot;) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;) normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs such as the wood frog, moor frog, or spring peeper can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and its heartbeat can restart when conditions warm up.

At the other extreme, the striped burrowing frog (&quot;Cyclorana alboguttata&quot;) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.

==Locomotion==
Different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including jumping, running, walking, swimming, burrowing, climbing and gliding.
=== Jumping ===
Frogs are generally recognised as exceptional jumpers and, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates. The striped rocket frog, &quot;Litoria nasuta&quot;, can leap over , a distance that is more than fifty times its body length of . There are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability. Within a species, jump distance increases with increasing size, but relative jumping distance (body-lengths jumped) decreases. The Indian skipper frog (&quot;Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis&quot;) has the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface. The tiny northern cricket frog (&quot;Acris crepitans&quot;) can &quot;skitter&quot; across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps.

Slow-motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position for the duration of the jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (&quot;Osteopilus septentrionalis&quot;) and the northern leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates pipiens&quot;), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.

Early hatching of froglets can have negative effects on frog jumping performance and overall locomotion. The hindlimbs are unable to completely form, which results in them being shorter and much weaker relative to a normal hatching froglet. Early hatching froglets may tend to depend on other forms of locomotion more often, such as swimming and walking.

=== Walking and running ===

Frogs in the families Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (&quot;Gastrophryne olivacea&quot;) has been described as having a gait that is &quot;a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length&quot;. In an experiment, Fowler&#x27;s toad (&quot;Anaxyrus&quot; &quot;fowleri&quot;) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad&#x27;s uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.

The red-legged running frog (&quot;Kassina maculata&quot;) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion photography shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog&#x27;s gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (&quot;Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis&quot;) has broad feet and can run across the surface of the water for several metres (yards).

=== Swimming ===
Frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialisation. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.

=== Burrowing ===
Some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme example of this is the purple frog (&quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot;) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.

The spadefoot toads of North America are also adapted to underground life. The Plains spadefoot toad (&quot;Spea bombifrons&quot;) is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. As it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil. It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. In winter, it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of . The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. During this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by osmosis to supply the toad&#x27;s needs. Spadefoot toads are &quot;explosive breeders&quot;, all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.

The burrowing frogs of Australia have a rather different lifestyle. The western spotted frog (&quot;Heleioporus albopunctatus&quot;) digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development. Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these, the green burrowing frog (&quot;Scaphiophryne marmorata&quot;), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes. It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.

=== Climbing ===
Tree frogs live high in the canopy, where they scramble around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The &quot;true&quot; tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the glass frogs (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (&quot;Phyllomedusa ayeaye&quot;) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.

=== Gliding ===
During the evolutionary history of frogs, several different groups have independently taken to the air. Some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor. Typical of them is Wallace&#x27;s flying frog (&quot;Rhacophorus nigropalmatus&quot;) from Malaysia and Borneo. It has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed. Flaps of skin occur on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region. With the digits splayed, the limbs outstretched, and these flaps spread, it can glide considerable distances, but is unable to undertake powered flight. It can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to between trees.

==Life history==
===Reproduction===
Two main types of reproduction occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. In the former, adopted by the majority of species, adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. In explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. In these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up.

Among prolonged breeders, males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned. This means that males outnumber females at the water&#x27;s edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. They advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. Larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. Females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice. In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. Calling is an energy-sapping activity. Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.

In explosive breeders, the first male that finds a suitable breeding location, such as a temporary pool, calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool. Explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away. The spadefoot toads (&quot;Scaphiopus spp.&quot;) of North America fall into this category. Mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction. In some years, suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding. Some female New Mexico spadefoot toads (&quot;Spea multiplicata&quot;) only spawn half of the available eggs at a time, perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later.

At the breeding site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus takes place in the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilisation is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (&quot;Bufo cognatus&quot;), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus &quot;Nimbaphrynoides&quot; are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; &quot;Limnonectes larvaepartus&quot;, &quot;Eleutherodactylus jasperi&quot; and members of the Tanzanian genus &quot;Nectophrynoides&quot; are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilisation is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except &quot;L. larvaepartus&quot;, which give birth to tadpoles.

===Life cycle===
====Eggs / frogspawn ====
Frogs may lay their eggs as clumps, surface films, strings, or individually. Around half of species deposit eggs in water, others lay eggs in vegetation, on the ground or in excavations. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (&quot;Eleutherodactylus limbatus&quot;) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (&quot;Leptodactylus pentadactylus&quot;) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (&quot;Agalychnis callidryas&quot;) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below.

In certain species, such as the wood frog (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;), symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis. The interior of globular egg clusters of the wood frog has also been found to be up to 6 °C (11 °F) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.

Direct development, where eggs hatch into juveniles like small adults, is also known in many frogs, for example, &quot;Ischnocnema henselii,&quot; &quot;Eleutherodactylus coqui&quot;, and &quot;Raorchestes ochlandrae&quot; and &quot;Raorchestes chalazodes.&quot;

====Tadpoles====
The larvae that emerge from the eggs are known as tadpoles (or occasionally polliwogs). Tadpoles lack eyelids and limbs, and have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and tails they use for swimming. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, but at least one species (&quot;Nannophrys ceylonensis&quot;) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks.

From early in its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole&#x27;s gills and front legs. The lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of &quot;Hymenochirus&quot;, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which try to grasp them by the tail.

Tadpoles are typically herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog (&quot;Osteopilus septentrionalis&quot;) is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.

Tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, particularly water birds, such as storks and herons and domestic ducks. Some tadpoles, including those of the cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.

====Metamorphosis====
At the end of the tadpole stage, a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator. Homeostatic feedback control of food intake is largely absent, making tadpoles eat constantly when food is present. But shortly before and during metamorphosis the sensation of hunger is suppressed, and they stop eating while their gut and internal organs are reorganised and prepared for a different diet. Also the gut microbiota changes, from being similar to that of fish to resembling that of amniotes. Exceptions are carnivorous tadpoles like Lepidobatrachus laevis, which has a gut already adapted to a diet similar to that of adults. These continue to eat during metamorphosis. The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding. The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed. The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs. Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. At this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.

====Adults====
Adult frogs may live in or near water, but few are fully aquatic. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including insects, crabs, spiders, mites, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals and reptiles, and fish. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog &quot;Xenohyla truncata&quot; is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, floral structures and nectar. &quot;Leptodactylus mystaceus&quot; has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in &quot;Euphlyctis hexadactylus&quot;, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Many frogs use their sticky tongues to catch prey, while others simply grab them with their mouths. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (&quot;Rana pipiens&quot;) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.

Frogs are primary predators and an important part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.

Little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (&quot;Rana muscosa&quot;) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;). The cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;).

===Parental care===

Although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs, up to an estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way. The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed. Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour. Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival. The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.

In small pools, predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. Certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata (water-filled leaf or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles. While these smaller rearing sites are free from competition, they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance. Frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilised eggs. The female strawberry poison-dart frog (&quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;) lays her eggs on the forest floor. The male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist. When they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding bromeliad or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location. She visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilised eggs in the phytotelma, continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (&quot;Oophaga granulifera&quot;) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way.

Many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs. The tiny male &quot;Colostethus subpunctatus&quot; stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool. The male common midwife toad (&quot;Alytes obstetricans&quot;) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The tungara frog (&quot;Physalaemus pustulosus&quot;) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.

Some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies. Both male and female pouched frogs (&quot;Assa darlingtoni&quot;) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (&quot;Rheobatrachus&quot; sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilised eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin&#x27;s frog (&quot;Rhinoderma darwinii&quot;) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male&#x27;s mouth and emerge.

==Defence==

At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of defensive structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.

The skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called bufotoxins to make them unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. &quot;Allobates zaparo&quot; is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators. Other species, such as the European fire-bellied toad (&quot;Bombina bombina&quot;), have their warning colour underneath. They &quot;flash&quot; this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.

Some frogs, such as the poison dart frogs, are especially toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting, although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (&quot;Eleutherodactylus gaigei&quot; and &quot;Lithodytes lineatus&quot;) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection. Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, such as the Australian corroboree frogs (&quot;Pseudophryne corroboree&quot; and &quot;Pseudophryne pengilleyi&quot;), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.

Some frogs use bluff or deception. The European common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) adopts a characteristic stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. The bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;) crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened. This places the parotoid glands in the most effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected. Another tactic used by some frogs is to &quot;scream&quot;, the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. The grey tree frog (&quot;Hyla versicolor&quot;) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew &quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;. Although toads are avoided by many predators, the common garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;) regularly feeds on them. The strategy employed by juvenile American toads (&quot;Bufo americanus&quot;) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. This is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. If it is encountered by the snake&#x27;s head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.

==Distribution==
Frogs live on every continent except Antarctica, but they are not present on certain islands, especially those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other human-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus &quot;Cyclorana&quot; bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast compared with those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.

== Conservation ==

In 2006, of 4,035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.

Many environmental scientists believe amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.
Frog mutations and genetic defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes have been identified or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode &quot;Ribeiroia ondatrae&quot;. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode&#x27;s complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.

In a few cases, captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums named 2008 as the &quot;Year of the Frog&quot; in order to draw attention to the conservation issues faced by them.

The cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a biological pest control agent. In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to control cane beetles such as &quot;Dermolepida albohirtum&quot;, the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results in many of these countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. In many of these countries, they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.

==Human uses==
===Culinary===

Frog legs are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg. Originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply. This resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the American bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.

The mountain chicken frog, so-called as it tastes of chicken, is now endangered, in part due to human consumption, and was a major food choice of the Dominicans. Raccoon, opossum, partridges, prairie chicken, and frogs were among the fare Mark Twain recorded as part of American cuisine.

===Scientific research===

In November 1970, NASA sent two bullfrogs into space for six days during the Orbiting Frog Otolith mission to test weightlessness.

Frogs are used for dissections in high school and university anatomy classes, often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among the biological systems. This practice is declining due to animal welfare concerns, and &quot;digital frogs&quot; are now available for virtual dissection.

Frogs have served as experimental animals throughout the history of science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. He created one of the first tools for measuring electric current out of a frog leg. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog&#x27;s heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (&quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.

Frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of embryology. Although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed, biologists continue to use &quot;Xenopus&quot; as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory. &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative, &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot;, which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the one to two years for &quot;X. laevis&quot;, thus facilitating faster studies across generations.

Genomes of &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;, &quot;X. tropicalis&quot;, &quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;, &quot;Rhinella marina&quot;, and &quot;Nanorana parkeri&quot; have been sequenced and deposited in the NCBI Genome database.

===Pharmaceutical===
Because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a &quot;natural pharmacy&quot;. The alkaloid epibatidine, a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine, is made by some species of poison dart frogs. Other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to HIV infection. Dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs.

It has long been suspected that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (&quot;Bufo alvarius&quot;). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound that has been used in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.

Exudations from the skin of the golden poison frog (&quot;Phyllobates terribilis&quot;) are traditionally used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun. The combination of the two alkaloid toxins batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice. Two other species, the Kokoe poison dart frog (&quot;Phyllobates aurotaenia&quot;) and the black-legged dart frog (&quot;Phyllobates bicolor&quot;) are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.
=== Cultural significance ===

Frogs have been featured in mythology, fairy tales and popular culture. In traditional Chinese myths, the world rests on a giant frog, who would try to swallow the moon, causing the lunar eclipse. Frogs have been featured in religion, folklore, and popular culture. The ancient Egyptians depicted the god Heqet, protector of newborns, with the head of a frog. For the Mayans, frogs represented water, crops, fertility and birth and were associated with the god Chaac. In the Bible, Moses unleashes a plague of frogs on the Egyptians. Medieval Europeans associated frogs and toads with evil and witchcraft. The Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; features a princess taking in a frog and it turning into a handsome prince. In modern culture, frogs may take a comedic or hapless role, such as Mr. Toad of the 1908 novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, Michigan J. Frog of Warner Bros. Cartoons, the Muppet Kermit the Frog and in the game &quot;Frogger&quot;.

<text>Toad is a common name for certain frogs, especially of the family Bufonidae, that are characterized by dry, leathery skin, short legs, and large bumps covering the parotoid glands.

In popular culture (folk taxonomy), toads are distinguished from frogs by their drier, rougher skin and association with more terrestrial habitats. However, this distinction does not align precisely with scientific taxonomy.

== List of toad families ==
In scientific taxonomy, toads include the true toads (Bufonidae) and various other terrestrial or warty-skinned frogs.

Non-bufonid &quot;toads&quot; can be found in the families:

* Bombinatoridae (fire-bellied toads and jungle toads)
* Calyptocephalellidae (helmeted water toad and false toads)
* Discoglossidae (midwife toads)
* Myobatrachidae (Australian toadlets)
* Pelobatidae (European spadefoot toad)
* Rhinophrynidae (burrowing toads)
* Scaphiopodidae (American spadefoot toads)
* Microhylidae (narrowmouth toads)

== Biology ==
Usually the largest of the bumps on a toad&#x27;s skin are those that cover the parotoid glands. The bumps are commonly called warts, but they have nothing to do with pathologic warts, being fixed in size, present on healthy specimens, and not caused by infection. It is a myth that handling toads causes warts.

Toads travel from non-breeding to breeding areas of ponds and lakes. Bogert (1947) suggests that the toads&#x27; call is the most important cue in the homing to ponds.
Toads, like many amphibians, exhibit breeding site fidelity (philopatry). Individual American toads return to their natal ponds to breed, making it likely they will encounter siblings when seeking potential mates. Although inbred examples within a species are possible, siblings rarely mate. Toads recognize and avoid mating with close kin. Advertisement vocalizations given by males appear to serve as cues by which females recognize kin. Kin recognition thus allows avoidance of inbreeding and consequent inbreeding depression.

== Habitat ==
In the United Kingdom, common toads often climb trees to hide in hollows or in nest boxes.

==Cultural depictions==


In Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1908), Mr. Toad is a likeable and popular, if selfish and narcissistic, comic character. Mr. Toad reappears as the lead character in A. A. Milne&#x27;s play &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot; (1929), based on the book.

In Chinese culture, the Money Toad (or Frog) Jin Chan appears as a feng shui charm for prosperity.

<text>A knight&#x27;s tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight&#x27;s move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.

The knight&#x27;s tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight&#x27;s tour. Creating a program to find a knight&#x27;s tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight&#x27;s tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual , as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

==Theory==
The knight&#x27;s tour problem is an instance of the more general Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of finding a closed knight&#x27;s tour is similarly an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, the knight&#x27;s tour problem can be solved in linear time.
==History==
The earliest known reference to the knight&#x27;s tour problem dates back to the 9th century AD. In Rudrata&#x27;s (5.15), a Sanskrit work on Poetics, the pattern of a knight&#x27;s tour on a half-board has been presented as an elaborate poetic figure () called the or &#x27;arrangement in the steps of a horse&#x27;. The same verse in four lines of eight syllables each can be read from left to right or by following the path of the knight on tour. Since the Indic writing systems used for Sanskrit are syllabic, each syllable can be thought of as representing a square on a chessboard. Rudrata&#x27;s example is as follows:

transliterated:
For example, the first line can be read from left to right or by moving from the first square to the second line, third syllable (2.3) and then to 1.5 to 2.7 to 4.8 to 3.6 to 4.4 to 3.2.

The Sri Vaishnava poet and philosopher Vedanta Desika, during the 14th century, in his 1,008-verse magnum opus praising the deity Ranganatha&#x27;s divine sandals of Srirangam, Paduka Sahasram (in chapter 30: &quot;Chitra Paddhati&quot;) has composed two consecutive Sanskrit verses containing 32 letters each (in Anushtubh meter) where the second verse can be derived from the first verse by performing a Knight&#x27;s tour on a board, starting from the top-left corner. The transliterated 19th verse is as follows:

The 20th verse that can be obtained by performing Knight&#x27;s tour on the above verse is as follows:

sThi thA sa ma ya rA ja thpA

ga tha rA mA dha kE ga vi |

dhu ran ha sAm sa nna thA dhA

sA dhyA thA pa ka rA sa rA ||

It is believed that Desika composed all 1,008 verses (including the special &quot;Chaturanga Turanga Padabandham&quot; mentioned above) in a single night as a challenge.

A tour reported in the fifth book of Bhagavantabaskaraby by Bhat Nilakantha, a cyclopedic work in Sanskrit on ritual, law and politics, written either about 1600 or about 1700 describes three knight&#x27;s tours. The tours are not only reentrant but also symmetrical, and the verses are based on the same tour, starting from different squares. Nilakantha&#x27;s work is an extraordinary achievement being a fully symmetric closed tour, predating the work of Euler (1759) by at least 60 years.
After Nilakantha, one of the first mathematicians to investigate the knight&#x27;s tour was Leonhard Euler. The first procedure for completing the knight&#x27;s tour was Warnsdorf&#x27;s rule, first described in 1823 by H. C. von Warnsdorf.

In the 20th century, the Oulipo group of writers used it, among many others. The most notable example is the knight&#x27;s tour which sets the order of the chapters in Georges Perec&#x27;s novel &quot;Life a User&#x27;s Manual&quot;.

The sixth game of the World Chess Championship 2010 between Viswanathan Anand and Veselin Topalov saw Anand making 13 consecutive knight moves (albeit using both knights); online commentators jested that Anand was trying to solve the knight&#x27;s tour problem during the game.

==Existence==

Schwenk proved that for any board with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, a closed knight&#x27;s tour is always possible &quot;unless&quot; one or more of these three conditions are met:
# &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are both odd
# &quot;m&quot; = 1, 2, or 4
# &quot;m&quot; = 3 and &quot;n&quot; = 4, 6, or 8.

Cull &quot;et al.&quot; and Conrad &quot;et al.&quot; proved that on any rectangular board whose smaller dimension is at least 5, there is a (possibly open) knight&#x27;s tour. For any board with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, a knight&#x27;s tour is always possible &quot;unless&quot; one or more of these three conditions are met: 
# &quot;m&quot; = 1 or 2
# &quot;m&quot; = 3 and &quot;n&quot; = 3, 5, or 6
# &quot;m&quot; = 4 and &quot;n&quot; = 4.

==Number of tours==
On an board, there are exactly 26,534,728,821,064 directed closed tours (i.e. two tours along the same path that travel in opposite directions are counted separately, as are rotations and reflections). The number of &quot;undirected&quot; closed tours is half this number, since every tour can be traced in reverse. There are 9,862 undirected closed tours on a board.
==Finding tours with computers==
There are several ways to find a knight&#x27;s tour on a given board with a computer. Some of these methods are algorithms, while others are heuristics.

===Brute-force algorithms===
A brute-force search for a knight&#x27;s tour is impractical on all but the smallest boards. On an board, for instance, there are knight&#x27;s tours, and a much greater number of sequences of knight moves of the same length. It is well beyond the capacity of modern computers (or networks of computers) to perform operations on such a large set. However, the size of this number is not indicative of the difficulty of the problem, which can be solved &quot;by using human insight and ingenuity ... without much difficulty.&quot;

===Divide-and-conquer algorithms===
By dividing the board into smaller pieces, constructing tours on each piece, and patching the pieces together, one can construct tours on most rectangular boards in linear time – that is, in a time proportional to the number of squares on the board.

===Warnsdorf&#x27;s rule===


Warnsdorf&#x27;s rule is a heuristic for finding a single knight&#x27;s tour. The knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the &quot;fewest&quot; onward moves. When calculating the number of onward moves for each candidate square, we do not count moves that revisit any square already visited. It is possible to have two or more choices for which the number of onward moves is equal; there are various methods for breaking such ties, including one devised by Pohl and another by Squirrel and Cull.

This rule may also more generally be applied to any graph. In graph-theoretic terms, each move is made to the adjacent vertex with the least degree. Although the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard in general, on many graphs that occur in practice this heuristic is able to successfully locate a solution in linear time. The knight&#x27;s tour is such a special case.

The heuristic was first described in &quot;Des Rösselsprungs einfachste und allgemeinste Lösung&quot; by H. C. von Warnsdorf in 1823.

A computer program that finds a knight&#x27;s tour for any starting position using Warnsdorf&#x27;s rule was written by Gordon Horsington and published in 1984 in the book &quot;Century/Acorn User Book of Computer Puzzles&quot;.

===Neural network solutions===

The knight&#x27;s tour problem also lends itself to being solved by a neural network implementation. The network is set up such that every legal knight&#x27;s move is represented by a neuron, and each neuron is initialized randomly to be either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; (output of 1 or 0), with 1 implying that the neuron is part of the solution. Each neuron also has a state function (described below) which is initialized to 0. 

When the network is allowed to run, each neuron can change its state and output based on the states and outputs of its neighbors (those exactly one knight&#x27;s move away) according to the following transition rules:
::formula_1

::formula_2

where formula_3 represents discrete intervals of time, formula_4 is the state of the neuron connecting square formula_5 to square formula_6, formula_7 is the output of the neuron from formula_5 to formula_6, and formula_10 is the set of neighbors of the neuron.

Although divergent cases are possible, the network should eventually converge, which occurs when no neuron changes its state from time formula_3 to formula_12. When the network converges, either the network encodes a knight&#x27;s tour or a series of two or more independent circuits within the same board.

<doc id="38512" wikidata="Q51832" url="?curid=38512" title="Plesiochronous digital hierarchy">
<text>The plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) is a technology used in telecommunications networks to transport large quantities of data over digital transport equipment such as fibre optic and microwave radio systems. The term &quot;plesiochronous&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;plēsios&quot;, meaning near, and &quot;chronos&quot;, time, and refers to the fact that PDH networks run in a state where different parts of the network are nearly, but not quite perfectly, synchronized.

Backbone transport networks replaced PDH networks with synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) or synchronous optical networking (SONET) equipment over the ten years ending around the turn of the millennium (2000), whose floating payloads relaxed the more stringent timing requirements of PDH network technology. The cost in North America was $4.5 billion in 1998 alone, p. 171.

PDH allows transmission of data streams that are nominally running at the same rate, but allowing some variation on the speed around a nominal rate. By analogy, any two watches are nominally running at the same rate, clocking up 60 seconds every minute. However, there is no link between watches to guarantee that they run at exactly the same rate, and it is highly likely that one is running slightly faster than the other.

==Implementation==

The data rate is controlled by a clock in the equipment generating the data. The rate is allowed to vary by ±50 ppm of 2048 kbit/s (according to ITU-T recommendation). This means that different data streams can (and probably do) run at slightly different rates from one another.

In order to transport multiple data streams from one place to another over a common transmission medium, they are multiplexed in groups of four. Because each of the four data streams is not necessarily running at the same rate, some compensation has to be introduced. Typically, the multiplexer takes the data from the 4 incoming 2.048 Mbit/s data streams and feeds each into a 2.112 Mbit/s stream via a buffer store, leaving a series of fixed gaps in each frame.

The data rate is thus 2.112 Mbit/s × (number of bits in a frame – number of gaps)/(number of bits in a frame)

This is slightly greater than 2.048 Mbit/s + 50ppm. If an extra gap is added, this is slightly smaller than 2.048 Mbit/s – 50ppm. Thus, on average, the data rate can be made exactly equal to the incoming rate by adding a gap in some frames and not others. This extra gap is in a fixed place in the frame and is referred to as the &quot;stuffable bit&quot;. If it does not contain data, i.e. it is a gap, it is &quot;stuffed&quot;. The data from the 4 data streams is now contained in 4 data streams of 2.112 Mbit/s which are synchronous and can easily be multiplexed to give a single stream of 8.448 Mbit/s by taking 1 bit from stream #1, followed by 1 bit from stream #2, then #3, then #4, etc. Some of the fixed gaps accommodate a synchronisation word which allows the demultiplexer to identify the start of each frame, and others contain control bits for each stream which say whether or not the stuffable bit is stuffed or not, i.e. contains data or not. The process can then be reversed by the demultiplexer and 4 data streams produced with exactly the same bit rate as previously. The timing irregularity is ironed out using a phase locked loop.

This scheme does not allow the addition of a stuffed bit as soon as it is required, because the stuffable bit is in a fixed point in the frame. Therefore, it is necessary to wait until the stuffable bit time slot. This wait results in &quot;waiting time jitter&quot; which can be arbitrarily low in frequency, i.e. down to zero, and so cannot be entirely eliminated by the filtering effects of the phase lock loop. The worst possible stuffing ratio would be 1 frame in 2, as this gives a theoretical 0.5 bit of jitter. Therefore, the stuffing ratio is carefully chosen to give theoretical minimum jitter. In a practical system however, the actual decision to stuff or not may be made by comparing the read address and write address of the input buffer store. The position in the frame when the decision is made varies and adds a second variable dependent on the length of the store.

The process is sometimes called &quot;pulse justification&quot; because &quot;justification&quot; in printing is adding gaps so that each line takes up a full column width. It is believed that this term was preferred because &quot;... stuffing stuffable bits&quot; and &quot;waiting time jitter is the jitter you get while waiting to stuff a stuffable bit&quot;, though technically correct, do sound like a pleonasm.

Similar techniques are used to combine four × 8 Mbit/s together, plus bit stuffing and frame alignment, giving 34 Mbit/s. Four × 34 Mbit/s, gives 140. Four × 140 gives 565.

== Independent clocks ==
In telecommunications networks, independent clocks are free-running precision clocks located at the nodes which are used for synchronization.

Variable storage buffers, installed to accommodate variations in transmission delay between nodes, are made large enough to accommodate small time (phase) departures among the nodal clocks that control transmission. Traffic may occasionally be interrupted to allow the buffers to be emptied of some or all of their stored data.

<doc id="38514" wikidata="Q338272" url="?curid=38514" title="Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network">
<text>In the 1980s, the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services did on the public switched telephone network, and conceived an end-to-end circuit switched service, known as Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN).

==History==
Before B-ISDN, the original ISDN attempted to substitute the analog telephone system with a digital system which was appropriate for both voice and non-voice traffic. Obtaining worldwide agreement on the basic rate interface standard was expected to lead to a large user demand for ISDN equipment, hence leading to mass production and inexpensive ISDN chips. However, the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly. Once the ISDN standard was finally agreed upon and products were available, it was already obsolete. For home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer, but the ISDN basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity.

This led to introduction of B-ISDN, by adding the word broadband. Although the term had a meaning in physics and engineering (similar to wideband), the CCITT defined it as: &quot;Qualifying a service or system requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate&quot; referring to the primary rate which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s. Services envisioned included video telephone and video conferencing. Technical papers were published in early 1988. Standards were issued by the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT, now known as ITU-T), and called &quot;Recommendations&quot;. They included G.707 to G.709, and I.121 which defined the principal aspects of B-ISDN, with many others following through the 1990s.

The designated technology for B-ISDN was Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), which was intended to carry both synchronous voice and asynchronous data services on the same transport. The B-ISDN vision has been overtaken by other disruptive technologies used in the Internet. The ATM technology survived as a low-level layer in most digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies, and as a payload type in some wireless technologies such as WiMAX. The term &quot;broadband&quot; became a marketing term for any digital Internet access service.

<doc id="38518" wikidata="Q602446" url="?curid=38518" title="Lyrics">
<text>Lyrics are words that make up a song, usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a &quot;libretto&quot; and their writer, as a &quot;librettist&quot;. Rap songs and grime contain rap lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung. The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression.

==Etymology==
us}}&quot; from the Greek (&quot;&quot;), the adjectival form of &quot;lyre&quot;. It first appeared in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the Earl of Surrey&#x27;s translations of Petrarch and to his own sonnets. Greek lyric poetry had been defined by the manner in which it was sung accompanied by the lyre or cithara, as opposed to the chanted formal epics or the more passionate elegies accompanied by the flute. The personal nature of many of the verses of the Nine Lyric Poets led to the present sense of &quot;lyric poetry&quot; but the original Greek sense of &quot;lyric poetry&quot;&quot;poetry accompanied by the lyre&quot; i.e. &quot;words set to music&quot;eventually led to its use as &quot;lyrics&quot;, first attested in Stainer and Barrett&#x27;s 1876 &quot;Dictionary of Musical Terms&quot;. Stainer and Barrett used the word as a singular substantive: &quot;&quot;Lyric&quot;, poetry or blank verse intended to be set to music and sung&quot;. By the 1930s, the present use of the plurale tantum &quot;lyrics&quot; had begun; it has been standard since the 1950s for many writers. The singular form &quot;lyric&quot; is still used to mean the complete words to a song by authorities such as Alec Wilder, Robert Gottlieb, and Stephen Sondheim. However, the singular form is also commonly used to refer to a specific line (or phrase) within a song&#x27;s lyrics.

==History==
==Poems==
The differences between poem and song may become less meaningful where verse is set to music, to the point that any distinction becomes untenable. This is perhaps recognised in the way popular songs have &quot;lyrics&quot;.

However, the verse may pre-date its tune (in the way that &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; was set to music, and &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot; has become the hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot;), or the tune may be lost over time but the words survive, matched by a number of different tunes (this is particularly common with hymns and ballads).

Possible classifications proliferate (under anthem, ballad, blues, carol, folk song, hymn, libretto, lied, lullaby, march, praise song, round, spiritual). Nursery rhymes may be songs, or doggerel: the term does not imply a distinction. The ghazal is a sung form that is considered primarily poetic. See also rapping, roots of hip hop music.

Analogously, verse drama might normally be judged (at its best) as poetry, but not consisting of poems (see dramatic verse).

In Baroque music, melodies and their lyrics were prose. Rather than paired lines they consist of rhetorical sentences or paragraphs consisting of an opening gesture, an amplification (often featuring sequence), and a close (featuring a cadence); in German &quot;Vordersatz&quot;-&quot;Fortspinnung&quot;-&quot;Epilog&quot;. For example:
 &quot;When I was a child,&quot; [opening gesture]
 &quot;I spoke as a child,&quot; [amplification...]
 &quot;I understood as a child,&quot; [...]
 &quot;I thought as a child;&quot; [...]
 &quot;But when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot; [close]
 &quot;- 1 Corinthians 13:11&quot;

==Shifter==
In the lyrics of popular music a &quot;shifter&quot; is a word, often a pronoun, &quot;where reference varies according to who is speaking, when and where&quot;, such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;. For example, who is the &quot;my&quot; of &quot;My Generation&quot;?

==Copyright and royalties==
: &quot;See Royalties&quot;
, there are many websites featuring song lyrics. This offering, however, is controversial, since some sites include copyrighted lyrics offered without the holder&#x27;s permission. The U.S. Music Publishers Association (MPA), which represents sheet music companies, launched a legal campaign against such websites in December 2005. The MPA&#x27;s president, Lauren Keiser, said the free lyrics web sites are &quot;completely illegal&quot; and wanted some website operators jailed.

Lyrics licenses could be obtained worldwide through one of the two aggregators: LyricFind and Musixmatch. The first company to provide licensed lyrics was Yahoo!, quickly followed by MetroLyrics. Several lyric websites are providing licensed lyrics, such as SongMeanings and LyricWiki (defunct as of 2020).

Many competing lyrics web sites are still offering unlicensed content, causing challenges around the legality and accuracy of lyrics. In an attempt to crack down unlicensed lyrics web sites, a U.S. federal court has ordered LiveUniverse, a network of websites run by MySpace co-founder Brad Greenspan, to cease operating four sites offering unlicensed song lyrics.

==Academic study==
Lyrics can be studied from an academic perspective. For example, some lyrics can be considered a form of social commentary. Lyrics often contain political, social, and economic themes—as well as aesthetic elements—and so can communicate culturally significant messages. These messages can be explicit, or implied through metaphor or symbolism. Lyrics can also be analyzed with respect to the sense of unity (or lack of unity) it has with its supporting music. Analysis based on tonality and contrast are particular examples. Former Oxford Professor of Poetry Christopher Ricks famously published &quot;Dylan&#x27;s Visions of Sin&quot;, an in-depth and characteristically Ricksian analysis of the lyrics of Bob Dylan; Ricks gives the caveat that to have studied the poetry of the lyrics in tandem with the music would have made for a much more complicated critical feat.

==Search engines==
===Search risk===
A 2009 report published by McAfee found that, in terms of potential exposure to malware, lyrics-related searches and searches containing the word &quot;free&quot; are the most likely to have risky results from search engines, both in terms of average risk of all results, and maximum risk of any result.

===Google===
Beginning in late 2014, Google changed its search results pages to include song lyrics. When users search for a name of a song, Google can now display the lyrics directly in the search results page. When users search for a specific song&#x27;s lyrics, most results show the lyrics directly through a Google search by using Google Play.

<text>The Pas-de-Calais (, &quot;strait of Calais&quot;; ; ) is a department in northern France named after the French designation of the Strait of Dover, which it borders. It has the most communes of all the departments of France, with 890, and is the 8th most populous. It had a population of 1,465,278 in 2019. The Calais Passage connects to the Port of Calais on the English Channel. The Pas-de-Calais borders the departments of Nord and Somme and is connected to the English county of Kent via the Channel Tunnel.

==History==
Inhabited since prehistoric times, the Pas-de-Calais region was populated in turn by the Celtic Belgae, the Romans, the Germanic Franks and the Alemanni. During the fourth and fifth centuries, the Roman practice of co-opting Germanic tribes to provide military and defence services along the route from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Cologne created a Germanic-Romance linguistic border in the region that persisted until the eighth century.

Saxon colonization into the region from the fifth to the eighth centuries likely extended the linguistic border somewhat south and west so that by the ninth century most inhabitants north of the line between Béthune and Berck spoke a dialect of Middle Dutch, while the inhabitants to the south spoke Picard, a variety of Romance dialects.

This linguistic border is still evident today in the toponyms and patronyms of the region. Beginning in the ninth century, the linguistic border began a steady move to north and the east.

Pas-de-Calais is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Calaisis, formerly English, Boulonnais, Ponthieu and Artois, this last formerly part of the Spanish Netherlands.

Some of the costliest battles of World War I were fought in the region. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial, from Arras, commemorates the Battle of Vimy Ridge assault during the Battle of Arras (1917) and is Canada&#x27;s most important memorial in Europe to its fallen soldiers.

Pas-de-Calais was also the target of Operation Fortitude during World War II, which was an Allied plan to deceive the Germans that the invasion of Europe at D-Day was to occur here, rather than in Normandy.

==Geography==

Pas-de-Calais is in the current region of Hauts-de-France and is surrounded by the departments of Nord and Somme, the English Channel, and the North Sea. It shares a maritime border with the English county of Kent in the United Kingdom halfway through the Channel Tunnel.

The principal rivers are the following:

* Authie
* Canche
* Ternoise
* Liane
* Sensée
* Scarpe
* Deûle
* Lys
* Aa
===Principal towns===

Its principal towns are, on the coast, Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, and in Artois, Arras, Lens, Liévin, and Béthune. The most populous commune is Calais; the prefecture Arras is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 10 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Economy==
The economy of the department was long dependent on mining, primarily the coal mines near the town of Lens, Pas-de-Calais where coal was discovered in 1849. However, since World War II, the economy has become more diversified.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Pas-de-Calaisiens&quot;.

Pas-de-Calais is one of the most densely populated departments of France, but has no cities with over 100,000 residents: Calais has about 73,000 inhabitants. The remaining population is primarily concentrated along the border with the department of Nord in the mining district, where a string of small towns constitutes an urban area with a population of about 1.2 million. The centre and south of the department are more rural, but still quite heavily populated, with many villages and small towns.

Although the department saw some of the heaviest fighting of World War I, its population rebounded quickly after both world wars. However, many of the mining towns have seen dramatic decreases in population, some up to half of their population.

Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

=== Local elections ===
The president of the Departmental Council is Jean-Claude Leroy, elected in 2017.

=== National politics ===

In the second round of the French presidential elections of 2017 Pas-de-Calais was one of only two departments in which the candidate of the Front National, Marine Le Pen, received a majority of the votes cast: 52.06%.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

=== National Assembly Representatives (2017 to 2022) ===
==Education==

There are currently two public universities in the department. Although it is one of the most populous departments of France, Pas-de-Calais did not contain a university until 1991 when the French government created two universities: ULCO (Université du Littoral Côte d&#x27;Opale) on the western part of the department, and Université d&#x27;Artois on the eastern part.

<text>William John Viola Jr. ( , ; January 25, 1951 – July 12, 2024) was an American video artist whose artistic expression depended upon electronic, sound, and image technology in new media. His works focus on the ideas behind fundamental human experiences such as birth, death, and aspects of consciousness.

== Early life and education ==
William John Viola Jr. was born on January 25, 1951, in Flushing, Queens, New York, and grew up in Queens and Westbury. He attended P.S. 20, in Flushing, where he was captain of the TV Squad. On vacation in the mountains with his family, he nearly drowned in a lake, an experience he described as &quot;… the most beautiful world I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life&quot; and &quot;without fear,&quot; and &quot;peaceful.&quot;

In 1973, Viola graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor in Fine Arts in experimental studies. Viola described the school as traditional and considered himself to be &quot;one of the worst painters in the class.&quot; He studied in Syracuse University&#x27;s College of Visual and Performing Arts, including the Synapse experimental program, which evolved into CitrusTV.

== Career ==
From 1973 to 1980, Viola studied and performed with composer David Tudor in the new music group &quot;Rainforest&quot; (later named &quot;Composers Inside Electronics&quot;). From 1974 to 1976, Viola worked as technical director at , a pioneering video studio led by Maria Gloria Conti Bicocchi, in Florence, Italy where he encountered video artists Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman, and Vito Acconci. From 1976 to 1983, he was artist-in-residence at WNET Thirteen Television Laboratory in New York. In 1976 and 1977, he travelled to the Solomon Islands, Java, and Indonesia to record traditional performing arts.

Viola was invited to show work at La Trobe University (Melbourne, Australia) in 1977, by cultural arts director Kira Perov. Viola and Perov later married, beginning an important lifelong collaboration in working and traveling together. In 1980, they lived in Japan for a year and a half on a Japan/U.S. cultural exchange fellowship where they studied Buddhism with Zen Master Daien Tanaka. During this time, Viola was also an artist-in-residence at Sony Corporation&#x27;s Atsugi Laboratories.

In 1983, he became an instructor in Advanced Video at the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia, California. Viola received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fine arts in 1985. He represented the United States at the 46th Venice Biennale in 1995 for which he produced a series of works called &quot;Buried Secrets&quot;, including one of his best known works &quot;The Greeting&quot;, a contemporary interpretation of Pontormo&#x27;s &quot;The Visitation&quot;. In 1997, the Whitney Museum of American Art organized and toured internationally a major 25-year retrospective of Viola&#x27;s work.

Viola was the 1998, Getty Scholar-in-residence at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles. Later, in 2000, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002, he completed &quot;Going Forth By Day&quot;, a digital &quot;fresco&quot; cycle in high-definition video, commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin and the Guggenheim Museum, New York.

In 2003,&quot;The Passions&quot; was exhibited in Los Angeles, London, Madrid, and Canberra. This was a major collection of Viola&#x27;s emotionally charged, slow-motion works inspired by traditions within Renaissance devotional painting.

The first biography of Viola, entitled &quot;Viola on Vídeo&quot;, was written by Federico Utrera (King Juan Carlos University) and published in Spain in 2011.

=== Bill Viola studio ===
Bill Viola studio is run by his wife, Kira Perov, who is the executive director. She worked with Viola from 1978 managing and assisting him with his videotapes and installations. She documents their work in progress on location. All publications from the studio are edited by Perov.

== Death ==
Viola&#x27;s wife and longtime creative collaborator was Kira Perov. He had two sons.

Viola died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at home in Long Beach, California, on July 12, 2024, at the age of 73.

== Artwork ==
=== Style ===
Viola&#x27;s art deals largely with the central themes of human consciousness and experience – birth, death, love, emotion, and a kind of humanist spirituality. Throughout his career he drew meaning and inspiration from his deep interest in mystical traditions, especially Zen Buddhism, Christian mysticism, and Islamic Sufism, often evident in the transcendental quality of some of his works. Equally, the subject matter and manner of western medieval and renaissance devotional art informed his aesthetic.

He often explored dualism, or the idea that comprehension of a subject is impossible unless its opposite is known. For example, a lot of his work has themes such as life and death, light and dark, fire and water, stressed and calm, or loud and quiet.

His work can be divided into three types, conceptual, visual, and a unique combination of the two. Gardner feels that Viola&#x27;s visual work, such as &quot;The Veiling&quot;, and his combination of both the conceptual and visual, such as &quot;The Crossing,&quot; are impressive and memorable.

Viola&#x27;s work often exhibits a painterly quality, with his use of ultra-slow motion video encouraging the viewer to sink into the image and connect deeply to the meanings contained within it. This quality makes his work perhaps unusually accessible within a contemporary art context. As a consequence, his work often receives mixed reviews from critics, some of whom have noted a tendency toward grandiosity and obviousness in some of his work.

Viola&#x27;s interest in capturing the essence of emotion through recording of its extreme display began at least as early as his 1976 work, &quot;The Space Between the Teeth&quot;, a video of himself screaming, and continued with such works as the 45-second &quot;Silent Mountain&quot; (2001), which shows two actors in states of anguish, which Viola described as “probably the loudest scream I’ve recorded.”

If Viola&#x27;s depictions of emotional states with no objective correlative — emotional states for which the viewer has no external object or event to understand them by—are one feature of many of his works, another, which has come to the forefront, is his reference to medieval and classical depictions of emotion. His subdued &quot;Catherine&#x27;s Room&quot; 2001, has many scene by scene parallels with Andrea di Bartolo&#x27;s 1393 &quot;St. Catherine of Siena Praying&quot;.

Viola&#x27;s work has received critical accolades. Critic Marjorie Perloff singles him out for praise. Writing at length about the necessity of poetic works responding to and taking advantage of contemporary computer technologies, Perloff sees Viola as an example of how new technology—in his case, the video camera—can create entirely new aesthetic criteria and possibilities that did not exist in previous incarnations of the genre — in this case, theater.

== Video art projects ==

While many video artists have been quick to adopt new technologies to their medium, Viola relied little on digital editing. Perhaps the most technically challenging part of his work, and that which has benefited most from the advances since his earliest pieces, is his use of extreme slow motion.

His early works include &quot;The Reflecting Pool&quot; (1977–79), inspired by a lake drowning he experienced underwater before being saved by his uncle while on a family vacation that left a mark on his life and work.

=== &quot;Reverse Television&quot; ===

&quot;Reverse Television&quot; (1983) is a 15-minute montage of people watching video cameras as though they were televisions.

=== &quot;The Quintet Series&quot; ===
&quot;The Quintet Series&quot; (2000-2001) is a set of four separate videos that shows the unfolding expressions of five actors in slow motion so that details of their changing expressions can be detected. The work references European Renaissance Old Masters such as Hieronymous Bosch and Dieric Bouts

=== Collaboration with Nine Inch Nails ===
In 2000, Viola collaborated with the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails and its lead singer Trent Reznor to create a video suite for the band&#x27;s tour. The triptych mainly is focused on water imagery and was supposed to be integral with the songs that were played.

=== &quot;An Ocean Without a Shore&quot; ===
In 2007, Viola was invited back to the 52nd Venice Biennale to present an installation called &quot;An Ocean Without a Shore&quot;, which was named after a quote from Ibn ʿArabī. The work consists of people standing in the foreground with nothing but black behind them. Each of them seem to produce gallons of water from themselves as if they were waterfalls. The water comes gushing out of their bodies as if they are being reborn. This main piece seems to creates the effect of appearing as a nearly transparent wall of glass. Viola described the piece in an interview as being &quot;about the fragility of life, like the borderline between life and death is actually not a hard wall; it’s not to be opened with a lock and key, it&#x27;s actually very fragile, very tenuous.&quot;

=== &quot;Observance&quot; ===
&quot;Observance&quot; (2002), is a work which may be taken partly as a response to the September 11 attacks. The installation involves about four or five individuals in a small frame. Although cramped in this small space, they seem to not want to move out of it. One of the youngest individuals in the group comes forward to the front center of the crowd looking at something with an air of solace. In this action, the actions of the other individuals makes more sense. There is something foreboding and tragic in front of them.

=== &quot;The Tristan Project&quot; ===
In 2004, Viola embarked on &quot;The Tristan Project&quot;. At the invitation of opera director Peter Sellars, he created video sequences to be shown as a backdrop to the action on stage during the performance of Wagner&#x27;s opera Tristan und Isolde. Using his extreme slow motion, Viola&#x27;s pieces used actors to portray the metaphorical story behind Wagner&#x27;s story, seeing for example the first act as an extended ritual of purification in which the characters disrobe and wash themselves before finally plunging headlong into water together (in Wagner&#x27;s story, the two characters maintain the facade of being indifferent to each other (necessary because Isolde is betrothed to Tristan&#x27;s uncle) before, mistakenly believing they are going to die anyway, and reveal their true feelings). The piece was first performed in Los Angeles at Disney Hall on 3 separate evenings in 2004, one act at a time, then given complete performances at the Bastille Opera in Paris in April and in November 2005. The video pieces were later shown in London without Wagner&#x27;s music in June to September 2006, at the Haunch of Venison Gallery and St. Olave&#x27;s School, London. The Tristan project returned, both in music and video, to the Disney Hall in Los Angeles in April 2007, with further performances at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center in May 2007 and at the Gergiev Festival in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2007.

=== &quot;The Night Journey&quot; ===
In 2005, he began working with Tracy Fullerton and the Game Innovation Lab at USC on the art game, &quot;The Night Journey&quot;, a project based on the universal story of an individual&#x27;s mystic journey toward enlightenment. The game has presented at a number of exhibits worldwide as a work in progress. It was awarded Sublime Experience at IndieCade 2008.

=== &quot;Bodies of Light&quot; ===
In October 2009, Viola&#x27;s solo exhibition entitled &quot;Bodies of Light&quot; appeared at the James Cohan Gallery in New York. Featured in the exhibition was Pneuma (1994), a projection of alternating images evoking the concept of fleeting memories. Also on view were several pieces from the Viola&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Transfiguration&quot; series, which he evolved from his 2007 installation Ocean Without a Shore.

== Other projects ==
In 2004, Viola began work on a new production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, a collaboration with director Peter Sellars, conductor
Esa-Pekka Salonen, and executive producer Kira Perov. The opera premiered at the Opéra National de Paris in 2005 and Viola&#x27;s video work was subsequently shown as &quot;LOVE/DEATH The Tristan Project&quot; at the Haunch of Venison Gallery and St Olave&#x27;s School, London, in 2006 and at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles in 2007. During 2007, the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo in Sevilla, organized an exhibition at the Palace of Charles V in la Alhambra- Granada- in which Viola&#x27;s work dialogues with the Fine Arts Collection of the museum.

== Viola&#x27;s Three Structures ==
Viola felt as if there are three different structures to describe patterns of data structures. There is the branching structure, matrix structure, and schizo structure.

&quot;The most common structure is called branching. In this structure, the viewer proceeds from the top to bottom in time.&quot; The branching structure of presenting data is the typical narrative and linear structure. The viewer proceeds from a set point A to point B by taking an exact path, the same path any other reader would take. An example of this is Google because users go into this website with a certain mindset of what they want to search for, and they get a certain result as they branch off and end at another website.

The second structure is the Matrix structure. This structure describes media when it follows nonlinear progression through information. The viewer could enter at any point, move in any direction, at any speed, pop in and out at any place. Like the branching structure, this also has its set perimeters. However, the exact path that is followed is up to the user. The user has the option of participating in decision-making that affect the viewing experience of the media. An example of this is Public Secrets, a website that reveals secrets of the justice and the incarceration system within the U.S. for women. There is a set boundary of what users can and cannot do while presenting them with different themes and subjects users are able to view. Different users will find themselves taking different paths, using flash cues to guide themselves through the website. This vast selection of paths presents many users with a unique viewing experience (in relation to that of the previous persons). As well, they have the choice to read the excerpts from these women or hear it out loud. This connects to Borges&#x27; &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; where the participant has a variety of choices on how they see a story unfold before them. Each time, they can create a different path.

The last structure is called the schizo, or the spaghetti model. This form of data structure pertains to pure or mostly randomness. &quot;Everything is irrelevant and significant at the same time. Viewers may become lost in this structure and never find their way out.&quot;

== Awards ==
Viola was awarded the XXIst Catalonia International Prize in 2009. The Premi Internacional Catalunya was created by the autonomous government of Catalonia, the Generalitat de Catalunya, to be awarded to those who make notable contributions to the advancement of human, cultural, and scientific values. The award honors an individual &quot;whose creative work has made a significant contribution to the development of cultural, scientific or human values anywhere in the world&quot;.

<text>In the administrative divisions of France, the department (, ) is one of the three levels of government under the national level (&quot;territorial collectivities&quot;), between the administrative regions and the communes. There are ninety-six departments in metropolitan France, with an additional five overseas departments, which are also classified as overseas regions. Departments are further subdivided into 333 arrondissements and 2,054 cantons (as of 2023). These last two levels of government have no political autonomy, instead serving as the administrative basis for the local organisation of police, fire departments as well as, in certain cases, elections.

Each department is administered by an elected body called a departmental council ( , ). From 1800 to April 2015, these were called general councils ( , ). Each council has a president. Their main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances, of junior high school () buildings and technical staff, and local roads and school and rural buses, and a contribution to municipal infrastructures. Local services of the state administration are traditionally organised at departmental level, where the prefect represents the government; however, regions have gained importance since the 2000s, with some department-level services merged into region-level services.

The departments were created in 1790 as a rational replacement of Ancien Régime provinces with a view to strengthen national unity; the title &quot;department&quot; is used to mean a part of a larger whole. Almost all of them were named after physical geographical features (rivers, mountains, or coasts), rather than after historical or cultural territories, which could have their own loyalties, or after their own administrative seats. The division of France into departments was a project particularly identified with the French revolutionary leader the Abbé Sieyès, although it had already been frequently discussed and written about by many politicians and thinkers. The earliest known suggestion of it is from 1665 in the writings of d&#x27;Argenson. They have inspired similar divisions in many countries, some of them former French colonies. The 1822 territorial division of Spain (reverted due to the 1823 French intervention ending the trienio liberal) and the 1833 territorial division of Spain, which forms the basis of the present day provinces of Spain with minor modifications, are also based on the French model of departments of roughly equal size.

Most French departments are assigned a two-digit number, the Official Geographical Code, allocated by the (). Overseas departments have a three-digit number. The number is used, for example, in the postal code and was until recently used for all vehicle registration plates. Residents commonly use the numbers to refer to their own department or a neighbouring one, for example inhabitants of Loiret may refer to their department as &quot;the 45&quot;. More distant departments are generally referred to by their names, as few people know the numbers of all the departments.

In 2014, President François Hollande proposed abolishing departmental councils by 2020, which would have maintained the departments as administrative divisions, and transferring their powers to other levels of governance. This reform project has since been scrapped.

==History==

The first French territorial departments were proposed in 1665 by Marc-René d&#x27;Argenson to serve as administrative areas purely for the &quot;Ponts et Chaussées&quot; (Bridges and Highways) infrastructure administration.

Before the French Revolution, France gained territory gradually through the annexation of a mosaic of independent entities. By the end of the Ancien Régime it was organised into provinces. During the Revolution they were dissolved, partly in order to weaken old loyalties. The National Constituent Assembly decided to create a more uniform division into departments (&quot;département&quot;) and districts in late 1789. The process began on 4 August 1789 with the elimination of provincial privileges, and a 22 December 1789 decree (with letters patent in January 1790) provided for the termination of the provincial governments.

The modern department system, as all-purpose units of the government, was decreed on 26 February 1790 (with letters patent on 4 March 1790) by the National Constituent Assembly. Their boundaries served two purposes:
* Boundaries were chosen to break up France&#x27;s historical regions in an attempt to erase cultural differences and build a more homogeneous nation.
* Boundaries were set so that every settlement in the country was within a day&#x27;s ride of the capital of a department. This was a security measure, intended to keep the entire national territory under close control.

The old nomenclature was carefully avoided in naming the new departments. Most were named after an area&#x27;s principal river or other physical features. Even Paris was in the department of Seine. Savoy, during its temporary occupation, became the department of Mont-Blanc. The provinces continued to exist administratively until 21 September 1791.

The number of departments, initially 83, had been increased to 130 by 1809 with the territorial gains of the Republic and of the First French Empire. Following the defeats of Napoleon in 1814–1815 the Congress of Vienna returned France to its pre-war size and the number of departments was reduced to 86 (three of the original departments having been split). In 1860 France acquired the County of Nice and Savoy, which led to the creation of three new departments. Two were added from the new Savoyard territory, while the department of Alpes-Maritimes was created from Nice and a portion of the Var department. The 89 departments were given numbers based on the alphabetical order of their names.

The department of Bas-Rhin and parts of Meurthe, Moselle, Vosges and Haut-Rhin were ceded to the German Empire in 1871 following France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. A small part of Haut-Rhin, however, remained French and became known as the Territoire de Belfort; the remaining parts of Meurthe and Moselle were merged into a new Meurthe-et-Moselle department. When France regained the ceded departments after World War I, the Territoire de Belfort was not reintegrated into Haut-Rhin. In 1922 it became France&#x27;s 90th department. Likewise the Lorraine departments were not changed back to their original boundaries, and a new Moselle department was created in the regained territory, with slightly different boundaries from the pre-war department of the same name.

The reorganisation of Île-de-France in 1968 and the division of Corsica in 1975 added six more departments, raising the total in Metropolitan France to 96. By 2011, when the overseas collectivity of Mayotte became a department, joining the earlier overseas departments of the Republic (all created in 1946) – French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion – the total number of departments in the French Republic had become 101. In 2015 the Urban Community of Lyon was split from Rhône to form the Métropole de Lyon, a &quot;sui generis&quot; entity, with the powers of both an intercommunality and those of a department on its territory, formally classified as a &quot;territorial collectivity with particular status&quot; () and as such not belonging to any department. As of 2019 Corse-du-Sud and Haute-Corse are still administrative departments, although they no longer have the status of departmental &quot;territorial collectivities&quot;: region and department functions have been managed by a &quot;single territorial collectivity&quot; since 2018.

Despite the intention to avoid the old nomenclature, often the names of pre-1790 provinces remained in use. For example, the name of Berry, though no longer having an official status, remains in widespread use in daily life.

==General characteristics==

=== Government and administration ===
The departmental seat of government is known as the prefecture () or and is generally a town of some importance roughly at the geographical centre of the department. This was determined according to the time taken to travel on horseback from the periphery of the department. The goal was for the prefecture to be accessible on horseback from any town in the department within 24 hours. The prefecture is not necessarily the largest city in the department: for instance, in Saône-et-Loire department the capital is Mâcon, but the largest city is Chalon-sur-Saône. Departments may be divided into . The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture () or .

Each department is administered by a departmental council (), an assembly elected for six years by universal suffrage, with the President of the Departmental Council as executive of the department. Before 1982, the chief executive of the department was the prefect (), who represents the Government of France in each department and is appointed by the President of the French Republic. The prefect is assisted by one or more sub-prefects () based in the subprefectures of the department. Since 1982, the prefect retains only the powers that are not delegated to the department councils. In practice, their role has been largely limited to preventing local policy from conflicting with national policy.

The departments are further divided into communes, governed by municipal councils. As of 2013, there were 36,681 communes in France. In the overseas territories, some communes play a role at departmental level. Paris, the country&#x27;s capital city, is a commune as well as a department.
In continental France (metropolitan France, excluding Corsica), the median land area of a department is , which is two-and-a-half times the median land area of the ceremonial counties of England and the preserved counties of Wales and slightly more than three-and-half times the median land area of a county of the United States. At the 2001 census, the median population of a department in continental France was 511,000 inhabitants, which is 21 times the median population of a United States county, but less than two-thirds of the median population of a ceremonial county of England and Wales. Most of the departments have an area of between 4,000 and 8,000 km2 (1500 to 3000 sq. mi.), and a population between 320,000 and 1 million. The largest in area is Gironde (), while the smallest is the city of Paris (). The most populous is Nord (2,550,000) and the least populous is Lozère (74,000).

=== Numbering ===

The departments are numbered: their two-digit numbers appear in postal codes, in INSEE codes (including &quot;social security numbers&quot;) and on vehicle number plates. Initially the numbers corresponded to the alphabetical order of the names of the departments, but several changed their names and some have been divided, so the correspondence became less exact. Alphanumeric codes 2A and 2B were used for Corsica while it was split but it has since reverted to 20. The two-digit code &quot;98&quot; is used by Monaco. Together with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code FR, the numbers form the ISO 3166-2 country subdivision codes for the metropolitan departments. The overseas departments have three digits.

=== Relation to national government ===

Originally, the relationship between the departments and the central government was left somewhat ambiguous. While citizens in each department elected their own officials, the local governments were subordinated to the central government, becoming instruments of national integration. By 1793, however, the revolutionary government had turned the departments into transmission belts for policies enacted in Paris. With few exceptions, the departments had this role until the early 1960s.

===Political party preferences===
These maps cannot be used as a useful resource of voter preferences, because Departmental Councils are elected on a two-round system, which drastically limits the chances of fringe parties, if they are not supported on one of the two rounds by a moderate party. After the 1992 election, the left had a majority in only 21 of the 100 departments; after the 2011 election, the left dominated 61 of the 100 departments. (Mayotte only became a department after the election.)

Key to the parties:
* Divers Centre = Independents of the centre or Democratic Movement (Mouvement démocrate)
* Divers Droite (DVD) = Independent conservatives
* Divers Gauche (DVG) = Independent left-wing politicians
* MPF = Movement for France (Mouvement pour la France) (right)
* Nouveau Centre = New Centre (centre or centre-right)
* PCF = French Communist Party (Parti communiste français)
* PRG = Radical Party of the Left (Parti radical de gauche)
* PS = Socialist Party (Parti socialiste)
* UDF = Union for French Democracy (Union pour la démocratie française) succeeded by Democratic Movement
* UMP = Union for a Popular Movement (Union pour un mouvement populaire)

==Future==
The removal of one or more levels of local government has been discussed for some years; in particular, the option of removing the departmental level. Frédéric Lefebvre, spokesman for the UMP, said in December 2008 that the fusion of the departments with the regions was a matter to be dealt with soon. This was soon refuted by Édouard Balladur and Gérard Longuet, members of the committee for the reform of local authorities, known as the Balladur Committee.

In January 2008, the Attali Commission recommended that the departmental level of government should be eliminated within ten years.

Nevertheless, the Balladur Committee has not retained this proposition and does not advocate the disappearance of the departments, but simply &quot;favors the voluntary grouping of departments&quot;, which it suggests also for the regions, with the aim of reducing the number of regions to 15. This committee advocates, on the contrary, the suppression of the cantons.

===Current departments===
Each department has a coat of arms and a flag with which it is commonly associated, though not all are officially recognised or used.
===Former departments===

====Former departments of the current territory of France====
====Departments of Algeria ()====
Unlike the rest of the French possessions in Africa, Algeria was divided into departments just like Corsica or Normandy from 1848 until its independence in 1962. These departments were supposed to be &quot;assimilated&quot; or &quot;integrated&quot; to France sometime in the future.

There are a number of former departments in territories conquered by France during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Empire that are now not part of France:

Notes for Table 7:
# Where a Napoleonic department was composed of parts from more than one country, the nation-state containing the prefecture is listed. Please expand this table to list all countries containing significant parts of the department.
# Territories that were a part of Austrian Netherlands were also a part of Holy Roman Empire.
# The Bishopric of Basel was a German Prince-Bishopric, not to be confused with the adjacent Swiss Canton of Basel.
# The Ionian Islands were annexed by France after the Fall of the Republic of Venice. They were lost to France, becoming the Septinsular Republic, a Russo-Ottoman vassal state, from 1800 to 1807, before reverting to France at the Treaty of Tilsit. The second period of French rule lasted until 1810/14, after which these territories became a British protectorate, as the United States of the Ionian Islands
# Maastricht was a condominium of the Dutch Republic and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.
# On 6 June 1805, as a result of the annexation of the Ligurian Republic (the puppet successor state to the Republic of Genoa), Tanaro was abolished and its territory divided between the departments of Marengo, Montenotte and Stura.

# Before becoming the department of Simplon, the was converted to a revolutionary (16 March 1798) which was swiftly incorporated (1 May 1798) into the puppet Helvetic Republic until 1802 when it became the independent Rhodanic Republic.
# In the months before Lippe was formed, the arrondissements of Rees and Münster were part of Yssel-Supérieur, the arrondissement of Steinfurt was part of Bouches-de-l&#x27;Yssel and the arrondissement of Neuenhaus was part of Ems-Occidental.

<doc id="38527" wikidata="Q358312" url="?curid=38527" title="Gregory Benford">
<text>Gregory Benford (born January 30, 1941) is an American science fiction author and astrophysicist who is professor emeritus at the department of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. He is a contributing editor of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine.

Benford wrote the Galactic Center Saga science fiction novels, beginning with &quot;In the Ocean of Night&quot; (1977). The series postulates a galaxy in which sentient organic life is in constant warfare with sentient electromechanical life.

In 1969 he wrote &quot;The Scarred Man&quot;, the first story about a computer virus (based on a real computer virus he had spread), published in 1970.

== Biography ==
Benford was born in Mobile, Alabama and grew up in Robertsdale and Fairhope. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa, he received a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1963 from the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma, followed by a Master of Science from the University of California, San Diego in 1965, and a doctorate there in 1967. That same year he married Joan Abbe, with whom he had two children. Benford modeled characters in several of his novels after his wife, most prominently the heroine of &quot;Artifact&quot;. She died in 2002.

Benford has an identical twin brother, James (Jim) Benford, with whom he has collaborated on science fiction stories. Both got their start in science fiction fandom, with Gregory being a co-editor of the science fiction fanzine &quot;Void&quot;. Benford has said he is an atheist.

He has been a long-time resident of Laguna Beach, California.

== Writing career ==
Gregory Benford&#x27;s first professional sale was the story &quot;Stand-In&quot; in the &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (June 1965), which won second prize in a short story contest based on a poem by Doris Pitkin Buck. In 1969, he began writing a science column for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

Benford tends to write hard science fiction which incorporates the research he is doing as a practical scientist. He has worked on collaborations with authors William Rotsler, David Brin and Gordon Eklund. His time-travel novel &quot;Timescape&quot; (1980) won both the Nebula Award and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. This scientific procedural novel eventually loaned its title to a line of science fiction published by Pocket Books. In the late 1990s, he wrote &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Fear&quot;, one of an authorized sequel trilogy to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Other novels published in that period include several near-future science thrillers: &quot;Cosm&quot; (1998), &quot;The Martian Race&quot; (1999) and &quot;Eater&quot; (2000).

Benford has served as an editor of numerous alternate history anthologies, as well as collections of Hugo Award winners.

He has been nominated for four Hugo Awards (for two short stories and two novellas) and 13 Nebula Awards (in all categories). In addition to &quot;Timescape&quot;, he won the Nebula for the novelette &quot;If the Stars Are Gods&quot; (with Eklund).

Benford was a guest of honour at Aussiecon Three, the 1999 Worldcon. He remains a regular contributor to science fiction fanzines, for example &quot;Apparatchik&quot; (defunct as of 1997).

In 2016 Benford was the recipient of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society Forry Award Lifetime Achievement Award in the Field of Science Fiction.

== Contributions to science and speculative science ==

Gregory Benford is Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of California, Irvine. With more than 200 scientific publications, his research encompassed both theory and experiments in the fields of astrophysics and plasma physics. His research has been supported by NSF, NASA, AFOSR, DOE and other agencies. He is an ongoing advisor to NASA, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the CIA.

Benford&#x27;s work in physics at the University of California focused on theoretical and experimental plasma physics, including studies of extremely strong turbulence, particularly in astrophysical contexts, and studies of magnetic structures from the Galactic Center to large-scale galactic jets. Working in collaboration with, among others, science fiction writers Cramer, Forward, and Landis, Benford worked on a theoretical study of the physics of wormholes, which pointed out that wormholes, if formed in the early universe, could still exist in the present day if they were wrapped in a negative-mass cosmic string. Such wormholes could potentially be detected by gravitational lensing.

In 2004, Benford proposed that the harmful effects of global warming could be reduced by the construction of a rotating Fresnel lens 1,000 kilometres across, floating in space at the Lagrangian point L1. According to Benford, this lens would diffuse the light from the Sun and reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%. He estimated that this would cost around US$10 billion. His plan has been commented on in a variety of forums. A similar space sunshade was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early, and again in 1997 by Edward Teller, Lowell Wood, and Roderick Hyde. In 2006, Benford pointed out one possible danger in this approach: if this lens were built and global warming were avoided, there would be less incentive to reduce greenhouse gases, and humans might continue to produce too much carbon dioxide until it caused some other environmental catastrophe, such as a chemical change in ocean water that could be disastrous to ocean life.

Benford serves on the board of directors and the steering committee of the Mars Society.

He has advocated human cryopreservation, for example by signing an open letter to support research into cryonics, being a member of Alcor, and by being an advisor to a UK cryonics and cryopreservation advocacy group.

Gregory Benford retired from the University of California in 2006 in order to found and develop Genescient Corporation. Genescient is a new generation biotechnology company that claims to combine evolutionary genomics with massive selective screening to analyze and exploit the genetics of model animal and human whole genomes.

==Benford&#x27;s law of controversy==
Benford&#x27;s law of controversy is an adage from the 1980 novel &quot;Timescape&quot;:

The adage was quoted in an international drug policy article in a peer-reviewed social science journal.

<doc id="38528" wikidata="Q12661" url="?curid=38528" title="Nord (French department)">
<text>Nord (; officially ; ; , ) is a département in Hauts-de-France region, France bordering Belgium. It was created from the western halves of the historical counties of Flanders and Hainaut, and the Bishopric of Cambrai. The modern coat of arms was inherited from the County of Flanders.

Nord is the country&#x27;s most populous département. It had a population of 2,608,346 in 2019. It also contains the metropolitan region of Lille (the main city and the prefecture of the département), the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The department is the part of France where the French Flemish dialect of Dutch has historically been spoken as a native language. Similarly, the distinct French Picard dialect Ch&#x27;ti is spoken there.

== History ==
Until the 17th century, the history of the North (Nord, French department) was largely in common with the history of Belgium (the Celtics Belgians during Antiquity were a multitude of Celtic peoples from the north of Gaul). The historical French provinces that preceded Nord are French Flanders, French Hainaut (part of Hainaut and Flanders is in the Kingdom of Belgium). Tribes of the Belgae, such as the Menapii and Nervii were the first peoples recorded in the area later known as Nord.

During the 4th and 5th Centuries, Roman rulers of &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot; secured the route from the major port of Bononia (Boulogne) to Colonia (Cologne), by co-opting Germanic peoples north-east of this corridor, such as the Tungri. In effect, the area known later as Nord became an isogloss (linguistic border) between the Germanic and Romance languages. Saxon colonisation of the region from the 5th to the 8th centuries likely shifted the isogloss further south so that, by the 9th century, most people immediately north of Lille spoke a dialect of Old Dutch. This has remained evident in the place names of the region. After the County of Flanders became part of France in the 9th century, the isogloss moved north and east.

During the 14th century, much of the area came under the control of the Duchy of Burgundy and in subsequent centuries was therefore part of the Habsburg Netherlands (from 1482) and the Spanish Netherlands (1581).

Areas that later constituted Nord were ceded to France by treaties in 1659, 1668, and 1678, becoming the Counties of Flanders and Hainaut, and part of the Bishopric of Cambrai.

On 4 March 1790, during the French Revolution, Nord became one of the original 83 departments created to replace the counties.

Modern government policies making French the only official language have led to a decline in use of the Dutch West Flemish dialect. There are currently 20,000 speakers of a sub-dialect of West Flemish in the arrondissement of Dunkirk and it appears likely that this particular sub-dialect will be extinct within decades.

== Geography ==

Nord is part of the current Hauts-de-France region and is surrounded by the French departments of Pas-de-Calais, Somme, and Aisne, as well as by Belgium and the North Sea. Its area is . It is the longest department in metropolitan France, measuring 184 km from Fort-Philippe in the north-west to Anor in the south-east.

Situated in the north of the country along the western half of the Belgian frontier, the department is unusually long and narrow. The principal rivers are the following: Yser, Lys, Escaut, Scarpe, Sambre.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Lille, the prefecture. With nearby Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq, it constitutes the center of a cluster of industrial and former mining towns totalling slightly over a million inhabitants. As of 2019, there are 10 communes with more than 30,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==

With a population of 2,608,346 in 2019, Nord is the department with the largest population.

==Politics==

The President of the Departmental Council is the unaffiliated right-winger Christian Poiret.

The first President of the Fifth Republic, General Charles de Gaulle, was born in Lille in the department on 22 November 1890.

=== Presidential elections second round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

== Economy ==
Until recently, the department was dominated economically by coal mining, which extended through the heart of the department from neighbouring Artois into central Belgium.

At the forefront of France&#x27;s 19th century industrialisation, the area suffered severely during World War I and now faces the economic, social and environmental problems associated with the decline of coal mining with its neighbours, following the earlier decline of the Lille-Roubaix textile industry.

<text>Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person&#x27;s biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.

Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation). Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.

==History==

===Antiquity===
;Adoption for the well-born

While the modern form of adoption emerged in the United States, forms of the practice appeared throughout history. The Code of Hammurabi, for example, details the rights of adopters and the responsibilities of adopted individuals at length. The practice of adoption in ancient Rome is well-documented in the Codex Justinianus.

Markedly different from the modern period, ancient adoption practices put emphasis on the political and economic interests of the adopter, providing a legal tool that strengthened political ties between wealthy families and created male heirs to manage estates. The use of adoption by the aristocracy is well-documented: many of Rome&#x27;s emperors were adopted sons. Adrogation was a kind of Roman adoption in which the person adopted consented to be adopted by another.

Infant adoption during Antiquity appears rare. Abandoned children were often picked up for slavery and composed a significant percentage of the Empire&#x27;s slave supply. Roman legal records indicate that foundlings were occasionally taken in by families and raised as a son or daughter. Although not normally adopted under Roman Law, the children, called &quot;alumni&quot;, were reared in an arrangement similar to guardianship, being considered the property of the father who abandoned them.

Other ancient civilizations, notably India and China, used some form of adoption as well. Evidence suggests the goal of this practice was to ensure the continuity of cultural and religious practices; in contrast to the Western idea of extending family lines. In ancient India, adoption was conducted in a limited and highly ritualistic form, so that an adopter might have the necessary funerary rites performed by a son. China had a similar idea of adoption with males adopted solely to perform the duties of ancestor worship.

The practice of adopting the children of family members and close friends was common among the cultures of Polynesia including Hawaii where the custom was referred to as &quot;hānai&quot;.

===Middle ages to modern period===
;Adoption and commoners
The nobility of the Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic cultures that dominated Europe after the decline of the Roman Empire denounced the practice of adoption. In medieval society, bloodlines were paramount; a ruling dynasty lacking a &quot;natural-born&quot; heir apparent was replaced, a stark contrast to Roman traditions. The evolution of European law reflects this aversion to adoption. English common law, for instance, did not permit adoption since it contradicted the customary rules of inheritance. In the same vein, France&#x27;s Napoleonic Code made adoption difficult, requiring adopters to be over the age of 50, sterile, older than the adopted person by at least 15 years, and to have fostered the adoptee for at least six years. Some adoptions continued to occur, however, but became informal, based on ad hoc contracts. For example, in the year 737, in a charter from the town of Lucca, three adoptees were made heirs to an estate. Like other contemporary arrangements, the agreement stressed the responsibility of the adopted rather than adopter, focusing on the fact that, under the contract, the adoptive father was meant to be cared for in his old age; an idea that is similar to the conceptions of adoption under Roman law.

Europe&#x27;s cultural makeover marked a period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose with the fall of the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church&#x27;s innovation, however, was the practice of oblation, whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe&#x27;s abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning of a shift toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.

As the idea of institutional care gained acceptance, formal rules appeared about how to place children into families: boys could become apprenticed to an artisan and girls might be married off under the institution&#x27;s authority. Institutions informally adopted out children as well, a mechanism treated as a way to obtain cheap labor, demonstrated by the fact that when the adopted died their bodies were returned by the family to the institution for burial.

This system of apprenticeship and informal adoption extended into the 19th century, today seen as a transitional phase for adoption history. Under the direction of social welfare activists, orphan asylums began to promote adoptions based on sentiment rather than work; children were placed out under agreements to provide care for them as family members instead of under contracts for apprenticeship. The growth of this model is believed to have contributed to the enactment of the first modern adoption law in 1851 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, unique in that it codified the ideal of the &quot;best interests of the child&quot;. Despite its intent, though, in practice, the system operated much the same as earlier incarnations. The experience of the Boston Female Asylum (BFA) is a good example, which had up to 30% of its charges adopted out by 1888. Officials of the BFA noted that, although the asylum promoted otherwise, adoptive parents did not distinguish between indenture and adoption: &quot;We believe,&quot; the asylum officials said, &quot;that often, when children of a younger age are taken to be adopted, the adoption is only another name for service.&quot;

===Modern period===
;Adopting to create a family

The next stage of adoption&#x27;s evolution fell to the emerging nation of the United States. Rapid immigration and the American Civil War resulted in unprecedented overcrowding of orphanages and foundling homes in the mid-nineteenth century. Charles Loring Brace, a Protestant minister, became appalled by the legions of homeless waifs roaming the streets of New York City. Brace considered the abandoned youth, particularly Catholics, to be the most dangerous element challenging the city&#x27;s order. 

His solution was outlined in &quot;The Best Method of Disposing of Our Pauper and Vagrant Children&quot; (1859), which started the Orphan Train movement. The orphan trains eventually shipped an estimated 200,000 children from the urban centers of the East to the nation&#x27;s rural regions. The children were generally indentured, rather than adopted, to families who took them in. As in times past, some children were raised as members of the family while others were used as farm laborers and household servants. The sheer size of the displacement—the largest migration of children in history—and the degree of exploitation that occurred, gave rise to new agencies and a series of laws that promoted adoption arrangements rather than indenture. The hallmark of the period is Minnesota&#x27;s adoption law of 1917, which mandated investigation of all placements and limited record access to those involved in the adoption.

During the same period, the Progressive movement swept the United States with a critical goal of ending the prevailing orphanage system. The culmination of such efforts came with the First White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children called by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909, where it was declared that the nuclear family represented &quot;the highest and finest product of civilization&quot; and was best able to serve as primary caretaker for the abandoned and orphaned. As late as 1923, only two percent of children without parental care were in adoptive homes, with the balance in foster arrangements and orphanages. Less than forty years later, nearly one-third were in adoptive homes.

Nevertheless, the popularity of eugenic ideas in America put up obstacles to the growth of adoption. There were grave concerns about the genetic quality of illegitimate and indigent children, perhaps best exemplified by the influential writings of Henry H. Goddard, who protested against adopting children of unknown origin, saying,

 The period 1945 to 1974, the baby scoop era, saw rapid growth and acceptance of adoption as a means to build a family. Illegitimate births rose three-fold after World War II, as sexual mores changed. Simultaneously, the scientific community began to stress the dominance of nurture over genetics, chipping away at eugenic stigmas. In this environment, adoption became the obvious solution for both unwed people and infertile couples.

Taken together, these trends resulted in a new American model for adoption. Following its Roman predecessor, Americans severed the rights of the original parents while making adopters the new parents in the eyes of the law. Two innovations were added: 1) adoption was meant to ensure the &quot;best interests of the child&quot;, the seeds of this idea can be traced to the first American adoption law in Massachusetts, and 2) adoption became infused with secrecy, eventually resulting in the sealing of adoption and original birth records by 1945. The origin of the move toward secrecy began with Charles Loring Brace, who introduced it to prevent children from the Orphan Trains from returning to or being reclaimed by their parents. Brace feared the impact of the parents&#x27; poverty, in general, and Catholic religion, in particular, on the youth. This tradition of secrecy was carried on by the later Progressive reformers when drafting of American laws.

The number of adoptions in the United States peaked in 1970. It is uncertain what caused the subsequent decline. Likely contributing factors in the 1960s and 1970s include a decline in the fertility rate, associated with the introduction of the pill, the completion of legalization of artificial birth control methods, the introduction of federal funding to make family planning services available to the young and low-income, and the legalization of abortion. In addition, the years of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic change in society&#x27;s view of illegitimacy and in the legal rights of those born outside of wedlock. In response, family preservation efforts grew so that few children born out of wedlock today are adopted. Ironically, adoption is far more visible and discussed in society today, yet it is less common.

The American model of adoption eventually proliferated globally. England and Wales established their first formal adoption law in 1926. The Netherlands passed its law in 1956. Sweden made adoptees full members of the family in 1959. West Germany enacted its first laws in 1977. Additionally, the Asian powers opened their orphanage systems to adoption, influenced as they were by Western ideas following colonial rule and military occupation. In France, local public institutions accredit candidates for adoption, who can then contact orphanages abroad or ask for the support of NGOs. The system does not involve fees, but gives considerable power to social workers whose decisions may restrict adoption to &quot;standard&quot; families (middle-age, medium to high income, heterosexual, Caucasian).

Adoption is today practiced globally. The table below provides a snapshot of Western adoption rates. Adoption in the United States still occurs at rates nearly three times those of its peers even though the number of children awaiting adoption has held steady in recent years, between 100,000 and 125,000 during the period 2009 to 2018.

==Contemporary adoption==

===Forms of adoption===
Contemporary adoption practices can be open or closed.
* Open adoption allows identifying information to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole custody over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child. As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements to be included in the adoption finalization.
* The practice of closed adoption (also called confidential or secret adoption), which has not been the norm for most of modern history, seals all identifying information, maintaining it as secret and preventing disclosure of the adoptive parents&#x27;, biological kin&#x27;s, and adoptees&#x27; identities. Nevertheless, closed adoption may allow the transmittal of non-identifying information such as medical history and religious and ethnic background. Today, as a result of safe haven laws passed by some U.S. states, secret adoption is seeing renewed influence. In so-called &quot;safe-haven&quot; states, infants can be left anonymously at hospitals, fire departments, or police stations within a few days of birth, a practice criticized by some adoption advocacy organizations as being retrograde and dangerous.

===How adoptions originate===


Adoptions can occur between related or unrelated individuals. Historically, most adoptions occurred within a family. The most recent data from the U.S. indicates that about half of adoptions are currently between related individuals. A common example of this is a &quot;step-parent adoption&quot;, where the new partner of a parent legally adopts a child from the parent&#x27;s previous relationship. Intra-family adoption can also occur through surrender, as a result of parental death, or when the child cannot otherwise be cared for and a family member agrees to take over.

Adoption is not always a voluntary process. In some countries, for example in the U.K., one of the main origins of children being placed for adoption is that they have been removed from the birth home, often by a government body such as the local authority. There are a number of reasons why children are removed including abuse and neglect, which can have a lasting impact on the adoptee. Social workers in many cases will be notified of a safeguarding concern in relation to a child and will make enquiries into the child&#x27;s well-being. Social workers will often seek means of keeping a child together with the birth family, for example, by providing additional support to the family before considering removal of a child. A court of law will often then make decisions regarding the child&#x27;s future, for example, whether they can return to the birth family, enter into foster care or be adopted.

Infertility is the main reason parents seek to adopt children they are not related to. One study shows this accounted for 80% of unrelated infant adoptions and half of adoptions through foster care. Estimates suggest that 11–24% of Americans who cannot conceive or carry to term attempt to build a family through adoption, and that the overall rate of never-married American women who adopt is about 1.4%. Other reasons people adopt are numerous although not well documented. These may include wanting to cement a new family following divorce or death of one parent, compassion motivated by religious or philosophical conviction, to avoid contributing to overpopulation out of the belief that it is more responsible to care for otherwise parent-less children than to reproduce, to ensure that inheritable diseases (e.g., Tay–Sachs disease) are not passed on, and health concerns relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Although there are a range of reasons, the most recent study of experiences of women who adopt suggests they are most likely to be 40–44 years of age, to be currently married, to have impaired fertility, and to be childless.

Unrelated adoptions may occur through the following mechanisms:
* Private domestic adoptions: under this arrangement, not-for-profit organizations and for-profit organizations act as intermediaries, bringing together prospective adoptive parents with families who want to place a child, all parties being residents of the same country. Alternatively, prospective adoptive parents sometimes avoid intermediaries and connect with women directly, often with a written contract; this is not permitted in some jurisdictions. Private domestic adoption accounts for a significant portion of all adoptions; in the United States, for example, nearly 45% of adoptions are estimated to have been arranged privately.

* Foster care adoption: this is a type of domestic adoption where a child is initially placed in public care. Many times the foster parents take on the adoption when the children become legally free. Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country. Of the 127,500 adoptions in the U.S. in 2000, about 51,000 or 40% were through the foster care system.
* International adoption: this involves the placing of a child for adoption outside that child&#x27;s country of birth. This can occur through public or private agencies. In some countries, such as Sweden, these adoptions account for the majority of cases (see above table). The U.S. example, however, indicates there is wide variation by country since adoptions from abroad account for less than 15% of its cases. More than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted in the United States since 1992, and a similar number of Chinese children were adopted from 1995 to 2005. The laws of different countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Recognizing the difficulties and challenges associated with international adoption, and in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption and exploitation which sometimes accompanies it, the Hague Conference on Private International Law developed the Hague Adoption Convention, which came into force on 1 May 1995 and has been ratified by 105 countries as of February 2024.
* Embryo adoption: based on the donation of embryos remaining after one couple&#x27;s in vitro fertilization treatments have been completed; embryos are given to another individual or couple, followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman&#x27;s uterus, to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. In the United States, embryo adoption is governed by property law rather than by the court systems, in contrast to traditional adoption.
* Common law adoption: this is an adoption that has not been recognized beforehand by the courts, but where a parent, without resorting to any formal legal process, leaves his or her children with a friend or relative for an extended period of time. At the end of a designated term of (voluntary) co-habitation, as witnessed by the public, the adoption is then considered binding, in some courts of law, even though not initially sanctioned by the court. The particular terms of a common-law adoption are defined by each legal jurisdiction. For example, the U.S. state of California recognizes common law relationships after co-habitation of 2 years. The practice is called &quot;private fostering&quot; in Britain.

===Disruption and dissolution===

Although adoption is often described as forming a &quot;forever&quot; family, the relationship can be ended at any time. The legal termination of an adoption is called disruption. In U.S. terminology, adoptions are &quot;disrupted&quot; if they are ended before being finalized, and they are &quot;dissolved&quot; if the relationship is ended afterwards. It may also be called a &quot;failed adoption&quot;. After legal finalization, the disruption process is usually initiated by adoptive parents via a court petition and is analogous to divorce proceedings. It is a legal avenue unique to adoptive parents as disruption/dissolution does not apply to biological kin, although biological family members are sometimes disowned or abandoned.

Ad hoc studies performed in the U.S., however, suggest that between 10 and 25 percent of adoptions through the child welfare system (e.g., excluding babies adopted from other countries or step-parents adopting their stepchildren) disrupt before they are legally finalized and from 1 to 10 percent are dissolved after legal finalization. The wide range of values reflects the paucity of information on the subject and demographic factors such as age; it is known that teenagers are more prone to having their adoptions disrupted than young children.

===Adoption by same-sex couples===
Joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in 34 countries as of March 2022, and additionally in various sub-national territories. Adoption may also be in the form of step-child adoption (6 additional countries), wherein one partner in a same-sex couple adopts the child of the other. Most countries that have same-sex marriage allow joint adoption by those couples, the exceptions being Ecuador (no adoption by same-sex couples), Taiwan (step-child adoption only) and Mexico (in one third of states with same-sex marriage). A few countries with civil unions or lesser marriage rights nonetheless allow step- or joint adoption.In 2019, the ACS enhanced its approach to measuring same-sex couple households, explicitly distinguishing between same-sex and opposite-sex spouses or partners.

Same-sex parents, according to the ACS, were predominantly female. Notably, 22.5% of female same-sex couple households had children under 18, in contrast to 6.6% of male same-sex couple households. In homes with children, neither male nor female same-sex couples were more likely to have biological children, but male same-sex couples were more likely to adopt children and less likely to have stepchildren.

==Parenting of adoptees==

===Parenting===
The biological relationship between a parent and child is important, and the separation of the two has led to concerns about adoption. The traditional view of adoptive parenting received empirical support from a Princeton University study of 6,000 adoptive, step, and foster families in the United States and South Africa from 1968 to 1985; the study indicated that food expenditures in households with mothers of non-biological children (when controlled for income, household size, hours worked, age, etc.) were significantly less for adoptees, step-children, and foster children, causing the researchers to speculate that people are less interested in sustaining the genetic lines of others. This theory is supported in another more qualitative study wherein adoptive relationships marked by sameness in likes, personality, and appearance, were associated with both adult adoptees and adoptive parents reporting being happier with the adoption.

Other studies provide evidence that adoptive relationships can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents, and concludes &quot;...adoptive parents enrich their children&#x27;s lives to compensate for the lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption.&quot; Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because they favor them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help.

Psychologists&#x27; findings regarding the importance of early mother-infant bonding created some concern about whether parents who adopt older infants or toddlers after birth have missed some crucial period for the child&#x27;s development. However, research on The Mental and Social Life of Babies suggested that the &quot;parent-infant system&quot;, rather than a bond between biologically related individuals, is an evolved fit between innate behavior patterns of all human infants and equally evolved responses of human adults to those infant behaviors. Thus nature &quot;ensures some initial flexibility with respect to the particular adults who take on the parental role.&quot;

Beyond the foundational issues, the unique questions posed for adoptive parents are varied. They include how to respond to stereotypes, answering questions about heritage, and how best to maintain connections with biological kin when in an open adoption. One author suggests a common question adoptive parents have is: &quot;Will we love the child even though he/she is not our biological child?&quot; A specific concern for many parents is accommodating an adoptee in the classroom. Familiar lessons like &quot;draw your family tree&quot; or &quot;trace your eye color back through your parents and grandparents to see where your genes come from&quot; could be hurtful to children who were adopted and do not know this biological information. Numerous suggestions have been made to substitute new lessons, e.g., focusing on &quot;family orchards&quot;.

Adopting older children presents other parenting issues. Some children from foster care have histories of maltreatment, such as physical and psychological neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse, and are at risk of developing psychiatric problems. Such children are at risk of developing a disorganized attachment. Studies by Cicchetti et al. (1990, 1995) found that 80% of abused and maltreated infants in their sample exhibited disorganized attachment styles. Disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems, including dissociative symptoms, as well as depressive, anxious, and acting-out symptoms. &quot;Attachment is an active process—it can be secure or insecure, maladaptive or productive.&quot; In the U.K., some adoptions fail because the adoptive parents do not get sufficient support to deal with difficult, traumatized children. This is a false economy as local authority care for these children is extremely expensive.

Concerning developmental milestones, studies from the Colorado Adoption Project examined genetic influences on adoptee maturation, concluding that cognitive abilities of adoptees reflect those of their adoptive parents in early childhood but show little similarity by adolescence, resembling instead those of their biological parents and to the same extent as peers in non-adoptive families.

Similar mechanisms appear to be at work in the physical development of adoptees. Danish and American researchers conducting studies on the genetic contribution to body mass index found correlations between an adoptee&#x27;s weight class and his biological parents&#x27; BMI while finding no relationship with the adoptive family environment. Moreover, about one-half of inter-individual differences were due to individual non-shared influences.

These differences in development appear to play out in the way young adoptees deal with major life events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees have been found to respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.

Recent research has shown that adoptive parenting may have impacts on adoptive children, it has been shown that warm adoptive parenting reduces internalizing and externalizing problems of the adoptive children over time. Another study shows that warm adoptive parenting at 27 months predicted lower levels of child externalizing problems at ages 6 and 7.

===Effects on the original parents===
Several factors affect the decision to release or raise the child. White adolescents tend to give up their babies to non-relatives, whereas black adolescents are more likely to receive support from their own community in raising the child and also in the form of informal adoption by relatives. Studies by Leynes and by Festinger and Young, Berkman, and Rehr found that, for pregnant adolescents, the decision to release the child for adoption depended on the attitude toward adoption held by the adolescent&#x27;s mother. Another study found that pregnant adolescents whose mothers had a higher level of education were more likely to release their babies for adoption. Research suggests that women who choose to release their babies for adoption are more likely to be younger, enrolled in school, and have lived in a two-parent household at age 10, than those who kept and raised their babies.

There is limited research on the consequences of adoption for the original parents, and the findings have been mixed. One study found that those who released their babies for adoption were less comfortable with their decision than those who kept their babies. However, levels of comfort over both groups were high, and those who released their child were similar to those who kept their child in ratings of life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and positive future outlook for schooling, employment, finances, and marriage. Subsequent research found that adolescent mothers who chose to release their babies for adoption were more likely to experience feelings of sorrow and regret over their decision than those who kept their babies. However, these feelings decreased significantly from one year after birth to the end of the second year.

More recent research found that in a sample of mothers who had released their children for adoption four to 12 years prior, every participant had frequent thoughts of their lost child. For most, thoughts were both negative and positive in that they produced both feelings of sadness and joy. Those who experienced the greatest portion of positive thoughts were those who had open, rather than closed or time-limited mediated, adoptions.

In another study that compared mothers who released their children to those who raised them, mothers who released their children were more likely to delay their next pregnancy, to delay marriage, and to complete job training. However, both groups reached lower levels of education than their peers who were never pregnant. Another study found similar consequences for choosing to release a child for adoption. Adolescent mothers who released their children were more likely to reach a higher level of education and to be employed than those who kept their children. They also waited longer before having their next child. Most of the research that exists on adoption effects on the birth parents was conducted with samples of adolescents, or with women who were adolescents when carrying their babies—little data exists for birth parents from other populations. Furthermore, there is a lack of longitudinal data that may elucidate long-term social and psychological consequences for birth parents who choose to place their children for adoption.

==Development of adoptees==
Previous research on adoption has led to assumptions that indicate that there is a heightened risk in terms of psychological development and social relationships for adoptees. Yet, such assumptions have been clarified as flawed due to methodological failures. But more recent studies have been supportive in indicating more accurate information and results about the similarities, differences and overall lifestyles of adoptees. Adoptees are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other people.

Evidence about the development of adoptees can be supported in newer studies. It can be said that adoptees, in some respect, tend to develop differently from the general population. This can be seen in many aspects of life, but usually can be found as a greater risk around the time of adolescence. For example, it has been found that many adoptees experience difficulty in establishing a sense of identity.

===Identity===
There are many ways in which the concept of identity can be defined. It is true in all cases that identity construction is an ongoing process of development, change and maintenance of identifying with the self. Research has shown that adolescence is a time of identity progression rather than regression. One&#x27;s identity tends to lack stability in the beginning years of life but gains a more stable sense in later periods of childhood and adolescence. Typically associated with a time of experimentation, there are endless factors that go into the construction of one&#x27;s identity. As well as being many factors, there are many types of identities one can associate with. Some categories of identity include gender, sexuality, class, racial and religious, etc. For transracial and international adoptees, tension is generally found in the categories of racial, ethnic and national identification. Because of this, the strength and functionality of family relationships play a huge role in its development and outcome of identity construction. Transracial and transnational adoptees tend to develop feelings of a lack of acceptance because of such racial, ethnic, and cultural differences. Therefore, exposing transracial and transnational adoptees to their &quot;cultures of origin&quot; is important in order to better develop a sense of identity and appreciation for cultural diversity. Identity construction and reconstruction for transnational adoptees the instant they are adopted. For example, based upon specific laws and regulations of the United States, the Child Citizen Act of 2000 makes sure to grant immediate U.S. citizenship to adoptees.

Identity is defined both by what one is and what one is not. Adoptees born into one family lose an identity and then borrow one from the adopting family.
The formation of identity is a complicated process and there are many factors that affect its outcome. From a perspective of looking at issues in adoption circumstances, the people involved and affected by adoption (the biological parent, the adoptive parent and the adoptee) can be known as the &quot;triad members and state&quot;.
Adoption may threaten triad members&#x27; sense of identity. Triad members often express feelings related to confused identity and identity crises because of differences between the triad relationships.
Adoption, for some, precludes a complete or integrated sense of self. Triad members may experience themselves as incomplete, deficient, or unfinished. They state that they lack feelings of well-being, integration, or solidity associated with a fully developed identity.

===Influences===

Family plays a vital role in identity formation. This is not only true in childhood but also in adolescence. Identity (gender/sexual/ethnic/religious/family) is still forming during adolescence and family holds a vital key to this.
The research seems to be unanimous; a stable, secure, loving, honest and supportive family in which all members feel safe to explore their identity is necessary for the formation of a sound identity. Transracial and International adoptions are some factors that play a significant role in the identity construction of adoptees. Many tensions arise from relationships built between the adoptee(s) and their family. These include being &quot;different&quot; from the parent(s), developing a positive racial identity, and dealing with racial/ethnic discrimination. It has been found that multicultural and transnational youth tend to identify with their parents origin of culture and ethnicity rather than their residing location, yet it is sometimes hard to balance an identity between the two because school environments tend to lack diversity and acknowledgment regarding such topics. These tensions also tend to create questions for the adoptee, as well as the family, to contemplate. Some common questions include what will happen if the family is more naïve to the ways of socially constructed life? Will tensions arise if this is the case? What if the very people that are supposed to be modeling a sound identity are in fact riddled with insecurities? Ginni Snodgrass answers these questions in the following way.
The secrecy in an adoptive family and the denial that the adoptive family is different builds dysfunction into it. &quot;... social workers and insecure adoptive parents have structured a family relationship that is based on dishonesty, evasions and exploitation. To believe that good relationships will develop on such a foundation is psychologically unsound&quot; (Lawrence). Secrecy erects barriers to forming a healthy identity.

The research says that the dysfunction, untruths and evasiveness that can be present in adoptive families not only makes identity formation impossible, but also directly works against it. What effect on identity formation is present if the adoptee knows they are adopted but has no information about their biological parents? Silverstein and Kaplan&#x27;s research states that adoptees lacking medical, genetic, religious, and historical information are plagued by questions such as &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Why was I born?&quot; &quot;What is my purpose?&quot; This lack of identity may lead adoptees, particularly in adolescent years, to seek out ways to belong in a more extreme fashion than many of their non-adopted peers. Adolescent adoptees are overrepresented among those who join sub-cultures, run away, become pregnant, or totally reject their families.

Concerning developmental milestones, studies from the Colorado Adoption Project examined genetic influences on adoptee maturation, concluding that cognitive abilities of adoptees reflect those of their adoptive parents in early childhood but show little similarity by adolescence, resembling instead those of their biological parents and to the same extent as peers in non-adoptive families.

Similar mechanisms appear to be at work in the physical development of adoptees. Danish and American researchers conducting studies on the genetic contribution to body mass index found correlations between an adoptee&#x27;s weight class and his biological parents&#x27; BMI while finding no relationship with the adoptive family environment. Moreover, about one-half of inter-individual differences were due to individual non-shared influences.

These differences in development appear to play out in the way young adoptees deal with major life events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees have been found to respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.

The adoptee population does, however, seem to be more at risk for certain behavioral issues. Researchers from the University of Minnesota studied adolescents who had been adopted and found that adoptees were twice as likely as non-adopted people to develop oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with an 8% rate in the general population. Suicide risks were also significantly greater than the general population. Swedish researchers found both international and domestic adoptees undertook suicide at much higher rates than non-adopted peers; with international adoptees and female international adoptees, in particular, at highest risk.

Nevertheless, work on adult adoptees has found that the additional risks faced by adoptees are largely confined to adolescence. Young adult adoptees were shown to be alike with adults from biological families and scored better than adults raised in alternative family types including single parent and step-families. Moreover, while adult adoptees showed more variability than their non-adopted peers on a range of psychosocial measures, adult adoptees exhibited more similarities than differences with adults who had not been adopted. There have been many cases of remediation or the reversibility of early trauma. For example, in one of the earliest studies conducted, Professor Goldfarb in England concluded that some children adjust well socially and emotionally despite their negative experiences of institutional deprivation in early childhood. Other researchers also found that prolonged institutionalization does not necessarily lead to emotional problems or character defects in all children. This suggests that there will always be some children who fare well, who are resilient, regardless of their experiences in early childhood. Furthermore, much of the research on psychological outcomes for adoptees draws from clinical populations. This suggests that conclusions such that adoptees are more likely to have behavioral problems such as ODD and ADHD may be biased. Since the proportion of adoptees that seek mental health treatment is small, psychological outcomes for adoptees compared to those for the general population are more similar than some researchers propose.

While adoption studies have shown that by adulthood the personalities of adopted siblings are little or no more similar than random pairs of strangers, the parenting style of adoptive parents may still play a role in the outcome of their adoptive children. Research has suggested that adoptive parents can have impacts on adoptees as well, several recent studies have shown that warm adoptive parenting can reduce behavioral problems of adopted children over time.

=== Mental health ===
Adopted children are more likely to experience psychological and behavioral problems than non-adopted peers. Children who were older than four at the time of their adoption experience more psychological problems than those who were younger.

According to study in the UK, adopted children can have mental health problems that do not improve even four years after their adoption. Children with multiple adverse childhood experiences are more likely to have mental health problems. The study suggests that to identify and treat mental health problems early, care professionals and the adopting parents need detailed biographical information about the child&#x27;s life. Another study in the UK suggests that adopted children are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress (PTS) than the general population. Their PTS symptoms depend on the type of adverse experiences they went through and knowledge of their history offers an option for tailored support.

===Adoptees of LGBT parents===
There is evidence that shows the adoptees of LGBT families and those in heterosexual families have no significant differences in development. One of the main arguments used against same-sex adoption is that a child needs a mother and a father in the home to develop properly. However, a 2013 study of predictors for psychological outcomes of adoptees showed that family type (hetero, gay, lesbian) does not affect the child&#x27;s adjustment; rather the preparedness of the adoptive parent(s), and health of relationship to partner, and other contextual factors predicted later adjustment in early placed adoptees. Along with this, a 2009 study showed again that sexual orientation of parents does not affect externalizing and internalized problems, but family functioning and income can affect adjustment, especially for older adoptees.

===Late discovery adoptees===
Late Discovery Adoption is a term used to describe the situation where an adopted individual first discovers that they are adopted at a later age than is universally considered to be appropriate, often well into adulthood. Adopted individuals who discover their adoption status at a later age are referred to as Late Discovery Adoptees (LDAs). Failure of the adoptive parent(s) to disclose adoption status to a child is an outdated adoption practice that was once fairly common for adoptees born in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Since the 1970s, it has been socially unacceptable to keep the truth from adopted individuals regarding their genetic origins. The discovery of the deception regarding true parentage and that one is, in fact, a Late Discovery Adoptee can add &quot;layers of trauma, loss, betrayal, identity confusion, and disorganization upon learning the truth.&quot;

=== Public perception of adoption ===

In Western culture, many see that the common image of a family being that of a heterosexual couple with biological children. This idea places alternative family forms outside the norm. As a consequence – research indicates – disparaging views of adoptive families exist, along with doubts concerning the strength of their family bonds.

The most recent adoption attitudes survey completed by the Evan Donaldson Institute provides further evidence of this stigma. Nearly one-third of the surveyed population believed adoptees are less-well adjusted, more prone to medical issues, and predisposed to drug and alcohol problems. Additionally, 40–45% thought adoptees were more likely to have behavior problems and trouble at school. In contrast, the same study indicated adoptive parents were viewed favorably, with nearly 90% describing them as &quot;lucky, advantaged, and unselfish&quot;.

The majority of people state that their primary source of information about adoption comes from friends and family and the news media. Nevertheless, most people report the media provides them a favorable view of adoption; 72% indicated receiving positive impressions. There is, however, still substantial criticism of the media&#x27;s adoption coverage. Some adoption blogs, for example, criticized &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; for using outdated orphanage imagery as did advocacy non-profit The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute.

The stigmas associated with adoption are amplified for children in foster care. Negative perceptions result in the belief that such children are so troubled it would be impossible to adopt them and create &quot;normal&quot; families. A 2004 report from the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care has shown that the number of children waiting in foster care doubled since the 1980s and now remains steady at about a half-million a year.&quot;

Attitude toward Adoption Questionnaire (ATAQ): this questionnaire was first developed by Abdollahzadeh, Chaloyi and Mahmoudi(2019). Preliminary Edition: This questionnaire has 23 items based on the Likert scale of 1 (totally Disagree), up to 5 (Totally Agree) being obtained after refining the items designed to construct the present tool and per-study study. The analysis of item and initial psychometric analyses indicate that there are two factors in it. Items 3-10-11-12-14-15-16-17-19-20-21 are reversed and the rest are graded positively. The results of exploratory factor analysis by main components with varimax rotation indicated two components of attitude toward adoption being named respectively cognitive as the aspects of attitude toward adoption and behavioral-emotional aspects of attitude toward adoption. These two components explained 43.25% of the variance of the total sample. Cronbach&#x27;s alpha coefficient was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaire. Cronbach&#x27;s alpha coefficient was 0.709 for the whole questionnaire, 0.71 for the first component, and 0.713 for the second one. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between desired social tendencies and the cognitive aspect of attitude toward adoption as well as the behavioral -emotional aspects of attitude toward adoption (P ≤ 0.01).

==Forced adoption==
Family preservation is the emphasis that, if possible, mothers and children should be kept together. In the U.S., this was clearly illustrated by the shift in policy of the New York Foundling Home, an adoption-institution that is among the country&#x27;s oldest and one that had pioneered sealed records. It established three new principles including &quot;to prevent placements of children...&quot;, reflecting the belief that children would be better served by staying with their biological families, a striking shift in policy that remains in force today. In addition, groups such as Origins USA (founded in 1997) started to actively speak about family preservation and the rights of mothers. The intellectual tone of these reform movements was influenced by the publishing of &quot;The Primal Wound&quot; by Nancy Verrier. &quot;Primal wound&quot; is described as the &quot;devastation which the infant feels because of separation from its birth mother. It is the deep and consequential feeling of abandonment which the baby adoptee feels after the adoption and which may continue for the rest of his life.&quot;

Forced adoption has also been enforced with the rationale of child welfare. The children of unwed or single mothers are commonly the target of such forced adoption. This was prominent during baby scoop era in the 1950s through the 1970s in the anglosphere. The children of parents in poverty have also been targeted for forced adoption under the rational of child welfare. This was often the case for Verdingkinder or &quot;contract children&quot; in Switzerland between the 1850s through the middle of the twentieth century.

===Forced assimilation===

Removing children of ethnic minorities from their families to be adopted by those of the dominant ethnic group has been used as a method of forced assimilation. Forced adoption based on ethnicity occurred during World War II. In German-occupied Poland, it is estimated that 200,000 Polish children with purportedly Aryan traits were removed from their families and given to German or Austrian couples, and only 25,000 returned to their families after the war. The Stolen Generation of Aboriginal people in Australia were affected by similar policies, as were Native Americans in the United States and First Nations of Canada. These practices have become significant social and political issues in recent years, and in many cases the policies have changed. The United States, for example, now has the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, which allows the tribe and family of a Native American child to be involved in adoption decisions, with preference being given to adoption within the child&#x27;s tribe. While forced assimilation usually revolves around ethnicity, assimilating children of political minorities has also occurred. In Spain under Francisco Franco&#x27;s 1939–1975 dictatorship the newborns of some left-wing opponents of the regime, or unmarried or poor couples, were removed from their mothers and adopted. New mothers were frequently told their babies had died suddenly after birth and the hospital had taken care of their burials, when in fact they were given or sold to another family. It is believed that up to 300,000 babies were involved. These system—which allegedly involved doctors, nurses, nuns and priests—outlived Franco&#x27;s death in 1975 and carried on as an illegal baby trafficking network until 1987 when a new law regulating adoption was introduced.

==Commercialized adoption==

Adoption is usually managed by judges, bureaucrats and social workers. Profiting from giving or receiving orphans has incentivized abusive practices.

===Baby farming===

Baby farming is the practice of accepting custody of a child in return for payment. This was most common in Victorian Britain. Illegitimacy and its attendant social stigma were usually the impetus for a mother&#x27;s decision to give her child to a baby farmer. Baby &#x27;farmers&#x27; would sometimes neglect or murder the babies to keep costs down.

===Child harvesting===

Child harvesting is the practice of rearing human children to be sold, typically for adoption. Poor mothers have used street clinics, known as &quot;baby factories&quot;, to deliver babies to be adopted by richer women for payment. While this can be voluntary, baby factories have also coerced or abducted women into such facilities to be raped in order to sell their babies for adoption. Organized rings in Nairobi are known to abduct the children of homeless mothers sleeping on the street. During the One Child Policy in China, when women were only allowed to have one child, local governments would often allow the woman to give birth and then they would take the baby away. Child traffickers, often paid by the government, would sell the children to orphanages that would arrange international adoptions worth tens of thousands of dollars, turning a profit for the government.

==Official records==
Adoption practices have changed significantly over the course of the 20th century, with each new movement labeled, in some way, as reform. Beginning in the 1970s, efforts to improve adoption became associated with opening records and encouraging family preservation. These ideas arose from suggestions that the secrecy inherent in modern adoption may influence the process of forming an identity, create confusion regarding genealogy, and provide little in the way of medical history.

Open records: After a legal adoption in the United States, an adopted person&#x27;s original birth certificate is usually amended and replaced with a new post-adoption birth certificate. The names of any birth parents listed on the original birth certificate are replaced on an amended certificate with the names of the adoptive parents, making it appear that the child was born to the adoptive parents. Beginning in the late 1930s and continuing through the 1970s, state laws allowed for the sealing of original birth certificates after an adoption and, except in Alaska and Kansas, made the original birth certificate unavailable to the adopted person even at the age of majority.

Adopted people have long sought to undo these laws so that they can obtain their own original birth certificates. Movements to unseal original birth certificates and other adoption records for adopted people proliferated in the 1970s along with increased acceptance of illegitimacy. In the United States, Jean Paton founded Orphan Voyage in 1954, and Florence Fisher founded the Adoptees&#x27; Liberty Movement Association (ALMA) in 1971, calling sealed records &quot;an affront to human dignity&quot;. While in 1975, Emma May Vilardi created the first mutual-consent registry, the International Soundex Reunion Registry (ISRR), allowing those separated by adoption to locate one another. and Lee Campbell and other birthmothers established CUB (Concerned United Birthparents). Similar ideas were taking hold globally with grass-roots organizations like Parent Finders in Canada and Jigsaw in Australia. In 1975, England and Wales opened records on moral grounds.

By 1979, representatives of 32 organizations from 33 states, Canada and Mexico gathered in Washington, DC, to establish the American Adoption Congress (AAC) passing a unanimous resolution: &quot;Open Records complete with all identifying information for all members of the adoption triad, birthparents, adoptive parents and adoptee at the adoptee&#x27;s age of majority (18 or 19, depending on state) or earlier if all members of the triad agree.&quot; Later years saw the evolution of more militant organizations such as Bastard Nation (founded in 1996), groups that helped overturn sealed records in Alabama, Delaware, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Maine, and Vermont. A coalition of New York and national adoptee rights activists successfully worked to overturn a restrictive 83-year-old law in 2019, and adult adopted people born in New York, as well as their descendants, today have the right to request and obtain their own original birth certificates. As of 2024, fifteen states in the United States recognize the right of adult adopted people to obtain their own original birth certificates, including Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont. In July, 2024, Minnesota became the 13th state to restore an adopted person&#x27;s right to obtain their original birth certificates, and the 15th state to ensure adopted people have the legal right to obtain their original birth certificate.

==Language of adoption==
Since the 1970s, changes in social attitudes have resulted in examination of the language used in adoption and shifts in language use. Controversies in adoption reform efforts have been reflected in the varying terminology recommended by adoptive parents, birth parents, adoptees, and professionals involved in the adoption process such as social workers. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as &quot;positive adoption language&quot; (PAL, sometimes called &quot;respectful adoption language&quot; or RAL), and &quot;honest adoption language&quot;.

As adoption search and support organizations developed, there were challenges to the language in common use at the time. Books such as &quot;Adoption Triangle&quot; by Sorosky, Pannor and Baran (1978) and newly formed support groups such as CUB (Concerned United Birthparents) argued for a shift in language from &quot;natural parent&quot; to &quot;birthparent.&quot; In 1979, social worker Marietta Spencer wrote &quot;The Terminology of Adoption,&quot; introducing the idea of &quot;positive adoption language&quot; and arguing that &quot;[s]ocial service professionals and adoptive parents should take responsibility for providing informed and sensitive leadership in the use of words.&quot; Terms used in &quot;positive adoption language&quot; and the related &quot;respectful adoption language&quot; include the terms &quot;birth mother&quot; (to replace the terms &quot;natural mother&quot; and &quot;real mother&quot;), and &quot;placing&quot; (to replace the term &quot;surrender&quot;).

In contrast, proponents of &quot;honest adoption language&quot; (HAL) emphasize the value of the family relationships that existed prior to legal adoption and note that mothers who have &quot;voluntarily surrendered&quot; children seldom view it as a choice that was freely made. Proponents of &quot;honest language adoption&quot; argue that the use of the term &quot;birth mother&quot; dehumanize women who have given birth, likening them to an incubator, and does not reflect that mother-child relationships continue after the physical act of giving birth. Terms included in HAL include terms that were used before PAL, including &quot;natural mother&quot; and &quot;surrendered for adoption,&quot; as well as the use of language emphasizing the lifelong status of adoptees, such as &quot;is adopted&quot; instead of &quot;was adopted.&quot;
==Reunion==

Estimates for the extent of search behavior by adoptees have proven elusive; studies show significant variation. In part, the problem stems from the small adoptee population which makes random surveying difficult, if not impossible.

Nevertheless, some indication of the level of search interest by adoptees can be gleaned from the case of England and Wales which opened adoptees&#x27; birth records in 1975. The U.K. Office for National Statistics has projected that 33% of all adoptees would eventually request a copy of their original birth records, exceeding original forecasts made in 1975 when it was believed that only a small fraction of the adoptee population would request their records. The projection is known to underestimate the true search rate, however, since many adoptees of the era get their birth records by other means.

The research literature states adoptees give four reasons for desiring reunion: 1) they wish for a more complete genealogy, 2) they are curious about events leading to their conception, birth, and relinquishment, 3) they hope to pass on information to their children, and 4) they have a need for a detailed biological background, including medical information. It is speculated by adoption researchers, however, that the reasons given are incomplete: although such information could be communicated by a third-party, interviews with adoptees, who sought reunion, found they expressed a need to actually meet biological relations.

It appears the desire for reunion is linked to the adoptee&#x27;s interaction with and acceptance within the community. Internally focused theories suggest some adoptees possess ambiguities in their sense of self, impairing their ability to present a consistent identity. Reunion helps resolve the lack of self-knowledge.

Externally focused theories, in contrast, suggest that reunion is a way for adoptees to overcome social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive the absence of biological ties as distinguishing their adoptive family from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a sense of social exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood tie that reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search as an attempt to resolve experiences of social stigma.

Some adoptees reject the idea of reunion. It is unclear, though, what differentiates adoptees who search from those who do not. One paper summarizes the research, stating, &quot;...attempts to draw distinctions between the searcher and non-searcher are no more conclusive or generalizable than attempts to substantiate ... differences between adoptees and nonadoptees.&quot;

In sum, reunions can bring a variety of issues for adoptees and parents. Nevertheless, most reunion results appear to be positive. In the largest study to date (based on the responses of 1,007 adoptees and relinquishing parents), 90% responded that reunion was a beneficial experience. This does not, however, imply ongoing relationships were formed between adoptee and parent nor that this was the goal.

== Working with an adoption agency ==

An adoption agency is an organization that supports the legal process of placing children with adoptive families. These agencies work to match pregnant women with individuals or couples who wish to adopt. Adoption agencies can be public (run by government agencies) or private (operated by nonprofit or for-profit organizations). Some specialize in domestic adoptions, while others handle international adoptions or focus on specific groups, such as foster children or infants.

Working with a licensed and regulated adoption agency may help to ensure that the adoption process follows legal and ethical guidelines. These agencies are regulated by state or national authorities and must meet specific standards to operate. Working with a licensed adoption agency generally provides structure, support, and legal security, making the adoption journey smoother and more reliable.

==Cultural variations==
Attitudes and laws regarding adoption vary greatly. Whereas all cultures make arrangements whereby children whose birth parents are unavailable to rear them can be brought up by others, not all cultures have the concept of adoption, that is treating unrelated children as equivalent to biological children of the adoptive parents. Under Islamic Law, for example, adopted children must keep their original surname to be identified with blood relations, and, traditionally, women wear a hijab in the presence of males in their adoptive households. In Egypt, these cultural distinctions have led to making adoption illegal opting instead for a system of foster care.

===Homecoming Day===
In some countries, such as the United States, &quot;Homecoming Day&quot; is the day when an adoptee is officially united with their new adoptive family.
