<text>In chemistry and manufacturing, electrolysis is a technique that uses direct electric current (DC) to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the separation of elements from naturally occurring sources such as ores using an electrolytic cell. The voltage that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the decomposition potential. The word &quot;lysis&quot; means to separate or break, so in terms, electrolysis would mean &quot;breakdown via electricity.&quot;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;electrolysis&quot; was introduced by Michael Faraday in 1834, using the Greek words &quot;amber&quot;, which since the 17th century was associated with electrical phenomena, and &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;dissolution&quot;. Nevertheless, electrolysis, as a tool to study chemical reactions and obtain pure elements, precedes the coinage of the term and formal description by Faraday.

==History==
In the early nineteenth century, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle sought to further Volta&#x27;s experiments. They attached two wires to either side of a voltaic pile and placed the other ends in a tube filled with water. They noticed when the wires were brought together that each wire produced bubbles. One type was hydrogen, the other was oxygen.

In 1785 a Dutch scientist named Martin van Marum created an electrostatic generator that he used to reduce tin, zinc and antimony from their salts using a process later known as electrolysis. Though he unknowingly produced electrolysis, it was not until 1800 when William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle discovered how electrolysis works.

In 1791 Luigi Galvani experimented with frog legs. He claimed that placing animal muscle between two dissimilar metal sheets resulted in electricity. Responding to these claims, Alessandro Volta conducted his own tests. This would give insight to Humphry Davy&#x27;s ideas on electrolysis. During preliminary experiments, Humphry Davy hypothesized that when two elements combine to form a compound, electrical energy is released. Humphry Davy would go on to create Decomposition Tables from his preliminary experiments on Electrolysis. The Decomposition Tables would give insight on the energies needed to break apart certain compounds.

In 1817 Johan August Arfwedson determined there was another element, lithium, in some of his samples; however, he could not isolate the component. It was not until 1821 that William Thomas Brande used electrolysis to single it out. Two years later, he streamlined the process using lithium chloride and potassium chloride with electrolysis to produce lithium and lithium hydroxide.

During the later years of Humphry Davy&#x27;s research, Michael Faraday became his assistant. While studying the process of electrolysis under Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday discovered two laws of electrolysis.

During the time of Maxwell and Faraday, concerns came about for electropositive and electronegative activities.

In November 1875, Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered gallium using electrolysis of gallium hydroxide, producing 3.4 mg of gallium. The following December, he presented his discovery of gallium to the Académie des sciences in Paris.

On June 26, 1886, Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan finally felt comfortable performing electrolysis on anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to create a gaseous fluorine pure element. Before he used hydrogen fluoride, Henri Moissan used fluoride salts with electrolysis. Thus on June 28, 1886, he performed his experiment in front of the Académie des sciences to show his discovery of the new element fluorine. While trying to find elemental fluorine through electrolysis of fluoride salts, many chemists perished including Paulin Louyet and Jérôme Nicklès.

In 1886 Charles Martin Hall from America and Paul Héroult from France both filed for American patents for the electrolysis of aluminum, with Héroult submitting his in May, and Hall, in July. Hall was able to get his patent by proving through letters to his brother and family evidence that his method was discovered before the French patent was submitted. This became known as the Hall–Héroult process which benefited many industries because aluminum&#x27;s price then dropped from four dollars to thirty cents per pound.

In 1902 Polish engineer and inventor Stanisław Łaszczyński filed for and obtained Polish patent for the electrolysis of copper and zinc.

==Overview==
Electrolysis is the passing of a direct electric current through an electrolyte which is producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and decomposition of the materials.

The main components required to achieve electrolysis are an electrolyte, electrodes, and an external power source. A partition (e.g. an ion-exchange membrane or a salt bridge) is optional to keep the products from diffusing to the vicinity of the opposite electrode.

The electrolyte is a chemical substance which contains free ions and carries electric current (e.g. an ion-conducting polymer, solution, or a ionic liquid compound). If the ions are not mobile, as in most solid salts, then electrolysis cannot occur. A liquid electrolyte is produced by:
* Solvation or reaction of an ionic compound with a solvent (such as water) to produce mobile ions
* An ionic compound melted by heating

The electrodes are immersed separated by a distance such that a current flows between them through the electrolyte and are connected to the power source which completes the electrical circuit. A direct current supplied by the power source drives the reaction causing ions in the electrolyte to be attracted toward the respective oppositely charged electrode.

Electrodes of metal, graphite and semiconductor material are widely used. Choice of suitable electrode depends on chemical reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte and manufacturing cost. Historically, when non-reactive anodes were desired for electrolysis, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday&#x27;s time) or platinum were chosen. They were found to be some of the least reactive materials for anodes. Platinum erodes very slowly compared to other materials, and graphite crumbles and can produce carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions but otherwise does not participate in the reaction. Cathodes may be made of the same material, or they may be made from a more reactive one since anode wear is greater due to oxidation at the anode.

===Process of electrolysis===
The key process of electrolysis is the interchange of atoms and ions by the removal or addition of electrons due to the applied potential. The desired products of electrolysis are often in a different physical state from the electrolyte and can be removed by mechanical processes (e.g. by collecting gas above an electrode or precipitating a product out of the electrolyte).

The quantity of the products is proportional to the current, and when two or more electrolytic cells are connected in series to the same power source, the products produced in the cells are proportional to their equivalent weight. These are known as Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis.

Each electrode attracts ions that are of the opposite charge. Positively charged ions (cations) move towards the electron-providing (negative) cathode. Negatively charged ions (anions) move towards the electron-extracting (positive) anode. In this process electrons are effectively introduced at the cathode as a reactant and removed at the anode as a product. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called oxidation, while electron gain is called reduction.

When neutral atoms or molecules, such as those on the surface of an electrode, gain or lose electrons they become ions and may dissolve in the electrolyte and react with other ions.

When ions gain or lose electrons and become neutral, they will form compounds that separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu2+ deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are electroplating, electrowinning, and electrorefining.

When an ion gains or loses electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process.

For example, the electrolysis of brine produces hydrogen and chlorine gases which bubble from the electrolyte and are collected. The initial overall reaction is thus:

:2 NaCl + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2 + Cl2

The reaction at the anode results in chlorine gas from chlorine ions:
:2 Cl− → Cl2 + 2 e−

The reaction at the cathode results in hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions:
:2 H2O + 2 e− → H2 + 2 OH−

Without a partition between the electrodes, the OH− ions produced at the cathode are free to diffuse throughout the electrolyte to the anode. As the electrolyte becomes more basic due to the production of OH−, less Cl2 emerges from the solution as it begins to react with the hydroxide producing hypochlorite (ClO−) at the anode:

:Cl2 + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O

The more opportunity the Cl2 has to interact with NaOH in the solution, the less Cl2 emerges at the surface of the solution and the faster the production of hypochlorite progresses. This depends on factors such as solution temperature, the amount of time the Cl2 molecule is in contact with the solution, and concentration of NaOH.

Likewise, as hypochlorite increases in concentration, chlorates are produced from them:

: 3 NaClO → NaClO3 + 2 NaCl

Other reactions occur, such as the self-ionization of water and the decomposition of hypochlorite at the cathode, the rate of the latter depends on factors such as diffusion and the surface area of the cathode in contact with the electrolyte.

===Decomposition potential===
Decomposition potential or decomposition voltage refers to the minimum voltage (difference in electrode potential) between anode and cathode of an electrolytic cell that is needed for electrolysis to occur.

The voltage at which electrolysis is thermodynamically preferred is the difference of the electrode potentials as calculated using the Nernst equation. Applying additional voltage, referred to as overpotential, can increase the rate of reaction and is often needed above the thermodynamic value. It is especially necessary for electrolysis reactions involving gases, such as oxygen, hydrogen or chlorine.

===Oxidation and reduction at the electrodes===
Oxidation of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the anode. For example, it is possible to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions at the anode:
: Fe(aq) → Fe(aq) + e− 
Reduction of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the cathode. It is possible to reduce ferricyanide ions to ferrocyanide ions at the cathode:
:Fe(CN) + e− → Fe(CN)

Neutral molecules can also react at either of the electrodes. For example: &quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone at the cathode:

: + 2 e− + 2 H+ → 

In the last example, H+ ions (hydrogen ions) also take part in the reaction and are provided by the acid in the solution, or by the solvent itself (water, methanol, etc.). Electrolysis reactions involving H+ ions are fairly common in acidic solutions. In aqueous alkaline solutions, reactions involving OH− (hydroxide ions) are common.

Sometimes the solvents themselves (usually water) are oxidized or reduced at the electrodes. It is even possible to have electrolysis involving gases, e.g. by using a gas diffusion electrode.

===Energy changes during electrolysis===
The amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (in theory) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum thermodynamic efficiency equals the enthalpy change divided by the free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released in the form of heat. In some cases, for instance, in the electrolysis of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true and heat energy is absorbed. This heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the heating value of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input.

===Variations===
Pulsating current results in products different from DC. For example, pulsing increases the ratio of ozone to oxygen produced at the anode in the electrolysis of an aqueous acidic solution such as dilute sulphuric acid. Electrolysis of ethanol with pulsed current evolves an aldehyde instead of primarily an acid.

===Related processes===
Galvanic cells and batteries use spontaneous, energy-releasing redox reactions to generate an electrical potential that provides useful power. When a secondary battery is charged, its redox reaction is run in reverse and the system can be considered as an electrolytic cell.

==Industrial uses==
=== Chloralkali process ===
The chloralkali process is a large scale application of electrolysis. This technology supplies most of the chlorine and sodium hydroxide required by many industries. The cathode is a mixed metal oxide clad titanium anode (also called a dimensionally stable anode).
=== Electrofluorination ===
Many organofluorine compounds are produced by electrofluorination. One manifestation of this technology is the Simons process, which can be described as:
:R3C–H + HF → R3C–F + H2
In the course of a typical synthesis, this reaction occurs once for each C–H bond in the precursor. The cell potential is maintained near 5–6 V. The anode, the electrocatalyst, is nickel-plated.

===Hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile===
Acrylonitrile is converted to adiponitrile on an industrial scale via electrocatalysis.

===Electroplating and electrowinning processes===

* Purifying copper from refined copper.
* Electrometallurgy of aluminium, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium.

Electroplating, where a thin film of metal is deposited over a substrate material. Electroplating is used in many industries for either functional or decorative purposes, as in-vehicle bodies and nickel coins.

===Electrochemical machining (ECM)===
In Electrochemical machining, an electrolytic cathode is used as a shaped tool for removing material by anodic oxidation from a workpiece. ECM is often used as a technique for deburring or for etching metal surfaces like tools or knives with a permanent mark or logo.

===Other===
* Production of sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate.
* Production of fuels such as hydrogen for spacecraft, nuclear submarines and vehicles.
* Rust removal and cleaning of old coins and other metallic objects.

==Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis==
Using a cell containing inert platinum electrodes, electrolysis of aqueous solutions of some salts leads to the reduction of the cations (such as metal deposition with, for example, zinc salts) and oxidation of the anions (such as the evolution of bromine with bromides). However, with salts of some metals (such as sodium) hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, and for salts containing some anions (such as sulfate ) oxygen is evolved at the anode. In both cases, this is due to water being reduced to form hydrogen or oxidized to form oxygen.
In principle, the voltage required to electrolyze a salt solution can be derived from the standard electrode potential for the reactions at the anode and cathode. The standard electrode potential is directly related to the Gibbs free energy, Δ&quot;G&quot;, for the reactions at each electrode and refers to an electrode with no current flowing. An extract from the table of standard electrode potentials is shown below.
In terms of electrolysis, this table should be interpreted as follows:

* Moving &quot;down&quot; the table, &quot;E&quot;° becomes more positive, and species on the &quot;left&quot; are more likely to be &quot;reduced&quot;: for example, zinc ions are more likely to be reduced to zinc metal than sodium ions are to be reduced to sodium metal.
* Moving &quot;up&quot; the table, &quot;E&quot;° becomes more negative, and species on the &quot;right&quot; are more likely to be &quot;oxidized&quot;: for example, sodium metal is more likely to be oxidized to sodium ions than zinc metal is to be oxidized to zinc ions.

Using the Nernst equation the electrode potential can be calculated for a specific concentration of ions, temperature and the number of electrons involved. For pure water (pH 7):
* the electrode potential for the reduction producing hydrogen is −0.41 V,
* the electrode potential for the oxidation producing oxygen is +0.82 V.
Comparable figures calculated in a similar way, for 1 M zinc bromide, ZnBr2, are −0.76 V for the reduction to Zn metal and +1.10 V for the oxidation producing bromine.
The conclusion from these figures is that hydrogen should be produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode from the electrolysis of water—which is at variance with the experimental observation that zinc metal is deposited and bromine is produced.
The explanation is that these calculated potentials only indicate the thermodynamically preferred reaction. In practice, many other factors have to be taken into account such as the kinetics of some of the reaction steps involved. These factors together mean that a higher potential is required for the reduction and oxidation of water than predicted, and these are termed overpotentials. Experimentally it is known that overpotentials depend on the design of the cell and the nature of the electrodes.

For the electrolysis of a neutral (pH 7) sodium chloride solution, the reduction of sodium ion is thermodynamically very difficult and water is reduced evolving hydrogen leaving hydroxide ions in solution. At the anode the oxidation of chlorine is observed rather than the oxidation of water since the overpotential for the oxidation of chloride to chlorine is lower than the overpotential for the oxidation of water to oxygen. The hydroxide ions and dissolved chlorine gas react further to form hypochlorous acid. The aqueous solutions resulting from this process is called electrolyzed water and is used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.

==Research trends==
===Electrolysis of carbon dioxide===

The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 can produce value-added chemicals such as methane, ethylene, ethanol, etc. The electrolysis of carbon dioxide gives formate or carbon monoxide, but sometimes more elaborate organic compounds such as ethylene. This technology is under research as a carbon-neutral route to organic compounds.

===Electrolysis of acidified water===

Electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen in a ratio of 2 to 1 respectively.
:2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2 &quot;E&quot;° = +1.229 V

The energy efficiency of water electrolysis varies widely. The efficiency of an electrolyser is a measure of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144 MJ/kg (40 kWh/kg). Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology. In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers (50 kWh/kg); however, higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated in 2006 that 1 kg of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to 3 kg, or 4 liters, of petroleum in energy terms) could be produced by wind powered electrolysis for between US$5.55 in the near term and US$2.27 in the longer term.

About 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite. Hydrogen is used for the creation of ammonia for fertilizer via the Haber process, and converting heavy petroleum sources to lighter fractions via hydrocracking. Onsite electrolysis has been utilized to capture hydrogen for hydrogen fuel-cells in hydrogen vehicles.

===Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis===

Recently, to reduce the energy input, the utilization of carbon (coal), alcohols (hydrocarbon solution), and organic solution (glycerol, formic acid, ethylene glycol, etc.) with co-electrolysis of water has been proposed as a viable option. The carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (so-called CAWE) process for hydrogen generation would perform this operation in a single electrochemical reactor. This system energy balance can be required only around 40% electric input with 60% coming from the chemical energy of carbon or hydrocarbon. This process utilizes solid coal/carbon particles or powder as fuels dispersed in acid/alkaline electrolyte in the form of slurry and the carbon contained source co-assist in the electrolysis process as following theoretical overall reactions:

:Carbon/Coal slurry (C + 2H2O) → CO2 + 2H2 &quot;E&quot;′ = 0.21 V (reversible voltage) / &quot;E&quot;′ = 0.46 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

or

:Carbon/Coal slurry (C + H2O) → CO + H2 &quot;E&quot;′ = 0.52 V (reversible voltage) / &quot;E&quot;′ = 0.91 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

Thus, this CAWE approach is that the actual cell overpotential can be significantly reduced to below 1.0 V as compared to 1.5 V for conventional water electrolysis.

===Electrocrystallization===
A specialized application of electrolysis involves the growth of conductive crystals on one of the electrodes from oxidized or reduced species that are generated in situ. The technique has been used to obtain single crystals of low-dimensional electrical conductors, such as charge-transfer salts and linear chain compounds.

=== Electrolysis of Iron Ore ===
The current method of producing steel from iron ore is very carbon intensive, in part to the direct release of CO2 in the blast furnace. A study of steel making in Germany found that producing 1 ton of steel emitted 2.1 tons of CO2e with 22% of that being direct emissions from the blast furnace. As of 2022, steel production contributes 7–9% of global emissions. Electrolysis of iron can eliminate direct emissions and further reduce emissions if the electricity is created from green energy.

The small-scale electrolysis of iron has been successfully reported by dissolving it in molten oxide salts and using a platinum anode. Oxygen anions form oxygen gas and electrons at the anode. Iron cations consume electrons and form iron metal at the cathode. This method was performed a temperature of 1550 °C which presents a significant challenge to maintaining the reaction. Particularly, anode corrosion is a concern at these temperatures.

Additionally, the low temperature reduction of iron oxide by dissolving it in alkaline water has been reported. The temperature is much lower than traditional iron production at 114 °C. The low temperatures also tend to correlate with higher current efficiencies, with an efficiency of 95% being reported. While these methods are promising, they struggle to be cost competitive because of the large economies of scale keeping the price of blast furnace iron low.

=== Electrolysis of seawater ===
A 2020 study investigated direct electrolysis of seawater, alkaline electrolysis, proton-exchange membrane electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis. Direct electrolysis of seawater follows known processes, forming an electrolysis cell in which the seawater acts as the electrolyte to allow for the reaction at the anode, and the reaction at the cathode, . The inclusion of magnesium and calcium ions in the seawater makes the production of alkali hydroxides possible that could form scales in the electrolyser cell, cutting down on lifespan and increasing the need for maintenance. The alkaline electrolysers operate with the following reactions at the anode, and cathode, , and use high base solutions as electrolytes, operating at and need additional separators to ensure the gas phase hydrogen and oxygen remain separate. The electrolyte can easily get contaminated, but the alkaline electrolyser can operate under pressure to improve energy consumption. The electrodes can be made of inexpensive materials and there&#x27;s no requirement for an expensive catalyst in the design. Proton-exchange membrane electrolysers operate with the reactions at the anode, and cathode, , at temperatures of , using a solid polymer electrolyte and requiring higher costs of processing to allow the solid electrolyte to touch uniformly to the electrodes. Similar to the alkaline electrolyser, the proton exchange membrane electrolyser can operate at higher pressures, reducing the energy costs required to compress the hydrogen gas afterward, but the proton exchange membrane electrolyser also benefits from rapid response times to changes in power requirements or demands and not needing maintenance, at the cost of having a faster inherent degradation rate and being the most vulnerable to impurities in the water. Solid oxide electrolysers run the reactions at the anode and at the cathode. The solid oxide electrolysers require high temperatures () to operate, generating superheated steam. They suffer from degradation when turned off, making it a more inflexible hydrogen generation technology. In a selected series of multiple-criteria decision-analysis comparisons in which the highest priority was placed on economic operation costs followed equally by environmental and social criteria, it was found that the proton exchange membrane electrolyser offered the most suitable combination of values (e.g., investment cost, maintenance, and operation cost, resistance to impurities, specific energy for hydrogen production at sea, risk of environmental impact, etc.), followed by the alkaline electrolyser, with the alkaline electrolyser being the most economically feasible, but more hazardous in terms of safety and environmental concerns due to the need for basic electrolyte solutions as opposed to the solid polymers used in proton-exchange membranes. Due to the methods conducted in multiple-criteria decision analysis, non-objective weights are applied to the various factors, and so multiple methods of decision analysis were performed simultaneously to examine the electrolysers in a way that minimizes the effects of bias on the performance conclusions.

<text>Epirus () is a geographical and historical region in southeastern Europe, now shared between Greece and Albania. It lies between the Pindus Mountains and the Ionian Sea, stretching from the Bay of Vlorë and the Acroceraunian Mountains in the north to the Ambracian Gulf and the ruined Roman city of Nicopolis in the south. It is currently divided between the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece and the counties of Gjirokastër and Vlorë in southern Albania. The largest city in Epirus is Ioannina, seat of the Greek region of Epirus, with Gjirokastër the largest city in the Albanian part of Epirus.

A rugged and mountainous region, Epirus was the north-west area of ancient Greece. It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians. It was home to the sanctuary of Dodona, the oldest oracle in ancient Greece, and the second most prestigious after Delphi. Unified into a single state in 370 BC by the Aeacidae dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of Pyrrhus of Epirus who fought the Roman Republic in a series of campaigns. Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Republic along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire.

Following the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade (1204), Epirus became the center of the Despotate of Epirus, one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. In the 14th century, Epirus was brought under the rule of the restored Byzantine Empire, before being briefly conquered by the Serbian Empire. The region was then divided amongst a number of despotates and political entities, including the Despotate of Epirus, the Despotate of Arta, the Zenebishi family, and the Republic of Venice, before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. Epirus became part of the semi-independent Pashalik governed by the Ottoman Albanian ruler Ali Pasha in the early 19th century, but the Sublime Porte re-asserted its control in 1821. Following the Balkan Wars and World War I, southern Epirus became part of Greece, while northern Epirus became part of Albania.

==Name and etymology==

The name &quot;Epirus&quot; is derived from the (), meaning &quot;mainland&quot; or &quot;&quot;. It is thought to come from an Indo-European root &quot;*apero-&quot; &#x27;coast&#x27;, and was applied to the mainland of north-west Greece opposite Corfu and the Ionian islands. The local name was struck on the coinage of the unified Epirote commonwealth: &quot;ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ&quot; (, , i.e. &quot;of the Epirotes&quot;, see adjacent image). The Albanian name for the region, which derives from the Greek, is . Similarly, the Aromanian name for Epirus, which is also Greek-derived, is .

==Boundaries and definitions==
Historically, the geographical area of Epirus proper is defined within the lines drawn from Cape Gjuhëz of the Ceraunian Mountains in the north-west, to Mount Qelqëz in the north-east, to Mount Gavrovo in the south-east, to the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf in the south-west. The northern boundary of ancient Epirus is alternatively given as the Vjosa river. Epirus&#x27;s eastern boundary is defined by the Pindus Mountains, that form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. To the west, Epirus faces the Ionian Sea. The island of Corfu is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.

The definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The region of Epirus in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, the counties of Gjirokastër, Vlorë, and Berat extend well beyond the northern and northeastern boundaries of classical Epirus.

==Geography and ecology==

Epirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region. It is largely made up of the Pindus Mountains, a series of parallel limestone ridges that are a continuation of the Dinaric Alps. The Pindus mountains form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly to the east. The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture. Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2,637 m at Mount Smolikas, the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include Tymfi (2,496 m at Mount Gamila), Lygkos (2,249 m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, Gramos (2,523 m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2,356 m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1,976 m) in the southwest, Mitsikeli near Ioannina (1,810 m), Mourgana (1,806 m), and Nemercke/Aeoropos (2,485 m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the Ceraunian Mountains (2,000 m) near Himara in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.

Significant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near Arta and Preveza, in the Acheron plain between Paramythia and Fanari, between Igoumenitsa and Sagiada, and also near Saranda. The Zagori area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.

The main river flowing through Epirus is the Vjosë, which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the Bay of Vlorë in Albania. Other important rivers include the Acheron river, famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the Necromanteion, the Arachthos river, crossed by the historic Bridge of Arta, the Louros, the Thyamis or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjosë flowing through the Vikos Gorge. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the Vikos–Aoös National Park, known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is Lake Pamvotis, on whose shores lies the city of Ioannina, the region&#x27;s largest and traditionally most important city.

The climate of Epirus is Mediterranean along the coast and Alpine in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as bears, wolves, foxes, deer, and lynxes.

==History==
===Early history===
In the Neolithic period Epirus was populated by seafarers along the coast and by shepherds and hunters from the southwestern Balkans who brought with them the Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large mounds containing shaft graves. Similar burial chambers were subsequently used by the Mycenaean civilization, suggesting that the founders of Mycenae may have come from Epirus and central Albania. Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenaean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer’s Odyssey, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona, to whom Achilles prayed in the Iliad.

In the Middle Bronze Age, Epirus was inhabited by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle in the rest of Greece. Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated. According to Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev, Epirus was part of the Proto-Greek linguistic area during the Late Neolithic period. By the early 1st millennium BC, all fourteen Epirote tribes including the Chaonians in northwestern Epirus, the Molossians in the centre and the Thesprotians in the south, were speakers of a strong west Greek dialect.

===Epirus in the Classical and Hellenistic periods===


Geographically on the edge of the Greek world, Epirus remained for the most part outside the limelight of Greek history until relatively late, much like the neighbouring Greek regions of Macedonia, Aetolia, and Acarnania, with which Epirus had political, cultural, linguistic and economic connections. Unlike most other Greeks of this time, who lived in or around city-states, the inhabitants of Epirus lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of the poleis of southern Greece. Their region lay on the periphery of the Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples to the north. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona – regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.

The Epirotes, speakers of a Northwest Greek dialect, different from the Doric of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy, seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some classical writers. The 5th-century BC Athenian historian Thucydides describes them as &quot;barbarians&quot; in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, as does Strabo in his &quot;Geography&quot;, although the latter clearly distinguishes them from the neighboring Illyrians. Other writers, such as Herodotus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pausanias, and Eutropius, describe them as Greeks. Similarly, Epirote tribes/states are included in the Argive and Epidaurian lists of the Greek Thearodokoi (hosts of sacred envoys). Plutarch mentions an interesting element of Epirote folklore regarding Achilles: In his biography of King Pyrrhus, he claims that Achilles &quot;had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos&quot; (meaning &quot;unspeakable&quot;, &quot;unspeakably great&quot;, in Homeric Greek).

Beginning in 370 BC, the Molossian Aeacidae dynasty built a centralized state in Epirus and began expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes. The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of Macedon, in part against the common threat of Illyrian raids, and in 359 BC the Molossian princess Olympias, niece of Arybbas of Epirus, married King Philip II of Macedon. She was to become the mother of Alexander the Great.

On the death of Arybbas, Alexander of Epirus succeeded to the throne and the title King of Epirus in 334 BC. He invaded Italy, but was killed in battle by a Lucanian in the Battle of Pandosia against several Italic tribes 331 BC. Aeacides of Epirus, who succeeded Alexander, espoused the cause of Olympias against Cassander, but was dethroned in 313 BC. His son Pyrrhus came to throne in 295 BC, and for six years fought against the Romans and Carthaginians in southern Italy and Sicily. The high cost of his victories against the Romans gave Epirus a new, but brief, importance, as well as a lasting contribution to the Greek language with the concept of a &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;. Pyrrhus nonetheless brought great prosperity to Epirus, building the great theater of Dodona and a new suburb at Ambracia (now modern Arta), which he made his capital.

The Aeacid dynasty ended in 232 BC, but Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament, or &quot;synedrion&quot;. However, it was faced with the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars against Macedon. The League steered an uneasy neutral course in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome. The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved.

===Roman and Byzantine rule===
====Epirus as a Roman province====

The region of Epirus was placed under the senatorial province of Achaea in 27 BC, with the exception of its northernmost part, which remained part of the province of Macedonia. Under Emperor Trajan, sometime between 103 and 114 AD, Epirus became a separate province, under a &quot;procurator Augusti&quot;. The new province extended from the Gulf of Aulon (Vlorë) and the Acroceraunian Mountains in the north to the lower course of the Acheloos River in the south, and included the northern Ionian Islands of Corfu, Lefkada, Ithaca, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos.

====Late Antiquity====

Probably during the provincial reorganization by Diocletian (r. 284–305), the western portion of the province of Macedonia along the Adriatic coast was split off into the province of New Epirus (). Although this territory was not traditionally part of Epirus proper as defined by the ancient geographers, and was historically inhabited by Illyrian tribes and Greeks, the name reflects the fact that under Roman rule, the area had been subject to increasing Hellenization and settlement by Epirote tribes from the south.

The two Epirote provinces became part of the Diocese of Moesia, until it was divided in ca. 369 into the dioceses of Macedonia and Dacia, when they became part of the former. In the 4th century, Epirus was still a stronghold of paganism, and was aided by Emperor Julian (r. 361–363) and his praetorian prefect Claudius Mamertinus through reduction in taxes and the rebuilding of the provincial capital, Nicopolis. According to Jordanes, in 380 the Visigoths raided the area. With the division of the Empire on the death of Theodosius I in 395, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. In 395–397, the Visigoths under Alaric plundered Greece. They remained in Epirus for a few years, until 401, and again in 406–407, during Alaric&#x27;s alliance with the Western Roman generalissimo Stilicho in order to wrest the Eastern Illyricum from the Eastern Empire.
The &quot;Synecdemus&quot; of Hierocles, composed in ca. 527/8 AD but probably reflecting the situation in the first half of the 5th century, reports 11 cities for Old Epirus (, ): the capital Nicopolis, Dodona, Euroea, Hadrianopolis, Appon, Phoenice, Anchiasmos, Buthrotum, Photike, Corfu Island, and Ithaca Island. New Epirus, with capital at Dyrrhachium, comprised 9 cities. From 467 on, the Ionian Islands and the coasts of Epirus became subject to raids by the Vandals, who had taken over the North African provinces and established their own kingdom centred on Carthage. The Vandals notably seized Nicopolis in 474 as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with Emperor Zeno, and plundered Zakynthos, killing many of its inhabitants and ferrying off others into slavery. Epirus Nova became a battleground in the rebellions of the Ostrogoths after 479. In 517, a raid of the Getae or Antae reached Greece, including Epirus Vetus. The claim of Procopius of Caesarea in his &quot;Secret History&quot;, that under Justinian I (r. 527–565) the entirety of the Balkan provinces was raided by barbarians every year, is considered rhetorical hyperbole by modern scholars; only a single Slavic raid to the environs of Dyrrhachium, in 548/9, has been documented. Procopius further reports that in 551, in an attempt to interdict the Byzantines&#x27; lines of communication with Italy during the Gothic War, the Ostrogoth king Totila sent his fleet to raid the shores of Epirus. In response to these raids, and to repair the damage done by two destructive earthquakes in 522, Justinian initiated a wide-ranging programme of reconstruction and re-fortification: Hadrianopolis was rebuilt, albeit in reduced extent, and renamed Justinianopolis, while Euroea was moved further inland (traditionally identified with the founding of Ioannina), while Procopius claims that no less than 36 smaller fortresses in Epirus Vetus—most of them not identifiable today—were either rebuilt or built anew.

====Epirus from the Slavic invasions until 1204====
In the late 6th century, much of Greece, including Epirus, fell under the control of the Avars and their Slavic allies. This is placed by the &quot;Chronicle of Monemvasia&quot; in the year 587, and is further corroborated by evidence that several sees were abandoned by their bishops by 591. Thus in the bishop, clergy and people of Euroea fled their city, carrying with them the relics of their patron saint, St. Donatus, to Cassiope in Corfu.

Of the various Slavic tribes, only the Baiounitai, first attested , are known by name, giving their name to their region of settlement: &quot;Vagenetia&quot;. Based on the density of the Slavic toponyms in Epirus, the Slavs must have settled in the region, although the extent of this settlement is unclear. Slavic toponyms occur mainly in the mountainous areas of the interior and the coasts of the Gulf of Corinth, indicative of the fact that this was the avenue used by most of the Slavs who crossed the Gulf into the Peloponnese. With the exception of some few toponyms on Corfu, the Ionian Islands seem to not have been affected by Slavic settlement. The linguistic analysis of the toponyms reveals that they date mostly to the early wave of Slavic settlement at the turn of the 6th/7th centuries. Due to scarcity of textual evidence, it is unclear how much the area was affected by the second wave of Slavic migration, which began in the middle of the 8th century due to Bulgar pressure in the northern Balkans. Slavic toponyms are nearly lacking in the mountains of Labëria (on the Kurvelesh plateau), in the Ionian coast where today Lab Albanian villages neighbour with the Greek-speaking ones, therefore it can be assumed that the expansion of the Slavs had not reach this region.

As in eastern Greece, the restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm Imperial control in , when Philippicus Bardanes was banished there. The gradual restoration of Imperial rule is evidenced further from the participation of local bishops in councils in Constantinople: whereas only the bishop of Dyrrhachium participated in the Ecumenical Councils of 680/1 and 692, a century later the bishops of Dyrrhachium, Nicopolis, Corfu, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos are attested in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In about the middle of the 8th century, the Theme of Cephallenia was established, but at least initially it was more oriented towards restoring Byzantine control over the Ionian and Adriatic seas, combating Saracen piracy, and securing communications with the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy, rather than any systematic effort at subduing the Epirote mainland. Nevertheless, following the onset of the Muslim conquest of Sicily in 827, the Ionian became particularly exposed to Arab raids.
The 9th century saw great progress in the restoration of Imperial control in the mainland, as evidenced by the participation of the bishops of Ioannina, Naupaktos, Hadrianopolis, and Vagenetia (evidently by now organized as a &quot;Sklavinia&quot; under imperial rule) in the Ecumenical Councils of 869/70 and 879/80. The Byzantine recovery resulted in an influx of Greeks from southern Italy and Asia Minor into the Greek interior, while remaining Slavs were Christianized and Hellenized. The eventual success of the Hellenization campaign also suggests a continuity of the original Greek population, and that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north, in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century. Following the great naval victory of admiral Nasar in 880, and the beginning of the Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy in the 880s, the security situation improved and the Theme of Nicopolis was established, most likely after 886. As the ancient capital of Epirus had been laid waste by the Slavs, the capital of the new theme became Naupaktos further south. The extent of the new province is unclear, but probably matched the extent of the Metropolis of Naupaktos, established at about the same time, encompassing the sees of Vonditsa, Aetos, Acheloos, Rogoi, Ioannina, Hadrianopolis, Photike, and Buthrotum. Vagenetia notably no longer appears as a bishopric. As the authors of the &quot;Tabula Imperii Byzantini&quot; comment, it appears that &quot;the Byzantine administration had brought the strongly Slavic-settled areas in the mainland somewhat under its control, and a certain Re-Hellenization had set in&quot;. Further north, the region around Dyrrhachium existed as the homonymous theme possibly as early as the 9th century.

During the early 10th century, the themes of Cephallenia and Nicopolis appear mostly as bases for expeditions against southern Italy and Sicily, while Mardaites from both themes are listed in the large but unsuccessful expedition of 949 against the Emirate of Crete. In , the Theme of Nicopolis was raided by the Bulgarians, who even occupied some parts until driven out or subjugated by the Byzantines years later. Only the extreme north of Epirus seems to have remained consistently under Bulgarian rule in the period, but under Tsar Samuel, who moved the centre of Bulgarian power south and west to Ohrid, probably all of Epirus down to the Ambracian Gulf came under Bulgarian rule. This is evidenced from the fact that the territories that were under Bulgarian rule formed part of the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid after the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria by Emperor Basil II in 1018: thus in Epirus the sees of Chimara, Hadrianopolis, Bela, Buthrotum, Ioannina, Kozyle, and Rogoi passed under the jurisdiction of Ohrid, while the Metropolitan of Naupaktos retained only the sees of Bonditza, Aetos, and Acheloos. Basil II also established new, smaller themes in the region: Koloneia, and Dryinopolis (Hadrianopolis).

The region joined the uprising of Petar Delyan in 1040, and suffered in the First Norman invasion of the Balkans: Dyrrhachium was occupied by the Normans in 1081–1084, Arta was unsuccessfully besieged, and Ioannina was captured by Robert Guiscard. An Aromanian presence in Epirus is first mentioned in the late 11th century, while Jewish communities are attested throughout the medieval period in Arta and Ioannina.

====Despotate of Epirus====

When Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the &quot;partitio Romaniae&quot; assigned Epirus to Venice, but the Venetians were largely unable to effectively establish their authority, except over Dyrrhachium (the &quot;Duchy of Durazzo&quot;). The Greek noble Michael Komnenos Doukas, who had married the daughter of a local magnate, took advantage of this, and within a few years consolidated his control over most of Epirus, first as a Venetian vassal and eventually as an independent ruler. By the time of his death in 1214/5, Michael had established a strong state, the Despotate of Epirus, with the former theme of Nicopolis at its core and Arta as its capital. Epirus, and the city of Ioannina in particular, became a haven for Greek refugees from the Latin Empire of Constantinople for the next half century.

The Despotate of Epirus ruled over Epirus and western Greece as far south as Naupaktos and the Gulf of Corinth, much of Albania (including Dyrrhachium), Thessaly, and the western portion of Macedonia, extending its rule briefly over central Macedonia and most of Thrace following the aggressive expansionism of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who established the Empire of Thessalonica in 1224. During this time, the definition of Epirus came to encompass the entire coastal region from the Ambracian Gulf to Dyrrhachium, and the hinterland to the west up to the highest peaks of the Pindus mountain range. Some of the most important cities in Epirus, such as Gjirokastër (Argyrokastron), were founded during this period. The oldest reference to Albanians in Epirus is from a Venetian document dating to 1210, which states that &quot;the continent facing the island of Corfu is inhabited by Albanians&quot;. Kosta Giakoumis believes that the use of hypothetical immigrations to explain the accounts of Albanian presence in Epirote territory prior to the 13th-14th century is somewhat arbitrary. 

====14th century until the Ottoman conquest====
In 1337, Epirus was once again brought under the rule of the restored Byzantine Empire. In 1348, taking advantage of the civil war between the Byzantine emperors John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, the Serbian king Stefan Uroš IV Dušan conquered Epirus, with a number of Albanian mercenaries assisting him. The Byzantine authorities in Constantinople soon re-established a measure of control by making the Despotate of Epirus a vassal state, but Albanian clans proceeded to invade and seize most of the region. Under Pjetër Losha, the Albanian Malakasi and Mazaraki tribes defeated Nikephoros II Orsini at the Battle of Achelous in 1359, which won Pjetër Losha the rule of Arta; Losha then founded the Despotate of Arta (1358-1416) with the help of the Mazaraki and Malakasi clans.

Although Albanian clans gained control of most of the region by 1366/7, their continued division into rival clans meant that they could not establish a single central authority. Ioannina became a center of Greek resistance to the Albanian clans. The Greeks of Ioannina offered power to three foreign rulers during this time, beginning with Thomas II Preljubović (1367–1384), whose rule was marked by hostilities in the region, as Ioannina came under constant siege by the Mazaraki and Malakasi clans under Losha. These tribes would besiege Ioannina a second time in 1374–1375. A truce was signed when Pjetër&#x27;s son Gjin was betrothed to Thomas&#x27;s daughter Irina, but she would soon die in the 1375 plague and hostilities would recommence. Preljubović attempted to pacify the Albanians of Epirus; however, under Gjin Bua Shpata, the Albanians defeated him. 

The reign of Esau de&#x27; Buondelmonti (1385–1411) in Ioannina followed, and with an army that consisted of the Albanian tribes of the Mazaraki and Malakasi, he marched against the Principality of Gjirokastër. He was defeated and captured by Albanian nobleman Gjon Zenebishi, and ransomed for 10,000 gold pieces on the intervention of the Venetian governor of Corfu. At the time the Zenebishi clan controlled the area around Gjirokastër (1386–1411), while only the city of Ioannina remained under Greek control.

Carlo I Tocco (1411–1429) then assumed control of Ioannina, commencing heavy conflicts with Jakob and Muriq Shpata, the Albanian leaders of the Despotate of Arta. The Shpata were originally defeated by Carlo&#x27;s brother Leonardo II Tocco at Mazoma near ancient Nicopolis, but Carlo&#x27;s son Torno was in turn defeated by the Albanians. After the Tocchi succeeded in capturing Rhiniasa, Leonardo tried to take Rogoi and Carlo attempted to take Arta, but Jakob and Muriq succeeded in defending their capital for the time being. Carlo withdrew to Ioannina, but soon after was able to lure Jakob to an ambush near Vobliana: Jakob was captured and immediately executed (1 October 1416). Carlo had effectively ended the rule of the Albanian clans in southernmost Epirus.

Nevertheless, internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which began with the capture of Ioannina in 1430 and continued with Arta in 1449, Angelokastro in 1460, Riniasa Castle and its environs (in what is now Preveza) in 1463, and finally Vonitsa in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was also the end of Latin rule in mainland Greece.

===Ottoman rule===

The Ottomans ruled Epirus for almost 500 years. Their rule in Epirus proved particularly damaging; the region was subjected to deforestation and excessive cultivation, which damaged the soil and drove many Epirotes to emigrate so as to escape the region&#x27;s pervasive poverty. Nonetheless, the Ottomans did not enjoy total control of Epirus. The Himara and Zagori regions managed to successfully resist Ottoman rule and maintained a degree of independence throughout this period. The Ottomans expelled the Venetians from almost the whole area in the late 15th century.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the city of Ioannina attained great prosperity and became a major center of the modern Greek Enlightenment. Numerous schools were founded, such as the Balaneios, Maroutsaia, Kaplaneios, and Zosimaia, teaching subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics and physical sciences. In the 18th century, as the power of the Ottoman Empire declined, Epirus became a &quot;de facto&quot; independent region under the despotic rule of Ali Pasha of Tepelena, a Muslim Albanian brigand who rose to become the provincial governor of Ioannina in 1788. At the height of his power, he controlled all of Epirus, and much of the Peloponnese, central Greece, and parts of western Macedonia Ali Pasha&#x27;s campaign to subjugate the confederation of the settlements of Souli met with fierce resistance by the Souliot warriors of the mountainous area. After numerous failed attempts to defeat the Souliotes, his troops succeeded in conquering the area in 1803. On the other hand, Ali, who used Greek as official language, witnessed an increase of Greek cultural activity with the establishment of several educational institutions.

When the Greek War of Independence broke out, the inhabitants of Epirus contributed greatly. Two of the founding members of the Filiki Eteria (the secret society of the Greek revolutionaries), Nikolaos Skoufas and Athanasios Tsakalov, came from the Arta area and the city of Ioannina, respectively. Greece&#x27;s first constitutional prime minister (1844–1847), Ioannis Kolettis, was a native of the village of Syrrako in Epirus and was a former personal physician to Ali Pasha. Ali Pasha tried to use the war as an opportunity to make himself a fully independent ruler, but was assassinated by Ottoman agents in 1822. When Greece became independent in 1830, however, Epirus remained under Ottoman rule. In 1854, during the Crimean War, a major local rebellion broke out. Although the newly found Greek state tried tacitly to support it, the rebellion was suppressed by Ottoman forces after a few months. Another failed rebellion by local Greeks broke out in 1878. During this period, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople managed to shut down the few Albanian schools, considering teaching in Albanian a factor that would diminish its influence and lead to the creation of separate Albanian church, while publications in Albanian were banned by the Ottoman Empire. In the late 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy opened various schools in the regions of Ioannina and Preveza in order to influence the local population. These schools began to attract students from the Greek language schools, but were ultimately closed after intervention and harassment by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Throughout, the late period of Ottoman rule (from the 18th century) Greek and Aromanian population of the region suffered from Albanians raiders, that sporadically continued after Ali Pasha&#x27;s death, until 1912–1913.

===20th-century Epirus===

While the Treaty of Berlin (1878) awarded large parts of Epirus to Greece, opposition by the Ottomans and the League of Prizren resulted in only the region of Arta being ceded to Greece in 1881. It was only following the First Balkan War of 1912–1913 and the Treaty of London that the rest of southern Epirus, including Ioannina, was incorporated into Greece. Greece had also seized northern Epirus during the Balkan Wars, but the Treaty of Bucharest, which concluded the Second Balkan War, assigned Northern Epirus to Albania.

This outcome was unpopular among local Greeks, as a substantial Greek population existed on the Albanian side of the border. Among Greeks, northern Epirus was henceforth regarded as &quot;terra irredenta&quot;. Local Greeks in northern Epirus revolted, declared their independence and proclaimed the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus in February 1914. After fierce guerrilla fighting, they managed to gain full autonomy under the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers. The signing of the Protocol ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local Greeks and provided self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as when World War I broke out, Albania collapsed, and northern Epirus was alternately controlled by Greece, Italy and France at various intervals.

Although the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded Northern Epirus to Greece, developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War and, crucially, Italian lobbying in favor of Albania meant that Greece would not keep Northern Epirus. In 1924, the area was again ceded to Albania.

In 1939, Italy occupied Albania, and in 1940 invaded Greece. The Italians were driven back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again took control of northern Epirus. The conflict marked the first tactical victory of the Allies in World War II. Benito Mussolini himself supervised the spring counter-offensive of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be repulsed again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. Nazi Germany then intervened in April 1941 to avert an Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through Yugoslavia and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.

The whole of Epirus was then placed under Italian occupation until 1943, when the Germans took over following the Italian surrender to the Allies. Due to the extensive activity of the anti-Nazi Greek resistance (mainly under EDES), the Germans carried out large scaled anti-partisan sweeps, making wide use of Nazi-collaborationist bands of Cham Albanians, who committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population. They fought fiercely against the Greek partisans of the EDES, the latter being ordered by the Allied command to push them out of Greece into Albania. The violent clashes and the reprisals that followed by the Greek guerillas resulted in the expulsion to Albania of almost the entire Cham population.

With the liberation of Greece and the start of the first round of the Greek Civil War at the end of 1944, the highlands of Epirus became a major theater of guerrilla warfare between the leftist Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS) and the right-wing National Republican Greek League (EDES). In subsequent years (1945–1949), the mountains of Epirus also became the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the second and bloodier round of the Greek Civil War. The final episode of the war took place on Mount Grammos in 1949, ending with the defeat of the Communists. Peace returned to the region in 1949, although because of official Albanian active involvement in the civil war on the side of the communists, the formal state of war between Greece and Albania remained in effect until 1987. Another reason for the continuation of the state of war until 1987 was that during the entire period of Communist rule in Albania, the Greek population of Northern Epirus experienced forced Albanisation. Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an &quot;official minority zone&quot; consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as Himara. People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public. The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country. Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece&#x27;s abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.

==Economy==
A rugged topography, poor soils, and fragmented landholdings have kept agricultural production low and have resulted in a low population density. Animal husbandry is the main industry and corn the chief crop. Oranges and olives are grown in the western lowlands, while tobacco is grown around Ioannina. Epirus has few natural resources and industries, and the population has been depleted by migration. The population is centered around Ioannina, which has the largest number of industrial establishments.

==Transportation==
Epirus has historically been a remote and isolated region due to its location between the Pindus mountains and the sea. In antiquity, the Roman Via Egnatia passed through Epirus Nova, which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to Dyrrachium on the Adriatic Sea. The modern &quot;Egnatia Odos&quot;, the A2 motorway, which links Ioannina to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at Igoumenitsa, is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region&#x27;s isolation from the east, while the Ionia Odos highway, connecting Epirus with Western Greece, helped reducing the region&#x27;s isolation from the south. Also, the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near Preveza, with Aetolia-Acarnania in western Greece. Ferry services from Igoumenitsa to the Ionian islands and Italy exist. The only airport in Epirus is the Ioannina National Airport, while the Aktion National Airport is located just south of Preveza in Aetolia-Acarnania. There are no railroads in Epirus.

<doc id="38261" wikidata="Q1335" url="?curid=38261" title="Montevideo">
<text>Montevideo (, ; ) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2023 census, the city proper has a population of 1,302,954 (about 37.2% of the country&#x27;s total population) in an area of . Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the Río de la Plata.

A Portuguese garrison was established in the place where today is the city of Montevideo in November 1723. The Portuguese garrison was expelled in February 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. There is no official document establishing the foundation of the city, but the &quot;Diario&quot; of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala officially mentions the date of 24 December 1726 as the foundation, corroborated by presential witnesses. The complete independence from Buenos Aires as a real city was not reached until 1 January 1730. It was also under brief British rule in 1807, but eventually the city was retaken by Spanish criollos who defeated the British invasions of the River Plate. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America&#x27;s leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.

The 2019 Mercer&#x27;s report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. , Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2022, it has a projected GDP of $53.9 billion, with a per capita of $30,148.

In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a &quot;vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life&quot;, and &quot;a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture&quot;, Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.

The city has preserved European architecture, being considered one of the cities with the most art deco influence. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.

== Etymology ==
There are several explanations for the word &quot;Montevideo&quot;. All agree that &quot;Monte&quot; refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the &quot;video&quot; part.

* Monte vide eu (&quot;I saw a mount&quot;) is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means &quot;I saw a mount&quot;, wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.
* Montem vídeo (&quot;I see a hill&quot;): This version, a variant of the previous one, suggests that the name comes directly from Latin, stemming from the spontaneous expression of a learned member of Magellan&#x27;s expedition, who, upon spotting the Cerro de Montevideo, exclaimed: &quot;Montem vídeo&quot; (&quot;I see a hill&quot;). The rest of the crew, who did not speak Latin, mistakenly registered this as the name of the hill they had just sighted, &quot;Monte Vídeo&quot;. This theory is supported by numerous maps and documents from the colonial period that refer to the Cerro de Montevideo with the name &quot;Monte Vídeo.&quot;
* Monte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the &quot;Diario de Navegación&quot; (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, &quot;Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa María [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name &quot;Montevidi&quot;.&quot; This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry &quot;Monte vide eu.&quot;
* Monte-VI-D-E-O (&quot;Monte VI De Este a Oeste&quot;, &quot;Sixth mount from east to west&quot;): According to Rolando Laguarda Trías, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating Río de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to &quot;Montevideo&quot;. No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis, nor can it be asserted with certainty which the other five mounts observable before the Cerro were.
* Monte Ovídio (&quot;Monte Santo Ovídio&quot;), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned &quot;Diario de Navegación&quot; of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted &quot;corruptly now called Santo Vidio&quot; when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Auditus of Braga (Spanish: &quot;Ovídio&quot;) was the third bishop of the Roman city of Braga (now in Portugal) in 95 CE, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovídio or Vídio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name &quot;Montevideo&quot; given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.

When the Portuguese invaded the Banda Oriental and annexed it as the province of Cisplatina until 1831, they called the city , and pronounced as .

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Between 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.

A Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.

A census of the city&#x27;s inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as &quot;San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo&quot;, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted more than 100 families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaraní, as well as some trafficked slaves of Bantu origin.

A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the Río de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.

In 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (&quot;Real Apostadero de Marina&quot;) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.

Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.

=== 19th century ===

On 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental—roughly the same area as modern Uruguay—and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de Elío opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. Elío disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.

During the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.

The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as the capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the &quot;Treinta y Tres Orientales&quot; (&quot;Thirty-Three Orientals&quot;) re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation&#x27;s capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city&#x27;s fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the &quot;Ciudad Nueva&quot; (&quot;new city&quot;). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.

Uruguay&#x27;s 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the &quot;caudillo&quot; of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe&#x27;s &quot;Blancos&quot; (&quot;whites&quot;), represented by the National Party, and Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Colorados&quot; (&quot;reds&quot;), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party&#x27;s name taken from the color of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign from the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.

The city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. By 1843 Montevideo&#x27;s population of thirty thousand inhabitants was highly cosmopolitan with Uruguayans making up only a third of it. The remaining were chiefly Italian (4205), Spanish (3406), Argentine (2553), Portuguese (659), English (606) and Brazilians (492). Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting however resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until the middle of the 20th century.

After the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Unión and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Solís was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cordón were incorporated to the growing &quot;Ciudad Nueva&quot; (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, &quot;La Paz&quot;, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.

In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company &quot;Compañía de Tranvías al Paso del Molino y Cerro&quot; created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Unión, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company &quot;Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay&quot; was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighborhoods Colón, Nuevo París and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Tristán Narvaja Street was established in Cordón in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, &quot;Bulevar Circunvalación&quot; was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed Artigas Boulevard in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area &quot;Los Pocitos&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;Novísima Ciudad&quot; (Most New City).

The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas-operated ones in 1886. The Hipódromo de Maroñas started operating in 1888, and the neighborhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliación were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Peñarol was founded. Other neighborhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.

=== 20th century ===

In the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city&#x27;s population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighborhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Colón. The Rodó Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as &quot;poles&quot; of urban development.

During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right to divorce (1907) and women&#x27;s right to vote.

The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo&#x27;s Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.

In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.

During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president José Batlle y Ordóñez died (1929); and the ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).

===World War II===
During World War II, a famous incident involving the German cruiser &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; took place in Punta del Este, from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; retreated to Montevideo&#x27;s port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; was salvaged on 10 February 2006.

===Post-war era===

Uruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberación Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.

From the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of political violence. In 1974 another hundred Uruguayans also disappeared in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to a referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favor. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.

In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.

=== 21st century ===

The 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.

Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.

== Geography ==

Montevideo is situated on the north shore of the Río de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies west on the Argentine side. The Santa Lucía River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San José Department to its west. To the city&#x27;s north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city&#x27;s southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbor, the nation&#x27;s largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams crisscross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.

The city has an average elevation of . Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of . Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighboring department capitals by road are, to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and to Canelones (Canelones Department).
=== Climate ===
Montevideo has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) in a middle latitude, the city experiences the four seasons. It has cool winters (June to August), warm to hot summers (December to February), mild autumns (March to May) and volatile springs (September to November); The climate is characterized by having mild temperatures, without harsh cold or extreme heat. There are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around .

Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. The average temperature during this season is just above . Daytime temperatures are generally between and , and night lows between and . During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city, with daytime temperatures around or below and possible night frosts. These occur few times during winter, with temperatures generally not falling below because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; a few kilometres inland, frosts are more common and colder. On the other hand, even in the middle of winter it&#x27;s not uncommon to have temperatures above for a few days. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.

Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. The average temperature in this season is 
. Daytime temperatures are usually between and , while night lows between and . During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent; temperatures can rise above . These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts from the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.

The autumn in Montevideo is quite pleasant and not so unstable. Daytime temperatures are in general around and nights around .
Spring average temperatures are very similar to the autumn, but the weather in that season tends to be more windy and volatile, with more dramatic changes in a short period of time.

Montevideo has an annual average temperature of . The lowest recorded temperature is while the highest is .

=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===

, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (&quot;Municipios&quot;), referred to with letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, &quot;aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.&quot; The head of each &quot;Municipio&quot; is called an &quot;alcalde&quot; or (if female) &quot;alcaldesa&quot;.

Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 &quot;barrios&quot;: neighborhoods or wards. Many of the city&#x27;s &quot;barrios&quot;—such as Sayago, Ituzaingó and Pocitos—were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo París. Each &quot;barrio&quot; has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighborhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.

=== Landmarks ===
The architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the late-modern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city&#x27;s extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rodó and Parque Prado are Montevideo&#x27;s three great parks.

The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the &quot;Edificio Panamericano&quot; designed by Raul Sichero, and the &quot;Positano&quot; and &quot;El Pilar&quot; designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighborhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle-class residents.

==== Palacio Legislativo ====

The Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, north of the city center, is the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President José Batlle y Ordóñez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and , who planned the building&#x27;s interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor José Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.

==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====

World Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square meters of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and of space. The World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a center of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St.

The Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social places. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and of space is under construction .

==== Telecommunications Tower ====
Torre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the , 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay&#x27;s government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge Company and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.

When its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.

==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====
Ciudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent &quot;barrio&quot; of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and nightclubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.
Montevideo&#x27;s most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here. 
The Solís Theatre is Uruguay&#x27;s oldest theater. It was built in 1856 and is owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theater, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theater reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the center of the plaza. Statues include that of José Gervasio Artigas, a hero of Uruguay&#x27;s independence movement; an honor guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.
Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confitería La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodríguez wrote his tango &quot;La Cumparsita&quot; (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.

Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constitución (or &quot;Plaza Matriz&quot;). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo—the seat of colonial government—and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.
==== Parque Batlle ====
Parque Batlle (formerly: &quot;Parque de los Aliados&quot;, translation: &quot;Park of the Allies&quot;) is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rodó it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighborhoods (&quot;barrios&quot;) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighborhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a sub-district of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Doña Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919;&lt;ref name=&quot;montevideo.gub.uy/Zoologico&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.&lt;ref name=&quot;montevideo.gub.uy/planetario&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parque Batlle is named in honor of José Batlle y Ordóñez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named &quot;Parque de los Aliados&quot;, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ordóñez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. , the park covers an area of and is considered the &quot;lung&quot; of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.

The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see &quot;Sports&quot;).

In 1934, sculptor José Belloni&#x27;s &quot;La Carreta&quot;, a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.

On the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín (1891–1975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing &quot;Law&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot;, and &quot;Force&quot;, respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.

==== Parque Prado ====
Established in 1873, the largest of Montevideo&#x27;s six main public parks is the Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighborhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaquín Suárez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and José María Reyes.

The most frequented areas of the park are the &quot;Rosedal&quot;, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the &quot;Rural del Prado&quot;, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.

The Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.

==== Parque Rodó ====

Parque Rodó is both a &quot;barrio&quot; (neighborhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighborhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name &quot;Rodó&quot; commemorates José Enrique Rodó, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rodó includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the &quot;Canteras&quot; (&quot;quarry&quot;) &quot;del Parque Rodó&quot;, the &quot;Teatro de Verano&quot; (&quot;summer theatre&quot;) and the &quot;Lago&quot; (&quot;lake&quot;) &quot;del Parque Rodó&quot;.

On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park area, and belonging to Parque Rodó &quot;barrio&quot;, there is the former &quot;Parque Hotel&quot;, now called &quot;Edifício Mercosur&quot;, the seat of the parliament of the member countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.

==== Forts ====
The first set of subsidiary forts was planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front-line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship &quot;Nossa Senhora de Oliveara&quot;. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.

===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====
Fortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.

====Punta Brava Lighthouse====

Punta Brava Lighthouse (&quot;Faro Punta Brava&quot;), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is high and its light reaches away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Inglés Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Lucía River.

==== Rambla of Montevideo ====

The Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word &quot;rambla&quot; is &quot;avenue&quot; or &quot;watercourse&quot;, but in the Americas it is mostly used as &quot;coastal avenue&quot;, and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have &quot;ramblas&quot; as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called &quot;Rambla Naciones Unidas&quot; (&quot;United Nations&quot;), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.

The Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even—in a special area—skateboard. Its length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.

Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best-known beaches are Ramírez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malvín. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.

==== Cemeteries ====

There are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the &quot;Fúnebre y Necrópolis&quot; annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.

The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: &quot;Cementerio central&quot;), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay&#x27;s main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 at a time when burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, José Batlle y Ordóñez, Juan Manuel Blanes, François Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, José Enrique Rodó, and Juan Zorrilla de San Martín.

The other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.
The British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Británico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.

=== Demographics ===

In 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by Portuguese Brazilians, French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.

According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay&#x27;s total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of −1.5 per thousand. The continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.

In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.

== Government and politics ==

===Intendancy of Montevideo===
The Intendancy of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality&#x27;s first mayor (1909–1911) was Daniel Muñoz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.

Since 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (&quot;Centro Comunal Zonal&quot;, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Intendancy of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994. In 2010, the city CCZ were abolished and eight municipalities were created instead.

The city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. The city hall is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.

The legislative branch of government, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco Gómez in Ciudad Vieja.

A 2016 private ranking named &quot;Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index&quot; measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.

==Culture==

In recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rodó, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree which went into effect on 1 March 2006, smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.

Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.

=== The arts ===
Montevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and a number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighborhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the center of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theater companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theater of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Solís Theatre is the most prominent theater in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, and .

==== Visual arts ====

The daily newspaper &quot;El País&quot; sponsors the Virtual Museum of Contemporary Uruguayan Art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in &quot;virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish&quot;.

In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country&#x27;s leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a &quot;hotbed of resistance&quot;. This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.

==== Literature ====
The first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father José Manuel Pérez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from José Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The building of the National Library of Uruguay (&quot;Biblioteca Pública de Uruguay&quot;) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of . Construction began in 1926 and it was inaugurated in 1964. Its collection amounts to 900,000 volumes.

==== Authors ====

The city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the center of the editorial and creative activity of literature.

In 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including José Enrique Rodó, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hernández. Montevideo was then called the &quot;Atenas del Plata&quot; or the &quot;Athens of the Rio de la Plata&quot;.

Among the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.

A new generation of writers has become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).

==== Music ====
In Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and &quot;vals criollo&quot;. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including &quot;El Tango supremo&quot;, &quot;La Cumparsita&quot;, &quot;La Milonga&quot;, &quot;La Puñalada&quot; and &quot;Desde el Alma&quot;, composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodríguez, Pintín Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. 20th. century composers like three-time Grammy nominated Miguel del Aguila have taken Uruguayan tango to international classical music audiences. &quot;Fun Fun&#x27; Bar&quot;, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is &quot;El Farolito&quot;, located in the old part of the city and &quot;Joventango&quot;, &quot;Café Las Musas&quot;, &quot;Garufa&quot; and &quot;Vieja Viola&quot;. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.

===Cuisine===
The center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (&quot;Port Market&quot;). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A &quot;torta frita&quot; is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the center for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.

==== Museums ====

The Centro Cultural de España, as well as Asturian and cultural centers, testify to Montevideo&#x27;s considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres García, , Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.

The Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.
The Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo&#x27;s first theater (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th–18th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.
The National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico. Also nearby is the Museo Casa de José Garibaldi where Giuseppe Garibaldi lived in the 1840s while participating in the Uruguayan Civil War.

The Museo Torres García is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaquín Torres García&#x27;s unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Piña Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the García Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.
There are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The Centro de Fotografía de Montevideo (CdF) is a museum, archive, and gallery for historic and contemporary photography with twelve outdoor exhibition spaces in various Montevideo neighborhoods as well as four galleries in its downtown headquarters. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rodó has Uruguay&#x27;s largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In the back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.

There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay&#x27;s gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and &quot;mate&quot; (tea), gourds, and &quot;bombillas&quot; (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Automóvil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando García in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual façade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.

==== Festivals ====

As the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.
During carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. &quot;Tablados&quot; or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include &quot;Desfile de las Llamadas&quot; (&quot;Parade of the Calls&quot;), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the &quot;zonal beauty queens&quot; to appear in the carnival.

==== Sports ====

Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay&#x27;s first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world&#x27;s classic stadiums, along with Maracanã, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay&#x27;s 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.

Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabaré Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theater using impermanent materials.

Today the vast majority of teams in the Primera División and Segunda División come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Peñarol, Central Español, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atlético Fénix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atlético Torque, Boston River and Rampla Juniors.

Besides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Gran Parque Central, Estadio Campeón del Siglo, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hipódromo, José Pedro Damiani, &quot;La Bombonera&quot;, Luis Franzini, Luis Tróccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo Víctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, José Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracaná and Palermo.

The city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.

The Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Biguá, Atlético Aguada, Goes, Malvín, , and Trouville. Montevideo is also a center of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maroñas Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo&#x27;s promenade) and the Parque Rodó (Fun Fair).

=== Religion ===
The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado–Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San José de Mayo, Tacuarembó.

Montevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese&#x27;s mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción y San Felipe y Santiago. Church and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. , the Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.

Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess &quot;believing in God but without religion&quot;.

==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====

The Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.

In 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighborhood.

==== Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón ====

Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón (&quot;Our Lady of the Sacred Heart&quot;), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (&quot;Punta Carretas Church&quot;), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano García and José Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.

== Economy ==
&quot;Main Article: Economy of Uruguay&quot;

As the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political center of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay&#x27;s most important buildings—the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay&#x27;s government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city&#x27;s integration into the global marketplace.

The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city&#x27;s economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.

The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water &amp; sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called &quot;Ente Autonomo&quot; (&quot;autonomous entity&quot;). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).

Banking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed &quot;the Switzerland of America&quot;, mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. 9 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Darío Cukier, GBU, Hordeñana &amp; Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.

===Tourism===

Tourism accounts for much of Uruguay&#x27;s economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city&#x27;s oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarandí Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Solís Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city&#x27;s most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the &quot;Rambla&quot; (the coastal avenue), of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo &quot;barrios&quot;.

The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.

Most tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises and ferries that arrive into the port of Montevideo.

=== Retail ===
Montevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal center of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping center in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with the building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo. In 2013 Nuevocentro Shopping, a shopping mall located in the Jacinto Vera neighborhood, was inaugurated.

Apart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cordón &quot;barrios&quot;, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the

=== Media ===
Out of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973–1985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.

Some of the important newspapers published in the city are: &quot;Brecha&quot;, &quot;La República&quot;, &quot;El Observador&quot;, &quot;El País&quot;, &quot;Gaceta Comercial&quot; and &quot;La Diaria&quot;. &quot;El Día&quot; was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by José Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)

== Transport ==
=== Public transport ===

The city and its metropolitan area have a bus transportation network, the &quot;Sistema Met&quot;s acronym. It covers urban and interurban services within the Metropolitan Area and is administered by the municipal government together with the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. The Baltasar Brum Terminal located in Ciudad Vieja, is the main urban bus station. However, there are numerous interchanges and terminals distributed in both the city and the metropolitan area.

=== Taxis ===

The livery of most Montevideo taxis features white on the sides, along with a yellow band, as well as yellow on the top of the car. To determine the rate they use a taximeter, which will determine the price depending on the distance traveled. All taxis accept cash, although it is also common that a passenger can pay with a credit card.

=== Rail ===
The State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San José and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Colón (line to San Jose and Florida), Peñarol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the &quot;barrio&quot; Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, north of the old one and part of the Telecommunications Tower modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.

The train service is currently suspended for works related to the modernization of the railway system until mid-2023 when the work will end.

=== Intercity buses ===
The Tres Cruces bus station is the main bus terminal in Uruguay, serving long-distance buses that travel into Montevideo, from other parts of the country and abroad. Inaugurated in 1994, it serves more than 12 million passengers per year. 

Companies operating at Tres Cruces bus station: Agencia central, Bruno, Copsa, Cromin, Cynsa, Copay, Cot, Cut, Corporacion, Cita, Cauvi, Colonia Express, El Condor, El Norteño, Ega, Expreso Chago, Expreso Minuano, Intertur, Nossar, Nuñez, Rutas del sol, TTL, Turil, Turismar, etc.

=== Aviation ===
Montevideo is served by the Carrasco International Airport , which is located in the north of Ciudad de la Costa, in Canelones Department, from the city center. It handles over 1,5 million passengers per year, and has been cited as one of the most efficient and traveler-friendly airports in Latin America.

Ángel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies and in which there is also a flight school.

=== Port ===
Montevideo is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port with Buenos Aires. More than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about .The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbor entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires.
The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port&#x27;s first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja Refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city&#x27;s engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.

The port&#x27;s proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.

Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.

=== Cycling ===
The city has bicycle circuits in Ciudad Vieja, Artigas Boulevard and Centro as well as with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks throughout the city. In 2013 the &quot;South Bicicircuito&quot; was also inaugurated, which connects several of the dependent faculties of the University of the Republic. There are more than 100 bike stations in the city. In 2014, a bicycle sharing system called &quot;Movete&quot; was launched.

==Education==

===Public education===

The University of the Republic is the country&#x27;s largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, José Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste

The process of founding the country&#x27;s public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay at that time.
===Private education===
The largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
The university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its rector is Dr. Jorge A. Grünberg.

Another private university in Uruguay is the University of Montevideo (Spanish: Universidad de Montevideo, short: UM). It opened in 1986 and obtained the right to be legally named a university in 1997. With its seven schools the UM has facilities all over Montevideo. The Universidad de Montevideo also holds more than 250 partnerships with other universities in 47 countries. Since 2019 is the university ranked in the Top 500 in the world by the QS World University Rankings (QSWUR). 

The Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women&#x27;s Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley&#x27;s values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.
The Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighborhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school&#x27;s headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school&#x27;s alumni club.

Also in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with &quot;the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles&quot;. The School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include president Luis Lacalle Pou and former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry and Gabriel Gurméndez Armand-Ugon.

Located in Cordon, St.Brendan&#x27;s school, previously named St.Catherine&#x27;s is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is known for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such as, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.
St. Brendan&#x27;s School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:
*Diploma Program – Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Program is a two-year curriculum.
*MYP -Middle Years Program. For students aged 12 to 16.
*PYP – Primary Years Program. For students aged 3 to 12.

Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, John XXIII Institute, Lycée Français de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.

==Healthcare==
In Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term &quot;hospital&quot; is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while &quot;sanatorio&quot; is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.

===Public hospitals===
Hospital de Clínicas &quot;Dr. Manuel Quintela&quot; is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928–1929 and has a surface area of on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.

Hospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of José Toribio (son of ) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.

Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city&#x27;s first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.

Hospital Vilardebó is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist , it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.

Other public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Unión neighborhood; the Hospital Español, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and re-inaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.

===Private healthcare===
Private healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Británico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU&#x27;s Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, , Sanatorio de la Asociación Española, Sanatorios del Círculo Católico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.

<text>Max Ferdinand Perutz (19 May 1914 – 6 February 2002) was an Austrian-born British molecular biologist, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with John Kendrew, for their studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin. He went on to win the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971 and the Copley Medal in 1979. At Cambridge he founded and chaired (1962–79) The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), fourteen of whose scientists have won Nobel Prizes.

==Early life and education==
Perutz was born in Vienna, the son of Adele &quot;Dely&quot; (Goldschmidt) and Hugo Perutz, a textile manufacturer. His parents were Jewish by ancestry, but had baptised Perutz in the Catholic religion. Although Perutz rejected religion and was an atheist in his later years, he was against offending others for their religious beliefs.

His parents hoped that he would become a lawyer, but he became interested in chemistry while at school. Overcoming his parents&#x27; objections he enrolled as a chemistry undergraduate at the University of Vienna and completed his degree in 1936. Made aware by lecturer Fritz von Wessely of the advances being undertaken at the University of Cambridge into biochemistry by a team led by Gowland Hopkins, he asked Professor Mark, who was soon to visit Cambridge, to make inquiries of Hopkins about whether there would be a place for him. Mark forgot, but had visited J.D. Bernal, who was looking for a research student to assist him with studies into X-ray crystallography. Perutz was dismayed as he knew nothing about the subject. Mark countered by saying that he would soon learn. Bernal accepted him as a research student in his crystallography research group at the Cavendish Laboratory. His father had deposited £500 with his London agent to support him. He learnt quickly. Bernal encouraged him to use the X-ray diffraction method to study the structure of proteins. As protein crystals were difficult to obtain, he used horse haemoglobin crystals, and began his doctoral thesis on its structure. Haemoglobin was a subject which was to occupy him for most of his professional career. He completed his Ph.D. under Lawrence Bragg in 1940.

He applied to Kings and St. John&#x27;s colleges, and became a member of Peterhouse, on the basis that it served the best food. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse in 1962. He took a keen interest in the Junior Members, and was a regular and popular speaker at the Kelvin Club, the college&#x27;s scientific society.

===World War II===
When Hitler took over Austria in 1938, Perutz&#x27;s parents managed to escape to Switzerland, but they had lost all of their money. As a result, Perutz lost their financial support. With his ability to ski, experience in mountaineering since childhood and his knowledge of crystals, Perutz was accepted as a member of a three-man team to study the conversion of snow into ice in Swiss glaciers in the summer of 1938. His resulting article for the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; made him known as an expert on glaciers.

Lawrence Bragg, who was Professor of Experimental Physics at the Cavendish, thought that Perutz&#x27;s research into haemoglobin had promise and encouraged him to apply for a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue his research. The application was accepted in January 1939 and with the money Perutz was able to bring his parents from Switzerland to England in March 1939.

On the outbreak of World War II, Perutz was rounded up along with other persons of German or Austrian background, and sent to Newfoundland (on orders from Winston Churchill). After being interned for several months he returned to Cambridge. 
Because of his pre-War research into the changes in the arrangement of the crystals in the layers of a glacier, he was asked for advice on whether if a battalion of commandos were landed in Norway, could they be hidden in shelters under glaciers. His knowledge on the subject of ice then led to him being recruited for Project Habakkuk in 1942. This was a secret project to build an ice platform in the mid-Atlantic, which could be used to refuel aircraft. To that end he investigated the recently invented mixture of ice and woodpulp known as pykrete. He carried out early experiments on pykrete in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London.

===Establishment of the Molecular Biology Unit===
After the War he returned briefly to glaciology, demonstrating how glaciers flow.

In 1947, Perutz, with the support of Professor Bragg, was successful in obtaining support from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to undertake research into the molecular structure of biological systems. This financial support allowed him to establish the Molecular Biology Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory. Perutz&#x27;s new unit attracted researchers who realised that the field of molecular biology had great promise; among them were Francis Crick in 1949 and James D. Watson in 1951.

In 1953, Perutz showed that diffracted X-rays from protein crystals could be phased by comparing the patterns from crystals of the protein with and without heavy atoms attached. In 1959 he employed this method to determine the molecular structure of the protein haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood. This work resulted in his sharing with John Kendrew the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Fifty years later, in 2013, 9,500 molecular structures of proteins were determined by X-ray crystallography.

After 1959, Perutz and his colleagues went on to determine the structure of oxy- and deoxy- haemoglobin at high resolution. As a result, in 1970, he was at last able to suggest how it works as a molecular machine: how it switches between its deoxygenated and its oxygenated states, in turn triggering the uptake of oxygen and then its release to the muscles and other organs. Further work over the next two decades refined and corroborated the proposed mechanism. In addition Perutz studied the structural changes in a number of haemoglobin diseases and how these might affect oxygen binding. He hoped that the molecule could be made to function as a drug receptor and that it would be possible to inhibit or reverse the genetic errors such as those that occur in sickle cell anaemia. A further interest was the variation of the haemoglobin molecule from species to species to suit differing habitats and patterns of behaviour. In his final years Perutz turned to the study of changes in protein structures implicated in Huntington and other neurodegenerative diseases. He demonstrated that the onset of Huntington disease is related to the number of glutamine repeats as they bind to form what he called a &quot;polar zipper&quot;.

===DNA structure and Rosalind Franklin===

During the early 1950s, while Watson and Crick were trying to determine the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), they were given by Perutz an unpublished 1952 progress report for the King&#x27;s College laboratory of Sir John Randall. This report contained X-ray diffraction images taken by Rosalind Franklin that proved to be crucial in coming to the double-helix structure.

Perutz did this without Franklin&#x27;s knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to publish a detailed analysis of the content of her unpublished progress report. Later this action was criticised by Randall and others, in view of the results and the honours resulting from this &quot;gift&quot;.

In an effort to clarify this issue, Perutz later published the report, arguing that it included nothing that Franklin had not said in a talk she gave in late 1951, which Watson had attended. Perutz also added that the report was addressed to an MRC committee created to &quot;establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council&quot;. Randall&#x27;s and Perutz&#x27;s labs were both funded by the MRC.

===The author===
In his later years, Perutz was a regular reviewer/essayist for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; on biomedical subjects. Many of these essays are reprinted in his 1998 book, &quot;I wish I had made you angry earlier&quot;.

In August 1985, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published his account of his experiences as an internee during World War II, titled &quot;That Was the War: Enemy Alien&quot;.

Perutz won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science in 1997.

A collection of Perutz&#x27;s correspondence was published posthumously in 2009, titled &quot;What a Time I Am Having: Selected Letters of Max Perutz&quot;.

===The scientist-citizen===
Perutz attacked the theories of philosophers Sir Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn and biologist Richard Dawkins in a lecture given at Cambridge on &#x27;Living Molecules&#x27; in 1994. He criticised Popper&#x27;s notion that science progresses through a process of hypothesis formation and refutation, saying that hypotheses are not necessarily the basis of scientific research and, in molecular biology at least, they are not necessarily subject to revision either. For Perutz, Kuhn&#x27;s notion that science advances in paradigm shifts that are subject to social and cultural pressures is an unfair representation of modern science.

These criticisms extended to scientists who attack religion, in particular to Dawkins. Statements which offend people&#x27;s religious faith were for Perutz tactless and simply damage the reputation of science, though he did not criticize scientists opposing &quot;demonstrably false&quot; theories such as creationism. He concluded that &quot;even if we do not believe in God, we should try to live as though we did.&quot;

Within days of the 11 September attacks in 2001, Perutz wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, appealing to him to not respond with military force: &quot;I am alarmed by the American cries for vengeance and concerned that President Bush&#x27;s retaliation will lead to the death of thousands more innocent people, driving us into a world of escalating terror and counter-terror. I do hope that you can use your restraining influence to prevent this happening.&quot;

===Honours and awards===
Perutz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. In addition to the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1962, which he shared with John Kendrew for their respective studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin, Max Perutz received a number of other important honours: he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1963, elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year, received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art in 1967, was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1968, elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1970, received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971, appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1975, received the Copley Medal in 1979 and became a Member of the Order of Merit in 1988.

Perutz was made a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1964, received an Honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna (1965) and received the Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1967. He was elected to EMBO Membership in 1964.

The European Crystallographic Association established the Max Perutz Prize, named in his honour.

<doc id="38264" wikidata="Q8810" url="?curid=38264" title="Granada">
<text>Granada ( ; ) is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega de Granada &quot;comarca&quot;, the city sits at an average elevation of above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.

In the 2021 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 227,383, and the population of the entire municipal area was estimated to be 231,775, ranking as the 20th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico García Lorca Granada-Jaén Airport.

The area was settled since ancient times by Iberians, Romans, and Visigoths. The current settlement became a major city of Al-Andalus in the 11th century during the Zirid Taifa of Granada. In the 13th century it became the capital of the Emirate of Granada under Nasrid rule, the last Muslim-ruled state in the Iberian Peninsula. Granada was conquered in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs and progressively transformed into a Christian city over the course of the 16th century.

The Alhambra, a medieval Nasrid citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the most visited tourist sites in Spain. Islamic-period influence and Moorish architecture are also preserved in the Albaicín neighborhood and other medieval monuments in the city. The 16th century also saw a flourishing of Mudéjar architecture and Renaissance architecture, followed later by Baroque and Churrigueresque styles. The University of Granada has an estimated 47,000 undergraduate students spread over five different campuses in the city. The pomegranate (in Spanish, &quot;granada&quot;) is the heraldic device of Granada.

== Etymology ==
Granada&#x27;s historical name in the Arabic language was (&quot;&quot;). Both the name&#x27;s meaning and origin are uncertain and have been debated. The toponym definitely existed prior to the Zirid period in the 11th century. It probably first appeared in the 9th century and it is found in Arabic sources from the 10th century.

The word &quot;Gárnata&quot; (or &quot;Karnata&quot;) possibly meant &quot;hill of strangers&quot;. Another meaning might be &quot;hill of pilgrims&quot;. It could even have been of Berber origin. Another theory is that it derived from Latin (or its plural ), meaning &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;beads&quot;, or a &quot;scarlet color&quot;, which would have been adapted into Arabic as &#x27; or &#x27;. The Arab chronicler Al-Maqqari believed that it came from the Latin word for pomegranate, . In either case, the Latin word may have been used not in its primary sense, but in the more derived sense of &quot;red&quot;, referring to the color of the area&#x27;s soil and its buildings. This would also mirror the etymology of the name of the Alhambra.

==History==
===Pre-Umayyad history===
The region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500BC. Archeological artifacts found in the city indicate that the site of the city, including the area around the present-day avenue of &quot;Gran Vía de Colón&quot;, was inhabited since the Bronze Age. The most ancient ruins found in the area belong to an oppidum called &quot;Ilturir&quot;, founded by the Iberian Bastetani tribe around 650BC. The name Elibyrge is also attested in reference to this area. This settlement became later known as &quot;Iliberri&quot; or &quot;Iliberis&quot;. In 44BC &quot;Iliberis&quot; became a Roman colony and in 27BC it became a Roman &quot;municipium&quot; named &quot;Florentia Iliberritana&quot; (&#x27;Flourishing Iliberri&#x27;).

The identification of present-day Granada with the Roman-era &quot;Iliberis&quot; and the historical continuity between the two settlements has long been debated by scholars. Modern archeological digs on the Albaicín hill have uncovered finds demonstrating the presence of a significant Roman town on that site. Little is known, however, about the history of the city in the period between the end of the Roman era and the 11th century. An important Christian synod circa 300 AD, the Synod of Elvira, took place near this area (the name &quot;Elvira&quot; being derived from the name &quot;Iliberri&quot;), but there is no concrete archeological or documentary evidence establishing the exact location of the meeting. It may have taken place in the former Roman town or it may have taken place somewhere in the surrounding region, which was known as Elvira.

===Founding and early history===
The Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in 711AD, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. The earliest Arabic historical sources mention that a town named &quot;Qashtīliya&quot;, later known as &quot;Madīnat Ilbīra&quot; (Elvira), was located on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Elvira mountains (near present-day Atarfe) and became the most important settlement in the area. A smaller settlement and fortress (&quot;ḥiṣn&quot;) named &quot;Ġarnāṭa&quot; (also transliterated as &quot;Gharnāṭa)&quot; existed on the south side of the Darro River or on the site of the current Albaicín neighbourhood. The latter had a mainly Jewish population and thus was also known as &quot;Gharnāṭat al-Yahūd&quot; (&quot;&quot;Gharnāṭa&quot; of the Jews&quot;). The district around the city was known as &quot;Kūrat Ilbīra&quot; (roughly &quot;Province of Elvira&quot;). After 743 the town of &quot;Ilbīra&quot; was settled by soldiers from the region of Syria who played a role in supporting Abd al-Rahman I, the founder of the Emirate of Córdoba and a new Umayyad dynasty. In the late 9th century, during the reign of Abdallah (r. 844–912), the city and its surrounding district were the site of conflict between &quot;muwallad&quot;s (Muslim converts) who were loyal to the central government and Arabs, led by Sawwār ibn Ḥamdūn, who resented them.

At the beginning of the 11th century, the area became dominated by the Zirids, a Sanhaja Berber group and offshoot of the Zirids who ruled parts of North Africa. This group became an important contingent in the army of ʿAbd al-Malik al-Muẓaffar, the prime minister of Caliph Hisham II (r. 976–1009) and successor to Ibn Abi ʿAmir al-Mansur (Almanzor) as &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Caliphate of Córdoba. For their service, the Zirids were granted control of the province of Elvira. When the Caliphate collapsed after 1009 and the Fitna (civil war) began, the Zirid leader Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. Arab sources such as al-Idrisi consider him to be the founder of the city of Granada. His surviving memoirs – the only ones for the Spanish &quot;Middle Ages&quot; – provide considerable detail for this brief period. Because &quot;Madīnat Ilbīra&quot; was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of &quot;Ġarnāṭa&quot;. According to Arabic sources &quot;Ilbīra&quot; was razed during the Fitna, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead &quot;Ġarnāṭa&quot;, the former Jewish town, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus. Until the 11th century it had a mixed population of Christians, Muslims, and Jews.

The Zirids built their citadel and palace, known as the &quot;al-Qaṣaba al-Qadīma&quot; (&quot;Old Citadel&quot;), on the hill now occupied by the Albaicín neighborhood. It was connected to two smaller fortresses on the Sabika hill (site of the future Alhambra) and Mauror hill to the south. The city around it grew during the 11th century to include the Albaicín, the Sabika, the Mauror, and a part of the surrounding plains. The city was fortified with walls encompassing an area of approximately 75 hectares. The northern part of these walls, near the Albaicin citadel, have survived to the present day, along with two of its gates: &quot;Bāb al-Unaydar&quot; (now called &quot;Puerta Monaita&quot; in Spanish) and &quot;Bāb al-Ziyāda&quot; (now known as &quot;Arco de las Pesas&quot; or &quot;Puerta Nueva&quot;). The city and its residences were supplied with water through an extensive network of underground cisterns and pipes. On the Darro River, along the wall connecting the Zirid citadel with the Sabika hill, was a sluice gate called &quot;Bāb al-Difāf&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Tambourines&quot;), which could be closed or opened to control the flow of the river and retain water if necessary. The nearby Bañuelo, a former hammam (bathhouse), also likely dates from this time, as does the former minaret of a mosque in the Albaicín, now part of the Church of San José.

Under the Zirid kings Habbus ibn Maksan and Badis, the most powerful figure was the Jewish administrator known as Samuel ha-Nagid (in Hebrew) or Isma&#x27;il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel was a highly educated member of the former elites of Cordoba, who fled that city after the outbreak of the Fitna. He eventually found his way to Granada, where Habbus ibn Maksan appointed him his secretary in 1020 and entrusted him with many important responsibilities, including tax collection. Under Badis, he even took charge of the army. During this period, the Muslim king was looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. Granada was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship. According to Daniel Eisenberg:

After Samuel&#x27;s death, his son Joseph took over after his position but proved to lack his father&#x27;s diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.

From the late 11th century to the early 13th century, Al-Andalus was dominated by two successive North African Berber empires. The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohads from 1166. Granada also served as an administrative capital of Almoravid rule in al-Andalus. Evidence from the artistic and archeological remains of this period suggest that the city thrived under the Almoravids but declined under the Almohads. Remnants of the Almohad period in the city include the Alcázar Genil, built in 1218–1219 (but later redecorated under the Nasrids), and possibly the former minaret attached to the present-day Church of San Juan de los Reyes in the Albaicin.

===Nasrid Emirate of Granada===
In 1228 Idris al-Ma&#x27;mun, the last effective Almohad ruler in al-Andalus, left the Iberian Peninsula. As Almohad rule collapsed local leaders and factions emerged across the region. With the &quot;Reconquista&quot; in full swing, the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon – under kings Ferdinand III and James I, respectively – made major conquests across al-Andalus. Castile captured Cordoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. Meanwhile, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar (Muhammad I) established what became the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids, who ruled the Emirate of Granada. On multiple occasions Ibn al-Ahmar aligned himself with Ferdinand III, eventually agreeing to become his vassal in 1246. Granada thereafter became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. The political history of the emirate was turbulent and intertwined with that of its neighbours. The Nasrids sometimes provided refuge or military aid to Castilian kings and noblemen, even against other Muslim states, while in turn the Castilians provided refuge and aid to some Nasrid emirs against other Nasrid rivals. On other occasions the Nasrids attempted to leverage the aid of the North African Marinids to ward off Castile, although Marinid interventions in the Peninsula ended after Battle of Rio Salado (1340).

The population of the emirate was also swollen by Muslim refugees from the territories newly conquered by Castile and Aragon, resulting in a small yet densely-populated territory which was more uniformly Muslim and Arabic-speaking than before. The city itself expanded and new neighbourhoods grew around the Albaicín (named after refugees from Baeza) and in Antequeruela (named after refugees from Antequera after 1410). A new set of walls was constructed further north during the 13th–14th centuries, with &quot;Bab Ilbirah&quot; (present-day &quot;Puerta de Elvira&quot;) as its western entrance. A major Muslim cemetery existed outside this gate. The city&#x27;s heart was its Great Mosque (on the site of the present-day Granada Cathedral) and the commercial district known as the &quot;qaysariyya&quot; (the Alcaicería). Next to this was the only major madrasa built in al-Andalus, the &quot;Madrasa al-Yusufiyya&quot; (known today as the Palacio de la Madraza), founded in 1349. Other monuments from this era include the &quot;al-Funduq al-Jadida&quot; (&quot;New Inn&quot; or caravanserai, now known as the Corral del Carbón), built in the early 14th century, the Maristan (hospital), built in 1365–1367 and demolished in 1843, and the main mosque of the Albaicín, dating from the 13th century.

When Ibn Al-Ahmar established himself in the city he moved the royal palace from the old Zirid citadel on the Albaicín hill to the Sabika hill, beginning construction on what became the present Alhambra. The Alhambra acted as a self-contained palace-city, with its own mosque, hammams, fortress, and residential quarters for workers and servants. The most celebrated palaces that survive today, such as the Comares Palace and the Palace of the Lions, generally date from the reigns of YusufI (r. 1333–1354) and his son MuhammadV (r. 1354–1391, with interruptions). Some smaller examples of Nasrid palace architecture in the city have survived in the Cuarto Real de Santo Domingo (late 13th century) and the Dar al-Horra (15th century).Partly due to the heavy tributary payments to Castile, Granada&#x27;s economy specialized in the trade of high-value goods. Integrated within the European mercantile network, the ports of the kingdom fostered intense trading relations with the Genoese, but also with the Catalans, and to a lesser extent, with the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Portuguese. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area.

Despite its frontier position, Granada was also an important Islamic intellectual and cultural center, especially in the time of MuhammadV, with figures such as Ibn Khaldun and Ibn al-Khatib serving in the Nasrid court. Ibn Battuta, a famous traveller and historian, visited the Emirate of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the &quot;metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.&quot;

=== End of Muslim rule and 16th-century changes ===

On 2 January 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII, known as &quot;Boabdil&quot; to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile), after the last episode of the Granada War.

The 1492 capitulation of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada&#x27;s history. It brought the demise of the last Muslim-controlled polity in the Iberian Peninsula. The terms of the surrender, outlined in the Treaty of Granada at the end of 1491, explicitly allowed the Muslim inhabitants, known as &quot;mudéjares&quot;, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. This had been a traditional practice during Castilian (and Aragonese) conquests of Muslim cities since the takeover of Toledo in the 11th century. The terms of the surrender pressured Jewish inhabitants to convert or leave within three years, but this provision was quickly superseded by the Alhambra Decree, issued only a few months later on March 31, which instead forced all Jews in Spain to convert or be expelled within four months. Those who converted became known as &quot;conversos&quot; (converts). This move, along with the progressive erosion of other guarantees provided by the surrender treaty, raised tensions and fears within the remaining Muslim community during the 1490s. Many of the city&#x27;s affluent Muslims and its traditional ruling classes emigrated to North Africa in the early years after the conquest, but these early emigrants numbered only a few thousand, with the rest of the population unable to afford leaving.

By 1499, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians and undertook a program of forced baptisms, creating the &quot;converso&quot; class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros&#x27;s new strategy, which was a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499–1501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southeast of the city. The rebellion lasted until 1500 in Granada and continued until 1501 in the Alpujarras. Responding to the rebellion of 1501, the Crown of Castile rescinded the Treaty of Granada, and mandated that Granada&#x27;s Muslims convert or emigrate. Many of the remaining Muslim elites subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada&#x27;s &quot;mudéjares&quot; converted (becoming the so-called &quot;moriscos&quot; or Moorish) so that they could stay. Both populations of converts were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy (the so-called &quot;marranos&quot; in the case of the &quot;conversos&quot; accused of the charge of crypto-Judaism).
Over the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants arrived from other regions of Castile, lured by the promise of economic opportunities in the newly conquered city. At the time of the city&#x27;s surrender in 1492 it had a population of 50,000 which included only a handful of Christians (mostly captives), but by 1561 (the year of the first royal census of the city) the population was composed of over 30,000 Christian immigrants and approximately 15,000 &quot;moriscos&quot;. After 1492 the city&#x27;s first churches had been installed in some converted mosques. The vast majority of the city&#x27;s remaining mosques were subsequently converted into churches during and after the mass conversions of 1500. In 1531, Charles V founded the University of Granada on the site of the former madrasa built by Yusuf I.

Granada&#x27;s Town Council did not fully establish until almost nine years after the Castilian conquest, upon the concession of the so-called &#x27;Constitutive Charter&#x27; of the Ayuntamiento of Granada on 23 September 1500. From then on, the municipal institution became a crucible for the &quot;Old Christian&quot; and the converted &quot;morisco&quot; elites, resulting in strong factionalism, particularly after 1508. The new period also saw the creation of a number of other new institutions such as the Cathedral Cabildo, the , the Royal Chapel and the Royal Chancellery. For the rest of the 16th century the Granadan ruling oligarchy featured roughly a 40% of (Jewish) &quot;conversos&quot; and about a 31% of &quot;hidalgos&quot;. From the 1520s onward, the mosque structures themselves began to be replaced with new church buildings, a process which continued for most of the century. In December 1568, during a period of renewed persecution against &quot;moriscos&quot;, the Second Morisco Rebellion broke out in the Alpujarras. Although the city&#x27;s &quot;morisco&quot; population played little role in the rebellion, King Philip II ordered the expulsion of the vast majority of the &quot;morisco&quot; population from the Kingdom of Granada, with the exception of those artisans and professionals judged essential to the economy. The expelled population was redistributed to other cities throughout the Crown of Castile. The final expulsion of all &quot;moriscos&quot; from Castile and Aragon was carried out between 1609 and 1614.

=== Later history and present day ===

During the 17th century, despite the importance of immigration, the population of the city stagnated at about 55,000, contrary to the trend of population increase experienced in the rural areas of the Kingdom of Granada, where the hammer of depopulation caused by the expulsion of the &quot;moriscos&quot; had taken a far greater toll in the previous century. The 17th-century demographic stagnation in the city and overall steady population increase in the wider kingdom went in line with the demographic disaster experienced throughout the century in the rest of the Crown of Castile. The city was overshadowed in importance by other cities including Seville and the capital, Madrid.

Between 1810 and 1812 Granada was occupied by Napoleon&#x27;s army during the Peninsular War. The French troops occupied the Alhambra as a fortified position and caused significant damage to the monument. Upon evacuating the city, they attempted to dynamite the whole complex, successfully blowing up eight towers before the remaining fuses were disabled by Spanish soldier José Garcia, thus saving what remains today. In 1830 Washington Irving lived in Granada and wrote his &quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot;, which revived some international interest in southern Spain and in its Islamic-era monuments.

In the 1930s the tensions that eventually divided Spain were evident in Granada, with frequent riots and friction between landowners and peasants. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Granada was one of the cities that joined the Nationalist uprising. There was local resistance against the Nationalists, particularly from the working classes in the Albaicín, which was violently repressed. During the 1950s and 1960s, under the Franco regime, the province of Granada was one of the poorest areas in Spain. In recent decades tourism has become a major industry in the city.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

The city of Granada sits on the Vega de Granada, one of the depressions or plains located within the Baetic mountain ranges, continued to the west by those of Archidona and Antequera and to the East by those of Guadix, Baza and Huéscar.

The fertile soil of the Vega, apt for agriculture, is irrigated by the water streams originated in Sierra Nevada, as well as minor secondary ranges, all drained by the catchment basin of the Genil River, that cuts across the city centre following an east to west direction. The Monachil, a left-bank tributary of the former, also passes through the city, discharging into the Genil to the west of the city centre.

===Climate===
Granada has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) close to a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at and dropping to around during the night. Frost is common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Snow is rare and occurs once every few years. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on June 13, 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6 °C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9 °C on June 14, 41.3 (June 15) and, eventually, 41.5 (June 17). The second extreme surge in temperatures followed roughly a month later when readings soared to 45.7 and 45.3 °C on July 12 and 13, respectively, surpassing the old July record by almost 3 degrees.



== Demographics ==

=== Urban areas ===
In the municipality of Granada there are five urban areas: Granada city, Alquería del Fargue, Bobadilla, Cerrillo de Maracena and Lancha del Genil. Due to the expansion of Granada city, Cerrillo de Maracena has been integrated into it.


=== Population pyramid ===
According to the municipal register of inhabitants, in 2021 the municipality of Granada had a population of 231,775 people, of whom 106,987 were men (46.15%) and 124,738 were women (53.85%). Since the 90&#x27;s, there has been a slight decrease in the population of Granada city, in favour of smaller towns in the metropolitan area.

According to the population pyramid:

* People younger than 20 years old are 19% of the total population
* People between 20 and 40 years old are 23%
* People between 40 and 60 years old are 29%
* People older than 60 years old are 29%

== Politics and administration ==
=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===
Granada&#x27;s metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.

=== Capital of Granada Province ===
The city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andalucía, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.

=== Judicial administration ===
The headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.

Most of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows:

* Superior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.
* Provincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3.
* Courts

=== Municipal organization ===
Its political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors.

In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. Luis Salvador, leader of Citizens, became mayor with support from the PP and Vox. Salvador resigned in 2021, having lost the support of the PP. He was succeeded by the Socialist Francisco Cuenca who had previously served as mayor from 2016-2019. In the 2023 Spanish local elections Cuenca was ousted by Marifrán Carazo of the PP. Carazo increased the PP&#x27;s number of seats from 7 to 14, gaining her a slim majority and making her the first female mayor of the city.

=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===
The municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.

==Culture==
===Heritage and monuments===
====Alhambra====
The Alhambra is a fortified palace complex located on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of the Sierra Nevada which overlooks the city of Granada. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic Islamic world, in addition to containing notable examples of Spanish Renaissance architecture. It is one of Spain&#x27;s major tourist attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.

The complex was begun in 1238 by MuhammadI Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir, on the site of earlier fortresses and of the 11th-century palace of vizier Samuel ibn Naghrillah. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site, most notably during the reigns of YusufI and MuhammadV in the 14th century. During this era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of Granada below. It contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a Friday mosque, hammams (public baths), roads, houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where they commanded views over the Albaicín quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the Mexuar, the Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the Alhambra&#x27;s western tip is the Alcazaba fortress, the centerpiece of its defensive system. The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over previous centuries. Decoration is focused on the inside of the building and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls. Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic calligraphy were the main types of decorative motifs. Additionally, &quot;stalactite&quot;-like sculpting, known as &quot;muqarnas&quot;, was used for three-dimensional features like vaulted ceilings.

After the conclusion of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, Charles V commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace, now known as the Palace of Charles V, in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century. Other notable Renaissance additions from the reign of CharlesV include the Emperor&#x27;s Chambers and the &quot;Peinador de la Reina&quot; (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s Robing Room&#x27;), which are connected to the former Nasrid Palaces.

In the 18th century the Alhambra fell into severe neglect and parts of it were demolished by French troops in 1812. Through the course of the 19th century, the Alhambra was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by British, American, and other European Romantic travelers and intellectuals. The most influential of them was Washington Irving, whose &quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; (1832) brought international attention to the site. The Alhambra became one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century, a process which continues today. 
====Generalife====
The Generalife is a Nasrid-era country estate or summer palace located just east of the Alhambra, on a sloping site above it. It was first built by Muhammad II and Muhammad III in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. This palace features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end and it was originally linked to the Alhambra by a walled corridor that crosses the valley between the two. It underwent modifications and redecoration under multiple later Nasrid rulers.

The Generalife also underwent major alterations by Christian Spanish builders in the 16th century, which imparted Renaissance elements on the palace. In the 20th century a large area of modern landscaped gardens, known as the &quot;Jardines Nuevos&quot; (&#x27;New Gardens&#x27;), were added to the south of the Nasrid palace and form the main approach to it today. These date in large part to the work of Leopoldo Torres Balbás and Francisco Prieto Moreno, between 1931 and 1951, who incorporated both Italian and Moorish influences in their design. An open-air auditorium was also added in 1952. Along with the Alhambra, the Generalife is a major tourist attraction and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.

====Cathedral====
The cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Hontañón and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chancillería (Supreme Court).

The church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.

The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main façade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601–1667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator José Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.

Highlights of the church&#x27;s components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Siloé.

====Royal Chapel====

The Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (&quot;Juana la Loca&quot;) and her husband Felipe I (&quot;Felipe el Hermoso&quot;). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.

The Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Interés Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.

====Albayzín====
The historic neighbourhood, located on the hillsides north of the Alhambra, still retains much of its medieval street plan dating back to the Nasrid period, although it has undergone physical and demographic changes since then. Archeological evidence indicates that Iberians inhabited the main hill of the present-day Albaicin towards the 7th centuryBC and that a significant town was located here during the Roman period. During the early Islamic period, up to the 10th century, the location hosted only the small settlement of &quot;Gharnāṭa&quot; (Granada), until in the 11th century the creation of the Zirid Taifa kingdom transformed the location into one of the most important cities in Al-Andalus. During this period, the city&#x27;s main citadel and palace, the &quot;al-Qaṣaba al-Qadīma&quot; (&quot;Old Citadel&quot;), was located on the top of this hill. During the Nasrid period, the citadel was moved to the Alhambra and the old district became known as (), from which its present name derives. Among the various Nasrid-period houses and other structures, one notable establishment was the Maristan, a type of historic hospital (bimaristan) which also took care of the mentally ill.

Through the course of the 16th century, after the surrender of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the district underwent some of the some changes that occurred throughout the city. Mosques were replaced with new parish churches, particularly after 1501. These new churches were often built in a mix of Mudéjar and Renaissance styles, such as the Church of Santa Ana, the Church of San Cristóbal, and the Church of San Miguel Bajo, among others. Some, like the churches of San Salvador, San José, and San Juan de los Reyes, preserve parts of former mosques. New civic institutions were also built in this area, such as the Royal Chancellery (&quot;Real Chancillería&quot;), which overlooks Plaza Nueva, a wide public square expanded during the 16th century.

During the 16th century most of the city&#x27;s &quot;morisco&quot; population was concentrated in the Albaicín, but after the 1568 rebellion and their subsequent expulsion, the district was depopulated. As a result, many of the remaining Christian residents expanded their residences to form &quot;carmen&quot;s, traditional semi-rural houses with gardens or orchards, many examples of which survive today. Some of these houses and mansions, such as Casa de Zafra and the Dar al-Horra, date back to the Nasrid period. In 1994 the UNESCO World Heritage Site encompassing the Alhambra was extended to incorporate the Albaicín as well. In addition to its historic houses and mansions, churches, and the Royal Chancellery, the district also preserves sections of the 11th-century Zirid city walls (part of the former Zirid citadel), the 14th-century Nasrid walls, the Bañuelo (a former Islamic-era bathhouse), and numerous cisterns from the Islamic period that were part of a water supply system providing water to most of the city&#x27;s houses.

====Sacromonte====

The Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valparaíso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco &quot;cantes&quot; and &quot;quejíos&quot;, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.

At the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.

The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th–18th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the &quot;Crucificado de Risueño&quot;, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.

====Charterhouse====
The Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called &quot;Aynadamar&quot; (&quot;fountain of tears&quot;) that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, known as El Gran Capitán. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.

The Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendizábal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.

The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan Sánchez Cotán and the chancel&#x27;s glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods, and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.

The church&#x27;s tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the Córdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.

The courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.

Mosque of Granada

The Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicolás. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque&#x27;s initial funding was supplied by Shaykh &#x27;Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada&#x27;s new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Islámica en España) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.

====Palace of the Marqués de Salar====
The Palace of the Marqués de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqués de Salar, great-grandson of both Hernán Pérez del Pulgar (known by the name of &quot;El de la Hazañas&quot; [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (&quot;El Gran Capitán&quot; [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with of floor space on two floors and of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.

===Gastronomy===

The gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the &quot;traditional cuisine of Granada&quot;, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently, there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.

The climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables, meats and sausages, and fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.

The famous and reputed Trevélez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.

Ham and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauteed before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning &quot;papas a lo pobre&quot;, potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.

Among the stews and potajes, the pot of San Antón stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land.

Confectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the &quot;pestiños&quot; of Vélez or those of the &quot;Encarnación&quot;, the puff pastries of San Jerónimo, the ovos moles of San Antón, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, &quot;cocas&quot;, &quot;roscos&quot; from Santo Tomas and &quot;mantecados&quot;. Aljojábanas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called , as well as fig bread, Moorish &quot;roscos&quot; and an almond cake called &quot;soyá&quot; are all of Arabic heritage.

Unlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada &quot;tapas&quot; (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. &quot;Bar hopping&quot; (&quot;Ir de tapas&quot;) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.

<text>The Viceroyalty of the New Kingdom of Granada ( ), also called Viceroyalty of New Granada or Viceroyalty of Santa Fe, was the name given on 27 May 1717 to the jurisdiction of the Spanish Empire in northern South America, corresponding to modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela. Created in 1717 by King Felipe V, as part of a new territorial control policy, it was suspended in 1723 for financial problems and was restored in 1739 until the independence movement suspended it again in 1810. The territory corresponding to Panama was incorporated later in 1739, and the provinces of Venezuela were separated from the Viceroyalty and assigned to the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777. In addition to those core areas, the territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada included Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, southwestern Suriname, parts of northwestern Brazil, and northern Peru. A strip along the Atlantic Ocean in Mosquito Coast was added by the Royal Decree of 20 November 1803, but the British battled for administrative control.

== Colonial history ==

Two centuries after the establishment of the New Kingdom of Granada in the 16th century, whose governor was dependent upon the Viceroy of Peru at Lima, and an &quot;audiencia&quot; at Santa Fe de Bogotá (today capital of the republic of Colombia), the slowness of communications between the two capitals led to the creation of an independent Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717 (and its reestablishment in 1739 after a short interruption). Other provinces corresponding to modern Ecuador, the eastern and southern parts of today&#x27;s Venezuela, and Panama came together in a political unit under the jurisdiction of Bogotá, confirming that city as one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with Lima and Mexico City. Sporadic attempts at reform were directed at increasing efficiency and centralizing authority, but control from Spain was never very effective.

The rough and diverse geography of northern South America and the limited range of proper roads made travel and communications within the viceroyalty difficult. The establishment of an autonomous Captaincy General in Caracas in 1777 and the preservation of the older Audiencia of Quito, nominally subject to the Viceroy but for most purposes independent, was a response to the necessities of effectively governing the peripheral regions. Some analysts also consider that these measures reflected a degree of local traditions that eventually contributed to the differing political and national differences among these territories once they became independent in the nineteenth century and which the unifying efforts of Simón Bolívar could not overcome.

=== Guajira rebellion ===

The Spanish had never subjugated the Wayuu. The two groups were in a more or less permanent state of war. There had been rebellions in 1701 (when they destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Wayuus attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761 and 1768. In 1718, Governor Soto de Herrera called them &quot;barbarians, horse thieves, worthy of death, without God, without law, and without a king.&quot; Of all the Indians in the territory of Colombia, the Wayuu were unique in having learned the use of firearms and horses.

In 1769 the Spanish took 22 Wayuus captive, in order to put them to work building the fortifications of Cartagena. The reaction of the Wayuus was unexpected. On 2 May 1769, at El Rincón, near Riohacha, they set their village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it. They also captured the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rincón to capture the Wayuus. At the head of this force was José Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed.
This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Messía, at the peak, there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others were taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra&#x27;s relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements caused the rebellion to fade away, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.

== Administrative divisions ==

=== New Kingdom of Granada &quot;&quot; ===
The Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogotá was established in 1549, but became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. It was re-incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru from 1723 to 1739. It met in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá until it was disestablished in 1810. It was briefly re-established between 1816 and 1819. It had the following provinces under its authority:

== Independent history ==
The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful independence struggle led mainly by Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander in neighboring Venezuela. Bolívar returned to New Granada only in 1819 after establishing himself as leader of the pro-independence forces in the Venezuelan &quot;llanos&quot;. From there Bolivar led an army over the Andes and captured New Granada after a quick campaign that ended at the Battle of Boyacá, on 7 August 1819, finally proclaimed independence in 1821. The pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.

The territories of the viceroyalty gained full de facto independence from Spain between 1819 and 1822 after a series of military and political struggles, uniting in a republic now known as Gran Colombia.

With the dissolution of Gran Colombia, the states of Ecuador, Venezuela, and the Republic of New Granada were created. The Republic of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá, lasted from 1831 to 1856. The name &quot;Colombia&quot; reappeared in the &quot;United States of Colombia&quot;; the new name for the country having been introduced by a liberal government after a civil war. The use of the term &quot;New Granada&quot; survived in conservative circles, such as among ecclesiastics.

== Demographics ==
In the 1778 census, New Granada had a population of around 1,280,000, around 40% of the population being Indians with around 500,000 people, with the next largest group being free Mestizos and Africans at around 400,000, then Whites with close to 300,000, and the smallest group at around 70,000 people being slaves. However, in the current territory of Colombia, it was estimated that the population was 826,550.
New Granada was estimated to have 2,150,000 inhabitants in 1810.

<doc id="38267" wikidata="Q929302" url="?curid=38267" title="Dimension (vector space)">
<text>In mathematics, the dimension of a vector space &quot;V&quot; is the cardinality (i.e., the number of vectors) of a basis of &quot;V&quot; over its base field. It is sometimes called Hamel dimension (after Georg Hamel) or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other types of dimension.

For every vector space there exists a basis, and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality; as a result, the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined. We say formula_1 is &#x27; if the dimension of formula_1 is , and &#x27; if its dimension is infinite.

The dimension of the vector space formula_1 over the field formula_4 can be written as formula_5 or as formula_6 read &quot;dimension of formula_1 over formula_4&quot;. When formula_4 can be inferred from context, formula_10 is typically written.

== Examples ==

The vector space formula_11 has
formula_12
as a standard basis, and therefore formula_13 More generally, formula_14 and even more generally, formula_15 for any field formula_16 

The complex numbers formula_17 are both a real and complex vector space; we have formula_18 and formula_19 So the dimension depends on the base field.

The only vector space with dimension formula_20 is formula_21 the vector space consisting only of its zero element.

== Properties ==

If formula_22 is a linear subspace of formula_1 then formula_24

To show that two finite-dimensional vector spaces are equal, the following criterion can be used: if formula_1 is a finite-dimensional vector space and formula_22 is a linear subspace of formula_1 with formula_28 then formula_29 

The space formula_30 has the standard basis formula_31 where formula_32 is the formula_33-th column of the corresponding identity matrix. Therefore, formula_30 has dimension formula_35

Any two finite dimensional vector spaces over formula_4 with the same dimension are isomorphic. Any bijective map between their bases can be uniquely extended to a bijective linear map between the vector spaces. If formula_37 is some set, a vector space with dimension formula_38 over formula_4 can be constructed as follows: take the set formula_40 of all functions formula_41 such that formula_42 for all but finitely many formula_43 in formula_44 These functions can be added and multiplied with elements of formula_4 to obtain the desired formula_4-vector space.

An important result about dimensions is given by the rank–nullity theorem for linear maps.

If formula_47 is a field extension, then formula_4 is in particular a vector space over formula_49 Furthermore, every formula_4-vector space formula_1 is also a formula_52-vector space. The dimensions are related by the formula
formula_53
In particular, every complex vector space of dimension formula_54 is a real vector space of dimension formula_55

Some formulae relate the dimension of a vector space with the cardinality of the base field and the cardinality of the space itself.
If formula_1 is a vector space over a field formula_4 and if the dimension of formula_1 is denoted by formula_59 then:

:If dim formula_1 is finite then formula_61
:If dim formula_1 is infinite then formula_63

== Generalizations ==

A vector space can be seen as a particular case of a matroid, and in the latter there is a well-defined notion of dimension. The length of a module and the rank of an abelian group both have several properties similar to the dimension of vector spaces.

The Krull dimension of a commutative ring, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899–1971), is defined to be the maximal number of strict inclusions in an increasing chain of prime ideals in the ring.

=== Trace ===
The dimension of a vector space may alternatively be characterized as the trace of the identity operator. For instance, 
formula_64 
This appears to be a circular definition, but it allows useful generalizations.

Firstly, it allows for a definition of a notion of dimension when one has a trace but no natural sense of basis. For example, one may have an algebra formula_65 with maps formula_66 (the inclusion of scalars, called the &quot;unit&quot;) and a map formula_67 (corresponding to trace, called the &quot;counit&quot;). The composition formula_68 is a scalar (being a linear operator on a 1-dimensional space) corresponds to &quot;trace of identity&quot;, and gives a notion of dimension for an abstract algebra. In practice, in bialgebras, this map is required to be the identity, which can be obtained by normalizing the counit by dividing by dimension (formula_69), so in these cases the normalizing constant corresponds to dimension.

Alternatively, it may be possible to take the trace of operators on an infinite-dimensional space; in this case a (finite) trace is defined, even though no (finite) dimension exists, and gives a notion of &quot;dimension of the operator&quot;. These fall under the rubric of &quot;trace class operators&quot; on a Hilbert space, or more generally nuclear operators on a Banach space.

A subtler generalization is to consider the trace of a &quot;family&quot; of operators as a kind of &quot;twisted&quot; dimension. This occurs significantly in representation theory, where the character of a representation is the trace of the representation, hence a scalar-valued function on a group formula_70 whose value on the identity formula_71 is the dimension of the representation, as a representation sends the identity in the group to the identity matrix: formula_72 The other values formula_73 of the character can be viewed as &quot;twisted&quot; dimensions, and find analogs or generalizations of statements about dimensions to statements about characters or representations. A sophisticated example of this occurs in the theory of monstrous moonshine: the formula_74-invariant is the graded dimension of an infinite-dimensional graded representation of the monster group, and replacing the dimension with the character gives the McKay–Thompson series for each element of the Monster group.

<text>Nicotine is a naturally produced alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants (most predominantly in tobacco and &quot;Duboisia hopwoodii&quot;) and is widely used recreationally as a stimulant and anxiolytic. As a pharmaceutical drug, it is used for smoking cessation to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist.

Nicotine constitutes approximately 0.6–3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco. Nicotine is also present at ppb concentrations in edible plants in the family Solanaceae, including potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants, though sources disagree on whether this has any biological significance to human consumers. It functions as an antiherbivore toxin; consequently, nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past, and neonicotinoids (structurally similar to nicotine), such as imidacloprid, are some of the most effective and widely used insecticides.

Nicotine is highly addictive. Slow-release forms (gums and patches, when used correctly) can be less addictive and help in quitting. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors present in tobacco smoke may enhance nicotine&#x27;s addictive properties. An average cigarette yields about 2 mg of absorbed nicotine.
The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500–1,000 mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5–13 mg/kg). Nicotine addiction involves drug-reinforced behavior, compulsive use, and relapse following abstinence. Nicotine dependence involves tolerance, sensitization, physical dependence, and psychological dependence, which can cause distress. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include depression, stress, anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Mild nicotine withdrawal symptoms are measurable in unrestricted smokers, who experience normal moods only as their blood nicotine levels peak, with each cigarette. On quitting, withdrawal symptoms worsen sharply, then gradually improve to a normal state.

Nicotine use as a tool for quitting smoking has a good safety history. Animal studies suggest that nicotine may adversely affect cognitive development in adolescence, but the relevance of these findings to human brain development is disputed. At low amounts, it has a mild analgesic effect. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, &quot;nicotine is not generally considered to be a carcinogen&quot;.
The Surgeon General of the United States indicates that evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between exposure to nicotine and risk for cancer. Nicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in humans and is considered a teratogen. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. High doses are known to cause nicotine poisoning, organ failure, and death through paralysis of respiratory muscles, though serious or fatal overdoses are rare.

==Uses==
===Medical===

The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is treating nicotine dependence to eliminate smoking and the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through gums, dermal patches, lozenges, inhalers, or nasal sprays to wean them off their dependence. A 2018 Cochrane Collaboration review found high-quality evidence that all current forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, patch, lozenges, inhaler, and nasal spray) increase the chances of successfully quitting smoking by , regardless of setting.

Combining nicotine patch use with a faster acting nicotine replacement, like gum or spray, improves the odds of treatment success.

In contrast to recreational nicotine products, which have been designed to maximize the likelihood of addiction, nicotine replacement products (NRTs) are designed to minimize addictiveness. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk.

===Pesticide===
Nicotine has been used as an insecticide since at least 1690, in the form of tobacco extracts or as pure nicotine sulphate (although other components of tobacco also seem to have pesticide effects). It acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and gave the receptor its name. Nicotine is in IRAC group 4B. Nicotine insecticides have been banned in the US since 2014, including use on organic crops, and caution is recommended for small gardeners. Nicotine pesticides have been banned in the EU since 2009. Foods are imported from countries in which nicotine pesticides are allowed, such as China, but foods may not exceed maximum nicotine levels. Neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, which are derived from and structurally similar to nicotine, are widely used as agricultural and veterinary pesticides as of 2016.

===Performance===
Nicotine-containing products are sometimes used for the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine on cognition. A 2010 meta-analysis of 41 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concluded that nicotine or smoking had significant positive effects on aspects of fine motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. A 2015 review noted that stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic receptor is responsible for certain improvements in attentional performance; among the nicotinic receptor subtypes, nicotine has the highest binding affinity at the α4β2 receptor (ki=1 ), which is also the biological target that mediates nicotine&#x27;s addictive properties. Nicotine has potential beneficial effects, but it also has paradoxical effects, which may be due to the inverted U-shape of the dose-response curve or pharmacokinetic features.

===Recreational===
Nicotine is used as a recreational drug. It is widely used, highly addictive and hard to discontinue. Nicotine is often used compulsively, and dependence can develop within days. Recreational drug users commonly use nicotine for its mood-altering effects. Recreational nicotine products include chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, snuff, pipe tobacco, snus, and nicotine pouches.

Alcohol infused with nicotine is called nicotini.

==Contraindications==
Nicotine use for tobacco cessation has few contraindications.

It is not known whether nicotine replacement therapy is effective for smoking cessation in adolescents, as of 2014. It is therefore not recommended to adolescents. It is not safe to use nicotine during pregnancy or breastfeeding, although it is safer than smoking. The desirability of NRT use in pregnancy is therefore debated.

Randomized trials and observational studies of nicotine replacement therapy in cardiovascular patients show no increase in adverse cardiovascular events compared to those treated with placebo. Using nicotine products during cancer treatment may be contraindicated, as nicotine may promote tumour growth, but temporary use of NRTs to quit smoking may be advised for harm reduction.

Nicotine gum is contraindicated in individuals with temporomandibular joint disease. People with chronic nasal disorders and severe reactive airway disease require additional precautions when using nicotine nasal sprays. Nicotine in any form is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to nicotine.

==Adverse effects==

Nicotine is classified as a poison, and it is &quot;extremely hazardous&quot;. However, at doses typically used by consumers, it presents little if any hazard to the user. A 2018 Cochrane Collaboration review lists nine main adverse events related to nicotine replacement therapy: headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, abnormal dreams, non-ischemic palpitations and chest pain, skin reactions, oral/nasal reactions, and hiccups. Many of these were also common in the placebo group without nicotine. Palpitations and chest pain were deemed &quot;rare&quot; and there was no evidence of an increased number of serious cardiac problems compared to the placebo group, even in people with established cardiac disease. The common side effects from nicotine exposure are listed in the table below. Serious adverse events due to the use of nicotine replacement therapy are extremely rare. At low amounts, it has a mild analgesic effect. However, at sufficiently high doses, nicotine may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradycardia, and possibly seizures, hypoventilation, and death.
===Sleep===
Nicotine reduces the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and total sleep time in healthy nonsmokers given nicotine via a transdermal patch, and the reduction is dose-dependent. Acute nicotine intoxication has been found to significantly reduce total sleep time and increase REM latency, sleep onset latency, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep time. Depressive non-smokers experience mood and sleep improvements under nicotine administration; however, subsequent nicotine withdrawal has a negative effect on both mood and sleep.

===Cardiovascular system===

Nicotine exerts several significant effects on the cardiovascular system. Primarily, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of catecholamines. This activation results in an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as enhanced myocardial contractility, which raises the workload on the heart. Additionally, nicotine causes systemic vasoconstriction, including constriction of coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart. Long-term exposure to nicotine may impair endothelial function, potentially contributing to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, nicotine has been associated with the development of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in individuals who already have underlying heart disease.

The effects of nicotine can be differentiated between short-term and long-term use. Short-term nicotine use, such as that associated with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation, appears to pose little cardiovascular risk, even for patients with known cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, longer-term nicotine use may not accelerate atherosclerosis but could contribute to acute cardiovascular events in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Many severe cardiovascular effects traditionally associated with smoking may not be solely attributable to nicotine itself. Cigarette smoke contains numerous other potentially cardiotoxic substances, including carbon monoxide and oxidant gases.

A 2016 review of the cardiovascular toxicity of nicotine concluded, &quot;Based on current knowledge, we believe that the cardiovascular risks of nicotine from e-cigarette use in people without cardiovascular disease are quite low. We have concerns that nicotine from e-cigarettes could pose some risk for users with cardiovascular disease.&quot;

A 2018 Cochrane review found that, in rare cases, nicotine replacement therapy can cause non-ischemic chest pain (i.e., chest pain that is unrelated to a heart attack) and heart palpitations, but does not increase the incidence of serious cardiac adverse events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death) relative to controls.

====Blood pressure====
In the short term, nicotine causes a transient increase in blood pressure. Long term, epidemiological studies generally show increased blood pressure and hypertension among nicotine users.

===Reinforcement disorders===

Nicotine is highly addictive but paradoxically has quite weak reinforcing property compared to other drugs of abuse in various animals. Its addictiveness depends on how it is administered and also depends upon form in which nicotine is used. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, acetaldehyde and other constituents in tobacco smoke may enhance its addictiveness. Nicotine dependence involves aspects of both psychological dependence and physical dependence, since discontinuation of extended use has been shown to produce both affective (e.g., anxiety, irritability, craving, anhedonia) and somatic (mild motor dysfunctions such as tremor) withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms peak in one to three days and can persist for several weeks. Even though other drugs of dependence can have withdrawal states lasting 6 months or longer, this does not appear to occur with cigarette withdrawal.

Normal between-cigarettes discontinuation, in unrestricted smokers, causes mild but measurable nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These include mildly worse mood, stress, anxiety, cognition, and sleep, all of which briefly return to normal with the next cigarette. Smokers have a worse mood than they typically would have if they were not nicotine-dependent; they experience normal moods only immediately after smoking. Nicotine dependence is associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration among smokers.

In dependent smokers, withdrawal causes impairments in memory and attention, and smoking during withdrawal returns these cognitive abilities to pre-withdrawal levels. The temporarily increased cognitive levels of smokers after inhaling smoke are offset by periods of cognitive decline during nicotine withdrawal. Therefore, the overall daily cognitive levels of smokers and non-smokers are roughly similar.

Nicotine activates the mesolimbic pathway and induces long-term ΔFosB expression (i.e., produces phosphorylated ΔFosB isoforms) in the nucleus accumbens when inhaled or injected frequently or at high doses, but not necessarily when ingested. Consequently, high daily exposure (possibly excluding oral route) to nicotine can cause ΔFosB overexpression in the nucleus accumbens, resulting in nicotine addiction.

===Cancer===

Contrary to popular belief, nicotine itself does not cause cancer in humans, although it is unclear whether it functions as a tumor promoter . A 2018 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concludes, &quot;[w]hile it is biologically plausible that nicotine can act as a tumor promoter, the existing body of evidence indicates this is unlikely to translate into increased risk of human cancer.&quot;

Although nicotine is classified as a non-carcinogenic substance, it can still promote tumor growth and metastasis. It induces several processes that contribute to cancer progression, including cell cycle progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis. These effects are primarily mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 subtype, and to a lesser extent, β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). Activation of these receptors triggers several signaling cascades crucial in cancer biology, notably the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling.

Nicotine promotes lung cancer development by enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via nAChRs, which are present in lung cancer cells. Additionally, nicotine-induced EMT contributes to drug resistance in cancer cells.

Nicotine in tobacco can form carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines through a nitrosation reaction. This occurs mostly in the curing and processing of tobacco. However, nicotine in the mouth and stomach can react to form N-nitrosonornicotine, a known type 1 carcinogen, suggesting that consumption of non-tobacco forms of nicotine may still play a role in carcinogenesis.

===Genotoxicity===

Nicotine causes DNA damage in several types of human cells as judged by assays for genotoxicity such as the comet assay, cytokinesis-block micronucleus test and chromosome aberrations test. In humans, this damage can happen in primary parotid gland cells, lymphocytes, and respiratory tract cells.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Nicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in some animal species, but not others; consequently, it is considered to be a possible teratogen in humans. In animal studies that resulted in birth defects, researchers found that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes; the negative effects on early brain development are associated with abnormalities in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter system function. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke.

Nicotine exposure &quot;in utero&quot; is responsible for several complications of pregnancy and birth: pregnant women who smoke are at greater risk for both miscarriage and stillbirth and infants exposed to nicotine &quot;in utero&quot; tend to have lower birth weights. A McMaster University research group observed in 2010 that rats exposed to nicotine in the womb (via parenteral infusion) later in life had conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility.

==Overdose==
It is unlikely that a person would overdose on nicotine through smoking alone. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2013 that there are no significant safety concerns associated with the use of more than one form of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy at the same time, or using OTC NRT at the same time as another nicotine-containing product, like cigarettes. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. Nevertheless, nicotine has a relatively high toxicity in comparison to many other alkaloids such as caffeine, which has an LD50 of 127 mg/kg when administered to mice. At sufficiently high doses, it is associated with nicotine poisoning, which, while common in children (in whom poisonous and lethal levels occur at lower doses per kilogram of body weight) rarely results in significant morbidity or death. The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500–1,000 mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5–13 mg/kg).

The initial symptoms of a nicotine overdose typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), tachypnea (rapid breathing), headache, dizziness, pallor (pale skin), auditory or visual disturbances, and perspiration, followed shortly after by marked bradycardia (slow heart rate), bradypnea (slow breathing), and hypotension (low blood pressure). An increased respiratory rate (i.e., tachypnea) is one of the primary signs of nicotine poisoning. At sufficiently high doses, somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness), confusion, syncope (loss of consciousness from fainting), shortness of breath, marked weakness, seizures, and coma may occur. Lethal nicotine poisoning rapidly produces seizures, and death – which may occur within minutes – is believed to be due to respiratory paralysis.

===Toxicity===
Today nicotine is less commonly used in agricultural insecticides, which was a main source of poisoning. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products, or ingestion of nicotine-containing plants. People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience GTS, a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced tobacco harvesters who do not consume tobacco. People can be exposed to nicotine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At environmental levels of 5 mg/m3, nicotine is immediately dangerous to life and health.
==Drug interactions==
===Pharmacodynamic===
* Potential interaction with sympathomimetic drugs (adrenergic agonists) and sympatholytic drugs (alpha-blockers and beta-blockers).

===Pharmacokinetic===
Nicotine and cigarette smoke both induce the expression of liver enzymes (e.g., certain cytochrome P450 proteins) which metabolize drugs, leading to the potential for alterations in drug metabolism.
* &quot;Smoking cessation&quot; may decrease the metabolism of acetaminophen, beta-blockers, caffeine, oxazepam, pentazocine, propoxyphene, theophylline, and tricyclic antidepressants, leading to higher plasma concentrations of these drugs.
* Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through the skin from the transdermal nicotine patch by drugs that cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction.
* Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through the nasal cavity from the nicotine nasal spray by nasal vasoconstrictors (e.g., xylometazoline).
* Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through oral mucosa from nicotine gum and lozenges by food and drink that modify salivary pH.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist. Such antagonism results in mild analgesia.

====Central nervous system====

By binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, nicotine elicits its psychoactive effects and increases the levels of several neurotransmitters in various brain structures – acting as a sort of &quot;volume control&quot;. Nicotine has a higher affinity for nicotinic receptors in the brain than those in skeletal muscle, though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis. Nicotine&#x27;s selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes. Nicotine is unusual in comparison to most drugs, as its profile changes from stimulant to sedative with increasing dosages, a phenomenon known as &quot;Nesbitt&#x27;s paradox&quot; after the doctor who first described it in 1969. At very high doses it dampens neuronal activity. Nicotine induces both behavioral stimulation and anxiety in animals. Research into nicotine&#x27;s most predominant metabolite, cotinine, suggests that some of nicotine&#x27;s psychoactive effects are mediated by cotinine.

Nicotine activates nicotinic receptors (particularly α4β2 nicotinic receptors, but also α5 nAChRs) on neurons that innervate the ventral tegmental area and within the mesolimbic pathway where it appears to cause the release of dopamine. This nicotine-induced dopamine release occurs at least partially through activation of the cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link in the ventral tegmental area. Nicotine can modulate the firing rate of the ventral tegmental area neurons. These actions are largely responsible for the strongly reinforcing effects of nicotine, which often occur in the absence of euphoria; however, mild euphoria from nicotine use can occur in some individuals. Chronic nicotine use inhibits class I and II histone deacetylases in the striatum, where this effect plays a role in nicotine addiction.

====Sympathetic nervous system====

Nicotine also activates the sympathetic nervous system, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulating the release of epinephrine. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream.

====Adrenal medulla====
By binding to ganglion type nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla, nicotine increases flow of adrenaline (epinephrine), a stimulating hormone and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and thus the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream. The release of epinephrine (adrenaline) causes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and respiration, as well as higher blood glucose levels.

===Pharmacokinetics===
As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and crosses the blood–brain barrier reaching the brain within 10–20 seconds after inhalation. The elimination half-life of nicotine in the body is around two hours. Nicotine is primarily excreted in urine and urinary concentrations vary depending upon urine flow rate and urine pH.

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. However, it has been found that the nicotine yield of individual products has only a small effect (4.4%) on the blood concentration of nicotine, suggesting &quot;the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation&quot;.

Nicotine has a half-life of 1–2 hours. Cotinine is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood with a half-life of 18–20 hours, making it easier to analyze.

Nicotine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6) and FMO3, which selectively metabolizes (&quot;S&quot;)-nicotine. A major metabolite is cotinine. Other primary metabolites include nicotine &quot;N&quot;-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as myosmine.

Glucuronidation and oxidative metabolism of nicotine to cotinine are both inhibited by menthol, an additive to mentholated cigarettes, thus increasing the half-life of nicotine &quot;in vivo&quot;.

===Metabolism===
Nicotine decreases hunger and as a consequence food consumption, alongside increasing energy expenditure. The majority of research shows that nicotine reduces body weight, but some researchers have found that nicotine may result in weight gain under specific types of eating habits in animal models. Nicotine effect on weight appears to result from nicotine&#x27;s stimulation of α3β4 nAChR receptors located in the POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus and subsequently the melanocortin system, especially the melanocortin-4 receptors on second-order neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, thus modulating feeding inhibition. POMC neurons are a precursor of the melanocortin system, a critical regulator of body weight and peripheral tissue such as skin and hair.

==Chemistry==
Nicotine is a hygroscopic, colorless to yellow-brown, oily liquid, that is readily soluble in alcohol, ether or light petroleum. It is miscible with water in its neutral amine base form between 60 °C and 210 °C. It is a dibasic nitrogenous base, having Kb1=1×10−6, Kb2=1×10−11. It readily forms ammonium salts with acids that are usually solid and water-soluble. Its flash point is 95 °C and its auto-ignition temperature is 244 °C. Nicotine is readily volatile (vapor pressure 5.5 Pa at 25 °C) On exposure to ultraviolet light or various oxidizing agents, nicotine is converted to nicotine oxide, nicotinic acid (niacin, a B3 vitamer), and methylamine.

Nicotine is chiral and hence optically active, having two enantiomeric forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is levorotatory with a specific rotation of [α]D=–166.4° ((−)-nicotine). The dextrorotatory form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (−)-nicotine. (−)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine. The salts of (−)-nicotine are usually dextrorotatory; this conversion between levorotatory and dextrorotatory upon protonation is common among alkaloids. The hydrochloride and sulfate salts become optically inactive if heated in a closed vessel above 180 °C. Anabasine is a structural isomer of nicotine, as both compounds have the molecular formula .

Nicotine that is found in natural tobacco is primarily (99%) the S-enantiomer.  Conversely, the most common chemistry synthetic methods for generating nicotine yields a product that is approximately equal proportions of the S- and R-enantiomers. This suggests that tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine can be determined by measuring the ratio of the two different enantiomers, although means exist for adjusting the relative levels of the enantiomers or performing a synthesis that only leads to the S-enantiomer. There is limited data on the relative physiological effects of these two enantiomers, especially in people. However, the studies to date indicate that (S)-nicotine is more potent than (R)-nicotine and (S)-nicotine causes stronger sensations or irritation than (R)-nicotine. Studies have not been adequate to determine the relative addictiveness of the two enantiomers in people. 

Pod mod electronic cigarettes use nicotine in the form of a protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier generations.

===Preparation===
The first laboratory preparation of nicotine (as its racemate) was described in 1904.

The starting material was an N-substituted pyrrole derivative, which was heated to convert it by a [1,5] sigmatropic shift to the isomer with a carbon bond between the pyrrole and pyridine rings, followed by methylation and selective reduction of the pyrrole ring using tin and hydrochloric acid. Many other syntheses of nicotine, in both racemic and chiral forms have since been published.

===Biosynthesis===

The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that comprise nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the pyridine ring of nicotine is derived from nicotinic acid the pyrrolidine is derived from &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation. Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for nicotinic acid and the tropane pathway for &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation.

The NAD pathway in the genus &quot;Nicotiana&quot; begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-amino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce nicotinic acid via the conversion of nicotinamide by the enzyme nicotinamidase.

The &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with decarboxylation of ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. Putrescine is then converted into &quot;N&quot;-methyl putrescine via methylation by SAM catalyzed by putrescine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (PMT). &quot;N&quot;-methyl putrescine then undergoes deamination into 4-methylaminobutanal by the &quot;N&quot;-methyl putrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation.

The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation and nicotinic acid. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of nicotinic acid into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with &quot;N&quot;-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation to form enantiomerically pure (−)-nicotine.

===Detection in body fluids===
Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids. Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.

===Methods for analysis of enantiomers===
Methods for measuring the two enantiomers are straightforward and include normal-phase liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography with a chiral column. However, since methods can be used to alter the two enantiomers, it may not be possible to distinguish tobacco-derived from synthetic nicotine simply by measuring the levels of the two enantiomers. A new approach uses hydrogen and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance to distinguish tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine based on differences the substrates used in the natural synthetic pathway performed in the tobacco plant and the substrates most used in synthesis. Another approach measures the carbon-14 content which also differs between natural and laboratory-based tobacco. These methods remain to be fully evaluated and validated using a wide range of samples.

==Natural occurrence==
Nicotine is a secondary metabolite produced in a variety of plants in the family Solanaceae, most notably in tobacco &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;, where it can be found at high concentrations of 0.5 to 7.5%. Nicotine is also found in the leaves of other tobacco species, such as &quot;Nicotiana rustica&quot; (in amounts of 2–14%). Nicotine production is strongly induced in response to wounding as part of a jasmonate-dependent reaction. Specialist insects on tobacco, such as the tobacco hornworm (&quot;Manduca sexta&quot;), have a number of adaptations to the detoxification and even adaptive re-purposing of nicotine. Nicotine is also found at low concentrations in the nectar of tobacco plants, where it may promote outcrossing by affecting the behavior of hummingbird pollinators.

Nicotine occurs in smaller amounts (varying from 2–7 μg/kg, or 20–70 millionths of a percent wet weight) in other Solanaceaeous plants, including some crop species such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers, as well as non-crop species such as &quot;Duboisia hopwoodii&quot;. The amounts of nicotine in tomatoes lowers substantially as the fruit ripens. A 1999 report found &quot;In some papers it is suggested that the contribution of dietary nicotine intake is significant when compared with exposure to ETS [environmental tobacco smoke] or by active smoking of small numbers of cigarettes. Others consider the dietary intake to be negligible unless inordinately large amounts of specific vegetables are consumed.&quot; The amount of nicotine eaten per day is roughly around 1.4 and 2.25 μg/day at the 95th percentile. These numbers may be low due to insufficient food intake data. The concentrations of nicotine in vegetables are difficult to measure accurately, since they are very low (parts per billion range). Pure nicotine tastes &quot;terrible&quot;.

==History, society and culture==
Nicotine was originally isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by chemists Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and Karl Ludwig Reimann from Germany, who believed it was a poison. Its chemical empirical formula was described by Melsens in 1843, its structure was discovered by Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein in 1893, and it was first synthesized by Amé Pictet and A. Rotschy in 1904.

Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant &quot;Nicotiana tabacum,&quot; which in turn is named after the French ambassador in Portugal, Jean Nicot de Villemain, who sent tobacco and seeds to Paris in 1560, presented to the French King, and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague.

Tobacco was introduced to Europe in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for smoking but also as an insecticide. After World War II, over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to mammals.

The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has increased over time, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005.

Although methods of production of synthetic nicotine have existed for decades, it was believed that the cost of making nicotine by laboratory synthesis was cost prohibitive compared to extracting nicotine from tobacco. However, recently synthetic nicotine started to be found in different brands of e-cigarettes and oral pouches and marketed as &quot;tobacco-free.&quot;

The US FDA is tasked with reviewing tobacco products such as e-cigarettes and determining which can be authorized for sale. In response to the likelihood that FDA would not authorize many e-cigarettes to be marketed, e-cigarette companies began marketing products that they claimed to contain nicotine that were not made or derived from tobacco, but contained synthetic nicotine instead, and thus, would be outside FDA&#x27;s tobacco regulatory authority. Similarly, nicotine pouches that claimed to contain non-tobacco (synthetic) nicotine were also introduced. The cost of synthetic nicotine has decreased as the market for the product increased. In March 2022, the U.S. Congress passed a law (the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022) that expanded FDA&#x27;s tobacco regulatory authority to include tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, thereby including products made with synthetic nicotine.

===Legal status===

In the United States, nicotine products and nicotine replacement therapy products like Nicotrol are only available to people 18 and above; proof of age is required; not for sale in vending machine or from any source where proof of age cannot be verified. As of 2019, the minimum age to purchase tobacco in the US is 21 at the federal level.

In the European Union, the minimum age to purchase nicotine products is 18. However, there is no minimum age requirement to use tobacco or nicotine products.

In the United Kingdom, the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 implemented the European directive 2014/40/EU, amended by Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. Additionally other regulations limit advertising, sale and display of tobacco products and other products containing nicotine for human consumption. The Sunak government proposed banning disposable vapes to limit their appeal and affordability for children and to reduce the amount of waste generated.

===In media===

In some anti-smoking literature, the harm that tobacco smoking and nicotine addiction does is personified as Nick O&#x27;Teen, represented as a humanoid with some aspect of a cigarette or cigarette butt about him or his clothes and hat. Nick O&#x27;Teen was a villain that was created for the Health Education Council. The character was featured in three animated anti-smoking public service announcements in which he tries to get kids addicted to cigarettes before being foiled by the DC Comics character Superman.

Nicotine was often compared to caffeine in advertisements in the 1980s by the tobacco industry, and later in the 2010s by the electronic cigarettes industry, in an effort to reduce the stigmatization and the public perception of the risks associated with nicotine use.

==Research==
===Central nervous system===
While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitization of those receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of major depressive disorder in non-smokers.

Though tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, there is evidence that nicotine itself has the potential to prevent and treat Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Smoking is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease; however, it is unknown whether this is due to people with healthier brain dopaminergic reward centers (the area of the brain affected by Parkinson&#x27;s) being more likely to enjoy smoking and thus pick up the habit, nicotine directly acting as a neuroprotective agent, or other compounds in cigarette smoke acting as neuroprotective agents.

Nicotine may partly attenuate sensory gating and attentional deficits associated with schizophrenia. Short-term use of transdermal nicotine was found to improve subjects’ reaction time and alertness in given tasks. Nicotine was not found to improve negative, positive, or other cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

===Immune system===
Immune cells of both the innate immune system and adaptive immune systems frequently express the α2, α5, α6, α7, α9, and α10 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Evidence suggests that nicotinic receptors which contain these subunits are involved in the regulation of immune function.

===Optopharmacology===
A photoactivatable form of nicotine, which releases nicotine when exposed to ultraviolet light with certain conditions, has been developed for studying nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in brain tissue.

===Oral health===
Several &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have investigated the potential effects of nicotine on a range of oral cells. A recent systematic review concluded that nicotine was unlikely to be cytotoxic to oral cells &quot;in vitro&quot; in most physiological conditions but further research is needed. Understanding the potential role of nicotine in oral health has become increasingly important given the recent introduction of novel nicotine products and their potential role in helping smokers quit.

<text>Turbo Pascal is a software development system that includes a compiler and an integrated development environment (IDE) for the programming language Pascal running on the operating systems CP/M, CP/M-86, and MS-DOS. It was originally developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Borland, and was notable for its very fast compiling. Turbo Pascal, and the later but similar Turbo C, made Borland a leader in PC-based development tools.

For versions 6 and 7 (the last two versions), both a lower-priced Turbo Pascal and more expensive Borland Pascal were produced; Borland Pascal was oriented more toward professional software development, with more libraries and standard library source code. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland&#x27;s dialect of the language Pascal, significantly different from Standard Pascal.

Borland has released three old versions of Turbo Pascal free of charge because of their historical interest: the original Turbo Pascal (now known as 1.0), and versions 3.02 and 5.5 for DOS, while Borland&#x27;s French office released version 7.01 on its FTP. 

== History ==
Philippe Kahn first saw an opportunity for Borland, his newly formed software company, in the field of programming tools. Historically, the vast majority of programmers saw their workflow in terms of the edit/compile/link cycle, with separate tools dedicated to each task. Programmers wrote source code using a text editor; the source code was then compiled into object code (often requiring multiple passes), and a linker combined object code with runtime libraries to produce an executable program.

In the early IBM PC market (1981–1983) the major programming tool vendors all made compilers that worked in a similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, even though programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the hundreds of dollars.

Kahn&#x27;s idea was to package all these functions in an integrated programming toolkit designed to have much better performance and resource utilization than the usual professional development tools, and charge a low price for a package integrating a custom text editor, compiler, and all functionality needed to produce executable programs. The program was sold by direct mail order for , without going through established sales channels (retailers or resellers).

The Turbo Pascal compiler was based on the Blue Label Pascal compiler originally produced for the NasSys cassette-based operating system of the Nascom microcomputer in 1981 by Anders Hejlsberg. Borland licensed Hejlsberg&#x27;s &quot;PolyPascal&quot; compiler core (&quot;Poly Data&quot; was the name of Hejlsberg&#x27;s company in Denmark), and added the user interface and editor. Anders Hejlsberg joined the company as an employee and was the architect for all versions of the Turbo Pascal compiler and the first three versions of Borland Delphi.

The compiler was first released as Compas Pascal for CP/M, and then released on 20 November 1983 as Turbo Pascal for CP/M (including the Apple II fitted with a Z-80 SoftCard, effectively converting the 6502-based Apple into a CP/M machine, the Commodore 64 with CP/M cartridge, and the later DEC Rainbow), CP/M-86, and DOS machines. On its launch in the United States market, Turbo Pascal retailed for , a very low price for a compiler at the time. The integrated Pascal compiler was of good quality compared to other Pascal products of the time.

The Turbo name alluded to the speed of compiling and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations because everything related to building the program was stored in RAM, and because it was a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compiling was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland&#x27;s own later compilers for C), and other Pascal compilers, and programmer time was also saved since the program could be compiled and run from the IDE. The execution speed of these COM-format programs was a revelation for developers whose only prior experience programming microcomputers was with interpreted BASIC or UCSD Pascal, which compiled to p-code which was then interpreted at runtime.

Unlike some other development tools, Turbo Pascal disks had no copy protection. Turbo Pascal came with the &quot;Book License&quot;: &quot;You must treat this software &quot;just like a book&quot; ... [it] may be used by any number of people ... may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one location while it&#x27;s being used at another.&quot;

=== Reception ===
Borland sold about 250,000 copies of Turbo Pascal in two years, which Bruce F. Webster of &quot;Byte&quot; described as &quot;an amazing figure for a computer language&quot;. He reported six months later that the figure had risen to &quot;more than 400,000 copies in a marketplace that had been estimated as having only 30,000 potential buyers&quot;.

Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in February 1984 that Turbo Pascal &quot;comes close to what I think the computer industry is headed for: well documented, standard, plenty of good features, and a reasonable price&quot;. He disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that &quot;it turns out not to be a lot more. Borland only wants another &quot; atop the base price, and that &quot;my first impression of Turbo is that it&#x27;s probably worth . It looks to do everything MT+ &quot;with the Speed Programming Package&quot; does, and maybe even do it faster and better&quot;. Pournelle reported in July that, according to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least ; he noted that &quot;Turbo is much better than the Pascal IBM sells&quot;, and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three &quot;Byte&quot; reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One reviewer said that because of dialect differences &quot;Turbo is not really Pascal. But it&#x27;s very useful&quot;. While cautioning that it was not suitable for developing very large applications, he concluded that Turbo Pascal &quot;is well written, fun to use at times, and fast enough to make up for its few shortcomings ... it is a bargain that shouldn&#x27;t be passed up&quot;. A second called the DOS version &quot;without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased&quot;, while a third said that Borland &quot;deserves praise for&quot; the &quot;high-value&quot; CP/M version.

Pournelle in August 1985 called version 3.0 &quot;a distinct improvement on the already impressive version 2&quot; and said that the new book license &quot;seems quite fair to me&quot;. He said that &quot;Turbo Pascal has got to be the best value in languages on the market today&quot;, and that Borland led the industry in &quot;delivering excellent products at reasonable costs&quot;. Despite finding what the magazine called &quot;a serious bug&quot; in 3.0, and decreased compatibility with PC clones, &quot;Byte&quot; in February 1986 stated that &quot;it is hard to avoid recommending Turbo to anyone who wants to program in Pascal&quot;, citing improved speed and graphic routines. When reviewing four other Pascal compilers in December 1986, the magazine described Turbo Pascal as &quot;practical and attractive to programmers at all levels of expertise&quot;. Besides allowing applications larger than 64 KB, &quot;Byte&quot; in 1988 reported substantially faster compiling and executing for version 4.0, and that although it did not maintain previous versions&#x27; &quot;almost total&quot; backward compatibility, conversion was fast and easy. The reviewer concluded, &quot;I highly recommend Turbo Pascal 4.0 as an addition to any programmer&#x27;s software repertoire&quot;.

Webster praised the language, stating in August 1985 that Turbo Pascal &quot;is best known for its small size, incredible compile speeds, and fast execution times&quot;. He noted that the software&#x27;s quality and low price was especially surprising after the &quot;JRT Pascal fiasco&quot;, and stated that even at the new higher price, version 3.0 was &quot;probably still the best software deal on the market&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; was similarly complimentary in November 1984, stating that &quot;nothing like Turbo Pascal has ever existed for PC-DOS before&quot;. It praised the software&#x27;s low price, speed, and unusually good documentation for a compiler, and noted the existence of many utilities for Turbo Pascal from other companies. The review stated that the IDE that simplified the edit-compile-run-debug loop made Turbo Pascal accessible, like BASIC, to new programmers.

&quot;Byte&quot; in 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the Byte Awards. Citing their user interface and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that &quot;for rapid prototyping there&#x27;s not much better&quot;. In the same issue Pournelle again praised version 4.0 and 5.0 of Turbo Pascal. Citing &quot;Anacreon&quot; as &quot;a good example of how complex a program you can write in Pascal&quot;, and the many libraries from Borland and other developers, he wrote &quot;I think it may well be the language for the rest of us&quot;.

Scott MacGregor of Microsoft said that Bill Gates &quot;couldn&#x27;t understand why our stuff was so slow&quot; compared to Turbo Pascal. &quot;He would bring in poor Greg Whitten [programming director of Microsoft languages] and yell at him for half an hour&quot; because their company was unable to defeat Kahn&#x27;s small startup, MacGregor recalled.

=== Successors ===

By 1995 Borland had dropped Turbo/Borland Pascal and replaced it with the rapid application development (RAD) environment Borland Delphi, based on Object Pascal. The 32- and 64-bit Delphi versions still support the more portable Pascal enhancements of the earlier products (i.e., those not specific to 16-bit code) including the earlier static object model. This language backwards compatibility means much old Turbo Pascal code can still be compiled and run in a modern environment today.

Other suppliers have produced software development tools compatible with Turbo Pascal. The best-known are Free Pascal and Virtual Pascal.

== Syntax ==

* Pascal is not case-sensitive.
* Historically, Pascal comments are enclosed codice_1, or codice_2, and these can span any number of lines. Later versions of Borland Pascal also supported C++-style comments codice_3, which finish at the end of the line.
* The syntax for the statement codice_4 is more flexible than standard Pascal.
* Sets may only have up to 256 (28) members.
* The standard Pascal codice_5 preceded by a length byte is supported, and takes a fixed amount of storage; later versions added a more flexible null-terminated type, calling the older type &quot;short string&quot;. Older source code which handles strings in non-standard ways (e.g., directly manipulating the length byte like codice_6 to truncate a string) must either have its strings declared as short strings, or be rewritten.

This is the classic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in Turbo Pascal:
program HelloWorld;
begin
 WriteLn(&#x27;Hello World&#x27;)
end.
This asks for a name and writes it back to the screen a hundred times:
program WriteName;
var
 i : Integer; {variable to be used for looping}
 Name : String; {declares the variable Name as a string}
begin
 Write(&#x27;Please tell me your name: &#x27;);
 ReadLn(Name); {ReadLn returns the string entered by the user}
 for i := 1 to 100 do
 begin
 WriteLn(&#x27;Hello &#x27;, Name)
 end;
 readln;
end.
==Features==
===Assembly language===
While all versions of Turbo Pascal could include inline machine code, starting with version 6 it was possible to integrate assembly language within Pascal source code.

Support for the various x86 memory models was provided by inline assembly, compiler options, and language extensions such as the &quot;absolute&quot; keyword. The Turbo Assembler, TASM, a standard x86 assembler independent of TP, and source-compatible with the widely used Microsoft Macro Assembler MASM, was supplied with the enhanced &quot;Borland Pascal&quot; versions.

===Debugging and profiling===
The IDE provided several debugging facilities, including single stepping, examination and changing of variables, and conditional breakpoints. In later versions assembly-language blocks could be stepped through. The user could add breakpoints on variables and registers in an IDE window. Programs using IBM PC graphics mode could flip between graphics and text mode automatically or manually, or display both on two screens. For cases where the relatively simple debugging facilities of the IDE were insufficient, Turbopower Software produced a more powerful debugger, T-Debug. The same company produced Turbo Analyst and Overlay Manager for Turbo Pascal. T-Debug was later updated for Turbo Pascal 4, but discontinued with the release of Borland&#x27;s Turbo Debugger (TD), which also allowed some hardware intervention on computers equipped with the new 80386 processor.

TD was usually supplied in conjunction with the Turbo Assembler and the Turbo Profiler, a code profiler that reported on the time spent in each part of the program to assist program optimisation by finding bottlenecks. The books included with Borland Pascal had detailed descriptions of the Intel assembler language, including the number of clock cycles required by each instruction. Development and debugging could be carried out entirely within the IDE unless the advanced debugging facilities of Turbopower T-Debug, and later TD, were required.

Later versions also supported remote debugging via an RS-232 communication cable.

===Units===
Over the years, Borland enhanced not only the IDE, but also extended the programming language. A development system based on ISO standard Pascal requires implementation-specific extensions for the development of real-world applications on the platforms they target. Standard Pascal is designed to be platform-independent, so prescribes no low-level access to hardware- or operating system-dependent facilities. Standard Pascal also does not prescribe how a large program should be split into separate compiling units. From version 4, Turbo Pascal adopted the concept of &quot;units&quot; from UCSD Pascal. Units were used as external function libraries, like the object files used in other languages such as FORTRAN or C.

For example, the line codice_7 in a program included the unit called crt; the codice_8 is the mechanism for using other compiling units. codice_9 and codice_10 were the keywords used to specify, within the unit, what was (and what was not) visible outside the unit. This is similar to the codice_11 and codice_12 keywords in other languages such as C++ and Java.

Units in Borland&#x27;s Pascal were similar to Modula-2&#x27;s separate compiling system. In 1987, when Turbo Pascal 4 was released, Modula-2 was making inroads as an educational language which could replace Pascal. Borland, in fact, had a Turbo Modula-2 compiler, but only released it on CP/M (its user interface was almost identical to that of Turbo Pascal 1–3) with little marketing. A much improved DOS version was developed, but as Borland was unwilling to publish the results, the authors including Niels Jensen bought the rights and formed Jensen &amp; Partners International to publish it as JPI TopSpeed Modula-2. Instead Borland chose to implement separate compiling in their established Pascal product.

Separate compiling was not part of the standard Pascal language, but was already available in UCSD Pascal, which was very popular on 8-bit machines. Turbo Pascal syntax for units appears to have been borrowed from UCSD Pascal. Earlier versions of Turbo Pascal, designed for computers with limited resources, supported a &quot;chain and execute&quot; system of dynamic linking for separately compiled objects, similar to the system widely used in BASIC. Also, the language had a statement to include separate source code in a program when necessary, and overlaying was supported from TP3, but, as with overlays, chained objects had to fit into the original (limited) program memory space. As computing and storage facilities advanced, the ability to generate large EXE files was added to Turbo Pascal, with the ability to statically link and collectively load separately compiled objects.

The .TPU files output by compiling a Turbo Pascal unit are tightly linked to the internal structures of the compiler, rather than standard .OBJ linkable files. This improved compiling and linking times, but meant that .TPU files could not be linked with the output of other languages or even used with different releases of Turbo Pascal unless recompiled from source.

===Object-oriented programming===

From version 5.5 some object-oriented programming features were introduced: classes, inheritance, constructors and destructors. The IDE was already augmented with an object browser interface showing relations between objects and methods and allowing programmers to navigate the modules easily. Borland called its language &quot;Object Pascal&quot;, which was greatly extended to become the language underlying Delphi (which has two separate OOP systems).
The name &quot;Object Pascal&quot; originated with the Pascal extensions developed by Apple Computer to program its Lisa and Macintosh computers. Pascal originator Niklaus Wirth consulted in developing these extensions, which built upon the record type already present in Pascal.

===Issue with CRT unit on fast processors===
Several versions of Turbo Pascal, including the last version 7, include a unit named CRT, which was used by many fullscreen text-mode applications on a CRT. This unit contains code in its initialization section to determine the CPU speed and calibrate delay loops. This code fails on processors with a speed greater than about 200 MHz and aborts immediately with a &quot;Runtime Error 200&quot; message. (the error code 200 had nothing to do with the CPU speed 200 MHz). This is caused because a loop runs to count the number of times it can iterate in a fixed time, as measured by the real-time clock. When Turbo Pascal was developed it ran on machines with CPUs running at 2.5 to 8 MHz, and little thought was given to the possibility of vastly higher speeds, so from about 200 MHz enough iterations can be run to overflow the 16-bit counter. A patch was produced when machines became too fast for the original method, but failed as processor speeds increased yet further, and was superseded by others.

Programs subject to this error can be recompiled from source code with a compiler patched to eliminate the error (using a TURBO.TPL compiled with a corrected CRT unit) or, if source code is unavailable, executables can be patched by a tool named TPPATCH or equivalent, or by loading a terminate-and-stay-resident program before running the faulty program.

There are also patches to the TP7 compiler, thus if the Pascal source is available, a new compiling&#x27;s code will work without the compiled code needing a patch. If the source code is available, porting to libraries without CPU clock speed dependency is a solution too.

===Floating-point arithmetic===
There were several floating point types, including codice_13 (the 4-byte [IEEE 754] representation) codice_14 (the 8-byte IEEE 754 representation), codice_15 (a 10-byte IEEE 754 representation used mostly internally by numeric coprocessors) and codice_16 (a 6-byte representation).

In the early days, codice_16 was the most popular. Most PCs of the era did not have a floating-point coprocessor so all floating-point arithmetic had to be done in software. Borland&#x27;s own floating-point algorithms on codice_16 were quicker than using the other types, though its library also emulated the other types in software.

==Versions==
===CP/M and DOS versions===
====Version 1====
Version 1, released on 20 November 1983, was a basic all-in-one system, working in memory and producing .COM executable files for DOS and CP/M, and equivalent .CMD executables for CP/M-86 (totally different from .CMD batch files later used in 32-bit Microsoft Windows). Source code files were limited to 64 KB to simplify the IDE, and DOS .COM files were limited to 64 KB each of code, stack and global (static) variables. Program source code could be extended by using the include facility if the source code exceeded the memory limit of the editor.
There were different versions of Turbo Pascal for computers running DOS, CP/M, or CP/M-86 with 64 KB of memory and at least one floppy disk drive. The CP/M version could run on the many CP/M machines of the time with Z80 processors, or an Apple II with Z80 card. The DOS and CP/M-86 versions ran on the many 8086 and 8088 machines which became available, including the IBM PC. The installer, lister, and compiler with its IDE, and the source code for a simple spreadsheet program called MicroCalc written by Philippe Kahn as a demonstration, would fit on a single floppy disc. A disc copy without MicroCalc would accommodate the source code and compiled executable of a reasonable-sized program—as it was common at the time for users to have only a single floppy drive as mass storage, it was a great convenience to be able to fit both the compiler and the program being written on a single disc, avoiding endless disc swapping.

The architecture of the various machines running MS-DOS additionally limited the maximum user memory to under 1 MB (e.g., machines hardware-compatible with the IBM PC were limited to 640 KB).

The Turbo Pascal IDE was very advanced for its day. It was able to perform well and compile very fast with the amount of RAM on a typical home computer. The IDE was simple and intuitive to use, and had a well-organized system of menus. Early versions of the editor used WordStar key functions, which was the de facto standard at the time. Later versions of the IDE, designed for PCs with more disk space and memory, could display the definitions of the keywords of the language by putting the cursor over a keyword and pressing the F1 key (conventionally used to display help). Many definitions included example code.

In addition to standard executable programs, the compiler could generate terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, small utilities that stayed in memory and let the computer do other tasks—running several programs at the same time, multitasking, was not otherwise available. Borland produced a small application suite called Sidekick that was a TSR letting the user keep a diary, notes, and so forth.

==== Version 2 ====
Version 2, released a few months later on 17 April 1984, was an incremental improvement to the original Turbo Pascal, to the point that the reference manual was at first identical to version 1&#x27;s, down to having 1983 as the copyright date on some of the compiler&#x27;s sample output, but had a separate &quot;Addendum to Reference Manual: Version 2.0 and 8087 Supplement&quot; manual with separate page numbering. Additions included an overlay system, where separate overlay procedures would be automatically swapped from disk into a reserved space in memory. This memory was part of the 64kB RAM used by the program&#x27;s code, and was automatically the size of the largest overlay procedure. Overlay procedures could include overlay sections themselves, but unless a RAM disk was used, the resulting disk swapping could be slow. 2.0 also added the Dispose procedure to manage the heap, allowing individual dynamic variables to be freed, as an alternative to the more primitive &#x27;Mark/Release&#x27; system and increased compatibility with WordStar commands plus use of the numeric keypad on the IBM PC and compatibles. Such PCs also had new text window and CGA graphics mode commands as well as being able to use the PC&#x27;s speaker for tones. Finally, DOS and CP/M-86 machines with an 8087 maths coprocessor (or later compatible) had an alternative TURBO-87 compiler available to purchase. It supported the 8087&#x27;s &quot;long real&quot; data types with a range of 1.67E-307 to 1.67E+308 to 14 significant figure precision but with a much greater processing speed. The manual notes that although source code for the Turbo Pascal&#x27;s software real data types offering a range of 1E-63 to 1E+63 to 11 significant figures, these were incompatible at a binary level: as well as having a much larger range, the software reals took six bytes in memory and the 8087 ones were eight.

Like version 1, version 2 for CP/M-80 only ran on Z80-based CP/M machines.

==== Version 3 ====

Version 3 was released on 17 September 1986. Turbo Pascal 3 supported turtle graphics. In addition to the default software real numbers and 8087 edition of the compiler, Borland also offered a binary-coded decimal (BCD) version (TURBOBCD) which offered the same numeric range as real data types but to 18 significant figures.

=== DOS versions ===

==== Version 4 ====

Released on 20 November 1987, Version 4 was a total rewrite, with both look and feel and internal operation much changed. The compiler generated executables in .EXE format under DOS, rather than the simpler but more restricted .COM executables. The by-then obsolete CP/M and CP/M-86 operating system versions were dropped when Turbo Pascal was rewritten. Version 4 introduced units, and a full-screen text user interface with pull-down menus; earlier versions had a text-based menu screen and a separate full-screen editor. (Microsoft Windows was still very experimental when the first version was released, and even mice were rare.) An add-on package, the Turbo Pascal Graphix Toolbox, was available for Turbo Pascal V4.

==== Version 5.0 ====
Colour displays were replacing monochrome; Turbo Pascal version 5.0, released 24 August 1988, introduced blue as the editor&#x27;s default background color, used by Borland&#x27;s DOS compilers until the end of this product line in the mid-1990s. It also added debugger support for breakpoints and watches. Later versions came in two packages with the same version number: a less expensive &quot;Turbo&quot; package, and a &quot;Borland&quot; package with enhanced capabilities and more add-ons.

==== Version 5.5 ====

This version, released on 2 May 1989, introduced object-oriented programming features for the Pascal language, including concept of classes, static and dynamic objects, constructors and destructors and inheritance, which would become the basis for the Object Pascal found in Borland Delphi. The IDE uses the default blue colour scheme that would also be used on later Borland Turbo products. Other changes to IDE include the addition context-sensitive help with description of all built-in functions, and the ability to copy code fragments from the help to edit window.

==== Version 6.0 ====

Version 6 was released on 23 October 1990. Changes from 5.5 include: the addition of inline assembly, the addition of the Turbo Vision library, mouse support, clipboard for text manipulations, multiple document interface supporting up to nine edit windows.

==== Version 7.0 ====

Version 7 was released on 27 October 1992. Changes from 6.0 include support for the creation of DOS and Windows executables and Windows DLLs, and syntax highlighting.

===Turbo Pascal for Windows===
Two versions named &quot;Turbo Pascal for Windows&quot; (TPW), for Windows 3.x, were released: TPW 1.0, based on Turbo Pascal 6 but released about 2 years later, and 1.5, released after Turbo Pascal 7; they were succeeded by Borland Pascal 7, which had Windows support. The Windows compiler in Pascal 7 was titled &quot;Borland Pascal for Windows&quot;.

Both versions built Windows-compatible programs, and featured a Windows-based IDE, as opposed to the DOS-based IDE in Turbo Pascal. The IDE and editor commands conformed to the Microsoft Windows user interface guidelines instead of the classic TP user interface. The support for Windows programs required the Object Windows Library (OWL), similar but not identical to that for the first release of Borland C++, and radically different from the earlier DOS Turbo Vision environment. Turbo Pascal was superseded for the Windows platform by Delphi; the Delphi compiler can produce console programs and graphical user interface (GUI) applications, so that using Turbo and Borland Pascal became unnecessary.

===Turbo Pascal for Macintosh===
Borland released &quot;Turbo Pascal for Macintosh&quot; in 1986. Much like versions 1 to 3 for other operating systems, it was written in compact assembly language and had a very powerful IDE, but no good debugger. Borland did not support this product very well, although they issued a version 1.1, patched to run on the 32-bit Macintosh II. Macintosh support was dropped soon after.

===Freeware releases===
Borland released several versions of Turbo Pascal as freeware after they became &quot;antique software&quot;, with 1.0 for DOS on 1 February 2000, 3.02 on 10 February 2000, 5.5 on 21 February 2002, Turbo Pascal 7.01 French version in year 2000. Most of the downloads are still available on the successor website of Embarcadero Technologies.

<text>John Enoch Powell (16 June 19128 February 1998) was a British politician, scholar and writer. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South West for the Conservative Party from 1950 to February 1974 and as MP for South Down for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from October 1974 to 1987. He was Minister of Health from 1960 to 1963 in the second Macmillan ministry and was Shadow Secretary of State for Defence from 1965 to 1968 in the Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath.

Before entering politics Powell was a classical scholar and a brigadier, having served during the Second World War. As a writer, Powell wrote both poetry and books on classical and political subjects. He is remembered particularly for his radical views on British immigration. In 1968 Powell attracted attention nationwide for his &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, in which he criticised immigration to the UK, and especially rapid influx from the New Commonwealth. He opposed the anti-discrimination Race Relations Bill (which ultimately became law). The speech was criticised by some of Powell&#x27;s own party members and &quot;The Times&quot; as racialist. Heath, who was then the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the Opposition, dismissed Powell from the Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech. In the aftermath of the Rivers speech, several polls suggested that 67–82% of the British population agreed with Powell&#x27;s opinions.

Powell turned his back on the Conservatives and endorsed a vote for the Labour Party, which returned as a minority government. Powell was returned to the House of Commons in October 1974 as the Ulster Unionist Party MP for the Northern Ireland constituency of South Down. He represented the constituency until he was defeated at the 1987 general election. Powell died in 1998 aged 85, and remains a divisive figure in the UK.

== Early years ==
John Enoch Powell was born in Stechford, within the city of Birmingham, on 16 June 1912, and was baptised at Newport, Shropshire, in St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, where his parents had married in 1909. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell, a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary Ellen, who was the daughter of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman, and his wife Eliza, who had been a teacher. His mother did not like his name, and as a child he was known as &quot;Jack&quot;. At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed &quot;the Professor&quot; because he used to stand on a chair and describe the stuffed birds that his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents&#x27; home. In 1918, the family moved to Kings Norton, Birmingham, where Powell remained until he went up to Cambridge in 1930.

The Powells were of Welsh descent and from Radnorshire (a Welsh border county), having moved to the developing Black Country during the early 19th century. His great-grandfather was a coal miner, and his grandfather had been in the iron trade.

Powell read avidly from a young age; as early as three, he could &quot;read reasonably well&quot;. Though not wealthy, the Powells were financially comfortable, and their home included a library. By the age of six, Powell loved to read. Every Sunday, Powell would give lectures to his parents on the books that he had read, and he would also conduct evensong and preach a sermon. Once he was old enough to go out on his own, Powell would walk around rural Worcestershire with the aid of Ordnance Survey maps, which instilled in him a love for landscape and cartography.

==Education==
Powell attended a dame school until he was eleven. He was then a pupil for three years at King&#x27;s Norton Grammar School for Boys before he won a scholarship to King Edward&#x27;s School in Birmingham in 1925, aged 13. The legacy of the First World War loomed large for Powell; Almost all his teachers had fought in the war. He formed the view that Britain and Germany would fight again.

Powell&#x27;s mother began teaching him Greek in the two weeks of Christmas break in 1925. By the time that he started the next term, he had attained a level in Greek that most pupils would reach after two years. Within two terms, Powell was top of the classics form. 

Precociously, Powell won all three of the school&#x27;s classics prizes and would win more later in his school career. In the fifth form and began to translate Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;. He entered the sixth form two years before his classmates, and was remembered as a hard-working student. Powell also won a medal in gymnastics and gained a proficiency in the clarinet. He contemplated studying at the Royal Academy of Music but his parents persuaded him to try for a scholarship at Cambridge. 

It was during his time in the sixth form that Powell learned German. He was influenced by reading James George Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, which led him towards the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche. 

Aged 17 Powell sat the classics scholarship paper at Trinity College, Cambridge, and won the top award. 
Powell studied at Trinity from 1930 to 1933. He became almost a recluse and devoted his time to studying. &quot;Granta&quot; called him &quot;The Hermit of Trinity&quot;. At the age of 18 his first paper to a classical journal was published (in German) in the &quot;&quot;, on a line of Herodotus. While studying at Cambridge, Powell became aware that there was another classicist who signed his name as &quot;John U. Powell&quot;. Powell decided to use his middle name and began referring to himself as &quot;Enoch Powell&quot;. Powell won the Craven scholarship at the beginning of his second term in 1931. It was at Cambridge that Powell fell under the influence of the poet A. E. Housman, then Professor of Latin at the university.

At Cambridge, Powell won a number of prizes, including the Percy Pemberton Prize, the Porson Prize, the Yeats Prize and the Lees Knowles, the Members&#x27; prize for Latin prose, the Browne Medal, the First Chancellor&#x27;s Classical Medal, and the Cromer Greek essay prize of the British Academy. 

Powell took a course in Urdu at the School of Oriental Studies (now SOAS, University of London), because he felt that his long-cherished ambition of becoming Viceroy of India would be unattainable without knowledge of an Indian language. Later, during his political career, he would speak to his Indian-born constituents in Urdu. Powell went on to learn other languages, such as Welsh, modern Greek, and Portuguese.

== Academic career ==
After graduating from Cambridge, Powell stayed on at Trinity College as a fellow, spending much of his time studying ancient manuscripts in Latin and producing academic works in Greek and Welsh. He won the Craven travelling scholarship, which he used to fund travels to Italy, where he researched Greek manuscripts. He also learned Italian. Powell was still convinced of the inevitability of war with Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933: he told his father in 1934, &quot;I want to be in the army from the first day that Britain goes to war&quot;. He suffered a spiritual crisis when he heard of the Night of the Long Knives in July 1934, which shattered his vision of German culture. 

Powell spent his time at Trinity teaching and supervising undergraduates, and worked on a lexicon of Herodotus. Since 1932 Powell had been working on the Egyptian manuscripts of J. Rendel Harris and his translation from the Greek into English was published in 1937.

Powell&#x27;s collection, &quot;First Poems&quot; (1937) and was influenced by Housman. His second volume of poems, &quot;Casting Off, and Other Poems&quot;, was printed in 1939. A further collection of poems, &quot;Dancer&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Gift&quot;, were published in 1951. A full collection of poems were published in one volume in 1990. 

In 1937, he was appointed Professor of Greek at the University of Sydney, aged 25, (failing in his aim of beating Nietzsche&#x27;s record of becoming a professor at 24). He was the youngest professor in the British Empire. He revised Henry Stuart Jones&#x27;s edition of Thucydides&#x27; &quot;Historiae&quot; for the Oxford University Press in 1938. His most lasting contribution to classical scholarship was his &quot;Lexicon to Herodotus&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press the same year, which was well received by critics.

Soon after arrival in Australia, he was appointed Curator of the Nicholson Museum at the University of Sydney. He informed the vice-chancellor that war would soon begin in Europe and that when it did, he would be heading home to enlist in the army. In his inaugural lecture as professor of Greek in May 1938 he condemned Britain&#x27;s policy of appeasement. At the outbreak of war, Powell immediately returned to the UK.

== Military service ==
In October 1939 Powell enlisted as a private in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He had trouble enlisting, as during the &quot;Phoney War&quot; the War Office did not want men with no military training. Rather than waiting to be called up, he claimed to be Australian, as Australians, many of whom had travelled to Britain join up, were allowed to enlist straight away. He was promoted from from private to lance-corporal and completed officer training. He told colleagues that he expected to be at least a major-general by the end of the war.

On 18 May 1940, Powell was commissioned as a second lieutenant onto the General List. He was transferred to the Intelligence Corps and later promoted to captain, posted as GSO3 (Intelligence) to the 1st (later 9th) Armoured Division. During this time he taught himself Portuguese; as insufficient Russian-speaking officers were available at the War Office, his knowledge of Russian and his textual analysis skills were used to translate a Russian parachute training manual; he was convinced that the Soviet Union must eventually enter the war on the Allied side.

In October 1941, Powell was posted to Cairo and then transferred back to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was promoted to major in May 1942 and then to lieutenant colonel in August 1942. In that role helped plan the Second Battle of El Alamein, having previously helped plan the attack on Erwin Rommel&#x27;s supply lines. The following year, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his military service. During his time in Algiers Powell began to distrust the United States&#x27; position. Powell&#x27;s suspicion of the anti-British Empire nature of the US Government&#x27;s foreign policy continued for the remainder of the war and into his subsequent post-war political career.

Following the Axis defeat at the Second Battle of El Alamein, Powell&#x27;s attention increasingly moved to the Far East theatre, where the Allies were fighting the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). He wished to be assigned to the Chindits units operating in Burma. He secured a posting to the British Indian Army in Delhi as a lieutenant-colonel in military intelligence in August 1943. Powell was appointed Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee for India and Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s Southeast Asia Command, involved in planning an amphibious offensive against Akyab.

Powell had continued to learn Urdu. He had an ambition of eventually becoming Viceroy of India, and when Mountbatten transferred his staff to Kandy, Ceylon, Powell chose to remain in Delhi. He was promoted to full colonel at the end of March 1944, as assistant director of military intelligence in India, giving intelligence support to the Burma campaign of Field Marshall William Slim. Powell ended the war as a brigadier, for a while, the youngest in the British Army. He told a colleague that he expected to be head of all military intelligence in &quot;the next war&quot;. Powell never experienced combat and felt guilty for having survived, writing that soldiers who did so, carried &quot;a sort of shame with them to the grave&quot;.

==Entry into politics==
Powell voted for the Labour Party in their 1945 landslide victory, because he wanted to punish the Conservative Party for the Munich Agreement. After the war he joined the Conservative Party and worked for the Conservative Research Department (CRD) under Rab Butler, where his colleagues included Iain Macleod and Reginald Maudling.

Powell&#x27;s ambition to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was so shocked by the change of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced walking the streets of London. He came to terms with it by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the Suez Crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that the United Kingdom should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.

After unsuccessfully contesting the Labour Party&#x27;s safe seat of Normanton at a by-election in 1947 (when the Labour majority was 62 per cent), he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South West at the 1950 general election.

===First years as a backbencher===
On 16 March 1950, Powell made his maiden speech in the House of Commons. For the rest of his life, Powell regarded this speech as the finest he ever delivered (rather than the much more well-known 1968 anti-immigration speech). On 3 March 1953, Powell spoke against the Royal Titles Bill in the House of Commons. 

In mid-November 1953, Powell secured a place on the 1922 Committee&#x27;s executive at the third attempt. Butler also invited him onto the committee that reviewed party policy for the general election, which he attended until 1955. Powell was a member of the Suez Group of MPs who were against the removal of British troops from the Suez Canal, because such a move would demonstrate, Powell argued, that the UK could no longer maintain a position there, and that any claim to the Suez Canal would therefore be illogical. However, after the troops had left in June 1956 and the Egyptians nationalised the Canal a month later, Powell opposed the attempt to retake the canal in the Suez Crisis because he thought the British no longer had the resources to be a world power.

==In and out of office==
===Junior Housing Minister===
On 21 December 1955, Powell was appointed parliamentary secretary to Duncan Sandys at the Ministry of Housing. In early 1956, he spoke for the Housing Subsidies Bill in the Commons and argued for the rejection of an amendment that would have hindered slum clearances. He also spoke in support of the Slum Clearances Bill, which provided entitlement for full compensation for those who purchased a house after August 1939 and still occupied it in December 1955 if this property would be compulsorily purchased by the government if it was deemed unfit for human habitation. In early 1956, Powell attended a subcommittee on immigration control as a housing minister and advocated immigration controls. 

===Financial Secretary to the Treasury===
When Macmillan replaced Eden as Prime Minister, Powell was offered the office of Financial Secretary to the Treasury on 14 January 1957. This office was the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x27;s deputy and the most important job outside the Cabinet.

In January 1958 Powell resigned, along with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and his Treasury colleague Nigel Birch, in protest of government plans for increased expenditure; he was a staunch advocate of disinflation, or, in modern terms, a monetarist, and a believer in market forces. Powell was also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society. The by-product of this expenditure was the printing of extra money to pay for it all, which Powell believed to be the cause of inflation, and in effect a form of taxation, as the holders of money find their money is worth less. Retail price index inflation was between 3.7 and 3% at the time of his resignation.

During the late 1950s, Powell promoted control of the money supply to prevent inflation and, during the 1960s, was an advocate of free market policies, which at the time were seen as extreme, unworkable and unpopular. Powell advocated the privatisation of the Post Office and the telephone network as early as 1964. He both scorned the idea of &quot;consensus politics&quot; and wanted the Conservative Party to become a modern business-like party, freed from its old aristocratic and &quot;old boy network&quot; associations. In his 1958 resignation over public spending and what he saw as an inflationary economic policy, he anticipated almost exactly the views that during the 1980s came to be described as &quot;monetarism&quot;.

===Hola Massacre speech===
On 27 July 1959, Powell delivered a speech in the Commons about the Hola Camp in Kenya, where eleven Mau Mau were killed after refusing work in the camp. Powell noted that some MPs had described the eleven as &quot;sub-human&quot;, but Powell responded by saying: &quot;In general, I would say that it is a fearful doctrine, which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it, to stand in judgement on a fellow human being and to say, &#x27;Because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow&#x27;.&quot; Powell also disagreed with the notion that because it was in Africa, different methods were acceptable:

Denis Healey, a member of parliament from 1952 to 1992, later said this speech was &quot;the greatest parliamentary speech I ever heard ... it had all the moral passion and rhetorical force of Demosthenes&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; report of the speech said that &quot;as Mr Powell sat down, he put his hand across his eyes. His emotion was justified, for he had made a great and sincere speech&quot;.

===Minister of Health===
Powell returned to the government in July 1960, when he was appointed Health minister, although he did not become a member of the Cabinet until the 1962 reshuffle. During a meeting with parents of babies that had been born with deformities caused by the drug thalidomide, he refused to meet any babies affected by the drug. Powell also refused to launch a public inquiry, and resisted calls to issue a warning against any left-over thalidomide pills that might remain in people&#x27;s medicine cabinets (as US President John F. Kennedy had done).

In December 1961, Powell, as Minister of Health, announced that the birth control pill Conovid could be prescribed to women through the NHS at a subsidised price of 2 shillings per month.

As health minister he developed the 1962 Hospital Plan. He began a debate on the neglect of psychiatric institutions, calling for them to be replaced by wards in general hospitals. The speech catalysed debate. It was one of several strands that led to the Care in the Community initiative of the 1980s. In 1993, however, Powell stated that the criminally insane should have never been released and that the problem was one of funding. He said the new way of caring for the mentally ill cost more, not less, than the old way because community care was decentralised and intimate as well as being &quot;more human&quot;; and his successors had not, Powell stated, provided the money for local authorities to spend on mental health care. Institutional care had therefore been neglected and there was not investment in community care.

After his speech on immigration in 1968, Powell&#x27;s political opponents sometimes alleged that he had, when Minister of Health, recruited immigrants from the Commonwealth into the National Health Service (NHS). However, the Minister of Health was not responsible for recruitment (this was left to health authorities) Powell did welcome immigrant nurses and doctors, under the condition that they were to be temporary workers training in the UK and would then return to their native countries as qualified doctors or nurses. Shortly after becoming Minister of Health, Powell asked Rab Butler (the Home Secretary) if he could be appointed to a ministerial committee which monitored immigration. Powell was worried about the strain caused by NHS immigrants, and papers show that he wanted a stronger restriction on Commonwealth immigration than that which was passed in 1961.

== 1960s ==
===Leadership elections===
In October 1963, along with Iain Macleod, Reginald Maudling and Lord Hailsham, Powell tried in vain to persuade Butler not to serve under the Earl of Home (soon to be known as Sir Alec Douglas-Home), in the belief that the latter would be unable to form a government. Powell commented that they had given Butler a revolver, which he had refused to use in case it made a noise or hurt anyone. Macleod and Powell refused to serve in Lord Home&#x27;s Cabinet. This refusal is not usually attributed to personal antipathy to Douglas-Home but rather to anger at what Macleod and Powell saw as Macmillan&#x27;s underhand manipulation of colleagues during the process of choosing a new leader. However, at the meeting at his house on the evening of 17 October, Powell, who still enjoyed a liberal reputation on racial issues after his Hola Massacre Speech, reportedly said of Lord Home: &quot;How can I serve under a man whose views on Africa are positively Portuguese?&quot;

During the 1964 general election, Powell said in his election address, &quot;it was essential, for the sake not only of our own people but of the immigrants themselves, to introduce control over the numbers allowed in. I am convinced that strict control must continue if we are to avoid the evils of a &#x27;colour question&#x27; in this country, for ourselves and for our children&quot;. Norman Fowler, then a reporter for &quot;The Times&quot;, interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: &quot;I expected to be told something about the cost of living but not a bit of it. &#x27;Immigration,&#x27; replied Powell. I duly phoned in my piece but it was never used. After all, who in 1964 had ever heard of a former Conservative cabinet minister thinking that immigration was an important political issue?&quot;

Following the Conservatives&#x27; defeat in the election, he agreed to return to the front bench as Transport Spokesman. In July 1965, he stood in the first-ever party leadership election but came a distant third to Edward Heath, obtaining only 15 votes, just below the result Hugh Fraser would gain in the 1975 contest. Heath appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Powell said that he had &quot;left his visiting card&quot;, i.e. demonstrated himself to be a potential future leader, but the immediate effect was to demonstrate his limited support in the Parliamentary Party, enabling Heath to feel more comfortable calling his bluff.

===Shadow Defence Secretary===
In his first speech to the Conservative Party conference as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence on 14 October 1965, Powell outlined a fresh defence policy, jettisoning what he saw as outdated global military commitments left over from the UK&#x27;s imperial past and stressing that the UK was a European power and therefore an alliance with Western European states from possible attack from the East was central to the UK&#x27;s safety. He defended the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons and argued that it was &quot;the merest casuistry to argue that if the weapon and the means of using it are purchased in part, or even altogether, from another nation, therefore the independent right to use it has no reality. With a weapon so catastrophic, it is possession and the right to use which count&quot;. Also, Powell called into question Western military commitments East of Suez:

The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist David Howell remarked to Andrew Alexander that Powell had &quot;just withdrawn us from East of Suez, and received an enormous ovation because no-one understood what he was talking about&quot;. However, the Americans were worried by Powell&#x27;s speech as they wanted British military commitments in South-East Asia as they were still fighting in Vietnam. A transcript of the speech was sent to Washington and the American embassy requested to talk to Heath about the &quot;Powell doctrine&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Powell&#x27;s speech was &quot;a potential declaration of independence from American policy&quot;. During the election campaign of 1966, Powell claimed that the British government had contingency plans to send at least a token British force to Vietnam and that, under Labour, &quot;Britain has behaved perfectly clearly and perfectly recognisably as an American satellite&quot;.

Lyndon B. Johnson had indeed asked Wilson for some British forces for Vietnam, and when it was later suggested to Powell that Washington understood that the public reaction to Powell&#x27;s allegations had made Wilson realise he would not have favourable public opinion and so could not go through with it, Powell responded: &quot;The greatest service I have performed for my country, if that is so&quot;. Labour was returned with a large majority, and Powell was retained by Heath as Shadow Defence Secretary as he believed Powell &quot;was too dangerous to leave out&quot;.

In a controversial speech on 26 May 1967, Powell criticised the UK&#x27;s post-war world role:

In 1967, Powell spoke of his opposition to the immigration of Kenyan Asians to the United Kingdom after the African country&#x27;s leader Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s discriminatory policies led to the flight of Asians from that country.

The biggest argument Powell and Heath had during Powell&#x27;s time in the Shadow Cabinet was over a dispute over the role of Black Rod, who would go to the Commons to summon them to the Lords to hear the Royal Assent of Bills. In November 1967, Black Rod arrived during a debate on the EEC and was met with cries of &quot;Shame&quot; to Op it&quot;. At the next Shadow Cabinet meeting Heath said this &quot;nonsense&quot; must be stopped. Powell suggested that Heath did not mean it should be ended. He asked whether Heath realised that the words Black Rod used went back to the 1307 Parliament of Carlisle and were ancient even then. Heath reacted furiously, saying that the British people &quot;were tired of this nonsense and ceremonial and mummery. He would not stand for the perpetuation of this ridiculous business etc&quot;.

===1968 &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech===
The Birmingham-based television company ATV saw an advance copy of the speech on the Saturday morning, and its news editor ordered a television crew to go to the venue, where they filmed sections of the speech. Earlier in the week, Powell said to his friend Clement &#x27;Clem&#x27; Jones, a journalist and then editor at the Wolverhampton &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m going to make a speech at the weekend and it&#x27;s going to go up &#x27;fizz&#x27; like a rocket; but whereas all rockets fall to the earth, this one is going to stay up.&quot;

Powell was renowned for his oratorical skills and his maverick nature. On 20 April 1968, he gave a speech in Birmingham in which he warned his audience of what he believed would be the consequences of continued unchecked mass immigration from the Commonwealth to the UK. Above all, it is an allusion to the Roman poet Virgil towards the end of the speech which has been remembered, giving the speech its colloquial name:

&quot;The Times&quot; declared it &quot;an evil speech&quot;, stating, &quot;This is the first time that a serious British politician has appealed to racial hatred in this direct way in our postwar history.&quot;

The main political issue addressed by the speech was not immigration as such, however. It was the introduction of the Race Relations Act 1968 (by the Labour Government at the time), which Powell found offensive and immoral. The Act would prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race in certain areas of British life, particularly housing, where many local authorities had been refusing to provide houses for immigrant families until they had lived in the country for a certain number of years.

One feature of his speech was the extensive quotation of a letter he received detailing the experiences of one of his constituents in Wolverhampton. The writer described the fate of an elderly woman who was supposedly the last White person living in her street. She had repeatedly refused applications from non-Whites requiring rooms-to-let, which resulted in her being called a &quot;racialist&quot; outside her home and receiving &quot;excreta&quot; through her letterbox.

When Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to tell her that he was going to sack Powell, she responded: &quot;I really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis&quot;. Heath sacked Powell from his Shadow cabinet the day after the speech and he never held another senior political post again. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74 per cent of those asked agreed with his speech and only 15 per cent disagreed, with 11 per cent unsure. One poll concluded that between 61 and 73 per cent disagreed with Heath sacking Powell. According to George L. Bernstein, many British people felt that Powell &quot;was the first British politician who was actually listening to them&quot;.

After &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; branded his speeches &quot;racialist&quot;, Powell sued it for libel, but withdrew when he was required to provide the letters he had quoted from because he had promised anonymity for the writer, who refused to waive it.

Powell had also expressed his opposition to the Race Relations legislation being put into place by the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson at the time.

Following the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, Powell was transformed into a national public figure and won huge support across the UK. Three days after the speech, on 23 April, as the Race Relations Bill was being debated in the House of Commons, 1,000 dockers marched on Westminster protesting against the &quot;victimisation&quot; of Powell, with slogans such as &quot;we want Enoch Powell!&quot; and &quot;Enoch here, Enoch there, we want Enoch everywhere&quot;. The next day, 400 meat porters from Smithfield market handed in a 92-page petition in support of Powell, amidst other mass demonstrations of working-class support, much of it from trade unionists, in London and Wolverhampton.

Conservative politician Michael Heseltine stated that in the aftermath of the &quot;Rivers of blood&quot; speech, if Enoch Powell had stood for leadership of the Conservative party he would have won &quot;by a landslide&quot; and if he had stood to be Prime Minister he would have won by a &quot;national landslide&quot;.

===&#x27;Morecambe Budget&#x27;===
Powell made a speech in Morecambe on 11 October 1968 on the economy, setting out alternative, radical free-market policies that would later be called the &#x27;Morecambe Budget&#x27;. Powell used the financial year of 1968–69 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s 3d to 4s 3d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41 to 21 per cent) and how capital gains tax and Selective Employment Tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax reductions required a saving of £2,855,000,000 and this would be funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and privatising the profit-making state concerns; ending all housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; ending all foreign aid; ending all grants and subsidies in agriculture; ending all assistance to development areas; ending all investment grants; and abolishing the National Economic Development Council and the Prices and Incomes Board. The cuts in taxation would also allow the state to borrow from the public to spend on capital projects such as hospitals and roads and spend on &quot;the firm and humane treatment of criminals&quot;.

===House of Lords reform===
In mid-1968, Powell&#x27;s book &quot;The House of Lords in the Middle Ages&quot; was published after twenty years&#x27; work. At the press conference for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its &quot;resolute enemy&quot;. Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath&#x27;s acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour&#x27;s Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring the government of the day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords&#x27; powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were &quot;unnecessary and undesirable&quot; and that there was no weight in the claim that the Lords could &quot;check or frustrate the firm intentions&quot; of the Commons.

Powell said that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: &quot;How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?&quot; Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked &quot;what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?&quot; He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was &quot;a grand absurdity&quot;, because they would have been chosen &quot;upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed&quot;.

Powell said the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: &quot;It has long been so, and it works&quot;. He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a recent survey of working-class voters that showed that only one-third of them wanted to reform or abolish the House of Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an &quot;intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain&quot;. Powell deduced from this, &quot;As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people—the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive&quot;.

Following more speeches against the Bill during early 1969, and faced with the fact a bloc of left-wing Labour members were also against reforming the House of Lords as they desired its abolition altogether, Harold Wilson announced on 17 April that the Bill was being withdrawn. Wilson&#x27;s statement was brief, with Powell intervening: &quot;Don&#x27;t eat them too quickly&quot;, which provoked much laughter in the House. Later that day Powell said in a speech to the Primrose League:

Powell&#x27;s biographer, Simon Heffer, described the defeat of Lords reform as &quot;perhaps the greatest triumph of Powell&#x27;s political career&quot;.

In 1969, when it was first suggested that the United Kingdom should join the European Economic Community, Powell spoke openly of his opposition to such a move.

===Departure from the Conservative Party===
A Gallup poll in February 1969 showed Powell to be the &quot;most admired person&quot; in British public opinion.

In a defence debate in March 1970, Powell said that &quot;the whole theory of the tactical nuclear weapon, or the tactical use of nuclear weapons, is an unmitigated absurdity&quot; and that it was &quot;remotely improbable&quot; that any group of nations engaged in war would &quot;decide upon general and mutual suicide&quot;, and advocated enlargement of the UK&#x27;s conventional forces. However, when fellow Conservative Julian Amery later in the debate criticised Powell for his antinuclear pronouncements, Powell responded: &quot;I have always regarded the possession of the nuclear capability as a protection against nuclear blackmail. It is a protection against being threatened with nuclear weapons. What it is not a protection against is war&quot;.

The 1970 general election took place on 18 June and was unexpectedly won by the Conservatives, with a late surge in their support. Powell&#x27;s supporters claim that he contributed to this surprise victory. In &quot;exhaustive research&quot; on the election, the American pollster Douglas Schoen and University of Oxford academic R. W. Johnson believed it &quot;beyond dispute&quot; that Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, but the Conservative vote had increased by only 1.7 million since 1966. However the Conservative victory was reportedly not to Powell&#x27;s advantage, who according to friends &quot;sat in his head in his hands&quot; for many days afterwards.

Powell had voted against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had supported entry into the European Coal and Steel Community only because he believed that it was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969, he opposed the UK&#x27;s joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was UK&#x27;s very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and as much as anything else it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.

During 1970, Powell gave speeches about the EEC in Lyon (in French), Frankfurt (in German), Turin (in Italian) and The Hague.

The Conservatives had promised at the 1970 general election in relation to the Common Market, &quot;Our sole commitment is to negotiate; no more, no less.&quot; The second reading of the Bill to put the Treaty into law was passed by just eight votes on second reading, and Powell declared his hostility to his party&#x27;s line. He voted against the government on every one of the 104 divisions in the course of the European Communities Bill. When Britain finally entered the EEC in January 1973, after three years of campaigning on the question, he decided he could no longer sit in a parliament that he believed was no longer sovereign.

A &quot;Daily Express&quot; opinion poll in 1972 showed Powell to be the most popular politician in the country. In mid-1972, he prepared to resign the Conservative whip and changed his mind only because of fears of a renewed wave of immigration from Uganda after the accession of Idi Amin, who had expelled Uganda&#x27;s Asian residents. He decided to remain in parliament and in the Conservative Party, and was expected to support the party in Wolverhampton at the snap general election of February 1974 called by Edward Heath. However, on 23 February 1974, with the election only five days away, Powell dramatically turned his back on his party, giving as the reasons that it had taken the United Kingdom into the EEC without having a mandate to do so, and that it had abandoned other manifesto commitments, so that he could no longer support it at the election. The monetarist economist Milton Friedman sent Powell a letter praising him as principled, and notably, there was a breakaway faction of the Conservative Party in Gloucester which selected a candidate who stood under the party name of &quot;Powell Conservative&quot;, securing 366 votes, 0.7% of the overall vote share in the constituency. There was also a candidate listed in the neighbouring constituency of Stroud who obtained 470 votes, 0.8% of the overall vote share in the constituency.

Powell had arranged for his friend Andrew Alexander to talk to Joe Haines, the press secretary of the Labour leader Harold Wilson, about the timing of Powell&#x27;s speeches against Heath. Powell had been talking to Wilson irregularly since June 1973 during chance meetings in the gentlemen&#x27;s lavatories of the &quot;aye&quot; lobby in the House of Commons. Wilson and Haines had ensured that Powell would dominate the newspapers of the Sunday and Monday before election day by having no Labour frontbencher give a major speech on 23 February, the day of Powell&#x27;s speech. Powell gave this speech at the Mecca Dance Hall in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, to an audience of 1,500, with some press reports estimating that 7,000 more had to be turned away. Powell said the issue of British membership of the EEC was one where &quot;if there be a conflict between the call of country and that of party, the call of country must come first&quot;:

Powell went on to criticise the Conservative government for obtaining British membership despite the party having promised at the general election of 1970 that it would &quot;negotiate: no more, no less&quot; and that &quot;the full-hearted consent of Parliament and people&quot; would be needed if the UK were to join. He also denounced Heath for accusing his political opponents of lacking respect for Parliament while also being &quot;the first Prime Minister in three hundred years who entertained, let alone executed, the intention of depriving Parliament of its sole right to make the laws and impose the taxes of this country&quot;. He then advocated a vote for the Labour Party:

This call to vote Labour surprised some of Powell&#x27;s supporters who were more concerned with beating socialism than the supposed loss of national independence. On 25 February, he made another speech at Shipley, again urging a vote for Labour, saying he did not believe the claim that Wilson would renege on his commitment to renegotiation, which Powell believed was ironic because of Heath&#x27;s premiership: &quot;In acrobatics Harold Wilson, for all his nimbleness and skill, is simply no match for the breathtaking, thoroughgoing efficiency of the present Prime Minister&quot;. At this moment a heckler shouted &quot;Judas!&quot; Powell responded: &quot;Judas was paid! Judas was paid! I am making a sacrifice!&quot; Later in the speech Powell said, &quot;I was born a Tory, am a Tory and shall die a Tory. It is part of me ... it is something I cannot alter&quot;. In 1987, Powell said there was no contradiction between urging people to vote Labour while proclaiming to be a Tory: &quot;Many Labour members are quite good Tories&quot;.

Powell, in an interview on 26 February, said he would be voting for Helene Middleweek, the Labour candidate, rather than the Conservative Nicholas Budgen. Powell did not stay up on election night to watch the results on television, and when on 1 March he picked up his copy of &quot;The Times&quot; from his letterbox and saw the headline &quot;Mr Heath&#x27;s general election gamble fails&quot;, he reacted by singing the &quot;Te Deum&quot;. He later said: &quot;I had had my revenge on the man who had destroyed the self-government of the United Kingdom&quot;. The election result was a hung parliament. Although the Tories had won the most votes, Labour finished five seats ahead of the Conservatives. The national swing to Labour was 1 per cent; 4 per cent in Powell&#x27;s heartland, the West Midlands conurbation; and 16 per cent in his old constituency (although Budgen won the seat). According to the &quot;Telegraph&quot; journalist Simon Heffer, both Powell and Heath believed that Powell had been responsible for the Conservatives&#x27; losing the election.

== Ulster Unionist ==
===1974–1979===
In a sudden general election in October 1974, Powell returned to Parliament as Ulster Unionist (UUP) MP for South Down, having rejected an offer to stand as a candidate for the far-right National Front, formed seven years earlier and fiercely opposed to non-white immigration. He repeated his call to vote Labour because of their policy on the EEC.

Since 1968, Powell had been an increasingly frequent visitor to Northern Ireland, and in keeping with his general British nationalist viewpoint, he sided strongly with the Ulster Unionists in their desire to remain a constituent part of the United Kingdom. From early 1971, he opposed, with increasing vehemence, Heath&#x27;s approach to Northern Ireland, the greatest breach with his party coming over the imposition of direct rule in 1972. He strongly believed that it would survive only if the Unionists strove to integrate completely with the United Kingdom by abandoning devolved rule in Northern Ireland. He refused to join the Orange Order, the first Ulster Unionist MP at Westminster never to be a member (and, to date, one of only four, the others being Ken Maginnis, Danny Kinahan and Lady Hermon), and he was an outspoken opponent of the more extremist loyalism espoused by Ian Paisley and his supporters.

In the aftermath of the Birmingham pub bombings by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) on 21 November 1974, the government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). During its second reading, Powell warned of passing legislation &quot;in haste and under the immediate pressure of indignation on matters which touch the fundamental liberties of the subject; for both haste and anger are ill counsellors, especially when one is legislating for the rights of the subject&quot;. He said terrorism was a form of warfare that could not be prevented by laws and punishments but by the aggressor&#x27;s certainty that the war was impossible to win.

When Heath called a leadership election at the end of 1974, Powell claimed they would have to find someone who was not a member of the Cabinet that &quot;without a single resignation or public dissent, not merely swallowed but advocated every single reversal of election pledge or party principle&quot;. During February 1975, after winning the leadership election, Margaret Thatcher refused to offer Powell a Shadow Cabinet place because &quot;he turned his back on his own people&quot; by leaving the Conservative Party exactly 12 months earlier and telling the electorate to vote Labour. Powell replied she was correct to exclude him: &quot;In the first place I am not a member of the Conservative Party and secondly, until the Conservative Party has worked its passage a very long way it will not be rejoining me&quot;. Powell also attributed Thatcher&#x27;s success to luck, saying that she was faced with &quot;supremely unattractive opponents at the time&quot;.

During the 1975 referendum on British membership of the EEC, Powell campaigned for a &#x27;No&#x27; vote. Powell was one of the few prominent supporters of the &#x27;No&#x27; camp, with Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Peter Shore, and Barbara Castle. The electorate voted &#x27;Yes&#x27; by a margin of more than two to one.

On 23 March 1977, in a vote of confidence against the minority Labour government, Powell, along with a few other Ulster Unionists, abstained. The government won by 322 votes to 298, and remained in power for another two years.

Powell said that the only way to stop the Provisional IRA was for Northern Ireland to be an integral part of the United Kingdom, treated the same as any other of its constituent parts. He said the ambiguous nature of the region&#x27;s status, with its own parliament and prime minister, gave hope to the IRA that it could be detached from the rest of the UK:

Nonetheless, in the 1987 general election that he lost, Powell campaigned in Bangor for Jim Kilfedder, the devolutionist North Down Popular Unionist Party MP, and against Bob McCartney, who was standing as a Real Unionist on a policy of integration and equal citizenship for Northern Ireland.

In Powell&#x27;s later career as an Ulster Unionist MP, he continued to criticise the United States and stated that the Americans were trying to persuade the British to surrender Northern Ireland into an all-Ireland state because the condition for the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s membership of NATO, Powell said, was Northern Ireland. The Americans wanted to close the &#x27;yawning gap&#x27; in NATO defence that was the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s coast to northern Spain. Powell had a copy of a State Department Policy Statement from 15 August 1950, in which the American government said that the &quot;agitation&quot; caused by partition in Ireland &quot;lessens the usefulness of Ireland in international organisations and complicates strategic planning for Europe&quot;. &quot;It is desirable&quot;, the document continued, &quot;that Ireland should be integrated into the defence planning of the North Atlantic area, for its strategic position and present lack of defensive capacity are matters of significance.&quot;

Though he voted with the Conservatives in a vote of confidence that brought down the Labour government on 28 March, Powell did not welcome the victory of Margaret Thatcher in the May 1979 election. &quot;Grim&quot; was Powell&#x27;s response when he was asked what he thought of Thatcher&#x27;s victory because he believed she would renege like Heath did in 1972. During the election campaign, Thatcher, when questioned, again repeated her vow that there would be no position for Powell in her cabinet if the Conservatives won the forthcoming general election. In the days following the election, Powell wrote to Callaghan to commiserate on his defeat, pay tribute to his premiership and to wish him well.

===1979–1982===
Following a riot in Bristol in 1980, Powell stated that the media were ignoring similar events in south London and Birmingham, and said: &quot;Far less than the foreseeable New Commonwealth and Pakistan ethnic proportion would be sufficient to constitute a dominant political force in the United Kingdom able to extract from a government and the main parties terms calculated to render its influence still more impregnable. Far less than this proportion would provide the bases and citadels for urban terrorism, which would in turn reinforce the overt political leverage of simple numbers&quot;. He criticised &quot;the false nostrums and promises of those who apparently monopolise the channels of communication. Who then is likely to listen, let alone to respond, to the proof that nothing short of major movements of population can shift the lines along which we are being carried towards disaster?&quot;

In the 1980s, Powell began espousing the policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In a debate on the nuclear deterrent on 3 March 1981, Powell claimed that the debate was now more political than military; that the UK did not possess an independent deterrent and that through NATO the UK was tied to the nuclear deterrence theory of the United States. In the debate on the address shortly after the general election of 1983, Powell picked up on Thatcher&#x27;s willingness, when asked, to use nuclear weapons as a &quot;last resort&quot;. Powell presented a scenario of what he thought the last resort would be, namely that the Soviet Union would be ready to invade the UK and had used a nuclear weapon on somewhere such as Rockall to demonstrate their willingness to use it:

Powell went on to say that if the Soviet invasion had already begun and the UK resorted to a retaliatory strike the results would be the same: &quot;We should be condemning, not merely to death, but as near as may be the non-existence of our population&quot;. To Powell, an invasion would take place with or without the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons and therefore there was no point in retaining them. He said that after years of consideration, he had come to the conclusion that there were no &quot;rational grounds on which the deformation of our defence preparations in the United Kingdom by our determination to maintain a current independent nuclear deterrent can be justified&quot;.

On 28 March 1981, Powell gave a speech to Ashton-under-Lyne Young Conservatives where he criticised the &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; between the government and the opposition over the prospective growth through births of the immigration population, and added, We have seen nothing yet&#x27; is a phrase that we could with advantage repeat to ourselves whenever we try to form a picture of that future&quot;. He also criticised those who believed it was &quot;too late to do anything&quot; and that &quot;there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war&quot;. He also said that the solution was &quot;a reduction in prospective numbers as would represent re-emigration hardly less massive than the immigration which occurred in the first place&quot;. The Shadow Home Secretary, Labour MP Roy Hattersley, criticised Powell for using &quot;Munich beer-hall language&quot;. On 11 April, there was a riot in Brixton and when on 13 April an interviewer quoted to Thatcher Powell&#x27;s remark that &quot;We have seen nothing yet&quot;, she replied: &quot;I heard him say that and I thought it was a very very alarming remark. And I hope with all my heart that it isn&#x27;t true&quot;.

In July, a riot took place in Toxteth, Liverpool. On 16 July 1981, Powell gave a speech in the Commons in which he said the riots could not be understood unless one takes into consideration the fact that in some large cities between a quarter and a half of those under 25 were immigrant or descended from immigrants. He read out a letter he had received from a member of the public about immigration that included the line: &quot;As they continue to multiply and as we can&#x27;t retreat further there must be conflict&quot;. A Labour MP, Martin Flannery, intervened, saying Powell was making &quot;a National Front speech&quot;. Powell predicted &quot;inner London becoming ungovernable or violence which could only effectively be described as civil war&quot;, and Flannery intervened again to ask what Powell knew about inner cities.

Powell replied: &quot;I was a Member for Wolverhampton for a quarter of a century. What I saw in those early years of the development of this problem in Wolverhampton has made it impossible for me ever to dissociate myself from this gigantic and tragic problem&quot;. He also criticised the view that the causes of the riots were economic: &quot;Are we seriously saying that so long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our cities will be torn to pieces, that the police in them will be the objects of attack and that we shall destroy our own environment? Of course not&quot;. Dame Judith Hart attacked his speech as &quot;an evil incitement to riot&quot;. Powell replied: &quot;I am within the judgment of the House, as I am within the judgment of the people of this country, and I am content to stand before either tribunal&quot;.

After the Scarman Report on the riots was published, Powell gave a speech on 10 December in the Commons. Powell disagreed with Scarman, as the report stated that the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged. Powell instead argued that the black community was alienated because it was alien. He said tensions would worsen because the non-white population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25 per cent, of those of secondary school age it was 40 per cent. Powell said that the government should be honest to the people by telling them that in thirty years&#x27; time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.

John Casey records an exchange between Powell and Thatcher during a meeting of the Conservative Philosophy Group:

===Falklands conflict===
When Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982, Powell was given secret briefings on Privy Counsellor terms on behalf of his party. On 3 April, Powell said in the Commons that the time for inquests on the government&#x27;s failure to protect the Falkland Islands would come later and that although it was right to put the issue before the United Nations, the UK should not wait upon that organisation to deliberate but use forceful action now. He then turned to face Thatcher: &quot;The Prime Minister, shortly after she came into office, received a sobriquet as the &#x27;Iron Lady&#x27;. It arose in the context of remarks which she made about defence against the Soviet Union and its allies; but there was no reason to suppose that the right hon. Lady did not welcome and, indeed, take pride in that description. In the next week or two this House, the nation and the right hon. Lady herself will learn of what metal she is made&quot;. According to Thatcher&#x27;s friends this had a &quot;devastating impact&quot; on her and encouraged her resolve.

On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell said: &quot;it is difficult to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken&quot;. He added: &quot;We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and the wishes of the inhabitants of the Falkland Islands ... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands. ... I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people&quot;.

Powell also criticised the United Nations Security Council&#x27;s resolution calling for a &quot;peaceful solution&quot;. He said while he wanted a peaceful solution, the resolution&#x27;s meaning &quot;seems to be of a negotiated settlement or compromise between two incompatible positions—between the position which exists in international law, that the Falkland Islands and their dependencies are British sovereign territory and some other position altogether ... It cannot be meant that one country has only to seize the territory of another country for the nations of the world to say that some middle position must be found. ... If that were the meaning of the resolution of the Security Council, the charter of the United Nations would not be a charter of peace; it would be a pirates&#x27; charter. It would mean that any claim anywhere in the world had only to be pursued by force, and points would immediately be gained and a bargaining position established by the aggressor&quot;.

On 28 April, Powell spoke in the Commons against the Northern Ireland Secretary&#x27;s (Jim Prior) plans for devolution to a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland: &quot;We assured the people of the Falkland Islands that there should be no change in their status without their agreement. Yet at the very same time that those assurances were being repeated, the actions of the Government and their representatives elsewhere were belying or contradicting those assurances and showing that part at any rate of the Government was looking to a very different outcome that could not be approved by the people of the islands. Essentially, exactly the same has happened over the years to Northern Ireland&quot;. He further said that power-sharing was a negation of democracy.

The next day Powell disagreed with the Labour Party leader Michael Foot&#x27;s claim that the British government was acting under the authority of the United Nations: &quot;The right of self-defence—to repel aggression and to expel an invader from one&#x27;s territory and one&#x27;s people whom he has occupied and taken captive—is, as the Government have said, an inherent right. It is one which existed before the United Nations was dreamt of&quot;.

On 13 May Powell said the task force was sent &quot;to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British administration of the islands and to ensure that the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants&quot; but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an &quot;interim agreement&quot;: &quot;So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which the task force was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces ... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that &#x27;corresponds&#x27; to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We have a right to be there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and we have the right to sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a &#x27;corresponding withdrawal&#x27;, a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands&quot;.

After British forces successfully recaptured the Falklands, Powell asked Thatcher in the Commons on 17 June, recalling his statement to her of 3 April: &quot;Is the right hon. Lady aware that the report has now been received from the public analyst on a certain substance recently subjected to analysis and that I have obtained a copy of the report? It shows that the substance under test consisted of ferrous matter of the highest quality, that it is of exceptional tensile strength, is highly resistant to wear and tear and to stress, and may be used with advantage for all national purposes?&quot; She replied, &quot;I think that I am very grateful indeed to the right hon. Gentleman. I agree with every word that he said&quot;. Their mutual friend Ian Gow printed and framed this and the original question and presented it to Thatcher, who hung it in her office.

Powell wrote an article for &quot;The Times&quot; on 29 June, in which he said: &quot;The Falklands have brought to the surface of the British mind our latent perception of ourselves as a sea animal. ... No assault on a landward possession would have evoked the same automatic defiance, tinged with a touch of that self sufficiency which belongs to all nations&quot;. The United States&#x27; response was &quot;very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction ... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability ... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World ... she lives with ... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval &#x27;war on two fronts&#x27;.&quot; Powell added: &quot;The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre. ... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance—for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain&#x27;s possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over&quot;. Powell then said there was &quot;the Hispanic factor&quot;: &quot;If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations ... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we would have something of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 18 October, Powell said that due to the Falklands War, &quot;Britain no longer looked upon itself and the world through American spectacles&quot; and the view was &quot;more rational; and it was more congenial; for, after all, it was our own view&quot;. He quoted an observation that Americans thought their country was &quot;a unique society ... where God has put together all nationalities, races and interests of the globe for one purpose—to show the rest of the world how to live&quot;. He denounced the &quot;manic exaltation of the American illusion&quot; and compared it to the &quot;American nightmare&quot;. Powell also disliked the American belief that &quot;they are authorised, possibly by the deity, to intervene, openly or covertly, in the internal affairs of other countries anywhere in the world&quot;. The UK should dissociate herself from American intervention in the Lebanon: &quot;It is not in Britain&#x27;s self-interest alone that Britain should once again assert her own position. A world in which the American myth and the American nightmare go unchallenged by question or by contradiction is not a world as safe or as peaceable as human reason, prudence and realism can make it&quot;.

Speaking to the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association on 4 February 1983, Powell blamed the United Nations for the Falklands War by the General Assembly resolution of December 1967 that stated &quot;its gratitude for the continuous efforts made by the Government of Argentina to facilitate the process of decolonisation&quot; and further called on the UK and Argentina to negotiate. Powell said that &quot;it would be difficult to imagine a more cynically wicked or criminally absurd or insultingly provocative action&quot;. As 102 had voted for this resolution, with only the UK voting against it (with 32 abstentions), he said it was not surprising that Argentina had continually threatened the UK until this threatening turned into aggression: &quot;It is with the United Nations that the guilt lies for the breach of the peace and the bloodshed&quot;. The UN knew that no international forum had ruled against British possession of the Falklands but had voted its gratitude to Argentina who wanted to annexe the Islands from their rightful owners. It was therefore &quot;disgraceful&quot; for the UK to belong to such a body that engaged in &quot;pure spite for spite&#x27;s sake against the United Kingdom&quot;: &quot;We were, and are, the victims of our own insincerity. For over thirty years we have sanctimoniously and dishonestly pretended respect, if not awe, for an organisation which all the time we knew was a monstrous and farcical humbug. ... The moral is to cease to engage in humbug, which almost all have happily and self-righteously engaged in for a generation&quot;.

===1983 general election===
In an article for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; on 3 April, Powell expressed his opposition to the Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto pledge to outlaw fox hunting. He claimed that angling was much crueller and that it was just as logical to ban the boiling of live lobsters or eating live oysters. The ceremonial part of fox hunting was &quot;a side of our national character which is deeply antipathetic to the Labour party&quot;. In the 1983 general election, Powell had to face a DUP candidate in his constituency and Ian Paisley denounced Powell as &quot;a foreigner and an Anglo-Catholic&quot;.

On 31 May Powell gave a speech at Downpatrick against nuclear weapons. Powell said that war could not be banished because &quot;War is implicit in the human condition&quot;. The &quot;true case against the nuclear weapon is the nightmarish unreality and criminal levity of the grounds upon which its acquisition and multiplication are advocated and defended&quot;. Thatcher had claimed nuclear weapons were our defence &quot;of last resort&quot;. Powell said he supposed this to mean &quot;that the Soviet Union, which seems always to be assumed to be the enemy in question, proved so victorious in a war of aggression in Europe as to stand upon the verge of invading these islands. ... Suppose further, because this is necessary to the alleged case for our nuclear weapon as the defence of last resort, that, as in 1940, the United States was standing aloof from the contest but that, in contrast with 1940, Britain and the Warsaw Pact respectively possessed the nuclear weaponry which they do today. Such must surely be the sort of scene in which the Prime Minister is asserting that Britain would be saved by possession of her present nuclear armament. I can only say: &#x27;One must be mad to think it&#x27;.&quot; Powell pointed out that the UK&#x27;s nuclear weaponry &quot;is negligible in comparison with that of Russia: if we could destroy 16 Russian cities she could destroy practically every vestige of life on these islands several times over. For us to use the weapon would therefore be equivalent to more than suicide: it would be genocide—the extinction of our race—in the literal and precise meaning of that much abused expression. Would anybody in their senses contemplate that this ought to be our choice or would be our choice?&quot;

Powell further stated that the continental nations held the nuclear weapon in such esteem that they had conventional forces &quot;manifestly inadequate to impose more than brief delay upon an assault from the East. The theory of nuclear deterrence states that, should Warsaw Pact forces score substantial military successes or make substantial advances this side of the Iron Curtain, the United States would initiate the suicidal duel of strategic nuclear exchanges with the Soviet Union. One can only greet this idea with an even more emphatic &#x27;One must be mad to think of it&#x27;. That a nation staring ultimate military defeat in the face would choose self-extermination is unbelievable enough; but that the United States, separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean, would regard the loss of the first pawn in the long game as necessitating harakiri is not describable by the ordinary resources of language&quot;. The reason why governments, including in the US, supported nuclear weapons was that &quot;enormous economic and financial interests are vested in the continuation and elaboration of nuclear armaments. I believe, however, that the crucial explanation lies in another direction: the nuclear hypothesis provides governments with an excuse for not doing what they have no intention of doing anyhow, but for reasons which they find it inconvenient to specify&quot;.

On 2 June, Powell spoke against the stationing of US cruise missiles in the UK and asserted that the United States had an obsessive sense of mission and a hallucinatory view of international relations: &quot;The American nation, as we have watched their proceedings during these last 25 years, will not, when another Atlantic crisis, another Middle East crisis or another European crisis comes, wait upon the deliberations of the British Cabinet, whose point of view and appreciation of the situation will be so different from their own&quot;.

In 1983, his local agent was Jeffrey Donaldson, later an Ulster Unionist MP before defecting to the DUP.

===1983–1987===
In 1984, Powell alleged that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had murdered the Earl Mountbatten of Burma and that the assassinations of the MPs Airey Neave and Robert Bradford were carried out at the direction of elements in the Government of the United States of America with the strategic objective of preventing Neave&#x27;s policy of integration of Northern Ireland fully into the United Kingdom. In 1986, Powell stated that the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) had not killed Neave but that &quot;MI6 and their friends&quot; were responsible: Powell cited as his sources information that had been disclosed to him from within the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

In 1985, race riots between the black community and the police broke out in London and in Birmingham, leading Powell to repeat his warning that ethnic civil conflict would be the ultimate outcome of foreign mass migration into the British Isles, and re-issue his call for a government sponsored programme of repatriation.

Powell later came into conflict with Thatcher in November 1985 over her support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement. On the day it was signed, 14 November, Powell asked her in the Commons: &quot;Does the Right Hon. Lady understand — if she does not yet understand she soon will — that the penalty for treachery is to fall into public contempt?&quot;, the Prime Minister replying that she found his remarks &quot;deeply offensive&quot;.

Along with other Unionist MPs, Powell resigned his seat in protest and then narrowly regained it at the ensuing by-election.

In 1986, the former Irish schoolteacher Seamus Mallon was a new entrant to the House of Commons. During his maiden speech, Mallon quoted the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, saying &quot;Peace is not an absence of war. It is … a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.&quot; Powell, sitting close to Mallon, hissed an objection. When Mallon enquired why, Powell said that he had misquoted Spinoza. Mallon stated he had not and, to reconcile the standoff between them, they both proceeded to the library to verify the quote. Mallon was found to have been correct.

In 1987, Thatcher visited the Soviet Union, which signified to Powell a &quot;radical transformation which is in progress in both the foreign policy and the defence policy of the United Kingdom&quot;. In a speech in the Commons on 7 April, Powell said the nuclear hypothesis had been shaken by two events. The first was the Strategic Defense Initiative or &quot;Star Wars&quot;: &quot;Star wars raised the terrible prospect that there might be an effective means of neutralising the inter-continental ballistic missile, whereby the two great giants who held what had become to be seen as the balance of terror would contract out of the game altogether: the deterrent would be switched off by the invulnerability of the two providers of the mutual terror&quot;.

America&#x27;s &quot;European allies were brought along to acquiesce in the United States engaging in the rational activity of discovering whether there was after all some defence against nuclear attack ... by the apparent assurance obtained from the United States that it was only engaged in experiment and research, and that, if there were any danger of effective protection being devised, of course the United States would not avail itself of that protection without the agreement of its European allies. That was the first recent event which shook to its foundations the nuclear deterrent with which we had lived these last 30 years&quot;.

The second event was Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s offer of both the Soviet Union and the United States agreeing to abolish intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Powell said that Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;most significant point was when she went on to say that we must aim at a conventional forces balance. So, after all our journeys of the last 30 or 40 years, the disappearance of the intermediate range ballistic missile revived the old question of the supposed conventional imbalance between the Russian alliance and the North Atlantic Alliance&quot;.

Powell further said that even if nuclear weapons had not existed, the Russians would still not have invaded Western Europe: &quot;What has prevented that from happening was ... the fact that the Soviet Union knew ... that such an action on its part would have led to a third world war—a long war, bitterly fought, a war which in the end the Soviet Union would have been likely to lose on the same basis and in the same way as the corresponding war was lost by Napoleon, by the Emperor Wilhelm and by Adolf Hitler. It was that fear, that caution, that understanding, that perception on the part of Russia and its leaders that was the real deterrent against Russia committing the utterly irrational and suicidal act of plunging into a third world war in which the Soviet Union would be likely to find itself confronting a combination of the greatest industrial and economic powers in the world&quot;.

Powell said, &quot;In the minds of the Russians the inevitable commitment of the United States in such a war would have come not directly or necessarily from the stationing of American marines in Germany, but, as it came in the previous two struggles, from the ultimate involvement of the United States in any war determining the future of Europe&quot;. Thatcher&#x27;s belief in the nuclear hypothesis &quot;in the context of the use of American bases in Britain to launch an aggressive attack on Libya, that it was &#x27;inconceivable&#x27; that we could have refused a demand placed upon this country by the United States. The Prime Minister supplied the reason why: she said it was because we depend for our liberty and freedom upon the United States. Once let the nuclear hypothesis be questioned or destroyed, once allow it to break down, and from that moment the American imperative in this country&#x27;s policies disappears with it&quot;.

At the start of 1987 general election, Powell claimed the Conservatives&#x27; prospects did not look good: &quot;I have the feeling of 1945&quot;. During the final weekend of the election campaign Powell gave a speech in London reiterating his opposition to the nuclear hypothesis, calling it &quot;barmy&quot;, and advocating a vote for the Labour Party, which had unilateral nuclear disarmament as a policy. He claimed that Chernobyl had strengthened &quot;a growing impulse to escape from the nightmare of peace being dependent upon the contemplation of horrific and mutual carnage. Events have now so developed that this aspiration can at last be rationally, logically and—I dare to add—patriotically seized by the people of the United Kingdom if they will use their votes to do so&quot;.

However, Powell lost his seat in the election by 731 votes to the SDLP&#x27;s Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign for the number of MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion for the rest of the United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held in by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, &quot;For the rest of my life when I look back on the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart&quot;. He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: &quot;What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue&quot;. When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: &quot;My opponent polled more votes than me&quot;.

He was offered a life peerage, which was regarded as his right as a former Cabinet minister, but declined it. He argued that as he had opposed the Life Peerages Act 1958, it would be hypocritical for him to take one.

== Post-parliamentary life ==
===1987–1992===

Powell was critical of the Special Air Service (SAS) shootings of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar in March 1988. Powell claimed in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 7 December 1988 that the new Western-friendly foreign policy of Russia under Mikhail Gorbachev heralded &quot;the death and burial of the American empire&quot;. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany had decided to visit Moscow to negotiate German reunification, signalling to Powell that the last gasp of American power in Europe to be replaced by a new balance of power not resting on military force but on the &quot;recognition of the restraints which the ultimate certainty of failure places upon the ambitions of the respective national states&quot;.

In an interview for the &quot;Sunday People&quot; in December 1988, Powell said the Conservative Party was &quot;rejoining Enoch&quot; on the European Community but repeated his warning of civil war as the consequence of immigration: &quot;I still cannot forsee how a country can be peaceably governed in which the composition of the population is progressively going to change. I am talking about violence on a scale which can only be described as civil war. I cannot see there can be any other outcome&quot;. It would not be a race war but &quot;about people who revolt against being trapped in a situation where they feel at the mercy of a built-in racial majority, whatever its colour&quot; and claimed that the government had made contingency plans for such an event. The solution, he said, was repatriation on a large scale and the cost of doing this in welfare payments and pensions was well worth paying.

In early 1989, he made a programme (broadcast in July) on his visit to Russia and his impressions on that country. The BBC originally wanted him to do a programme on India but the Indian High Commission in London refused him a visa. When he visited Russia, Powell went to the graves of 600,000 people who died during the Siege of Leningrad, saying that he could not believe a people who had suffered so much would willingly start another war. He also went to a veterans&#x27; parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However, the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union&#x27;s threat to the West since 1945 and that he had been too impressed with Russia&#x27;s sense of national identity. When German reunification was on the agenda in mid-1989, Powell said that the UK urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany&#x27;s effect on the balance of power in Europe.

Following Thatcher&#x27;s Bruges speech in September 1988 and her increasing hostility to a European currency in the last years of her premiership, Powell made many speeches publicly supporting her attitude to Europe. When Heath criticised Thatcher&#x27;s speech in May 1989, Powell called him &quot;the old virtuoso of the U-turn&quot;. When inflation crept up that year, he condemned Chancellor Nigel Lawson&#x27;s policy of printing money so sterling would shadow the Deutsche Mark and said that it was for the UK to join the European Monetary System (EMS).

In early September 1989, a collection of Powell&#x27;s speeches on Europe was published titled &quot;Enoch Powell on 1992&quot; (1992 being the year set for the creation of the Single Market by the Single European Act of 1986). In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, &quot;I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years&quot;. After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November, Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary, Mark Lennox-Boyd, to pass to her &quot;my respectful congratulations on her stand ... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europe—in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt. Those who lead are always out in front, alone&quot;. Thatcher replied, &quot;I am deeply touched by your words. They give me the greatest possible encouragement&quot;.

On 5 January 1990, addressing Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell said that if the Conservatives played the &quot;British card&quot; at the next general election, they could win; the new mood in the UK for &quot;self-determination&quot; had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a &quot;beacon&quot;, adding that the UK should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom, adding: &quot;We are taunted—by the French, by the Italians, by the Spaniards—for refusing to worship at the shrine of a common government superimposed upon them all ... where were the European unity merchants in 1940? I will tell you. They were either writhing under a hideous oppression or they were aiding and abetting that oppression. Lucky for Europe that Britain was alone in 1940&quot;.

The Conservative Party would have to ask, preferably at the next election: &quot;Do you intend still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the policies of your government?&quot; Five days after this speech, in an interview for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Thatcher praised Powell: &quot;I have always read Enoch Powell&#x27;s speeches and articles very carefully. ... I always think it was a tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that even though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me&quot;. On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell said that the government should admit that the community charge was &quot;a disaster&quot; and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern the UK and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled &quot;dictatorial&quot; for wanting to &quot;go it alone&quot; in Europe: &quot;Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those of my fellow countrymen ... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good&quot;. This was the first election since 1970 in which Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party.

After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell said that since the UK was not an ally of Kuwait in the &quot;formal sense&quot; and because the balance of power in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, the UK should not go to war. Powell said that &quot;Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come storming up the beaches of Kent or Sussex&quot;. On 21 October, he wrote, &quot;The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges? ... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state. I sometimes wonder if, when we shed our power, we omitted to shed our arrogance&quot;.

When Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine for the leadership of the Conservative Party during November 1990, Powell said he would rejoin the party, which he had left in February 1974 over the issue of Europe, if Thatcher won, and would urge the public to support both her and, in Powell&#x27;s view, national independence. He wrote to one of Thatcher&#x27;s supporters, Norman Tebbit, on 16 November, telling him Thatcher was entitled to use his name and his support in any way she saw fit. Since she resigned on 22 November, Powell never rejoined the Conservatives. Powell wrote the following Sunday: &quot;Good news is seldom so good, nor bad news so bad, as at first sight it appears. Her downfall was due to having so few like-minded people on European integration amongst her colleagues and that as she had adopted a line that would improve her party&#x27;s popularity, it was foolish of them to force her out.&quot; He added, &quot;The battle has been lost, but not the war. The fact abides that, outside the magic circle at the top, a deep rooted opposition has been disclosed in the UK to surrendering to others the right to make our laws, fix our taxes, or decide our policies. Running deep beneath the overlay of years of indifference is still the attachment of the British public to their tradition of democracy. Their resentment on learning that their own decisions can be overruled from outside remains as obstinate as ever&quot;. Thatcher had relit the flame of independence and &quot;what has happened once can happen again ... sooner or later those who aspire to govern ... will have to listen&quot;.

In December 1991, Powell said that &quot;Whether Yugoslavia dissolves into two states or half a dozen states or does not dissolve at all makes no difference to the safety and well being of the United Kingdom&quot;. The UK&#x27;s national interests determined that the country should have &quot;a foreign policy which befits the sole insular and oceanic state in Europe&quot;. During the 1992 general election Powell spoke for Nicholas Budgen in his old seat of Wolverhampton South West. He praised Budgen for his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty and condemned the rest of the Conservative Party for supporting it.

==Final years==

In late 1992, aged 80, Powell was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 1994, he published &quot;The Evolution of the Gospel: A New Translation of the First Gospel with Commentary and Introductory Essay&quot;. On 5 November, the &quot;European&quot; printed an article by Powell in which he said he did not expect the European Communities Act 1972 to be amended or repealed but added, &quot;Still, something has happened. There has been an explosion. Politicians, political parties, the public itself have looked into the abyss ... the British people, somehow or other, will not be parted from their right to govern themselves in parliament&quot;.

In 1993, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Powell&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, Powell wrote an article for &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he claimed the concentration of immigrant communities in inner cities would lead to &quot;communalism&quot;, which would have grave effects on the electoral system: &quot;communalism and democracy, as the experience of India demonstrates, are incompatible&quot;. In May, he spoke for Alan Sked of the Anti-Federalist League (the forerunner of the UK Independence Party) who was standing at the Newbury by-election. Sked went on to lose his deposit at the by-election, polling only 601 votes (1.0 per cent). At Michael Portillo&#x27;s 40th birthday party the same month, Thatcher greeted him enthusiastically and asked him: &quot;Enoch, I haven&#x27;t seen you since your eightieth-birthday dinner. How are you?&quot; Powell replied, &quot;I&#x27;m eighty-one&quot;. Powell&#x27;s opinion of Thatcher had declined after she endorsed John Major at the 1992 general election, which he believed to be a repudiation of her fight against European integration following the Bruges speech.

On 16 May 1994, Powell spoke at the Bruges Group and said Europe had &quot;destroyed one Prime Minister and will destroy another Prime Minister yet&quot; and demanded powers surrendered to the European Court of Justice to be repatriated. In June 1994, he wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, where he stated that &quot;Britain is waking from the nightmare of being part of the continental bloc, to rediscover that these offshore islands belong to the outside world and lie open to its oceans&quot;. Innovations in contemporary society did not worry him: &quot;When exploration has run its course, we shall revert to the normal type of living to which nature and instinct predispose us. The decline will not have been permanent. The deterioration will not have been irreversible&quot;.

In his book &quot;The Evolution of the Gospel&quot;, published in August 1994, Powell said he had arrived at the view that Jesus Christ was not crucified but stoned to death by the Jews. Bishop John Austin Baker commented &quot;He is a great classicist, but theology is out of his academic field.&quot;

Following his death, Powell&#x27;s friend Richard Ritchie recorded in 1998 that &quot;during one of the habitual coal crises of recent years he told me that he had no objection to supporting the coal industry, either through the restriction of cheap coal imports or subsidy, if it were the country&#x27;s wish to preserve local coal communities&quot;.

In the 1990s, Powell endorsed three UKIP candidates in parliamentary elections. He also turned down two invitations to stand for the party in elections, citing retirement.

In April 1995, he said in an interview that for the Conservatives &quot;defeat [at the next election] would help. It helps one to change one&#x27;s tune&quot;. The party was just &quot;slithering around&quot;. The same month, he took part at a debate on Europe at the Cambridge Union and won.

In July 1995, there was a leadership election for the Conservative Party, in which Major resigned as leader of the party and stood in the election. Powell wrote, &quot;He says to the Sovereign: I no longer am leader of the majority party in the House of Commons; but I am carrying on as your Prime Minister. Now I don&#x27;t think anybody can say that—at least without inflicting damage on the constitution&quot;. To seek to offer advice to the Queen while unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was &quot;tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded&quot;. After Major&#x27;s challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, &quot;Dear Redwood, you will never regret the events of the last week or two. Patience will evidently have to be exercised—and patience is the greatest of the political virtues—by those of us who want to keep Britain independent and self-governed&quot;.

During the final years of his life, he managed occasional pieces of journalism and co-operated in a BBC documentary about his life in 1995 (&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; was broadcast on 11 November). In April 1996, he wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in which he said: &quot;Those who consented to the surrender made in 1972 will have to think again. Thinking again means that activity most unthinkable for politicians—unsaying what has been said. The surrender ... we have made is not irrevocable. Parliament still has the power (thank God) to reclaim what has been surrendered by treaty. It is time we told the other European nations what we mean by being self-governed&quot;. In October, he gave his last interview, to Matthew d&#x27;Ancona in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

He said: &quot;I have lived into an age in which my ideas are now part of common intuition, part of a common fashion. It has been a great experience, having given up so much to find that there is now this range of opinion in all classes, that an agreement with the EEC is totally incompatible with normal parliamentary government. ... The nation has returned to haunt us&quot;. When Labour won the 1997 general election, Powell told his wife, Pamela Wilson, &quot;They have voted to break up the United Kingdom.&quot; She rejoined the Conservative Party the next day, but he did not. By then, Powell had been hospitalised several times as a result of a succession of falls.

==Death==

A few hours following Powell&#x27;s final admission to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in London, he asked where his lunch was. On being told that he was being fed intravenously, he remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t call that much of a lunch.&quot; These were his last recorded words. On 8 February 1998, he died there at the age of 85. Powell was survived by his widow and two daughters. His study of the Gospel of John remained unfinished.

Dressed in a brigadier&#x27;s uniform, Powell&#x27;s body was buried in his regiment&#x27;s plot in Warwick Cemetery, Warwickshire, ten days after a family funeral service at Westminster Abbey and public services at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.

Following Powell&#x27;s death, many politicians, including his rivals, paid tribute to him. Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair said, &quot;However controversial his views, he was one of the great figures of 20th-century British politics, gifted with a brilliant mind. However much we disagreed with many of his views, there was no doubting the strength of his convictions or their sincerity, or his tenacity in pursuing them, regardless of his own political self-interest.&quot; Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, &quot;There will never be anybody else so compelling as Enoch Powell. He was magnetic. Listening to his speeches was an unforgettable privilege. He was one of those rare people who made a difference and whose moral compass led us in the right direction.&quot; Over 1,000 people attended Powell&#x27;s funeral, and during the ceremony he was hailed as a man of prophecy, political sacrifice and as a great parliamentarian. During the service, Lord Biffen said that Powell&#x27;s nationalism &quot;certainly did not bear the stamp of racial superiority or xenophobia&quot;. Other mourners at the service included socialist Labour MP Tony Benn, who, despite criticising the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, maintained a close relationship with Powell, and when asked why he had attended the funeral, responded &quot;he was my friend.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Powell spoke German, French, Italian, Modern Greek, and Hindi/Urdu, and had a reading knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Welsh. Among classical languages, he knew Ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic.

Canon Eric James, a former Trinity College chaplain, revealed in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 10 February 1998 that in his old age Powell confessed to him that he had been in love with a fellow male undergraduate at Cambridge (whom Michael Bloch believes to have been &quot;probably Edward Curtis of Clare College&quot;) and that this infatuation had inspired love verses published in his &quot;First Poems&quot;. Following his appointment as Professor of Greek at the University of Sydney in 1937, he wrote to his parents that he was repelled by his female students, while feeling &quot;an instant and instinctive affection&quot; for young Australian males. This, he added, might be &quot;deplored, but it cannot be altered&quot;, and it therefore had to be &quot;endured – and (alas!) camouflaged.&quot; The letters are now in the Churchill College Archives.

Despite his earlier atheism, Powell became a devout member of the Church of England. He subsequently became a church warden of St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

On 2 January 1952, the 39-year-old Powell married 26-year-old Margaret Pamela Wilson, a former colleague from the Conservative Central Office. Their first daughter, Susan, was born in January 1954, and their second daughter, Jennifer, was born in October 1956. In Robert Shepherd&#x27;s biography of Powell, it is noted that General Walter Cawthorn &quot;became almost a second father&quot; to him.

Powell was an anti-Stratfordian, who firmly believed that William Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon was not the writer of the plays and poems of Shakespeare. He appeared on an episode of &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;The Shakespeare Mystery,&quot; 19 April 1989, in which he said, &quot;My astonishment was to discover that these were the works of someone who&#x27;d &#x27;been in the kitchen.&#x27; They are written by someone who has lived the life, who has been part of a life of politics and power, who knows what people feel when they are near to the centre of power. Near to the heat of the kitchen.&quot; He called the traditional biography a &quot;Stratfordian fantasy.&quot;

In his younger years Powell published four collections of poems: &quot;First Poems&quot;; &quot;Casting Off&quot;; &quot;Dancer&#x27;s End&quot;; and &quot;The Wedding Gift&quot;. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1990. As a young scholar he translated Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; and published many other works of classical scholarship. He also wrote a biography of Joseph Chamberlain in 1977. His political publications were often as critical of the conservatives as they were of Labour, making fun of what he saw as logical fallacies in reasoning or action. His book &quot;Freedom &amp; Reality&quot; contained many quotes from Labour party manifestos or by Harold Wilson that he regarded as nonsensical.

In March 2015, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Powell was one of the MPs whose activities had been investigated as part of Operation Fernbridge. His name had been passed to police by Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, after allegations of Powell&#x27;s involvement in historic child abuse had been made by one individual in the 1980s to the then Bishop of Monmouth, Dominic Walker. 

== Political beliefs ==
Powell delivered his Rivers of Blood speech on 20 April 1968. A poll which was taken after the speech reported that 74 per cent of Britons agreed with Powell&#x27;s opinions on mass immigration. In &quot;The Trial of Enoch Powell&quot;, a Channel 4 television programme broadcast in April 1998, on the thirtieth anniversary of his Rivers of Blood speech (and two months after his death), 64 per cent of the studio audience voted that Powell was not a racist. Some in the Church of England, of which Powell was a member, took a different view. Upon Powell&#x27;s death, black Barbados-born Wilfred Wood, then Bishop of Croydon, said &quot;Enoch Powell gave a certificate of respectability to white racist views which otherwise decent people were ashamed to acknowledge&quot;.

Conservative commentator Bruce Anderson has claimed that the Rivers of Blood speech would have come as a complete surprise to anyone who had studied Powell&#x27;s record: he had been a West Midlands MP for 18 years but had said hardly anything about immigration. On this view, the speech was merely part of a badly miscalculated strategy to become party leader if Heath fell. Anderson adds that the speech had no effect on immigration, except to make it more difficult for the subject to be discussed rationally in polite society.

Powell&#x27;s opponents claimed he was far-right, fascist and racist. His supporters claim that the first two charges clash with his voting record on most social issues, such as homosexual law reform (he was actually a co-sponsor of a bill on this issue in May 1965 and opposed the death penalty, both reforms unpopular among Conservatives at the time; however, he kept a low profile to his stance on these non-party &quot;issues of conscience&quot;). Powell voted against the reinstitution of the death penalty several times between 1969 and 1987.

By the early 1960s, Powell was in support of the campaign for immigration controls. The earliest and only statement from then by Powell on immigration was in August 1956, when, in Wolverhampton, Powell said that &quot;a fundamental change in the law is necessary&quot; in the UK&#x27;s citizenship law. However, he explained that a change was not needed at that time, but did not rule out the possibility of a future change. In the late 1950s, when other Conservatives were advocating a campaign for immigration control following race riots, Powell declined to join them, remarking that it was no good discussing the details when the &quot;real issue&quot; of the citizenship laws had remained unchanged. In November 1960, Powell became one of nine members of the ministerial committee which wanted to introduce controls of Commonwealth immigration; he submitted a letter in April 1961 which said &quot;if we desire to limitations or conditions on the entry of coloured British subjects into this country&quot; a change in the existing legal definition of a &quot;British subject&quot; was needed, since the British Nationality Act 1948 considered all those from independent Commonwealth countries listed under the UK&#x27;s nationality law to be British subjects.

In February 1967, Powell wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; titled &quot;Facing up to Britain&#x27;s Race Problem&quot; in which he wrote that, long before the immigrant population had reached 5% of the overall proportion of the United Kingdom, a &quot;proportion would have filtered into the general population, mingled with it in occupation, residence, habits and intermarriage&quot; compared to the other proportion which would be &quot;more separated than now in habits, occupation and way of life&quot;.

Concerns raised about effects of coloured immigration in communities in his constituency played a part in his commentary. In March 1968, the month before the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, he made his first public references to them in a speech in Walsall, when he described the concern of an anonymous constituent whose daughter was the only white child in her primary school class and suffered bullying from non-white pupils. When &quot;Wolverhampton Express and Star&quot; journalists failed to find the child or the class, the paper&#x27;s editor and a then personal friend, Clement Jones, challenged him, stating Jones himself had similar anonymous complaints that were traced to members of the National Front (NF). Powell would not accept the explanation, and told Jones he had received &quot;bags of supporting mail&quot; as a result of the Walsall speech.

During an interview with the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, a fortnight after Powell&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, he was asked whether or not he was a racialist. He replied:

Powell accepted an invitation to appear on David Frost&#x27;s evening television programme on 3 January 1969. Frost asked Powell whether or not he was a racialist, to which Powell replied:

During the 1970 election, Tony Benn declared in a speech that Powell&#x27;s approach to immigration was &quot;evil&quot;, and said: &quot;The flag of racialism which has been hoisted in Wolverhampton is beginning to look like the one that fluttered over Dachau and Belsen.&quot; In response, when a television reporter told Powell at a meeting of Benn&#x27;s comments, Powell snatched the microphone and replied: &quot;All I will say is that for myself, in 1939 I voluntarily returned from Australia to this country, to serve as a private soldier against Germany and Nazism. I am the same man today.&quot; Similarly, Powell responded to student hecklers at a speech in Cardiff: &quot;I hope those who shouted &#x27;Fascist&#x27; and &#x27;Nazi&#x27; are aware that before they were born I was fighting against Fascism and Nazism.&quot;

In November 1968, Powell also suggested that the problems that would be caused if there were a large influx of Germans or Russians into the UK &quot;would be as serious – and in some respects more serious – than could follow from the introduction of a similar number of West Indies or Pakistanis&quot;.

Powell said his views were neither genetic nor eugenic, and that he never arranged his fellow men on a merit according to their origins.

Powell said in a 1964 speech:

In a speech in November 1968, he said:

In 1944, when Powell was visiting Poona with another member of the Joint Intelligence Committee, an Indian, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Field Marshal) K. M. Cariappa, he refused to stay at the Byculla Club once it became clear that Cariappa as an Indian would not be allowed to stay there. Close friends also recall that Powell took great pleasure in speaking Urdu when dining at Indian restaurants.

Nevertheless, Powell&#x27;s nationalism and accusations of racialism sometimes trod a fine line. In 1996, BBC journalist Michael Cockerell asked him about the language he used in the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, arguing that it could be used by self-proclaimed racialists against non-whites. In defence of the language he used in the speech, Powell replied:

Powell further went on to say that &quot;it&#x27;s not impossible but it&#x27;s difficult, for a non-white person to be British.&quot;

Victoria Honeyman, Lecturer in Politics at the University of Leeds in England, wrote of Powell&#x27;s beliefs on immigration:

Powell&#x27;s speeches and TV interviews throughout his political life displayed a suspicion towards &quot;the Establishment&quot; in general, and by the 1980s there was a regular expectation that he would make some sort of speech or act in a way designed to upset the government and ensure he would not be offered a life peerage (and thus be transferred to the House of Lords), which, some believe, he had no intention of accepting so long as Edward Heath sat in the Commons. (Heath remained in the Commons until after Powell&#x27;s death.) He had opposed the Life Peerages Act, and felt it would be hypocritical to accept a life peerage himself since no Prime Minister ever offered him a hereditary peerage.

According to Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard, Powellism was seen as a proper step toward free markets in the early 1970s, writing:

== Legacy ==
Powell sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill for a portrait in clay. The correspondence file relating to the Powell portrait bust is held as part of the Thornhill Papers (2006:56) in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation&#x27;s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist. English photographer Allan Warren photographed many portraits of Powell.

There are 24 images of Powell in the National Portrait Gallery Collection including work by Bassano&#x27;s studios, Anne-Katrin Purkiss, and a 1971 cartoon by Gerald Scarfe.

Powell&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech was subject of the play &quot;What Shadows&quot; by Chris Hannan, staged in Birmingham from 27 October to 12 November 2016, with Powell portrayed by Ian McDiarmid and Clem Jones by George Costigan. Powell appears briefly as a character in James Graham&#x27;s 2021 play &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;.

In August 2002, Powell appeared 55th in the list of &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; of all time (voted for by the public in a BBC nationwide poll).

<doc id="38275" wikidata="Q204214" url="?curid=38275" title="Tru64 UNIX">
<text>Tru64 UNIX is a discontinued 64-bit UNIX operating system for the Alpha instruction set architecture (ISA), currently owned by Hewlett-Packard (HP). Previously, Tru64 UNIX was a product of Compaq, and before that, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), where it was known as Digital UNIX (originally DEC OSF/1 AXP).

As its original name suggests, Tru64 UNIX is based on the OSF/1 operating system. DEC&#x27;s previous UNIX product was known as Ultrix and was based on BSD.

It is unusual among commercial UNIX implementations, as it is built on top of the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University. (Other UNIX and UNIX-like implementations built on top of the Mach kernel are GNU Hurd, NeXTSTEP, MkLinux, and Darwin.)

Tru64 UNIX required the SRM boot firmware found on Alpha-based computer systems.

== DEC OSF/1 AXP ==
In 1988, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) joined with IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and others to form the Open Software Foundation (OSF). A primary aim was to develop a version of Unix, named OSF/1, to compete with System V Release 4 from AT&amp;T Corporation and Sun Microsystems. After DEC&#x27;s first release (OSF/1 Release 1.0) in January 1992 for their line of MIPS-based DECstation workstations, DEC ported OSF/1 to their new Alpha AXP platform (as DEC OSF/1 AXP), and this was the first version (Release 1.2) of what is most commonly referred to as OSF/1. DEC OSF/1 AXP Release 1.2 was shipped in March 1993. OSF/1 AXP was a full 64-bit operating system and the native UNIX implementation for the Alpha architecture. After OSF/1 AXP V2.0 onwards, UNIX System V compatibility was also integrated into the system.

== Digital UNIX ==
In 1995, starting with release 3.2, DEC renamed OSF/1 AXP to Digital UNIX to reflect its conformance with the X/Open Single UNIX Specification.

== Tru64 UNIX ==
After Compaq&#x27;s purchase of DEC in early 1998, with the release of version 4.0F, Digital UNIX was renamed to Tru64 UNIX to emphasise its 64-bit-clean nature and de-emphasise the Digital brand.

In April 1999, Compaq announced that Tru64 UNIX 5.0 successfully ran on Intel&#x27;s IA-64 simulator. However, this port was cancelled a few months later.

A Chinese version of Tru64 UNIX named COSIX was jointly developed by Compaq and China National Computer Software &amp; Technology Service Corporation (CS&amp;S). It was released in 1999.

== TruCluster Server ==
From release V5.0 Tru64 UNIX offered a clustering facility named TruCluster Server. TruCluster utilised a cluster-wide filesystem visible to each cluster member, plus member specific storage and an optional quorum disk. Member specific files paths were enhanced symbolic links incorporating the member id of the owning member. Each member had one or zero votes, which, combined with a possible quorum disk, implemented a cluster formation algorithm similar to that found in OpenVMS.

==End of Life ==
With their purchase of Compaq in 2002, HP announced their intention to migrate many of Tru64 UNIX&#x27;s more innovative features (including its AdvFS, TruCluster, and LSM) to HP-UX. In December 2004, HP announced a change of plan: they would instead use the Veritas File System and abandon the Tru64 advanced features. In the process, many of the remaining Tru64 developers were laid off.

The last maintenance release, 5.1B-6 was released in October 2010.

In October 2010, HP stated that they would continue to support Tru64 UNIX until 31 December 2012.

In 2008, HP contributed the AdvFS filesystem to the open-source community.

These versions were released for Alpha AXP platforms.

<text>The PDP-7 is an 18-bit minicomputer produced by Digital Equipment Corporation as part of the PDP series. Introduced in 1964, shipped since 1965, it was the first to use their Flip-Chip technology. With a cost of , it was cheap but powerful by the standards of the time. The PDP-7 is the third of Digital&#x27;s 18-bit machines, with essentially the same instruction set architecture as the PDP-4 and the PDP-9.

==Hardware==
The PDP-7 was the first wire-wrapped PDP computer. The computer has a memory cycle time of and an add time of . Input/output (I/O) includes a keyboard, printer, punched tape and dual transport DECtape drives (type 555). The standard core memory capacity is but expandable up to 

The PDP-7 weighs about .

==Software==
DECsys, the first operating system for DEC&#x27;s 18-bit computer family (and DEC&#x27;s first operating system for a computer smaller than its 36-bit timesharing systems), was introduced in 1965. It provides an interactive, single user, program development environment for Fortran and assembly language programs.

In 1969, Ken Thompson wrote the first UNIX system, then named Unics as a pun on Multics despite only using two design elements from Multics, in assembly language on a PDP-7, as the operating system for &quot;Space Travel&quot;, a game which requires graphics to depict the motion of the planets. A PDP-7 was also the development system used during the development of MUMPS at MGH in Boston a few years earlier.

==Sales==
The PDP-7 was described as &quot;highly successful.&quot; A combined total of 120 of the PDP-7 and PDP-7A were sold. A DEC publication states that the first units shipped to customers in November 1964.

Eleven systems were shipped to the UK.

==Restorations==
At least four PDP-7s were confirmed to still exist as of 2011 and a fifth was discovered in 2017.

A PDP-7A (serial number 115) was under restoration in Oslo, Norway; a second PDP-7A (serial number 113) previously located at the University of Oregon in its Nuclear Physics laboratory is now at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle, Washington and is completely restored to running condition after being disassembled for transport; Another PDP-7 (serial number 47) is known to be in the collection of Max Burnet near Sydney, Australia, a fourth PDP-7 (serial number 33) is in storage at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California and a fifth PDP-7 (serial number 129) belonging to Fred Yerian is also located at the Museum, and has been demonstrated running Unix version 0 and compiling a B program.

<doc id="38279" wikidata="Q493858" url="?curid=38279" title="A Commentary on the UNIX Operating System">
<text>A Commentary on the Sixth Edition UNIX Operating System by John Lions (later reissued as Lions&#x27; Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition and commonly referred to as the Lions Book) is a highly influential 1976 publication containing analytical commentary on the source code of the 6th Edition Unix computer operating system &quot;resident nucleus&quot; (i.e., kernel) software, plus copy formatted and indexed by Lions, of said source code obtained from the authors at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.

Itself an exemplar of the early success of UNIX as portable code for a publishing platform, Lions&#x27;s work was typeset using UNIX tools, on systems running code ported at the University, similar to that which it documented.

It is suspected to be the most frequently photocopied book in computer science. Despite its age, Lions&#x27;s book is still considered an excellent commentary on simple, high quality code.

Lions&#x27;s work was most recently reprinted in 1996 by Peer-To-Peer Communications, and has been circulated, recreated or reconstructed variously in a number of media by other parties.

==History==

The source code and commentary were printed in book form in 1977, after first being assembled in May 1976, as a set of lecture notes for Lions&#x27;s computer science courses (6.602B and 6.657G, mentioned in the introduction of the book) at the University of New South Wales.

UNSW had obtained UNIX source code in 1975, in response to Ken Robinson&#x27;s 1974 query to Dennis Ritchie at Bell. Bell Labs was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, due to the 1956 Consent Decree AT&amp;T was not permitted to conduct business in any other field hence couldn&#x27;t sell the software, though it was required, paradoxically, to license its inventions, such as Unix and the transistor. Western Electric, another AT&amp;T subsidiary, administered the licensing. From 1977, with the v7 &amp; later licenses, AT&amp;T forbade code commentaries for teaching and allowed only one copy of the Lions Commentary, printed, per license.

The UNIX User&#x27;s group, USENIX&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;UNIX News&quot;, of March 1977, announced the availability of the book to UNIX licensees.

Difficulty in keeping pace with the book&#x27;s popularity, meant that by 1978 it was available only from AT&amp;T Bell Labs.

When AT&amp;T announced UNIX Version 7 at USENIX in June 1979, the academic/research license no longer automatically permitted classroom use. However, thousands of computer science students around the world spread photocopies. As they were not being taught it in class, they would sometimes meet after hours to discuss the book. Many pioneers of UNIX and open source had a treasured multiple-generation photocopy.

Other follow-on effects of the license change included Andrew S. Tanenbaum creating Minix. As Tanenbaum wrote in &quot;Operating Systems&quot; (1987):

Various UNIX people, particularly Peter H. Salus, Dennis Ritchie and Berny Goodheart, lobbied Unix&#x27;s various owners (AT&amp;T, Novell, the Santa Cruz Operation) for many years to allow the book to be published officially. In 1996, the Santa Cruz Operation finally authorised the release of the twenty-year-old 6th Edition source code (along with the source code of other versions of &quot;Ancient UNIX&quot;), and the full code plus the 1977 version of the commentary was published by Peer-To-Peer Communications (). The reissue includes commentary from Michael Tilson (SCO), Peter Salus, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Peter Collinson, Greg Rose, Mike O&#x27;Dell, Berny Goodheart and Peter Reintjes.

== Contents ==
&quot;UNIX Operating System Source Code Level Six&quot; is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions to better separate the functionality — system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference.

The code as presented will run on a PDP-11/40 with RK05 disk drive, LP11 line printer interface, PCL11 paper tape writer and KL11 terminal interface, or a suitable PDP-11 emulator, such as SIMH.

&quot;A Commentary on the UNIX Operating System&quot; starts with notes on UNIX and other useful documentation (the UNIX manual pages, DEC hardware manuals and so on), a section on the architecture of the PDP-11 and a chapter on how to read C programs. The source commentary follows, divided into the same sections as the code. The book ends with suggested exercises for the student.

As Lions explains, this commentary supplements the comments in the source. It is possible to understand the code without the extra commentary, and the reader is advised to do so and only read the notes as needed. The commentary also remarks on how the code might be improved.

==&quot;You are not expected to understand this&quot;==
The infamous program comment &quot;You are not expected to understand this&quot; occurs on line 2238 of the source code (&quot;Lions&#x27; Commentary&quot;, p. 22) at the end of a comment explaining the process exchange mechanism. It refers to line 325 of the file slp.c. The source code reads:
 /*
 * If the new process paused because it was
 * swapped out, set the stack level to the last call
 * to savu(u_ssav). This means that the return
 * which is executed immediately after the call to aretu
 * actually returns from the last routine which did
 * the savu.
 * You are not expected to understand this.
 if(rp-&gt;p_flag&amp;SSWAP) {
 rp-&gt;p_flag =&amp; ~SSWAP;
 aretu(u.u_ssav);


A major reason why this piece of code was hard to understand was that it depended on a quirk of the way the C-compiler for the PDP-11 saved registers in procedure calls. This code failed when ported to other machines and had to be redesigned in Version 7 UNIX. Dennis Ritchie later explained the meaning of this remark:

<doc id="38282" wikidata="Q265222" url="?curid=38282" title="NOFX">
<text>NOFX () was an American punk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Bassist/lead vocalist Fat Mike, rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin and drummer Erik Sandin were original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release by the band, although Sandin departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year. El Hefe joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the best-known iteration of the lineup.

NOFX&#x27;s mainstream success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s; unlike many of their contemporaries, however, they had never been signed to a major label. NOFX released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays and a number of 7&quot; singles over a career spanning more than four decades. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; (1994), which is their only release to receive a gold certification by the RIAA. Their fifteenth and final studio album, &quot;Double Album&quot;, was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands ever. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse entitled &quot;NOFX: Backstage Passport&quot;. The band broke up in 2024 after a farewell tour.

==History==
===Early years (1983–1987)===
In 1983, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a Boston hardcore punk band called Negative FX. At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik &quot;Smelly&quot; Sandin. NOFX&#x27;s first recording was a demo from 1984, entitled &quot;Thalidomide Child&quot;, produced by Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell many copies, and Fat Mike once claimed that no copies existed. The demo would be re-released in 2012. The group released its self-titled debut extended play &quot;NOFX&quot; on Mystic Records in 1985; it was later re-released in 1992 as part of the &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; CD.

The band&#x27;s line-up underwent numerous changes prior to 1991. For a year, Erik &quot;Smelly&quot; Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released the extended play &quot;So What If We&#x27;re on Mystic!&quot;. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play &quot;The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This&quot;, attacking the PMRC&#x27;s campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&amp;M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of &quot;Liberal Animation&quot;, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the &quot;NOFX&quot; and &quot;So What If We&#x27;re on Mystic!&quot; extended plays, and only around 1,000 copies were pressed. The album&#x27;s cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the &quot;NOFX&quot; extended play.

===First four albums and signing to Epitaph (1988–1993)===
NOFX recorded their debut studio album &quot;Liberal Animation&quot; in 1988 with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some of the album&#x27;s lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the &quot;Liberal Animation&quot; album. The album was reissued in 1991 on Gurewitz&#x27;s label Epitaph Records. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of &quot;Liberal Animation&quot; and was replaced by Steve Kidwiler. The band released its second studio album, &quot;S&amp;M Airlines&quot;, through Epitaph in 1989.

In 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, &quot;Ribbed&quot;. Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiler left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. &quot;El Hefe&quot;) joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play &quot;The Longest Line&quot;, followed by the studio album &quot;White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean&quot;, released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX&#x27;s former label Mystic Records released &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot;, which compiles early singles and demo songs and is a reissue of their 1989 long-out-of-print compilation tape &quot;E Is for Everything&quot;. Despite being referred to as an &quot;official&quot; release, Fat Mike has been quoted as saying that he did not know that the album existed until he saw a copy of it &quot;in a store.&quot;

===Rise to popularity (1994–1999)===

In the wake of the 1990s punk rock revival revolution (dominated by Green Day, the Offspring, Bad Religion and Rancid), NOFX released their fifth studio album &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; in July 1994. It is one of the band&#x27;s most successful albums, peaking at number twelve on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers chart, and obtaining gold status six years after its release. Although one of the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Leave It Alone&quot; got airplay on active rock radio stations, the most notable being KROQ, its music video never received airplay on MTV. Fat Mike has been quoted saying, &quot;We made the &#x27;Leave It Alone&#x27; video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn&#x27;t want to be a part of that machine, of that &#x27;punk wave. &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.

Due to the success of &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. In 1995, the band released its first live album, &quot;I Heard They Suck Live!!&quot;. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating &quot;We&#x27;ve been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!&quot; 

&quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; was followed by 1996&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Petting Zoo&quot;, whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name &quot;Eating Lamb&quot;. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The &quot;Eating Lamb&quot; version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: &quot;Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn&#x27;t so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium.&quot;

In 1997, the band released &quot;So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes&quot;, a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, &quot;It&#x27;s My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite.&quot;

NOFX released &quot;The Decline&quot;, an 18-minute single-track extended play, which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary, in 1999. &quot;The Decline&quot;, clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (behind Crass&#x27; 20-minute song &quot;Taking Sides&quot;).

===Move from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords (2000–2008)===
NOFX released its eighth studio album, &quot;Pump Up the Valuum&quot;, in 2000. It was the band&#x27;s final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike&#x27;s own label, Fat Wreck Chords.

In 2002, the band recorded &quot;BYO Split Series Volume III&quot;, a split album with Rancid, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.
NOFX released its ninth studio album, &quot;The War on Errorism&quot;, in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping &quot;Rock Against Bush&quot; albums, and started a Rock Against Bush U.S. tour. The song &quot;Separation of Church and Skate&quot; from the album was featured in the game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;. In 2004, a previously unreleased demo version of their song &quot;Concerns of a GOP Neo-Phyte&quot; was contributed to the compilation album &quot;Take Action! Vol. 4&quot;.

In February 2005, the band launched the NOFX 7&quot; of the Month Club, a subscription-based service, which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the extended plays.

On March 14, 2006, the EP &quot;Never Trust a Hippy&quot; was released. It was followed on April 18 by the studio album &quot;Wolves in Wolves&#x27; Clothing&quot;. On September 12, 2006, the video game &quot;EA Sports&quot; &quot;NHL 07&quot; was released, featuring &quot;Wolves in Wolves&#x27; Clothing&quot; on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX&#x27;s song &quot;Kill All the White Man&quot; was played briefly in the action movie &quot;Crank&quot; in 2006, and was credited as such in the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, &quot;They&#x27;ve Actually Gotten Worse Live!&quot;, released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as &quot;their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever ... and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album &quot;I Heard They Suck Live&quot;.&quot;

NOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which was the basis for a documentary, &quot;NOFX: Backstage Passport&quot;, which aired on Fuse TV about its worldwide tour. The show was entitled &quot;NOFX: Backstage Passport&quot;.

===&quot;Coaster&quot;, &quot;Cokie the Clown&quot; and &quot;Self-Entitled&quot; (2009–2014)===

In February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiler and Dave Casillas for its 25th-anniversary special performances. They played three sold-out shows, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood, and one in S.F. NOFX released a new album, &quot;Coaster&quot;, on April 28, 2009. The band worked with the same co-producer, Bill Stevenson, who produced its previous album, &quot;Wolves in Wolves&#x27; Clothing&quot;. NOFX was also added to the lineup for the Warped Tour 2009. They also toured Australia and New Zealand in late 2009 with Bad Religion.

NOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009, titled &quot;Cokie the Clown&quot;. It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called &quot;Cokie the Clown&quot; and &quot;My Orphan Year&quot;. The extended play consists of outtakes from the &quot;Coaster&quot; sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 &quot;Fermented and Flailing&quot; tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album &quot;Coaster&quot;.

During this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play&#x27;s cover and the &quot;Cokie the Clown&quot; music video) during live performances. Fat Mike performed a solo acoustic performance on March 20, 2010, at the SXSW Festival as Cokie, which was described as &quot;strange, emotional, and intimate.&quot; At the end of the concert, after debuting a new song called &quot;Drinking Pee&quot;, a video that was played for the audience suggested that a number of festival participants unknowingly drank Fat Mike&#x27;s urine. The stunt resulted in Fat Mike getting banned from the Austin, Texas, venue, Emo&#x27;s. In May 2010, NOFX posted a video online that showed Fat Mike urinating into a bottle of Patrón as was previously announced, but then switching the bottle before going on stage to a bottle not containing any urine. Months later in an interview, Mike stated that he had &quot;always wanted to be banned from somewhere.&quot;

On June 21, 2010, NOFX announced that they were going to release a compilation album titled &quot;The Longest EP,&quot; a compilation of selected songs from its extended plays from 1987 to 2009. It was released on August 17, 2010.

On November 23, 2010, Fat Wreck Chords released &quot;NOFX / The Spits&quot;, a split EP with the Seattle, Washington, band the Spits. It contained two new songs from each band.

In a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, Fat Mike revealed that a new NOFX album was in production, saying &quot;There are some really good songs on &quot;Coaster&quot;, but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That&#x27;s why there are songs on there about Iron Maiden and Tegan and Sara. I&#x27;m reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I&#x27;m going in a lot of different directions.&quot; In December 2011, Fat Mike revealed to &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; that he has begun work on a new NOFX album and a soundtrack to a &quot;fetish film&quot; called &quot;Rubber Bordello&quot;.

In June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which would have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.

Along with a self-titled 10&quot; of 1980s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also planned to re-release their first recordings in the summer of 2011. The 10&quot; features covers from the Necros and D.O.A. and songs such as &quot;Police Brutality&quot; and &quot;Race Riot.&quot; The album was released on a vinyl record and has been distributed to independent record companies around the U.S., Great Britain, and elsewhere.

On February 14, 2012, in an article on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s website, Fat Mike said that a new album was on the way. &quot;We&#x27;re recording in April, and it should be out in the fall. I&#x27;ve got 12 songs, but I don&#x27;t have a name for it, and only a few of the songs are finished,&quot; he says. &quot;We&#x27;re demo-ing it right now.&quot;

A 7&quot; single, &quot;My Stepdad&#x27;s a Cop and My Stepmom&#x27;s a Domme&quot;, featuring new songs recorded prior to the sessions for &quot;Self Entitled&quot;, was released in June 2012.
NOFX released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Self Entitled&quot;, on September 11, 2012. NOFX also released &quot;X&#x27;mas Has Been X&#x27;d&quot; on January 15, 2013, and their 30th anniversary LP box set on February 19, 2013.

NOFX toured in Australia starting November 5, 2014. They performed in Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales, Wollongong, Brisbane, Darwin, Northern Territory, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Geelong, and Gold Coast, Queensland.

===&quot;First Ditch Effort&quot; and singles (2015–2020)===
NOFX toured the United States in the summer of 2015 celebrating the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords. Supporting acts for this tour were Lagwagon, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Strung Out, Propagandhi, Swingin&#x27; Utters, Bracket, ToyGuitar, the Flatliners, Masked Intruder and Bad Cop/Bad Cop. Guitarist El Hefe said that NOFX was going to work on new music after the Fat Wreck Chords 25th anniversary tour. On their tour to Europe, NOFX stated their new album would be out in September 2016. On July 19, 2016, the band&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;First Ditch Effort&quot;, was announced, to be released on October 7; the lead single &quot;Six Years on Dope&quot; was released the same day. On April 17, 2016, they released their autobiography, called &quot;NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories.&quot; During the tour, named the Hepatitis Bathtub Tour, they did book signings on some dates. On December 16 a special hard-covered edition with a seven-inch four-song vinyl (titled &quot;Hepatitis Bathtub&quot;) and a bath towel was also released.

In March 2018, NOFX released a new single &quot;There&#x27;s No &#x27;Too Soon&#x27; if Time Is Relative&quot;, in tribute to physicist Stephen Hawking, who had died days earlier. The track had been recorded a month prior to its release. Several days later, they announced the first annual &quot;Camp Punk in Drublic Festival&quot; in Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio. The three-day event was to feature NOFX alongside Rancid, Pennywise, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. In a May 2018 interview, Fat Mike hinted that NOFX was working on new material.

In February 2019, Fat Mike announced the NOFX 7&quot; of the Month Club, a new subscription-based service scheduled for the release of 12 new extended plays almost monthly. As with the previous 2005 installment, the cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries.

On August 16, 2019, NOFX released a new single, &quot;Fish in a Gun Barrel&quot;. The song was written in response to mass shootings in America, with proceeds from the single going to anti-gun-violence charity Moms Demand Action.

On March 23, 2020, NOFX released a video for another new song, &quot;PRBOD&quot;. A few days later, the band released a video for &quot;another new song that didn&#x27;t make it on the new album&quot; called &quot;The Oddition&quot;.

=== Final releases and retirement (2021–2024)===

On January 12, 2021, NOFX announced that they would release their first studio album in nearly five years, &quot;Single Album&quot;, on February 26.

On September 1, 2022, Fat Mike confirmed in a reply to a comment in an Instagram post that NOFX would be disbanding in 2023, the year of the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, and suggested that their final show may take place in their hometown of Los Angeles, California.

On September 27, 2022, NOFX announced their next album, &quot;Double Album&quot;, would come out on December 2, 2022. They released the single &quot;Darby Crashing,&quot; a reworked version of a song from their 2019-2020 &quot;7 inch of the Month Club&quot;, on the same day.

NOFX also announced three in-progress albums: &quot;Half Album&quot;, &quot;Everybody Else Is Insane&quot;, and &quot;NOFX: A–Z&quot;. On March 6, 2024, &quot;Half Album&quot; was revealed to be an EP, which was released on April 19, 2024, and the band released the single &quot;I&#x27;m a Rat&quot;.

NOFX played their final ever live shows after 41 years of performing live from October 4–6, 2024 in San Pedro, California. During their final show on October 6, NOFX played a new song that they had never performed live before or even released, &quot;We Did It Our Way&quot;, as their penultimate song in the show. Fat Mike described the tune as their &quot;thank you&quot; to fans and everyone onstage.

==Musical style and influences==
Critics have labeled NOFX&#x27;s style as primarily punk rock, melodic hardcore, skate punk, ska punk, and pop-punk. Fat Mike, in a 2021 &quot;Spin&quot; interview, identified NOFX as a melodic hardcore band, rejecting critics&#x27; labeling of the band&#x27;s style as pop-punk.

The band cites its influences as Bad Religion, Rich Kids on LSD, D.I., SNFU, Operation Ivy, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Dead Milkmen, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Adrenalin O.D., Minor Threat, Germs, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, the Adolescents, Misfits, and Subhumans.

==Controversy==
In 2018, the band attracted significant controversy after statements by Fat Mike and rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin during a concert in Las Vegas on May 30, 2018. Referencing the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Melvin stated &quot;I guess you only get shot in Vegas if you&#x27;re in a country band,&quot; and Mike replied with “You know, that [massacre] sucked, but least they were country fans and not punk rock fans.&quot; The lead sponsor of the Punk in Drublic festival, Stone Brewing Co., pulled support from the festival as well as from NOFX&#x27;s line of craft beer. NOFX and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were subsequently removed from the festival&#x27;s lineup.

The band later apologized, stating, &quot;What we said in Vegas was shitty and insensitive and we are all embarrassed by our remarks.&quot; In June 2018 the band stated that all of their U.S. concerts had been canceled and they had been &quot;effectively banned&quot; from playing in the United States due to the comments. However, Fat Mike later clarified otherwise, stating that &quot;Our promoter canceled — my partner [not the venues].&quot;

<text>Glam rock is a style of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was primarily defined by the flamboyant clothing, makeup, and hairstyles of its musicians, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists drew on diverse sources, ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with other gender roles. Glitter rock was a more extreme version of glam rock.

The UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975. The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC&#x27;s music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;—performing &quot;Hot Love&quot;—wearing glitter and satins, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists included David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music, Alvin Stardust and Gary Glitter. Though not central to the genre, artists such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Freddie Mercury of Queen also adopted glam styles. In the United States, the scene was much less prevalent, with Alice Cooper and Lou Reed the only American artists to score a hit in the UK. Other American glam artists include New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop and Jobriath. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, glam metal, death rock and gothic rock. The New Romantic movement, which began as an underground fashion subculture movement in nightclubs in the late 1970s before becoming mainstream in the early 80s, was also inspired by the visuals of the glam rock era.

==Characteristics==

Glam rock can be seen as a fashion as well as musical subgenre. Glam artists rejected the revolutionary rhetoric of the late 1960s rock scene, instead glorifying decadence, superficiality, and the simple structures of earlier pop music. In response to these characteristics, scholars such as I.Taylor and D. Wall characterised glam rock as &quot;offensive, commercial, and cultural emasculation&quot;.

Artists drew on such musical influences as bubblegum pop, the brash guitar riffs of hard rock, stomping rhythms, and 1950s rock and roll, filtering them through the recording innovations of the late 1960s. Ultimately, it became very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art pop of Roxy Music. In its beginning, it was a youth-orientated reaction to the creeping dominance of progressive rock and concept albums – what &quot;Bomp!&quot; called the &quot;overall denim dullness&quot; of &quot;a deadly boring, prematurely matured music scene&quot;.

Visually, it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamour, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. Glam rock is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics.

It was prefigured by the flamboyant English composer Noël Coward, especially his 1931 song &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;, with music writer Daryl Easlea stating, &quot;Noël Coward&#x27;s influence on people like Bowie, Roxy Music and Cockney Rebel was absolutely immense. It suggested style, artifice and surface were equally as important as depth and substance. &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted Coward&#x27;s &#x27;sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise&#x27;. It reads like a glam manifesto.&quot; Showmanship and gender identity manipulation acts included the Cockettes and Alice Cooper, the latter of which combined glam with shock rock.

==History==

Glam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and a reaction against, those trends. Its origins are associated with Marc Bolan, who had renamed his acoustic duo T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Bolan was, in the words of music critic Ken Barnes, &quot;the man who started it all&quot;. Often cited as the moment of inception is Bolan&#x27;s appearance on the BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), &quot;Hot Love&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; states that Bolan&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; &quot;permitted a generation of teeny-boppers to begin playing with the idea of androgyny&quot;. T. Rex&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; received critical acclaim as a pioneering glam rock album. In 1973, a few months after the release of the album &quot;Tanx&quot;, Bolan captured the front cover of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine with the declaration &quot;Glam rock is dead!&quot;
From late 1971, already a minor star, David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional makeup, mime and performance into his act. Bowie, in a 1972 interview in which he noted that other artists described as glam rock were doing different work, said &quot;I think glam rock is a lovely way to categorize me and it&#x27;s even nicer to be one of the leaders of it&quot;. Bolan and Bowie were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, Sweet, Slade, Mott the Hoople, Mud and Alvin Stardust. The popularity of glam rock in the UK was such that three glam rock bands had major UK Christmas hit singles; &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; by Slade, &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; by Wizzard and &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; by Mud, all of which have remained hugely popular. Glam was not only a highly successful trend in UK popular music, it became dominant in other aspects of British popular culture during the 1970s.

A heavier variant of glam rock, emphasising guitar riff centric songs, driving rhythms and live performance with audience participation, were represented by bands like Slade and Mott the Hoople, with later followers such as Def Leppard, Cheap Trick, Poison, Kiss, and Quiet Riot, some of which either covered Slade compositions (such as &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; and &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;) or composed new songs based on Slade templates. While highly successful in the single charts in the UK (Slade for example had six number one singles), very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the US; David Bowie was the major exception, becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as &quot;glitter rock&quot; and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.

In the UK, the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and the independent band with whom he often performed known as the Glitter Band. The Glitter Band and Gary Glitter had between them eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1975. A second wave of glam rock acts, including Suzi Quatro, Roy Wood&#x27;s Wizzard and Sparks, had hits on the British single charts in 1973 and 1974. Quatro and T.Rex directly inspired the pioneering Los Angeles based all-girl group The Runaways. Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including Rod Stewart, Elton John, Queen and, for a time, the Rolling Stones. After seeing Marc Bolan wearing Zandra Rhodes-designed outfits, Freddie Mercury enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next Queen tour in 1974. Punk rock, in part a reaction to the artifice of glam rock, but using some elements of the genre, including makeup and involving cover versions of glam rock records, helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976.

==Influence and legacy==

While glam rock was exclusively a British cultural phenomenon, with Steven Wells in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing &quot;Americans only got glam second hand via the posh Bowie version&quot;, covers of British glam rock classics are now piped-muzak staples at US sporting events. Glam rock was a background influence for Richard O&#x27;Brien, writer of the 1973 London musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. Although glam rock went into a steep decline in popularity in the UK in the second half of the 1970s, it had a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including Kiss and American glam metal acts like Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Ratt.

New Romantic acts in the UK such as Adam and the Ants and A Flock of Seagulls extended glam, and its androgyny and sexual politics were picked up by acts including Culture Club, Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Gothic rock was largely informed by the makeup, clothes, theatricality and sound of glam, and punk rock adopted some of the performance and persona-creating tendencies of glam, as well as the genre&#x27;s emphasis on pop-art qualities and simple but powerful instrumentation.
Glam rock has been influential around the world. In Japan in the 1980s, visual kei was strongly influenced by glam rock aesthetics. Glam rock has since enjoyed continued influence and sporadic modest revivals in R&amp;B crossover act Prince, bands such as Marilyn Manson, Suede, Placebo, Chainsaw Kittens, Spacehog and the Darkness, and has inspired pop artists such as Lady Gaga.

==Relationship to the LGBT community==

The glam rock scene that emerged in early 1970s London included numerous openly bisexual musicians, including Queen&#x27;s Freddie Mercury, Elton John, and David Bowie. Medium&#x27;s Claudia Perry felt that &quot;Glam rock was a queer paradise of sorts. Watching Mick Ronson and Bowie frolic onstage gave hope to every queer kid in the world. John&#x27;s flamboyancy was also of great comfort. Marc Bolan of T. Rex is still the subject of speculation (a friend who worked at Creem remembers him coming on to just about everyone when he came through Detroit, but this clearly isn&#x27;t definitive).&quot; Glam also rock helped to normalise androgynous fashion. Jobriath, the rock scene&#x27;s first openly gay star, was also part of the glam rock scene.

Glam rock hits &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; by Lou Reed and &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; by David Bowie also brought attention to non-heteronormative situations in the world of rock. When discussing &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, Tim Bowers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; recalls that &quot;glam&#x27;s vocals had a fruity theatricality, supporting lyrics that presented as a boast: &quot;Your mother can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re a boy or a girl.&quot; Glam was butch and femme at once: bisexuality in sound.&quot;

&quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, soundtracked by primarily glam rock, was a keystone of LGBTQ media in the 1970s. A song from the show, &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot;, was noted as &quot;the first big, glam rock aria of the musical&quot; and that glam rock &quot;was a queering (or camping) of the genre of rock music&quot; in the book &quot;Trans Representations in Contemporary, Popular Cinema&quot;. The musical &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; from 2001 also used glam rock to tell the story of a gender-affirming surgery gone awry. In discussing why glam rock was used for Hedwig, the article goes on to say &quot;by showcasing a more fluid approach to gender expression, glam rock artists like David Bowie, Marc Bolan, and Freddie Mercury became icons for the LGBTQ+ community. They helped pave the way for greater acceptance and understanding.&quot;

<text>A musician is someone who composes, conducts, or performs music. According to the United States Employment Service, &quot;musician&quot; is a general term used to designate a person who follows music as a profession. Musicians include songwriters, who write both music and lyrics for songs; conductors, who direct a musical performance; and performers, who perform for an audience. A music performer is generally either a singer (also known as a vocalist), who provides vocals, or an instrumentalist, who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. Musicians can specialize in a musical genre, though many play a variety of different styles and blend or cross said genres, a musician&#x27;s musical output depending on a variety of technical and other background influences including their culture, skillset, life experience, education, and creative preferences. A musician who records and releases music is often referred to as a recording artist; while a musician who primarily writes and records art music, media soundtracks and scores—including for films, theatrical stage productions, and video games—or classical music is usually called a composer. A music producer, while not necesarilly a musician outright, may themselves be a musician. A conductor, by way of gestures, leads and provides live direction for, or &quot;conducts&quot;, an ensemble, typically an orchestra or choral group.

== Types ==
===Composer===

A composer is a musician who creates musical compositions. The title is principally used for those who write classical music or film music. Those who write the music for popular songs may be called songwriters. Those who mainly write the words for songs may be referred to as lyricists.

===Conductor===

A conductor directs a musical performance; conducting has been defined as &quot;the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture&quot;. The conductor stands on a raised podium and communicates with the musicians through hand gestures or eye contact.
===Performer===

Examples of performers include, but are not limited to, instrumentalists and singers who perform for an audience. A musician can perform as a solo artist or as a part of an ensemble (e.g. an orchestra, a choir or a pop group).

===Producer===
A music producer plays a crucial role in shaping the sound of an album or song, overseeing the recording process, and guiding the overall creative direction. They often collaborate closely with artists, musicians, sound engineers, and other industry professionals.

<doc id="38286" wikidata="Q35865" url="?curid=38286" title="Inflation">
<text>In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. This is usually measured using a consumer price index (CPI). When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of CPI inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index. As prices faced by households do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose.

Changes in inflation are widely attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money; uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings; and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.

Today, some economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation, though inflation is less popular with the general public than with economists, since &quot;inflation simultaneously transfers some of [the] people&#x27;s income into the hands of government.&quot; Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to central banks that control monetary policy, normally through the setting of interest rates and by carrying out open market operations.

== Terminology ==
The term originates from the Latin &quot;inflare&quot; (to blow into or inflate). Conceptually, inflation refers to the general trend of prices, not changes in any specific price. For example, if people choose to buy more cucumbers than tomatoes, cucumbers consequently become more expensive and tomatoes less expensive. These changes are not related to inflation; they reflect a shift in tastes. Inflation is related to the value of currency itself. When currency was linked with gold, if new gold deposits were found, the price of gold and the value of currency would fall, and consequently, prices of all other goods would become higher.

===Classical economics===
By the nineteenth century, economists categorised three separate factors that cause a rise or fall in the price of goods: a change in the &quot;value&quot; or production costs of the good, a change in the &quot;price of money&quot; which then was usually a fluctuation in the commodity price of the metallic content in the currency, and &quot;currency depreciation&quot; resulting from an increased supply of currency relative to the quantity of redeemable metal backing the currency. Following the proliferation of private banknote currency printed during the American Civil War, the term &quot;inflation&quot; started to appear as a direct reference to the &quot;currency depreciation&quot; that occurred as the quantity of redeemable banknotes outstripped the quantity of metal available for their redemption. At that time, the term inflation referred to the devaluation of the currency, and not to a rise in the price of goods. This relationship between the over-supply of banknotes and a resulting depreciation in their value was noted by earlier classical economists such as David Hume and David Ricardo, who would go on to examine and debate what effect a currency devaluation has on the price of goods.

=== Related concepts ===
Other economic concepts related to inflation include: deflationa fall in the general price level; disinflationa decrease in the rate of inflation; hyperinflationan out-of-control inflationary spiral; stagflationa combination of inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment; reflationan attempt to raise the general level of prices to counteract deflationary pressures; and asset price inflationa general rise in the prices of financial assets without a corresponding increase in the prices of goods or services; agflationan advanced increase in the price for food and industrial agricultural crops when compared with the general rise in prices.

More specific forms of inflation refer to sectors whose prices vary semi-independently from the general trend. &quot;House price inflation&quot; applies to changes in the house price index while &quot;energy inflation&quot; is dominated by the costs of oil and gas.

==History==
===Overview===

Inflation has been a feature of history during the entire period when money has been used as a means of payment. One of the earliest documented inflations occurred in Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire 330 BCE. Historically, when commodity money was used, periods of inflation and deflation would alternate depending on the condition of the economy. However, when large, prolonged infusions of gold or silver into an economy occurred, this could lead to long periods of inflation.

The adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the 18th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Rapid increases in the money supply have taken place a number of times in countries experiencing political crises, producing hyperinflationsepisodes of extreme inflation rates much higher than those observed in earlier periods of commodity money. The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example. The hyperinflation in Venezuela is the highest in the world, with an annual inflation rate of 833,997% as of October 2018.

Historically, inflations of varying magnitudes have occurred, interspersed with corresponding deflationary periods, from the price revolution of the 16th century, which was driven by the flood of gold and particularly silver seized and mined by the Spaniards in Latin America, to the largest paper money inflation of all time in Hungary after World War II.

However, since the 1980s, inflation has been held low and stable in countries with independent central banks. This has led to a moderation of the business cycle and a reduction in variation in most macroeconomic indicatorsan event known as the Great Moderation.

===Ancient Europe===

Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE was followed by one of the earliest documented inflation periods in the ancient world. Rapid increases in the quantity of money or in the overall money supply have occurred in many different societies throughout history, changing with different forms of money used. For instance, when silver was used as currency, the government could collect silver coins, melt them down, mix them with other, less valuable metals such as copper or lead and reissue them at the same nominal value, a process known as debasement. At the ascent of Nero as Roman emperor in AD 54, the denarius contained more than 90% silver, but by the 270s hardly any silver was left. By diluting the silver with other metals, the government could issue more coins without increasing the amount of silver used to make them. When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way, the government profits from an increase in seigniorage. This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered. As the relative value of the coins becomes lower, consumers would need to give more coins in exchange for the same goods and services as before. These goods and services would experience a price increase as the value of each coin is reduced. Again at the end of the third century CE during the reign of Diocletian, the Roman Empire experienced rapid inflation.

===Ancient China===
Song dynasty China introduced the practice of printing paper money to create fiat currency. During the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the government spent a great deal of money fighting costly wars, and reacted by printing more money, leading to inflation. Fearing the inflation that plagued the Yuan dynasty, the Ming dynasty initially rejected the use of paper money, and reverted to using copper coins.

===Medieval Egypt===
During the Malian king Mansa Musa&#x27;s hajj to Mecca in 1324, he was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels. When he passed through Cairo, he spent or gave away so much gold that it depressed its price in Egypt for over a decade, reducing its purchasing power. A contemporary Arab historian remarked about Mansa Musa&#x27;s visit:

=== Medieval age and &quot;price revolution&quot; in Western Europe===

There is no reliable evidence of inflation in Europe for the thousand years that followed the fall of the Roman Empire, but from the Middle Ages onwards reliable data do exist. Mostly, the medieval inflation episodes were modest, and there was a tendency that inflationary periods were followed by deflationary periods.

From the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, Western Europe experienced a major inflationary cycle referred to as the &quot;price revolution&quot;, with prices on average rising perhaps sixfold over 150 years. This is often attributed to the influx of gold and silver from the New World into Habsburg Spain, with wider availability of silver in previously cash-starved Europe causing widespread inflation. European population rebound from the Black Death began before the arrival of New World metal, and may have begun a process of inflation that New World silver compounded later in the 16th century.

===After 1700===

A pattern of intermittent inflation and deflation periods persisted for centuries until the Great Depression in the 1930s, which was characterized by major deflation. Since the Great Depression, however, there has been a general tendency for prices to rise every year. In the 1970s and early 1980s, annual inflation in most industrialized countries reached two digits (ten percent or more). The double-digit inflation era was of short duration, however, inflation by the mid-1980s returned to more modest levels. Amid this, general trends there have been spectacular high-inflation episodes in individual countries in interwar Europe, towards the end of the Nationalist Chinese government in 1948–1949, and later in some Latin American countries, in Israel, and in Zimbabwe. Some of these episodes are considered hyperinflation periods, normally designating inflation rates that surpass 50 percent monthly.

== Measures ==
Given that there are many possible measures of the price level, there are many possible measures of price inflation. Most frequently, the term &quot;inflation&quot; refers to a rise in a broad price index representing the overall price level for goods and services in the economy. The consumer price index (CPI), the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI) and the GDP deflator are some examples of broad price indices. However, &quot;inflation&quot; may also be used to describe a rising price level within a narrower set of assets, goods or services within the economy, such as commodities (including food, fuel, metals), tangible assets (such as real estate), services (such as entertainment and health care), or labor. Although the values of capital assets are often casually said to &quot;inflate,&quot; this should not be confused with inflation as a defined term; a more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation. The FBI (CCI), the producer price index, and employment cost index (ECI) are examples of narrow price indices used to measure price inflation in particular sectors of the economy. Core inflation is a measure of inflation for a subset of consumer prices that excludes food and energy prices, which rise and fall more than other prices in the short term. The Federal Reserve Board pays particular attention to the core inflation rate to get a better estimate of long-term future inflation trends overall.

The inflation rate is most widely calculated by determining the movement or change in a price index, typically the consumer price index. 

The inflation rate is the percentage change of a price index over time. The Retail Prices Index is also a measure of inflation that is commonly used in the United Kingdom. It is broader than the CPI and contains a larger basket of goods and services. Inflation is politically driven, and policy can directly influence the trend of inflation.

The RPI is indicative of the experiences of a wide range of household types, particularly low-income households.

To illustrate the method of calculation, in January 2007, the U.S. Consumer Price Index was 202.416, and in January 2008 it was 211.080. The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of the year is: formula_1

The resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one-year period is 4.28%, meaning the general level of prices for typical U.S. consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007.

Other widely used price indices for calculating price inflation include the following:
* Producer price indices (PPIs) which measures average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output. This differs from the CPI in that price subsidization, profits, and taxes may cause the amount received by the producer to differ from what the consumer paid. There is also typically a delay between an increase in the PPI and any eventual increase in the CPI. Producer price index measures the pressure being put on producers by the costs of their raw materials. This could be &quot;passed on&quot; to consumers, or it could be absorbed by profits, or offset by increasing productivity. In India and the United States, an earlier version of the PPI was called the Wholesale price index.
* Commodity price indices, which measure the price of a selection of commodities. In the present commodity price indices are weighted by the relative importance of the components to the &quot;all in&quot; cost of an employee.
* Core price indices: because food and oil prices can change quickly due to changes in supply and demand conditions in the food and oil markets, it can be difficult to detect the long run trend in price levels when those prices are included. Therefore, most statistical agencies also report a measure of &#x27;core inflation&#x27;, which removes the most volatile components (such as food and oil) from a broad price index like the CPI. Because core inflation is less affected by short run supply and demand conditions in specific markets, central banks rely on it to better measure the inflationary effect of current monetary policy.

Other common measures of inflation are:
* GDP deflator is a measure of the price of all the goods and services included in gross domestic product (GDP). The US Commerce Department publishes a deflator series for US GDP, defined as its nominal GDP measure divided by its real GDP measure.

∴ formula_2
* Regional inflation The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down CPI-U calculations down to different regions of the US.
* Historical inflation Before collecting consistent econometric data became standard for governments, and for the purpose of comparing absolute, rather than relative standards of living, various economists have calculated imputed inflation figures. Most inflation data before the early 20th century is imputed based on the known costs of goods, rather than compiled at the time. It is also used to adjust for the differences in real standard of living for the presence of technology.
* Asset price inflation is an undue increase in the prices of real assets, such as real estate.
In some cases, the measures are meant to be more humorous or to reflect a single place. This includes:

* The Christmas Price Index, which calculates the cost of the items mentioned in a song, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;.
* The Big Mac Index, which compares prices across countries.
* The Jollof index, which calculates the price of food needed to make a Jollof rice, a popular African dish.
* The Two Dishes One Soup Index, which calculates the price of food needed to cook one soup and two other dishes for a small family in Hong Kong.
* The Herengracht index, which calculates the price of housing in a fashionable neighborhood of Amsterdam.
* The Lipstick index, which claimed that when the economy got worse, small luxury sales, such as lipstick, would go up.

=== Issues in measuring ===

Measuring inflation in an economy requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on a common set of goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance. For example, if the price of a can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 over the course of a year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general inflation in an overall economy. Overall inflation is measured as the price change of a large &quot;basket&quot; of representative goods and services. This is the purpose of a price index, which is the combined price of a &quot;basket&quot; of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the &quot;basket&quot;. A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is necessary to measure the effect of individual unit price changes on the economy&#x27;s overall inflation. The consumer price index, for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer&#x27;s overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a &quot;base year&quot; price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price. While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the base effect as well.

Inflation measures are often modified over time, either for the relative weight of goods in the basket, or in the way in which goods and services from the present are compared with goods and services from the past. Basket weights are updated regularly, usually every year, to adapt to changes in consumer behavior. Sudden changes in consumer behavior can still introduce a weighting bias in inflation measurement. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has been shown that the basket of goods and services was no longer representative of consumption during the crisis, as numerous goods and services could no longer be consumed due to government containment measures (&quot;lock-downs&quot;).

Over time, adjustments are also made to the type of goods and services selected to reflect changes in the sorts of goods and services purchased by &#x27;typical consumers&#x27;. New products may be introduced, older products disappear, the quality of existing products may change, and consumer preferences can shift. Different segments of the population may naturally consume different &quot;baskets&quot; of goods and services and may even experience different inflation rates. It is argued that companies have put more innovation into bringing down prices for wealthy families than for poor families.

Inflation numbers are often seasonally adjusted to differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts. For example, home heating costs are expected to rise in colder months, and seasonal adjustments are often used when measuring inflation to compensate for cyclical energy or fuel demand spikes. Inflation numbers may be averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques to remove statistical noise and volatility of individual prices.

When looking at inflation, economic institutions may focus only on certain kinds of prices, or &quot;special indices&quot;, such as the core inflation index which is used by central banks to formulate monetary policy.

Most inflation indices are calculated from weighted averages of selected price changes. This necessarily introduces distortion, and can lead to legitimate disputes about what the true inflation rate is. This problem can be overcome by including all available price changes in the calculation, and then choosing the median value. In some other cases, governments may intentionally report false inflation rates; for instance, during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner (2007–2015) the government of Argentina was criticised for manipulating economic data, such as inflation and GDP figures, for political gain and to reduce payments on its inflation-indexed debt.

=== Official vs. true vs. perceived inflation ===
The true inflation is one percentage point lower than the official one, according to research. Therefore, the 2% inflation target is needed to prevent the true inflation being close to zero or even deflation. The reasons are the following:
* Substitution effect: People buy fewer products with the highest price rises and more of those whose prices have risen less. Therefore, the price of their non-fixed shopping basket rises less than that of a fixed shopping basket.
* Unobserved quality improvements: Even though statisticians try to take quality improvements into account, they are not able to do it fully. This is why people rather buy current products at the higher prices than old products at their old prices.
* New goods: The current shopping basket is much better, because it has goods that you previously could not even dream of.

Nevertheless, people overestimate the inflation even vs. the measured inflation. This is because they focus more on commonly-bought items than on durable goods, and more on price increases than on price decreases.

On the other hand, different people have different shopping baskets and hence face different inflation rates.

===Inflation expectations===

Inflation expectations or expected inflation is the rate of inflation that is anticipated for some time in the foreseeable future. There are two major approaches to modeling the formation of inflation expectations. Adaptive expectations models them as a weighted average of what was expected one period earlier and the actual rate of inflation that most recently occurred. Rational expectations models them as unbiased, in the sense that the expected inflation rate is not systematically above or systematically below the inflation rate that actually occurs.

A long-standing survey of inflation expectations is the University of Michigan survey.

Inflation expectations affect the economy in several ways. They are more or less built into nominal interest rates, so that a rise (or fall) in the expected inflation rate will typically result in a rise (or fall) in nominal interest rates, giving a smaller effect if any on real interest rates. In addition, higher expected inflation tends to be built into the rate of wage increases, giving a smaller effect if any on the changes in real wages. Moreover, the response of inflationary expectations to monetary policy can influence the division of the effects of policy between inflation and unemployment (see monetary policy credibility).

== Causes ==
=== Historical approaches ===

Theories of the origin and causes of inflation have existed since at least the 16th century. Two competing theories, the quantity theory of money and the real bills doctrine, appeared in various disguises during century-long debates on recommended central bank behaviour. In the 20th century, Keynesian, monetarist and new classical (also known as rational expectations) views on inflation dominated post-World War II macroeconomics discussions, which were often heated intellectual debates, until some kind of synthesis of the various theories was reached by the end of the century.

==== Before 1936 ====
The price revolution from ca. 1550–1700 caused several thinkers to present what is now considered to be early formulations of the quantity theory of money (QTM). Other contemporary authors attributed rising price levels to the debasement of national coinages. Later research has shown that also growing output of Central European silver mines and an increase in the velocity of money because of innovations in the payment technology, in particular the increased use of bills of exchange, contributed to the price revolution.

An alternative theory, the real bills doctrine (RBD), originated in the 17th and 18th century, receiving its first authoritative exposition in Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. It asserts that banks should issue their money in exchange for short-term real bills of adequate value. As long as banks only issue a dollar in exchange for assets worth at least a dollar, the issuing bank&#x27;s assets will naturally move in step with its issuance of money, and the money will hold its value. Should the bank fail to get or maintain assets of adequate value, then the bank&#x27;s money will lose value, just as any financial security will lose value if its asset backing diminishes. The real bills doctrine (also known as the backing theory) thus asserts that inflation results when money outruns its issuer&#x27;s assets. The quantity theory of money, in contrast, claims that inflation results when money outruns the economy&#x27;s production of goods.

During the 19th century, three different schools debated these questions: The British Currency School upheld a quantity theory view, believing that the Bank of England&#x27;s issues of bank notes should vary one-for-one with the bank&#x27;s gold reserves. In contrast to this, the British Banking School followed the real bills doctrine, recommending that the bank&#x27;s operations should be governed by the needs of trade: Banks should be able to issue currency against bills of trading, i.e. &quot;real bills&quot; that they buy from merchants. A third group, the Free Banking School, held that competitive private banks would not overissue, even though a monopolist central bank could be believed to do it.

The debate between currency, or quantity theory, and banking schools during the 19th century prefigures current questions about the credibility of money in the present. In the 19th century, the banking schools had greater influence in policy in the United States and Great Britain, while the currency schools had more influence &quot;on the continent&quot;, that is in non-British countries, particularly in the Latin Monetary Union and the Scandinavian Monetary Union.

During the Bullionist Controversy during the Napoleonic Wars, David Ricardo argued that the Bank of England had engaged in over-issue of bank notes, leading to commodity price increases. In the late 19th century, supporters of the quantity theory of money led by Irving Fisher debated with supporters of bimetallism. Later, Knut Wicksell sought to explain price movements as the result of real shocks rather than movements in money supply, resounding statements from the real bills doctrine.

In 2019, monetary historians Thomas M. Humphrey and Richard Timberlake published &quot;Gold, the Real Bills Doctrine, and the Fed: Sources of Monetary Disorder 1922–1938&quot;.

==== Keynes and the early Keynesians ====
John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 main work &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; emphasized that wages and prices were sticky in the short run, but gradually responded to aggregate demand shocks. These could arise from many different sources, e.g. autonomous movements in investment or fluctuations in private wealth or interest rates. Economic policy could also affect demand, monetary policy by affecting interest rates and fiscal policy either directly through the level of government final consumption expenditure or indirectly by changing disposable income via tax changes.

The various sources of variations in aggregate demand will cause cycles in both output and price levels. Initially, a demand change will primarily affect output because of the price stickiness, but eventually prices and wages will adjust to reflect the change in demand. Consequently, movements in real output and prices will be positively, but not strongly, correlated.

Keynes&#x27; propositions formed the basis of Keynesian economics which came to dominate macroeconomic research and economic policy in the first decades after World War II. Other Keynesian economists developed and reformed several of Keynes&#x27; ideas. Importantly, Alban William Phillips in 1958 published indirect evidence of a negative relation between inflation and unemployment, confirming the Keynesian emphasis on a positive correlation between increases in real output (normally accompanied by a fall in unemployment) and rising prices, i.e. inflation. Phillips&#x27; findings were confirmed by other empirical analyses and became known as a Phillips curve. It quickly became central to macroeconomic thinking, apparently offering a stable trade-off between price stability and employment. The curve was interpreted to imply that a country could achieve low unemployment if it were willing to tolerate a higher inflation rate or vice versa.

The Phillips curve model described the U.S. experience well in the 1960s, but failed to describe the stagflation experienced in the 1970s.

==== Monetarism ====


During the 1960s the Keynesian view of inflation and macroeconomic policy altogether were challenged by monetarist theories, led by Milton Friedman. Friedman famously stated that &quot;Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&quot; He revived the quantity theory of money by Irving Fisher and others, making it into a central tenet of monetarist thinking, arguing that the most significant factor influencing inflation or deflation is how fast the money supply grows or shrinks.

The quantity theory of money, simply stated, says that any change in the amount of money in a system will change the price level. This theory begins with the equation of exchange:

:formula_3
where
:formula_4 is the nominal quantity of money;
:formula_5 is the velocity of money in final expenditures;
:formula_6 is the general price level;
:formula_7 is an index of the real value of final expenditures.

In this formula, the general price level is related to the level of real economic activity (&quot;Q&quot;), the quantity of money (&quot;M&quot;) and the velocity of money (&quot;V&quot;). The formula itself is simply an uncontroversial accounting identity because the velocity of money (&quot;V&quot;) is defined residually from the equation to be the ratio of final nominal expenditure (formula_8) to the quantity of money (&quot;M&quot;).

Monetarists assumed additionally that the velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy (at least in the long run), that the real value of output is also exogenous in the long run, its long-run value being determined independently by the productive capacity of the economy, and that money supply is exogenous and can be controlled by the monetary authorities. Under these assumptions, the primary driver of the change in the general price level is changes in the quantity of money. Consequently, monetarists contended that monetary policy, not fiscal policy, was the most potent instrument to influence aggregate demand, real output and eventually inflation. This was contrary to Keynesian thinking which in principle recognized a role for monetary policy, but in practice believed that the effect from interest rate changes to the real economy was slight, making monetary policy an ineffective instrument, preferring fiscal policy. Conversely, monetarists considered fiscal policy, or government spending and taxation, as ineffective in controlling inflation.

Friedman also took issue with the traditional Keynesian view concerning the Phillips curve. He, together with Edmund Phelps, contended that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment implied by the Phillips curve was only temporary, but not permanent. If politicians tried to exploit it, it would eventually disappear because higher inflation would over time be built into the economic expectations of households and firms. This line of thinking led to the concept of potential output (sometimes called the &quot;natural gross domestic product&quot;), a level of GDP where the economy is stable in the sense that inflation will neither decrease nor increase. This level may itself change over time when institutional or natural constraints change. It corresponds to the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment, NAIRU, or the &quot;natural&quot; rate of unemployment (sometimes called the &quot;structural&quot; level of unemployment). If GDP exceeds its potential (and unemployment consequently is below the NAIRU), the theory says that inflation will &quot;accelerate&quot; as suppliers increase their prices. If GDP falls below its potential level (and unemployment is above the NAIRU), inflation will &quot;decelerate&quot; as suppliers attempt to fill excess capacity, cutting prices and undermining inflation.

==== Rational expectations theory ====

In the early 1970s, rational expectations theory led by economists like Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent and Robert Barro transformed macroeconomic thinking radically. They held that economic actors look rationally into the future when trying to maximize their well-being, and do not respond solely to immediate opportunity costs and pressures. In this view, future expectations and strategies are important for inflation as well. One implication was that agents would anticipate the likely behaviour of central banks and base their own actions on these expectations. A central bank having a reputation of being &quot;soft&quot; on inflation will generate high inflation expectations, which again will be self-fulfilling when all agents build expectations of future high inflation into their nominal contracts like wage agreements. On the other hand, if the central bank has a reputation of being &quot;tough&quot; on inflation, then such a policy announcement will be believed and inflationary expectations will come down rapidly, thus allowing inflation itself to come down rapidly with minimal economic disruption. The implication is that credibility becomes very important for central banks in fighting inflation.

==== New Keynesians ====

Events during the 1970s proved Milton Friedman and other critics of the traditional Phillips curve right: The relation between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate broke down. Eventually, a consensus was established that the break-down was due to agents changing their inflation expectations, confirming Friedman&#x27;s theory. As a consequence, the notion of a natural rate of unemployment (alternatively called the structural rate of unemployment) was accepted by most economists, meaning that there is a specific level of unemployment that is compatible with stable inflation. Stabilization policy must therefore try to steer economic activity so that the actual unemployment rate converges towards that level. The trade-off between the unemployment rate and inflation implied by Phillips thus holds in the short term, but not in the long term. Also the oil crises of the 1970s causing at the same time rising unemployment and rising inflation (i.e. stagflation) led to a broad recognition by economists that supply shocks could independently affect inflation.

During the 1980s a group of researchers named new Keynesians emerged who accepted many originally non-Keynesian concepts like the importance of monetary policy, the existence of a natural level of unemployment and the incorporation of rational expectations formation as a reasonable benchmark. At the same time they believed, like Keynes did, that various market imperfections in different markets like labour markets and financial markets were also important to study to understand both inflation generation and business cycles. During the 1980s and 1990s, there were often heated intellectual debates between new Keynesians and new classicals, but by the 2000s, a synthesis gradually emerged. The result has been called the &quot;new Keynesian model&quot;, the &quot;new neoclassical synthesis&quot; or simply the &quot;new consensus&quot; model.

=== View post-2000 to present ===
A common view beginning around the year 2000 and holding through to the present time on inflation and its causes can be illustrated by a modern Phillips curve including a role for supply shocks and inflation expectations beside the original role of aggregate demand (determining employment and unemployment fluctuations) in influencing the inflation rate. Consequently, demand shocks, supply shocks and inflation expectations are all potentially important determinants of inflation, confirming the basis of the older triangle model by Robert J. Gordon:

* &quot;Demand shocks&quot; may both decrease and increase inflation. So-called demand-pull inflation may be caused by increases in aggregate demand due to increased private and government spending, etc. Conversely, negative demand shocks may be caused by contractionary economic policy. 
* &quot;Supply shocks&quot; may also lead to both higher or lower inflation, depending on the character of the shock. Cost-push inflation is caused by a drop in aggregate supply (potential output). This may be due to natural disasters, war or increased prices of inputs. For example, a sudden decrease in the supply of oil, leading to increased oil prices, can cause cost-push inflation. Producers for whom oil is a part of their costs could then pass this on to consumers in the form of increased prices. 
* &quot;Inflation expectations&quot; play a major role in forming actual inflation. High inflation can prompt employees to demand rapid wage increases to keep up with consumer prices. In this way, rising wages in turn can help fuel inflation as firms pass these higher labor costs on to their customers as higher prices, leading to a feedback loop. In the case of collective bargaining, wage growth may be set as a function of inflationary expectations, which will be higher when inflation is high. This can cause a wage-price spiral. In a sense, inflation begets further inflationary expectations, which beget further (built-in) inflation.

The important role of rational expectations is recognized by the emphasis on credibility on the part of central banks and other policy-makers. The monetarist assertion that monetary policy alone could successfully control inflation formed part of the new consensus which recognized that both monetary and fiscal policy are important tools for influencing aggregate demand. Indeed, monetary policy is under normal circumstances considered to be the preferable instrument to contain inflation. At the same time, most central banks have abandoned trying to target money growth as originally advocated by the monetarists. Instead, most central banks in developed countries focus on adjusting interest rates to achieve an explicit inflation target. The reason for central bank reluctance in following money growth targets is that the money stock measures that central banks can control tightly, e.g. the monetary base, are not very closely linked to aggregate demand, whereas conversely money supply measures like M2, which are in some cases more closely correlated with aggregate demand, are difficult to control for the central bank. Also, in many countries the relationship between aggregate demand and all money stock measures have broken down in recent decades, weakening further the case for monetary policy rules focusing on the money supply.

However, while more disputed in the 1970s, surveys of members of the American Economic Association (AEA) since the 1990s have shown that most professional American economists generally agree with the statement &quot;Inflation is caused primarily by too much growth in the money supply&quot;, while the same surveys have shown a lack of consensus by AEA members since the 1990s that &quot;In the short run, a reduction in unemployment causes the rate of inflation to increase&quot; has developed despite more agreement with the statement in the 1970s.

Housing shortages and climate change have both been cited as significant drivers of inflation in the 21st century.

==== 2021–2022 inflation spike ====

In 2021–2022, most countries experienced a considerable increase in inflation, peaking in 2022 and declining in 2023. The causes are believed to be a mixture of demand and supply shocks, whereas inflation expectations generally seem to remain anchored (as per May 2023). Possible causes on the demand side include expansionary fiscal and monetary policy in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, whereas supply shocks include supply chain problems also caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by energy price rises following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

The term sellers&#x27; inflation was coined during this period to describe the effect of corporate profits as a possible cause of inflation: Price inelasticity can contribute to inflation when firms consolidate, tending to support monopoly or monopsony conditions anywhere along the supply chain for goods or services. When this occurs, firms can provide greater shareholder value by taking a larger proportion of profits than by investing in providing greater volumes of their outputs. Shortly after initial energy price shocks caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine had subsided, oil companies found that supply chain constrictions, already exacerbated by the ongoing global pandemic, supported price inelasticity, i.e., they began lowering prices to match the price of oil when it fell much more slowly than they had increased their prices when costs rose.

The quantity theory of money has long been popular with libertarian-conservative critics of the Federal Reserve. During the COVID pandemic and its immediate aftermath, the M2 money supply increased at the fastest rate in decades, leading some to link the growth to the 2021-2023 inflation surge. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in December 2021 that the once-strong link between the money supply and inflation &quot;ended about 40 years ago,&quot; due to financial innovations and deregulation. Previous Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, had previously concurred with this position. The broadest measure of money supply, M3, increased about 45% from 2010 through 2015, far faster than GDP growth, yet the inflation rate declined during that period — the opposite of what monetarism would have predicted. A lower velocity of money than was historically the case was also cited for a diminished effect of growth in the money supply on inflation.

===Heterodox views===

Additionally, there are theories about inflation accepted by economists outside of the mainstream. The Austrian School stresses that inflation is not uniform over all assets, goods, and services. Inflation depends on differences in markets and on where newly created money and credit enter the economy. Ludwig von Mises said that inflation should refer to an increase in the quantity of money, that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money, and that price inflation will necessarily follow, always leaving a poorer nation.

== Effects of inflation ==

=== General effect ===
Inflation is the decrease in the purchasing power of a currency. That is, when the general level of prices rise, each monetary unit can buy fewer goods and services in aggregate. The effect of inflation differs on different sectors of the economy, with some sectors being adversely affected while others benefitting. For example, with inflation, those segments in society which own physical assets, such as property, stock etc., benefit from the price/value of their holdings going up, when those who seek to acquire them will need to pay more for them. Their ability to do so will depend on the degree to which their income is fixed. For example, increases in payments to workers and pensioners often lag behind inflation, and for some people income is fixed. Also, individuals or institutions with cash assets will experience a decline in the purchasing power of the cash. Increases in the price level (inflation) erode the real value of money (the functional currency) and other items with an underlying monetary nature.

Debtors who have debts with a fixed nominal rate of interest will see a reduction in the &quot;real&quot; interest rate as the inflation rate rises. The real interest on a loan is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. The formula &quot;R = N-I&quot; approximates the correct answer as long as both the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate are small. The correct equation is &quot;r = n/i&quot; where &quot;r&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are expressed as ratios (e.g. 1.2 for +20%, 0.8 for −20%). As an example, when the inflation rate is 3%, a loan with a nominal interest rate of 5% would have a real interest rate of approximately 2% (in fact, it&#x27;s 1.94%). Any unexpected increase in the inflation rate would decrease the real interest rate. Banks and other lenders adjust for this inflation risk either by including an inflation risk premium to fixed interest rate loans, or lending at an adjustable rate.

=== Negative ===

High or unpredictable inflation rates are regarded as harmful to an overall economy. They add inefficiencies in the market, and make it difficult for companies to budget or plan long-term. Inflation can act as a drag on productivity as companies are forced to shift resources away from products and services to focus on profit and losses from currency inflation. Uncertainty about the future purchasing power of money discourages investment and saving. Inflation hurts asset prices such as stock performance in the short-run, as it erodes non-energy corporates&#x27; profit margins and leads to central banks&#x27; policy tightening measures. Inflation can also impose hidden tax increases. For instance, inflated earnings push taxpayers into higher income tax rates unless the tax brackets are indexed to inflation.

With high inflation, purchasing power is redistributed from those on fixed nominal incomes, such as some pensioners whose pensions are not indexed to the price level, towards those with variable incomes whose earnings may better keep pace with the inflation. This redistribution of purchasing power will also occur between international trading partners. Where fixed exchange rates are imposed, higher inflation in one economy than another will cause the first economy&#x27;s exports to become more expensive and affect the balance of trade. There can also be negative effects to trade from an increased instability in currency exchange prices caused by unpredictable inflation.

;Hoarding: People buy durable and/or non-perishable commodities and other goods as stores of wealth, to avoid the losses expected from the declining purchasing power of money, creating shortages of the hoarded goods.

;Social unrest and revolts: Inflation can lead to massive demonstrations and revolutions. For example, inflation and in particular food inflation is considered one of the main reasons that caused the 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution and the 2011 Egyptian revolution, according to many observers including Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank. Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was ousted, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was also ousted after only 18 days of demonstrations, and protests soon spread in many countries of North Africa and Middle East.

;Hyperinflation: If inflation becomes too high, it can cause people to severely curtail their use of the currency, leading to an acceleration in the inflation rate. High and accelerating inflation grossly interferes with the normal workings of the economy, hurting its ability to supply goods. Hyperinflation can lead people to abandon the use of the country&#x27;s currency in favour of external currencies (dollarization), as has been reported to have occurred in North Korea.

;Corruption: Due to a high rise of inflation, it has been seen to affect unemployment levels around the world. From 2005 to 2019, it was found that the wellbeing costs of unemployment was 5 times higher than inflation. The trust between the central banks and individuals has become more limited. According to the Global Labor Organization (GLO), a global sample of 1.5 million observations during the 1999 and 2012 found a negative relationship of ECB unemployment between countries of Spain, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal a financial crisis. Lack of trust is shown between the government and political institutions which potentially, this can create bias towards both sides as unemployment rate will still increase. If the rate goes on, predictions of the economic activity may decrease, and investments from around the world will soon slowdown creating an &quot;economy crash&quot; that can affect millions of peoples&#x27; living.

;Allocative efficiency: A change in the supply or demand for a good will normally cause its relative price to change, signaling the buyers and sellers that they should re-allocate resources in response to the new market conditions. But when prices are constantly changing due to inflation, price changes due to genuine relative price signals are difficult to distinguish from price changes due to general inflation, so agents are slow to respond to them. The result is a loss of allocative efficiency.

;Shoe leather cost: High inflation increases the opportunity cost of holding cash balances and can induce people to hold a greater portion of their assets in interest paying accounts. However, since cash is still needed to carry out transactions this means that more &quot;trips to the bank&quot; are necessary to make withdrawals, proverbially wearing out the &quot;shoe leather&quot; with each trip.

;Menu cost

: With high inflation, firms must change their prices often to keep up with economy-wide changes. But often changing prices is itself a costly activity whether explicitly, as with the need to print new menus, or implicitly, as with the extra time and effort needed to change prices constantly.

;Tax: Inflation serves as a hidden tax on currency holdings.

=== Positive ===

;Labour-market adjustments: Nominal wages are slow to adjust downward. This can lead to prolonged disequilibrium and high unemployment in the labor market. Since inflation allows real wages to fall even if nominal wages are kept constant, moderate inflation enables labor markets to reach equilibrium faster.

;Room to maneuver: The primary tools for controlling the money supply are the ability to set the discount rate, the rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank, and open market operations, which are the central bank&#x27;s interventions into the bonds market with the aim of affecting the nominal interest rate. If an economy finds itself in a recession with already low, or even zero, nominal interest rates, then the bank cannot cut these rates further (since negative nominal interest rates are impossible) to stimulate the economythis situation is known as a liquidity trap.

;Mundell–Tobin effect: According to the Mundell–Tobin effect, an increase in inflation leads to an increase in capital investment, which leads to an increase in growth. The Nobel laureate Robert Mundell noted that moderate inflation would induce savers to substitute lending for some money holding as a means to finance future spending. That substitution would cause market clearing real interest rates to fall. The lower real rate of interest would induce more borrowing to finance investment. In a similar vein, Nobel laureate James Tobin noted that such inflation would cause businesses to substitute investment in physical capital (plant, equipment, and inventories) for money balances in their asset portfolios. That substitution would mean choosing the making of investments with lower rates of real return. (The rates of return are lower because the investments with higher rates of return were already being made before.) The two related effects are known as the Mundell–Tobin effect. Unless the economy is already overinvesting according to models of economic growth theory, that extra investment resulting from the effect would be seen as positive.

;Instability with deflation: Economist S.C. Tsiang noted that once substantial deflation is expected, two important effects will appear; both a result of money holding substituting for lending as a vehicle for saving. The first was that continually falling prices and the resulting incentive to hoard money will cause instability resulting from the likely increasing fear, while money hoards grow in value, that the value of those hoards are at risk, as people realize that a movement to trade those money hoards for real goods and assets will quickly drive those prices up. Any movement to spend those hoards &quot;once started would become a tremendous avalanche, which could rampage for a long time before it would spend itself.&quot; Thus, a regime of long-term deflation is likely to be interrupted by periodic spikes of rapid inflation and consequent real economic disruptions. The second effect noted by Tsiang is that when savers have substituted money holding for lending on financial markets, the role of those markets in channeling savings into investment is undermined. With nominal interest rates driven to zero, or near zero, from the competition with a high return money asset, there would be no price mechanism in whatever is left of those markets. With financial markets effectively euthanized, the remaining goods and physical asset prices would move in perverse directions. For example, an increased desire to save could not push interest rates further down (and thereby stimulate investment) but would instead cause additional money hoarding, driving consumer prices further down and making investment in consumer goods production thereby less attractive. Moderate inflation, once its expectation is incorporated into nominal interest rates, would give those interest rates room to go both up and down in response to shifting investment opportunities, or savers&#x27; preferences, and thus allow financial markets to function in a more normal fashion.

=== Cost-of-living allowance ===

The real purchasing power of fixed payments is eroded by inflation unless they are inflation-adjusted to keep their real values constant. In many countries, employment contracts, pension benefits, and government entitlements (such as social security) are tied to a cost-of-living index, typically to the consumer price index. A &quot;cost-of-living adjustment&quot; (COLA) adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost-of-living index. It does not control inflation, but rather seeks to mitigate the consequences of inflation for those on fixed incomes. Salaries are typically adjusted annually in low inflation economies. During hyperinflation they are adjusted more often. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves.

Annual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments (&quot;COLAs&quot;) or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes.

== Controlling Inflation ==

Monetary policy is the policy enacted by the monetary authorities (most frequently the central bank of a nation) to accomplish their objectives. Among these, keeping inflation at a low and stable level is often a prominent objective, either directly via inflation targeting or indirectly, e.g. via a fixed exchange rate against a low-inflation currency area.

=== Historical approaches to inflation control ===

Historically, central banks and governments have followed various policies to achieve low inflation, employing various nominal anchors. Before World War I, the gold standard was prevalent, but was eventually found to be detrimental to economic stability and employment, not least during the Great Depression in the 1930s. For the first decades after World War II, the Bretton Woods system initiated a fixed exchange rate system for most developed countries, tying their currencies to the US dollar, which again was directly convertible to gold. The system disintegrated in the 1970s, however, after which the major currencies started floating against each other. During the 1970s many central banks turned to a money supply target recommended by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, aiming for a stable growth rate of money to control inflation. However, it was found to be impractical because of the unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables, and was eventually abandoned by all major economies. In 1990, New Zealand as the first country ever adopted an official inflation target as the basis of its monetary policy, continually adjusting interest rates to steer the country&#x27;s inflation rate towards its official target. The strategy was generally considered to work well, and central banks in most developed countries have over the years adapted a similar strategy. As of 2023, the central banks of all G7 member countries can be said to follow an inflation target, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, who have adopted the main elements of inflation targeting without officially calling themselves inflation targeters. In emerging countries fixed exchange rate regimes are still the most common monetary policy.

=== Inflation targeting ===


From its first inception in New Zealand in 1990, direct inflation targeting as a monetary policy strategy has spread to become prevalent among developed countries. The basic idea is that the central bank perpetually adjusts interest rates to steer the country&#x27;s inflation rate towards its official target. Via the monetary transmission mechanism interest rate changes affect aggregate demand in various ways, causing output and employment to respond. Changes in employment and unemployment rates affect wage setting, leading to larger or smaller wage increases, depending on the direction of the interest rate adjustment. A changed rate of wage increases will transmit into changes in price setting – i.e. a change in the inflation rate. The relation between (un)employment and inflation is known as the Phillips curve.

In most OECD countries, the inflation target is usually about 2% to 3% (in developing countries like Armenia, the inflation target is higher, at around 4%). Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy.

=== Fixed exchange rates ===
Under a fixed exchange rate currency regime, a country&#x27;s currency is tied in value to another single currency or to a basket of other currencies. A fixed exchange rate is usually used to stabilize the value of a currency, vis-a-vis the currency it is pegged to. It can also be used as a means to control inflation if the currency area tied to itself maintains low and stable inflation. However, as the value of the reference currency rises and falls, so does the currency pegged to it. This essentially means that the inflation rate in the fixed exchange rate country is determined by the inflation rate of the country the currency is pegged to. In addition, a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic stability.

As of 2023, Denmark is the only OECD country which maintains a fixed exchange rate (against the euro), but it is frequently used as a monetary policy strategy in developing countries.

=== Gold standard ===


The gold standard is a monetary system in which a region&#x27;s common medium of exchange is paper notes (or other monetary token) that are normally freely convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold. The standard specifies how the gold backing would be implemented, including the amount of specie per currency unit. The currency itself has no &quot;innate value&quot; but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed for the equivalent value of the commodity (specie). A U.S. silver certificate, for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver.

Under a gold standard, the long term rate of inflation (or deflation) would be determined by the growth rate of the supply of gold relative to total output. Critics argue that this will cause arbitrary fluctuations in the inflation rate, and that monetary policy would essentially be determined by an intersection of however much new gold was produced by mining and changing demand for gold for practical uses. The gold standard was historically found to make it more difficult to stabilize employment levels and avoid recessions and was eventually abandoned everywhere.

=== Wage and price controls ===
Another method attempted in the past have been wage and price controls (&quot;incomes policies&quot;). Temporary price controls may be used as a complement to other policies to fight inflation; price controls may make disinflation faster, while reducing the need for unemployment to reduce inflation. If price controls are used during a recession, the kinds of distortions that price controls cause may be lessened. However, economists generally advise against the imposition of price controls.

Wage and price controls, in combination with rationing, have been used successfully in wartime environments. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed. Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon. More successful examples include the Prices and Incomes Accord in Australia and the Wassenaar Agreement in the Netherlands.

In general, wage and price controls are regarded as a temporary and exceptional measures, only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought.

<text>Jacques Vergès (; 5 March 1925 – 15 August 2013) was a Vietnamese French lawyer and anti-colonial activist. Vergès began as a fighter in the French Resistance during World War II, under Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French forces. After becoming a lawyer, he became well known for his defense of FLN militants during the Algerian War of Independence. He was later involved in a number of controversial and high-profile legal cases, with a series of defendants charged with terrorism, serial murder, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This includes Nazi officer Klaus Barbie &quot;the Butcher of Lyon&quot; in 1987, terrorist Carlos the Jackal in 1994, and former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan in 2008. He also defended infamous Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy in 1998 as well as members of the Baader-Meinhof gang. As a result of taking on such clients, he garnered criticism from members of the public, including intellectuals Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut, political-activist Gerry Gable as well as Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.

Vergès attracted widespread public attention in the 1950s for his use of trials as a forum for expressing views against French colonial rule in Algeria, questioning the authority of the prosecution and causing chaos in proceedings – a method he promoted as &quot;rupture defense&quot; in his book &quot;De la stratégie judiciaire&quot;. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1960 and temporarily lost his license to officially practice law. He was a supporter of the Palestinian fedayeen in the 1960s. He would later disappear from 1970 to 1978, without ever explaining his whereabouts during that period. An outspoken anti-imperialist, he continued his vocal political activism in the 2000s, including opposing the War on Terror. The media sensationalized his activities with the sobriquet &quot;the Devil&#x27;s advocate&quot;, and Vergès himself contributed to his &quot;notorious&quot; public persona by such acts as titling his autobiography &quot;The Brilliant Bastard&quot; and giving provocative replies in interviews, such as &quot;I&#x27;d even defend Bush! But only if he agrees to plead guilty.&quot;

==Biography==
Born on 5 March 1925 in Ubon Ratchathani, Siam, and brought up on the island of Réunion with his twin brother Paul Vergès, Jacques Vergès was the son of Raymond Vergès, a French doctor from Réunion, and a Vietnamese teacher named Pham Thi Khang. In 1942, with his father&#x27;s encouragement, he sailed to Liverpool to become part of the Free French Forces under Charles de Gaulle, and to participate in the anti-Nazi resistance. He went on to fight in Italy, France, and Germany.

After the end of World War II he entered the University of Paris, where he enrolled in the &quot;Faculté des lettres&quot; pursuing a degree in history, studying the Hindi and Malagasy languages. In 1945 he joined the Young Communists movement of the French Communist Party, while his father was helping to organize the Reunionese Communist Party. During this time he befriended Erich Honecker, future leader of East Germany, Henri Alleg and Felix Hophouet-Boigny, future President of the Ivory Coast. He would also marry his first wife Karine at this time. His twin brother, Paul, returned to Reunion, later becoming leader of the Communist Party there, and a member of the European Parliament. In 1949 Jacques became president of the AEC (Association for Colonial Students), where he befriended Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan. In 1950, at the request of his Communist mentors, he went to Prague to lead a youth organization for four years. He returned to Paris, where he went on to study law, passing his final exams in 1955. Vergès was then elected &quot;Secrétaire&quot; of the &quot;Conférence du barreau de Paris.&quot;

=== Political activities ===
Arriving in Paris, Jacques Vergès joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1945. On 25 May 1946, Alexis de Villeneuve, who ran for the legislative elections under the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) against his father, Raymond Vergès, was assassinated in front of the cathedral of Saint-Denis in Réunion. The firearm used belonged to Raymond Vergès.

===Algerian independence movement===
After returning to France, Vergès became a lawyer and quickly gained fame for his willingness to take controversial cases. During the struggle in Algiers he defended many accused of terrorism by the French government. He was a supporter of the Algerian armed independence struggle against France, comparing it to French armed resistance to the Nazi German occupation in the 1940s.
Vergès became a nationally known figure following his defence of the anti-French Algerian guerrilla Djamila Bouhired on terrorism charges: she was convicted of blowing up a café and killing eleven people inside it. This is where he pioneered the rupture strategy, in which he accused the prosecution of the same offenses as the defendants. She was sentenced to death but pardoned and freed following public pressure brought on by Vergès&#x27; efforts. After some years she married Vergès, who had by then converted to Islam. In an effort to limit Vergès&#x27; success at defending Algerian clients, he was sentenced to two months in jail in 1960 and temporarily lost his licence to officially practice law for anti-state activities. After Algeria gained its independence in 1962, Vergès obtained Algerian citizenship, going by the name of Mansour. During the Algerian War he had become acquainted with Ahmed Ben Bella of the FLN and the first President of Algeria, Swiss Nazi and financier for the FLN, François Genoud, as well as Ahmed Huber, a Swiss Muslim-convert and Nazi who covered the war as a journalist.

===Israel and the Palestinians===
In 1965, Vergès arrived in Israel, seeking to represent Mahmud Hijazi (מחמוד חיג&#x27;אזי), a Palestinian member of the Fatah movement who had at the time been sentenced to death by an Israeli military court on charges of terrorism, for crossing into Israel and setting a small demolition charge near the National Water Conduit in the Galilee. Israel&#x27;s Justice Minister Dov Yosef forbade Hijazi&#x27;s being represented by a foreign lawyer. Vergès was detained at the airport and deported. Nevertheless, though Vergès did not succeed in getting to represent Hijazi in court, his initiative generated considerable publicity and controversy which were influential in Hijazi&#x27;s death sentence being eventually commuted by an appeals court. (Hijazi was later released in a 1971 prisoner exchange.)

===Missing years===

From 24 February 1970 to 1978, Vergès disappeared from public view without explanation. He refused to comment about those years, remarking in an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s highly amusing that no one, in our modern police state, can figure out where I was for almost ten years.&quot; Vergès was last seen at an anti-colonial rally in Paris. He left his wife, Djamila, and cut off all his ties with his friends and family. Many people wondered if he had been killed, kidnapped, become a spy, or had gone into hiding. His whereabouts during these years have remained a mystery. Many of his close associates of the time assume that he was in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, a rumour Pol Pot (Brother #1), Nuon Chea (Brother #2) and Ieng Sary (Brother #3) have denied. There are claims that Vergès was spotted in Paris by Mohamed Boudia, a contact from Algerian War and an old Communist associate, Jiří Pelikán. He is also alleged to have been in Switzerland at the house of François Genoud according to Ahmed Huber. He was also thought to be in several Arab countries in the company of Ali Hassan Salameh and Palestinian militant groups according to the Lebanese attorney Karim Pakradouni, and exiled Algerian politician Bachir Boumaza.

== High-profile defendants ==
After Vergès&#x27;s return to public life he resumed his legal practice, taking on a variety of legal cases ranging from; Muslim children who wanted to wear headscarves in school, transfusion-transmitted HIV/AIDS patients contaminated by unscreened blood, prostitutes suing their pimps for back pay to defending high profile war criminals and dictators.

The first file that Jacques Vergès handled as a lawyer concerns Sonacotra. He engages in a &quot;defence of rupture&quot; (also called &quot;strategy of rupture&quot;), rather than what he calls the &quot;defense of connivance&quot;, which was classically pleaded: the accused becomes the accuser, considers that the judge does not have jurisdiction or that the court does not have the legitimacy, and takes the opinion to witness.

==== Klaus Barbie ====
The thrust of Vergès&#x27;s defence in the case was that Barbie was being singled out for prosecution while the French state conveniently ignored other cases that qualified as crimes against humanity. Vergès adopted a &quot;tu quoque&quot; defense, asking the judges &quot;is a crime against humanity to be defined as only one of Nazis against the Jews or if it applies to more serious crimes...the crimes of imperialists against people struggling for their independence?&quot;, going on to say there was nothing his client did against the Resistance that was not done by &quot;certain French officers in Algeria&quot; whom Vergès noted could not be prosecuted because of de Gaulle&#x27;s amnesty of 1962. As such, Vergès argued that the republic had no right to convict Barbie of anything given that French officers like the war hero General Jacques Massu had also engaged in torture and extrajudicial executions during the fight against the FLN. Vergès argued in impassioned speeches before the court that the main conflict motivating history was the struggle between the &quot;Global North&quot; vs. the &quot;Global South&quot;, and that American policy in the Vietnam war and French policy during the Algerian war were the &quot;true face&quot; of the West. Vergès maintained to convict Barbie was a base act of hypocrisy for a French court as his actions were those of a typical Westerner, and therefore he could not be punished for doing merely other Westerners had done.

Besides his &quot;tu quoque&quot; defense of arguing that French actions in the Algerian War were no different from Barbie&#x27;s, Vergès spent much time attempting to prove the Resistance hero Jean Moulin had been betrayed by either the Communists, the Gaullists, or both, which led him to argue Barbie was less culpable than those who had betrayed Moulin. Vergès claimed Moulin&#x27;s colleagues were &quot;playing a double game&quot; and all those in the Resistance &quot;whether they were anti-Gaullists or anti-Communists forgot their duty to the Resistance because of partisan political passions&quot;. At one point, Vergès claimed that Moulin had actually wanted to be tortured to death and tipped off Barbie himself. Under French law, defense lawyers are entitled to use competing theories in defense of their clients, unlike the prosecution who must stick to only one line of argument. Barbie was not on trial for the torture and murder of Moulin as the statute of limitations in the Moulin case had expired, but instead on trial for crimes against humanity for his role in deporting Jews from Lyons in 1942-44, for which there was no statute of limitations. Barbie was on trial for his role in the arrest and deportation of 44 Jewish children from the Izieu orphanage on 6 April 1944. Of the 44 children, 42 were killed at Auschwitz.

Vergès seems to have brought in the Moulin case as part of his defense of Barbie as a strategy of historical obfuscation and confusion, as he argued that the truth about who betrayed Moulin to Barbie can never truly be answered. The implication of Vergès&#x27;s argument was that other aspects of Barbie&#x27;s life were likewise uncertain and unknowable, making the question of whatever Barbie committed crimes against humanity impossible to answer. Despite Vergès&#x27;s best efforts at obfuscation and a &quot;tu quoque&quot; defense of comparing Barbie&#x27;s actions to French actions in Algeria and American actions in Vietnam, the court found Barbie guilty of crimes against humanity, sentencing him to life imprisonment. Reviewing the film &quot;Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie&quot;, the film critic David Denby wrote the climax of the film was when the French filmmaker Marcel Ophüls pressed the &quot;despicable&quot; Vergès during an interview about his defense of Barbie, whom Denby wrote &quot;...persists in pretending that Barbie is a victim of some sort&quot;. Vergès was paid to defend Barbie by Swiss Nazi financier François Genoud, whom Vergès had met during the Algerian War due to their mutual support for the FLN.

In 1999 Vergès sued Amnesty International on behalf of the government of Togo. In 2001, on behalf of Idriss Déby, president of Chad, Omar Bongo, president of Gabon, and Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, he sued François-Xavier Verschave for his book &quot;Noir silence&quot; denouncing the crimes of the &quot;Françafrique&quot; on the charges of &quot;offense toward a foreign state leader&quot;, using an arcane 1881 law. The attorney general observed how this crime recalled the lese majesty crime; the court thus deemed it contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, thus leading to Verschave&#x27;s acquittal.

==== Khieu Samphan ====

In April 2008, former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, and old associate of Vergès, made his first appearance at Cambodia&#x27;s genocide tribunal. Vergès represented Samphan, using the defence that, while Samphan has never denied that many people in Cambodia were killed, as head of state he was not directly responsible.

==== Saddam Hussein ====
After the US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 and deposed Saddam Hussein, many former leaders in the Baathist regime were arrested. In late 2003, Vergès offered to defend Hussein after he was approached by Sadam&#x27;s nephew who was putting a legal team together. However, the Hussein family opted not to use Vergès.

In May 2008, Tariq Aziz assembled a team that included Vergès as well as a French-Lebanese and four Italian lawyers.

== Personal life ==
Jacques Vergès was married twice. He had a son with his first wife with Karine. He would go on to marry his client Djamila Bouhired, having two children with her.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;history was his first love, and he still sometimes dreamed of deciphering Etruscan or Linear A, unfolding the secrets of mysterious civilizations.&quot;

In 2002, he called former Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević &quot;extremely likeable&quot;. In January 2008, he personally supported Tomislav Nikolić, nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party.

== Death ==

Jacques Vergès died on 15 August 2013 of a heart attack in Paris at the age of 88. His funeral was attended by Roland Dumas and Dieudonné M&#x27;bala M&#x27;bala. Vergès is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

<doc id="38289" wikidata="Q1814941" url="?curid=38289" title="Economic depression">
<text>An economic depression is a period of carried long-term economic downturn that is the result of lowered economic activity in one or more major national economies. It is often understood in economics that economic crisis and the following recession that may be named economic depression are part of economic cycles where the slowdown of the economy follows the economic growth and vice versa. It is a result of more severe economic problems or a &quot;downturn&quot; than the recession itself, which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of the normal business cycle of growing economy.

Economic depressions may also be characterized by their length or duration, showing increases in unemployment, larger increases in unemployment or even abnormally large levels of unemployment (as with for example some problems in Japan in incorporating digital economy, that such technological difficulty resulting in very large unemployment rates or lack of good social balance in employment among population, lesser revenues for businesses, or other economic difficulties, with having signs of financial crisis, that may also reflect on the work of banks, or may result in banking crisis (in various ways that may be for example unauthorized transformations of banks), and further the crisis in investment and credit; that further could reflect on innovation and new businesses investments lessening or even shrinking, or buyers dry up in recession and suppliers cut back on production and investment in technology, in financial crisis that may be more country defaults or debt problems, and further in feared businesses bankruptcies, and overall business slowdown. Other bad signs of economic depression could be significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce (especially international trade), as well as in currency markets that maybe fluctuations or unexpected exchange rates with observed highly volatile currency value fluctuations (often due to relative currency devaluations). Other signs of depression are prices deflation, financial crises, stock market crash or even bank failures, or even specific behaviour of economic agents or population, that are also common or also non common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession.

==Definitions==
In the United States the National Bureau of Economic Research determines contractions and expansions in the business cycle, but does not declare depressions. Generally, periods labeled depressions are marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced using current resources and technology (potential output). Another proposed definition of &quot;depression&quot; includes two general rules:
# a decline in real GDP exceeding 10%, or
# a recession lasting 2 or more years.

There are also differences in the duration of depression across definitions. Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until the economic activity has returned close to normal levels.

A recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity. In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration.

Under the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date.

A useful example is a difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938.

==Terminology==
Today the term &quot;depression&quot; is most often associated with the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then. Indeed, an early major American economic crisis, the Panic of 1819, was described by then-president James Monroe as &quot;a depression&quot;, and the economic crisis immediately preceding the 1930s depression, the Depression of 1920–21, was referred to as a &quot;depression&quot; by president Calvin Coolidge.

However, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, &quot;financial&quot; crises were traditionally referred to as &quot;panics&quot;, e.g., the &#x27;major&#x27; Panic of 1907, and the &#x27;minor&#x27; Panic of 1910–1911, though the 1929 crisis was more commonly called &quot;The Crash&quot;, and the term &quot;panic&quot; has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase &quot;The Great Depression&quot; had already been used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the Long Depression.

Common use of the phrase &quot;The Great Depression&quot; for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book &quot;The Great Depression&quot; is credited with &#x27;formalizing&#x27; the phrase, though US president Herbert Hoover is widely credited with having &#x27;popularized&#x27; the term/phrase, informally referring to the downturn as a &quot;depression&quot;, with such uses as &quot;Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement&quot;, (December 1930, Message to Congress) and &quot;I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression&quot; (1931).

==Occurrence== 
Due to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a &quot;depression&quot; is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as &quot;recessions&quot;, with the 1970s global crisis referred to as &quot;stagflation&quot;, but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as &quot;depressions&quot; are the 1870s and 1930s.

To some degree, this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of &quot;panic&quot; to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the economic cycle – both in the United States and in most OECD countries – though not in all – has been more moderate since 1945.

There &quot;have&quot; been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as &quot;depressions&quot; is controversial. The 2008–2009 economic cycle, which has comprised the most significant global crisis since the Great Depression, has at times been termed a depression, but this terminology is not widely used, with the episode instead being referred to by other terms, such as the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.

== Notable depressions ==

===The General Crisis of 1640===

The largest depression of all time occurred during the General Crisis. The Ming Empire of China went bankrupt and the Stuart Monarchy fought a civil war on three fronts in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Thomas Hobbes, an English philosopher, created the first recorded explanation of the need for a universal Social Contract in his 1651 book &quot;Leviathan&quot; based on the general misery within society during this period.

===Great depression of 1837===
This depression is acknowledged to be a worse depression in the United States than the later Great Depression of the 1930s. This depression ended in the United States due to the California Gold Rush and its tenfold addition to the United States&#x27; gold reserves. As with most depressions, it was followed by a thirty-year period of a booming economy in the United States, which is now called the Second Industrial Revolution (of the 1850s).

====Panic of 1837====
The Panic of 1837 was an American financial crisis, built on a speculative real estate market. The bubble burst on 10 May 1837 in New York City, when every bank stopped payment in gold and silver coinage. The Panic was followed by a five-year depression, with the failure of banks and record high unemployment levels.

=== Long Depression ===

Starting with the adoption of the gold standard in Britain and the United States, the Long Depression (1873–1896) was indeed longer than what is now referred to as the Great Depression, but shallower in some sectors. Many who lived through it regarded it to have been worse than the 1930s depression at times. It was known as &quot;the Great Depression&quot; until the 1930s.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression of the 1930s affected most national economies in the world. This depression is generally considered to have begun with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and the crisis quickly spread to other national economies. Between 1929 and 1933, the gross national product of the United States decreased by 33% while the rate of unemployment increased to 25% (with industrial unemployment alone rising to approximately 35% – U.S. employment was still over 25% agricultural).

A long-term effect of the Great Depression was the departure of every major currency from the gold standard, although the initial impetus for this was World War II (see Bretton Woods Accord).

===Greek depression===
Beginning in 2009, Greece sank into a recession that, after two years, became a depression. The country saw an almost 20% drop in economic output, and unemployment soared to near 25%. Greece&#x27;s high amounts of sovereign debt precipitated the crisis, and the poor performance of its economy after the introduction of severe austerity measures slowed the entire eurozone&#x27;s recovery. Greece&#x27;s troubles led to discussions about its departure from the eurozone.

===Post-communism depression===
The economic crisis in the 1990s that struck former members of the Soviet Union was almost twice as intense as the Great Depression in the countries of Western Europe and the United States in the 1930s. Average standards of living registered a catastrophic fall in the early 1990s in many parts of the former Eastern Bloc, most notably in post-Soviet states. Even before Russia&#x27;s financial crisis of 1998, Russia&#x27;s GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s. Some populations are still poorer today than they were in 1989 (e.g. Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, Central Asia, Caucasus). The collapse of the Soviet planned economy and the transition to a market economy resulted in catastrophic declines in GDP of about 45% from 1990 to 1996 and poverty in the region had increased more than tenfold.

Finnish economists refer to the Finnish economic decline during and after the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989–1994) as a great depression (&quot;suuri lama&quot;). However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the savings and loan crisis and early 1990s recession in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called &quot;casino economy&quot;. Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to the pre-crisis level.

==Other depressions==
===Global===
The late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: World War I and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918–20 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921–22, however Germany saw its economy crippled until 1923–24 because of the hyperinflation crisis.

The 1973 oil crisis, coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of welfare state in most countries led to a recession between 1973 and 1975, followed by a period of almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment. The 1980–82 recession marked the end of the period.

The savings &amp; loans and the leveraged buyout crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a recession in 1990–91 (also fueled by the oil price crisis), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had to resign in November 1990; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, U.S. President George H. W. Bush lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay.

In 2005, the persistent oil price rises and economic overheating caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed: The housing bubble in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a recession. This, in turn, provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably Lehman Brothers, leading to the loss of millions of jobs.

===Regional===
Several Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced another between 1998 and 2002. South American countries fell once again into this in the early-to-mid 2010s.

This definition also includes the economic performance of New Zealand from 1974 to 1992 and Switzerland from 1973 to the present, although this designation for Switzerland has been controversial.

From 1980 to 2000, Sub-Saharan Africa broadly suffered a fall in absolute income levels.
