<text>Wiesbaden (; ) is the capital of the German state of Hesse, and the second-largest Hessian city after Frankfurt am Main. With around 283,000 inhabitants, it is Germany&#x27;s 24th-largest city. Wiesbaden forms a conurbation with a population of around 500,000 with the neighbouring city of Mainz. This conurbation is in turn embedded in the Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region—Germany&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr—which also includes the nearby cities of Frankfurt am Main, Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, and Hanau, and has a combined population exceeding 5.8 million.

The city is located on the Rhine (Upper Rhine), at the foothills of the Taunus, opposite the Rhineland-Palatine capital of Mainz, and the city centre is located in the wide valley of the small Salzbach stream. Wiesbaden lies in the Rheingau wine-growing region, one of Germany&#x27;s 13 wine regions. Three of Wiesbaden&#x27;s boroughs were part of the city of Mainz until 1945, and still bear the designation &quot;Mainz&quot; in their names—the so-called AKK-boroughs of Mainz-Amöneburg, Mainz-Kastel, and Mainz-Kostheim. This so-called AKK-Konflikt (:de:AKK-Konflikt) is the main cause for the rivalry between Mainz and Wiesbaden. Wiesbaden Main Station is connected to Frankfurt am Main by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn rapid transit system.

Historically, Wiesbaden was a Nassauian city. From 1170 to 1629, it lay in the County of Nassau, and from 1629 to 1721, it was in the county and later principality of Nassau-Idstein, all of which were territories within the Holy Roman Empire ruled by branches of the House of Nassau. In 1728, the city found itself in the principality of Nassau-Usingen, and in 1744, Biebrich Palace became the main residence of the House of Nassau-Usingen. In 1806, the city became the capital of the Duchy of Nassau. Since 1841, the newly built Wiesbaden City Palace was the principal Nassauian residence. From 1868 to 1944, the city lay in the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, and from 1944 to 1945, it was the capital of the Province of Nassau. In 1945, it became the capital of Greater Hesse and subsequently, in 1946, of Hesse.

Wiesbaden is one of the oldest spa towns in Europe. Its name translates to &quot;meadow baths&quot;, and there are 15 mineral springs—14 of which are hot springs—in the city centre. With a yield of around 2 million liters daily, Wiesbaden is the second-most productive German spa after Aachen. Its location in a mountain basin at the southern foot of the Taunus, protected by the mountains in the north and west, gives Wiesbaden a mild climate. It has been called the &quot;Nice of the North&quot; because of its climate and architecture. The city of Wiesbaden is one of the wealthiest cities in Germany and one of those with above-average purchasing power. The United States Army Europe and Africa headquarters are located in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim.

==Geography==

Wiesbaden is situated on the right (northern) bank of the Rhine, above the confluence of the Main, where the Rhine&#x27;s main direction changes from north to west. The city is across the Rhine from Mainz, the capital of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Frankfurt am Main is located about east. To the north of the city are the Taunus Mountains, which trend in a northeasterly direction.

The city center, the &quot;Stadtmitte&quot;, is located in the north-easternmost part of the Upper Rhine Valley at the spurs of the Taunus mountains, about from the Rhine. The landscape is formed by a wide lowland between the Taunus heights in the north, the Bierstadter Höhe and the Hainerberg in the east, the Mosbacher Mountain in the south, and the Schiersteiner Mountain in the west, an offshoot of the Taunus range.

The downtown is drained only by the narrow valley of the Salzbach, a tributary of the Rhine, on the eastern flanks of the Mosbacher Mountain. The city&#x27;s main railway line and the Mainz road (&quot;Mainzer Straße&quot;) follow this valley. Several other streams drain into the Salzbach within the city center: the Wellritzbach, the Kesselbach, the Schwarzbach, the Dambach, and the Tennelbach, as well as the outflow of many thermal and mineral springs in the &quot;Kurhaus&quot; (spa) district. Above the city center, the Salzbach is better known as the Rambach.

The highest point of the Wiesbaden municipality is located northwest of the city center near the summit of the Hohe Wurzel, with an elevation of above sea level. The lowest point is the harbour entrance of Schierstein at above sea level. The central square (the &quot;Schlossplatz&quot;, or palace square) is at an elevation of .

Wiesbaden covers an area of . It is from north to south and from west to east. In the north are vast forest areas, which cover 27.4% of the urban area. In the west and east are vineyards and agricultural land, which cover 31.1% of the area. Of the municipality&#x27;s -long border, the Rhine makes up .

===Climate===
Wiesbaden has a temperate-oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;) with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Its average annual temperature is , with monthly mean temperatures ranging from in January to in July.

The Wiesbaden weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Highest Temperature on 25 July 2019.
* Lowest Temperature on 19 December 2009.
* Wettest Year in 1965.
* Driest Year in 1976.
* Highest Daily Precipitation: on 7 October 1982.
* Earliest Snowfall: 5 November 1966.
* Latest Snowfall: 15 April 2001.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
While evidence of settlement at present-day Wiesbaden dates back to the Neolithic era, historical records document continuous occupancy after the erection of a Roman fort in 6 AD which housed an auxiliary cavalry unit. The thermal springs of Wiesbaden are first mentioned in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;. They were famous for their recreation pools for Roman army horses and possibly as the source of a mineral used for red hair dye (which was very fashionable around the turn of BC/AD among women in Rome).

The Roman settlement is first mentioned using the name &quot;Aquae Mattiacorum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Waters of the Mattiaci&quot;) in 121. The Mattiaci were a Germanic tribe, possibly a branch of the neighboring Chatti, who lived in the vicinity at that time. The town also appears as Mattiacum in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia (2.10). The Roman Empire built the Limes Germanicus, which was a line of Roman frontier fortifications in the Taunus. Wiesbaden is just south of the Taunus.

The capital of the province of Germania Superior, Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz), base of 2 (at times 3) Roman legions, was just over the Rhine and connected by a bridge at the present-day borough of Mainz-Kastel (Roman &quot;castellum&quot;), a strongly fortified bridgehead.

The Alamanni, a coalition of Germanic tribes from beyond the &quot;Limes&quot;, captured the fort around 260. Later, in the 370s, when the Romans and Alamanni were allied, the Alemanni gained control of the Wiesbaden area and were in charge of its defense against other Germanic tribes.

===Middle Ages===
After the Franks under Clovis I defeated the Alamanni in the Battle of Tolbiac in 496, the Franks eventually displaced the Alamanni in the Wiesbaden area over the course of the 6th century. In the 8th century, Wiesbaden became the site of a royal palace of the Frankish kingdom. The first documented use of the name Wiesbaden is by Einhard, the biographer of Charlemagne, whose writings mention &quot;Wisabada&quot; sometime between 828 and 830.

When the Frankish Carolingian Empire broke up in 888, Wiesbaden was in the eastern half, called East Francia (which would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire). The town was part of Franconia, the heartland of East Francia. In the 1170s, the Count of Nassau, Walram I, received the area around Wiesbaden as a fiefdom. When Franconia fragmented in the early 13th century, Nassau emerged as an independent state as part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1232 Wiesbaden became a Reichsstadt, an imperial city, of the Holy Roman Empire. However, in 1242, during the war of Emperor Frederick II against the Pope, the Archbishop of Mainz, Siegfried III, ordered the city&#x27;s destruction.

Wiesbaden returned to the control of the House of Nassau in 1270 under Count Walram II, Count of Nassau. However, Wiesbaden and the castle at Sonnenberg were again destroyed in 1283 in conflict with Eppstein.

Walram&#x27;s son and successor Adolf would later become king of Germany from 1292 until 1298. In 1329, under Adolf&#x27;s son Gerlach I of Nassau-Weilburg the House of Nassau and thereby, Wiesbaden, received the right of coinage from Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian.

In 1355, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided among the sons of Gerlach. The County of Nassau&#x27;s holdings would be subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. Wiesbaden became the seat of the County of Nassau-Wiesbaden under Count Adolf I (1307–1370), eldest son of Gerlach. It would eventually fall back to Nassau-Weilburg in 1605.

===Modern era===

Due to its participation in the uprisings of the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1525, Wiesbaden lost all its privileges for over 40 years. During this time, Wiesbaden became Protestant with the nomination of Wolf Denthener as first Lutheran pastor on 1 January 1543. The same day, the first Latin school was opened, preparing pupils for the gymnasium in Idstein. In 1566, the privileges of the city were restored.

The oldest remaining building of Wiesbaden, the old city hall, was built in 1609 and 1610. No older buildings are preserved due to two fires in 1547 and 1561. In 1648, at the end of the devastating Thirty Years&#x27; War, chronicles tell that Wiesbaden had barely 40 residents left. In 1659, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided again. Wiesbaden became part of the County of Nassau-Usingen. In 1744, the seat of Nassau-Usingen was moved to Biebrich. In 1771, the Count of Nassau-Usingen granted a concession for gambling in Wiesbaden. In 1810, the Wiesbaden Casino (German: &quot;Spielbank&quot;) was opened in the old Kurhaus. Gambling was later outlawed by Prussian authorities in 1872.

As a result of Napoleon&#x27;s victory over Austria in the Battle of Austerlitz, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1805. On 12 July 1806, 16 states in present-day Germany, including the remaining counties of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg, formally left the Holy Roman Empire and joined in the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon was its &quot;protector&quot;. Under pressure from Napoleon, both counties merged to form the Duchy of Nassau on 30 August 1806.

At the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Duchy of Nassau joined the German Confederation. The capital of Nassau was moved from Weilburg to Wiesbaden, and the city became the ducal residence. Building activity started to give the city a magnificent appearance. Most of the historical center of Wiesbaden dates back to this time.
In the Revolutions of 1848, 30,000 citizens of Nassau assembled in Wiesbaden on 4 March. They demanded a constitution from the Duke, which they received.

In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Nassau took Austria&#x27;s side. This decision led to the end of the duchy. After the Austrian defeat, Nassau was annexed by Prussia and became part of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The deposed duke Adolph of Nassau in 1890 became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg (see House of Nassau). This turned out to be a fortunate change for the city, as it then became an international spa town. A rise in construction commenced after the aristocracy followed the lead of the Hohenzollern emperors, who began annual trips to Wiesbaden.

The period around the turn of the 20th century is regarded as the heyday of the city. Kaiser Wilhelm II visited the city regularly in summer, such that it became an unofficial &quot;summer residence&quot;. The city was also popular among the Russian nobility. In the wake of the imperial court, numerous nobles, artists, and wealthy businessmen increasingly settled in the city. Many wealthy persons chose Wiesbaden as their retirement seat, as it offered leisure and medical treatment alike. In the latter part of the 19th century, Wiesbaden became the German city with the most millionaires.

In 1894, the present Hessian State Theater, designed by the Vienna architects Fellner and Helmer, was built on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II.

===Weimar Republic and Third Reich (1919 to 1945)===
After World War I, Wiesbaden fell under the Allied occupation of the Rhineland and was occupied by the French army in 1918. In 1921, the Wiesbaden Agreement on German reparations to France was signed in the city. In 1925, Wiesbaden became the headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine until the withdrawal of occupying forces from the Rhineland in 1930.

In 1929, an airport was constructed in Erbenheim on the site of a horse-racing track. In 1936, Fighter Squadron 53 of the Luftwaffe was stationed here.

In the Kristallnacht pogrom on 10 November 1938, Wiesbaden&#x27;s large synagogue on Michelsberg was destroyed. The synagogue had been designed by Phillip Hoffmann and built in 1869. Another synagogue in Wiesbaden-Bierstadt was also destroyed. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, there were 2,700 Jews living in Wiesbaden. By June 1942 nearly all of them had been deported to the extermination camps in German-occupied Poland.

General Ludwig Beck from Wiesbaden was one of the planners of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler. Beck was designated by his fellow conspirators to be future Head of State (Regent) after elimination of Hitler. The plot failed, however, and Beck was forced to commit suicide. Today, the city annually awards the Ludwig Beck prize for civil courage in his honor.

Lutheran pastor and theologian Martin Niemöller, founder of the Confessing Church resistance movement against the Nazis, is an Honorary Citizen of Wiesbaden. He presented his last sermon before his arrest in Wiesbaden&#x27;s Market Church.

===World War II===
In World War II, Wiesbaden was the headquarters for Germany&#x27;s Wehrkreis XII. This military district included the Eifel, part of Hesse, the Palatinate, and the Saarland. After the Battle of France, this &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; was extended to include Lorraine, including Nancy, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The commander was &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Walther Schroth.

&quot;Wehrkreis&quot; XII was made up of three subordinate regions: &quot;Bereich Hauptsitze&quot; Koblenz, Mannheim and Metz.

*&quot;Bereich Hauptsitz&quot; Koblenz was the headquarters for 12 &quot;Unterregion-Hauptsitze&quot;, namely Trier I, Trier II, Koblenz, Neuwied, Kreuznach, Wiesbaden, Limburg an der Lahn, Lahn, Mainz, Worms, Darmstadt, and Luxembourg.
*&quot;Bereich Hauptsitz&quot; Mannheim was the headquarters for 10 &quot;Unterregion-Hauptsitze&quot;, namely Saarlautern, Saarbrücken, St. Wendel, Zweibrücken, Kaiserslautern, Neustadt an der Weinstraße, Ludwigshafen (Rhein), Mannheim I, Mannheim II, and Heidelberg.
*&quot;Bereich Hauptsitz&quot; Metz was the headquarters for &quot;Unterregion-Hauptsitze&quot; Metz, Diedenhofen (Thionville), and Saint-Avold.

During the war, Wiesbaden was, between August 1940 and the end of 1942, bombed by the Royal Air Force and from 1943 through to March 1945, was attacked by both RAF and United States Air Force bombers on 66 days. In the attacks, about 18% of the city&#x27;s homes were destroyed. During the war, more than 25% of the city&#x27;s buildings were damaged or worse and 1,700 people were killed.

Wiesbaden was the location of a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;), and two subcamps of the Hinzert concentration camp, mostly for Luxembourgish prisoners.

Wiesbaden was captured by U.S. Army forces on 28 March 1945. The U.S. 317th Infantry Regiment attacked in assault boats across the Rhine from Mainz while the 319th Infantry attacked across the river Main near Hochheim am Main. The attack started at 01:00 and by early afternoon the two forces of the 80th U.S. Infantry Division had linked up with the loss of only three dead and three missing. The Americans captured 900 German soldiers and a warehouse full of 4,000 cases of champagne.

After the war&#x27;s end, American rock artist Elvis Presley was stationed in Friedberg and often visited Wiesbaden.

===Cold War and contemporary history===
After World War II, the state of Hesse was established (see Greater Hesse), and Wiesbaden became its capital, though nearby Frankfurt am Main is much larger and works as Hesse&#x27;s economic and financial centre. Wiesbaden however suffered much less than Frankfurt from air bombing. There is a persistent rumour that the U.S. Army Air Force spared the town with the intention of turning it into a postwar HQ, but USAAF sources claim this to be a myth, arguing that Wiesbaden&#x27;s economic and strategic importance simply did not justify more bombing. Wiesbaden was host to the Headquarters, U.S. Air Forces, Europe based at the former Lindsey Air Station from 1953 to 1973.

American armed forces have been present in Wiesbaden since World War II. The U.S. 1st Armored Division was headquartered at the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, just off the autobahn toward Frankfurt, until the Division completed relocation to Fort Bliss, Texas, in 2011. Wiesbaden is now home to the U.S. Army Europe Headquarters and the General John Shalikashvili Mission Command Center.

In 1962, the American artists George Maciunas, Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles traveled to Europe to promote a planned &quot;Fluxus&quot; publication with concerts of antique musical instruments, the “Fluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Music” (Fluxus International Festival of Newest Music) at the Museum Wiesbaden. Fourteen concerts were performed on four weekends between 1 and 23 September which marked the beginning of the Fluxus movement. Work by musicians such as John Cage, György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Terry Riley, Brion Gysin and others were performed alongside new performance pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, George Brecht, Nam June Paik, Ben Patterson, Robert Filliou, Emmett Williams, and others. One performance in particular, &quot;Piano Activities&quot; by Philip Corner, became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.

==Bathing and gambling==
Wiesbaden has long been famous for its thermal springs and spa. Use of the thermal springs was first documented by the Romans. The business of spring bathing became important for Wiesbaden near the end of the Middle Ages. By 1370, 16 bath houses were in operation. By 1800, the city had 2,239 inhabitants and 23 bath houses.

By 1900, Wiesbaden, with a population of 86,100, hosted 126,000 visitors annually. Famous visitors to the springs included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Richard Wagner, Johannes Brahms, and Henrik Pontoppidan. In those years, more millionaires were living in Wiesbaden than in any other city in Germany.

Gambling followed bathing &quot;en suite&quot;, and in the 19th century, Wiesbaden was famous for both. Its casino (&quot;Spielbank&quot;) rivalled those of Bad Homburg, Baden-Baden, and Monaco. In 1872, the Prussian-dominated imperial government closed down all German gambling houses. The Wiesbaden casino was reopened in 1949.

==Main sights==
===The Palace Square===
The &quot;Schloßplatz&quot; (&quot;palace square&quot;) is situated in the center of the city, surrounded by several outstanding buildings. The ducal palace was begun under William, Duke of Nassau. Its foundations were laid in 1837 and it was completed in November 1841 (two years after William&#x27;s death). For the twenty-six remaining years of ducal authority it was the residence of the ruling family. It later served as a secondary residence for the King of Prussia 1866 to 1918. It was later used as a headquarters for French and British occupying forces after World War I, then as a museum.

Since 1945, the building has served as Landtag (parliamentary building) for the state of Hesse. The site of the palace had been that of a castle, probably from the early Middle Ages, around which the city had developed. While nothing is known of the former castle, remains of it were uncovered during excavations after World War II.
The new town hall was built in 1887. A tile mosaic in front of the town hall shows the heraldic eagle of the Kingdom of Prussia (of which Wiesbaden was a part at the time), the coat of arms of the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, and the fleur-de-lis of Wiesbaden. The old town hall, built in 1610, is the oldest preserved building in the city center and now is used as a civil registry office.

The Protestant &quot;Marktkirche&quot; (&quot;market church&quot;) was built from 1852 to 1862 in a neo-Gothic style. Its western steeple is in height, making the church the highest building in the city.

===Kurhaus and Theater===
The monumental Neo-Classical &quot;Kurhaus&quot; (&quot;spa house&quot;) was built at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II between 1904 and 1907. Its famous &quot;Spielbank&quot; (casino) is again in operation.

In front of the Kurhaus is a lawn known as the Bowling Green. To one side of the Bowling Green is the Kurhaus Kolonnade. Built in 1827, the 129 meter structure is the longest hall in Europe supported by pillars. To the other side is the Theater Kolonnade, built in 1839. It is adjacent to the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, built between 1892 and 1894.

===St. Bonifatius===

St. Bonifatius, the first church for the Catholic community after the Reformation, was built from 1845 until 1849 by Philipp Hoffmann in Gothic Revival style and dedicated to Saint Boniface.

===St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church===
The Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Elizabeth, called &quot;Griechische Kapelle&quot; (Greek chapel) locally, was built on the Neroberg from 1847 to 1855 by Duke Adolf of Nassau on the occasion of the early death of his wife Elizabeth Mikhailovna, who died in childbirth. The architect was again Philipp Hoffmann.

===Other sights===
Another building from the regency of Duke Wilhelm is the Luisenplatz, a square named for the Duke&#x27;s first wife. It is surrounded by Neoclassicist buildings, and in the middle of the square is the Waterloo Obelisk, commemorating the 683 Nassauers who died on 18 June 1815 near Hougoumont Farm in the respective battle against Napoleon. Apart from the palace in the center, the ducal family had a large palace on the banks of the Rhine, known as Schloss Biebrich. This baroque building was erected in the first half of the 18th century.

North of the city is the Neroberg. From the top of this hill it is possible to view a panorama of the city. The Nerobergbahn funicular railway connects the city with the hill. South of it, the Nerotalanlagen are a park along a creek, created in 1897/98 as an English landscape garden.

One of the three Hessian state museums, Museum Wiesbaden is located in Wiesbaden.

Other churches are the Bergkirche, completed in 1879 in Gothic Revival style, and the Lutherkirche, finished in 1910 in Jugendstil. The church Mariä Heimsuchung is a tall concrete landmark in the Kohlheck suburb.

Oriental Christianity is also represented with the St. Isaiah Syriac Orthodox Church on the Willi-Juppe-Straße in Dotzheim, built in 2016 by Assyrians.

The Warmer Damm park is a 4.5-hectare park on the east side of Wilhelmstrasse and south of the State theater and Kurhaus which features a lake, a fountain, various statues, and large grassy areas. The park was created in 1859–1860 and is named after the medieval fortifications around a pond into which the warm waters of the town&#x27;s 26 warm springs flowed.

==Boroughs of Wiesbaden==
The city of Wiesbaden is divided into 26 boroughs: five in the central city and 21 suburban districts. The 21 suburban districts were incorporated in four phases from 1926 to 1977. The former Mainz suburbs on the right bank of river Rhine viz. Amöneburg, Kastel and Kostheim have belonged to Wiesbaden since 1945.

===Inner boroughs===
===Suburban boroughs===
==Population==

Wiesbaden has a population of about 280,000. In 1946, when Wiesbaden became the capital of Hesse state, it had a population of about 188,000. At that time, Wiesbaden was a part of American occupied zone and parts of the city of Mainz, which was the right side on the Rhine river, became a part of Wiesbaden. In 1950s many Americans came to Wiesbaden due to its jobs by military bases. Many people who work in Frankfurt live in Wiesbaden due to its high rent of the city. Wiesbaden is one of the most international cities in Germany with people from over 180 countries.

===City council===

The Wiesbaden city council (&quot;Stadtverordnetenversammlung&quot;) governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 14 March 2021. Following the election, the coalition negotiations resulted in an agreement between Alliance 90/The Greens (Grüne), the Social Democratic Party (SPD), The Left, and Volt Germany. These 42 votes allowed the Greens, who came second in the popular vote, to keep the CDU, who had come in first, out of the governing majority. The full results of the election were as follows:

<text>Around the World in Eighty Days () is an adventure novel by the French writer Jules Verne, first published in French in 1872. In the story, Phileas Fogg of London and his newly employed French valet Passepartout attempt to circumnavigate the world in 80 days on a wager of £20,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) set by his friends at the Reform Club. It is one of Verne&#x27;s most acclaimed works.

==Plot==
Phileas Fogg is a wealthy English gentleman living a solitary life in London. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives modestly and carries out his habits with mathematical precision. He is a member of the Reform Club, where he spends a large portion of his days and nights. On the morning of 2 October 1872, having dismissed his valet for bringing him shaving water at a temperature slightly lower than expected, Fogg hires Frenchman Jean Passepartout as a replacement.

That evening, while at the Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; (or &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in some editions) stating that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for £20,000, half of his fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45 p.m.; to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later. They take Fogg&#x27;s remaining £20,000 with them to cover expenses during the journey.


Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez on time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by a Scotland Yard policeman, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of James Strand, a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of Strand, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (the &quot;Mongolia&quot;) conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They arrive in Bombay on 20 October, two days ahead of schedule, and board a train heading towards Calcutta that evening.

The early arrival in Bombay proves beneficial for Fogg and Passepartout, as contrary to what the newspaper article had said, an stretch of track from Kholby to Allahabad has not yet been built. Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide and starts toward Allahabad.

They come across a procession in which a young Indian woman, Aouda, is to undergo sati. Since she is drugged with opium and hashish and is not going voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of her deceased husband on the funeral pyre. He rises from the pyre during the ceremony, scaring off the priests and carries Aouda away. The two days gained earlier are lost but Fogg shows no regret.

Fogg and Passepartout re-board the train at Allahabad, taking Aouda with them. When the travelers arrive in Calcutta, Fix, who had arrived ahead of them, has Fogg and Passepartout arrested for a crime Passepartout had committed in Bombay. They jump bail and board a steamer (the &quot;Rangoon&quot;) going to Hong Kong, with a day&#x27;s stopover in Singapore. Fix also boards the &quot;Rangoon&quot;; he shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his friend from the earlier voyage.

In Hong Kong, the group learns Aouda&#x27;s distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved to Holland, so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the &quot;Carnatic,&quot; Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama but cannot inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.

Fogg discovers he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him to Yokohama, finding a pilot boat, the &quot;Tankadere&quot;, that takes him, Aouda, and Fix to Shanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. There, they search for Passepartout, believing he arrived on the &quot;Carnatic&quot; as initially planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the &quot;General Grant,&quot; taking them across the Pacific to San Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg&#x27;s journey but instead support him in getting back to Britain, where he can arrest him.

In San Francisco, they board a transcontinental train to New York City, encountering several obstacles along the way: a herd of bison crossing the tracks, a failing suspension bridge and a band of Sioux warriors ambushing the train. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the warriors. Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by a wind-powered sled to Omaha and then get a train to New York.

In New York, having missed the ship &quot;China&quot;, Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat, &quot;Henrietta&quot;, destined for Bordeaux, France. The captain of the boat refuses to take them to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 per passenger. He then bribes the crew to mutiny and makes course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. When the coal runs out, Fogg buys the boat from the captain, then has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.

The companions arrive at Queenstown (Cobh), Ireland, take the train to Dublin and then a ferry to Liverpool, still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up – the actual robber had been caught three days earlier in Edinburgh. As a result of the delay, Fogg misses the scheduled train to London; he orders a special train and arrives in London apparently five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.

The following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, their days were shortened by four minutes for every degree of longitude they crossed; thus, although they had experienced the same amount of time abroad as people had experienced in London, they had seen 80 sunrises and sunsets while London had seen only 79. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake and Fogg hurries to the Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having spent almost £19,000 of his travel money during the journey, he divides the remainder between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.

==Background and analysis==
&quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; was written during difficult times, both for France and Verne. It was during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him.

The technological innovations of the 19th century had opened the possibility of rapid circumnavigation, and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–1870 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in America (1869), the opening of the Suez Canal (1869), and the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870). It was another notable mark at the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.

The story began serialization in &quot;Le Temps&quot; on 6 November 1872. The story was published in installments over the next 45 days, with its ending timed to synchronize Fogg&#x27;s December 21 deadline with the real world. Chapter XXXV appeared on 20 December; 21 December, the date upon which Fogg was due to appear back in London, did not include an installment of the story; on 22 December, the final two chapters announced Fogg&#x27;s success. As it was being published serially for the first time, some readers believed that the journey was actually taking place – bets were placed, and some railway companies and ship liner companies lobbied Verne to appear in the book. It is unknown if Verne submitted to their requests, but the descriptions of some rail and shipping lines leave some suspicion he was influenced.

Concerning the final &quot;coup de théâtre&quot;, Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was because he had forgotten that during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rate of an hour per 15° of longitude crossed. At the time of publication and until 1884, a &quot;de jure&quot; International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, Fogg&#x27;s mistake would not have been likely to occur in the real world because a &quot;de facto&quot; date line did exist. The UK, India, and the US had the same calendar with different local times. When he arrived in San Francisco, he would have noticed that the local date was one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. Consequently, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were one day earlier than his travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, in &quot;Who Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?&quot;, John Sutherland points out that Fogg and company would have to be &quot;deaf, dumb and blind&quot; not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent &quot;Sunday&quot;, with the Sunday Observance Act 1780 still in effect.

==Real-life imitations==
Following publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg&#x27;s fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints:
* In 1889, Nellie Bly undertook to travel around the world in 80 days for her newspaper, the &quot;New York World&quot;. She managed to do the journey within 72 days, meeting Verne in Amiens. Her book &quot;Around the World in Seventy-Two Days&quot; became a best seller.
* In 1889, Elizabeth Bisland working for the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; became a rival to Bly, racing her across the world to try to achieve the global crossing first.
* In 1894, George Griffith carried out a publicity stunt on behalf of C. Arthur Pearson by circumnavigating the world in 65 days, from 12 March to 16 May. The tale of his journey was told in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in 14 parts between 2 June and 1 September 1894, bearing the title &quot;How I Broke the Record Round the World&quot;. It was later published in book form in 2008 under the title &quot;Around the World in 65 Days&quot;.
* In 1903, James Willis Sayre, an American theatre critic and arts promoter, set a world record for circling the earth using public transport: 54 days, 9 hours and 42 minutes.
* In 1908, Harry Bensley, on a wager, set out to circumnavigate the world on foot wearing an iron mask. The journey was abandoned, incomplete, at the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
* In 1928, 15-year-old Danish Boy Scout Palle Huld travelled around the world by train and ship in the opposite direction to the one in the book. His trip was sponsored by a Danish newspaper and made on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Jules Verne. The trip was described in the book &quot;A Boy Scout Around the World&quot;. It took 44 days. He took the Trans-Siberian Railway and did not go by India.
* In 1984, Nicholas Coleridge emulated Fogg&#x27;s trip, taking 78 days; he wrote a book titled &quot;Around the World in 78 Days&quot;.
* In 1988, Monty Python member Michael Palin took on a similar challenge without using aircraft, as a part of a television travelogue, called &quot;Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin&quot;. He completed the journey in 79 days and 7 hours.
* Since 1993, the Jules Verne Trophy has been given to the boat that sails around the world without stopping and with no outside assistance in the shortest time.
* In 2009, twelve celebrities performed a relay version of the journey for the BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity appeal.
* In 2011, Brazilian businessman and TV host Álvaro Garnero and journalist José Antonio Ramalho made a bet with a pub owner in London to travel around the world in 80 days. The Record (TV network) TV series &quot;50 by 1 - Around the World in 80 Days&quot; followed their journey. Both Brazilians crossed the Atlantic and Pacific, USA, Canada, Alaska, Japan, South Korea, China, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic nations, Scandinavia, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and France to end again at the pub in 81 days (they arrived in London in 80 days but the pub was closed at night).
*In 2017, Mark Beaumont, a British cyclist inspired by Verne, set out to cycle across the world in 80 days. He completed the trip in 78 days, 14 hours and 40 minutes, after departing from Paris on 2 July 2017. Beaumont beat the previous world record of 123 days, set by Andrew Nicholson, by cycling across the globe visiting Russia, Mongolia, China, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US and a number of countries in Europe.

==Origins==
The idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the title &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; is not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.

Another early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World or &quot;Voyage du Tour du Monde&quot; (1719, Paris).

&quot;Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway,&quot; was published in 1871 by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and an &quot;Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days&quot; by Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of in 77 days and 21 hours.

American William Perry Fogg traveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters to &quot;The Cleveland Leader&quot; newspaper, entitled, &quot;Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt&quot; (1872).

In 1872, Thomas Cook organised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters published in 1873 as &quot;Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World.&quot; Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne&#x27;s account and Cook&#x27;s letters. However, some argue that Cook&#x27;s trip happened too late to influence Verne. According to a second-hand 1898 account, Verne refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book. In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was &quot;through reading one day in a Paris cafe&quot; and &quot;due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.&quot; &quot;Around the World&quot; itself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook&#x27;s advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.

The periodical &quot;Le Tour du monde&quot; (3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, which refers to of the railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne&#x27;s work. But even the &quot;Le Tour de monde&quot; article was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography the &quot;Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie, de l&#x27;Histoire et de l&#x27;Archéologie&quot; (August 1869), which also contains the title &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; in its contents page. The &quot;Nouvelles Annales&quot; were written by Conrad Malte-Brun (1775–1826) and his son Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (1816–1889). Scholars believe that Verne was aware of the &quot;Le Tour de monde&quot; article, the &quot;Nouvelles Annales,&quot; or both and that he consulted it or them, noting that the &quot;Le Tour du monde&quot; even included a trip schedule very similar to Verne&#x27;s final version.

A possible inspiration was the traveller George Francis Train, who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, &quot;Verne stole my thunder. I&#x27;m Phileas Fogg.&quot;
Regarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: &quot;I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the &quot;Siècle&quot; that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form.&quot; In his April 1873 lecture, &quot;The Meridians and the Calendar&quot;, Verne responded to a question about where the change of day occurred since the International Date Line only became current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in &quot;Nature,&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;Three Sundays in a Week&quot; (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe&#x27;s story in his &quot;Edgar Poe and His Works&quot; (1864).

==Adaptations and influences==

The book has been adapted or reimagined many times in different forms.

===Literature===
* The novel &quot;Around the world in 100 days&quot; by Gary Blackwood (2010) serves as a sequel to the events in &quot;80 days&quot;. The book follows Phileas&#x27;s son as he travels around the world by car instead of train, hence the longer time limit.
* The novel &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot; by Philip Jose Farmer (1973) tells the secret history of Phileas Fogg&#x27;s unprecedented trip, in which two alien races contend for Earth&#x27;s mastery.

===Theatre===
* The novel was converted into a play by Verne and Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery for production in Paris in 1874. The play was translated into English and brought to the United States by The Kiralfy Brothers.
* Orson Welles produced a musical version with Cole Porter in 1946 called &quot;Around the World&quot;.
* Another musical version, &quot;80 Days&quot;, with songs by Ray Davies of the Kinks and a book by playwright Snoo Wilson, directed by Des McAnuff, ran at the Mandell Weiss Theatre in San Diego from 23 August to 9 October 1988, receiving mixed responses from the critics. Davies&#x27;s multi-faceted music, McAnuff&#x27;s directing, and the acting were well received, with the show winning the &quot;Best Musical&quot; award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.
* Mark Brown adapted the book for a five-actor stage production in 2001. It has been performed in New York, Canada, England, South Africa, and Bangladesh.
* Toby Hulse created an adaptation for three actors, which was first produced at The Egg at The Theatre Royal, Bath in 2010. It was revived at the Arcola Theatre in London in 2013 and The Theatre Chipping Norton in 2014.

===Radio===
* The novel was adapted twice by Orson Welles for his &quot;Mercury Theatre&quot; broadcasts, 23 October 1938 (60 minutes) and 7 June 1946 (30 minutes).
* &quot;Jules Verne – Around the World in Eighty Days,&quot; a 4-part drama adaptation in 2010 by Terry James and directed by Janet Whittaker for BBC Radio 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra), starred Leslie Phillips as Phileas Fogg, Yves Aubert as Passepartout and Jim Broadbent as Sergeant Fix.

===Film===

* In 1919, a silent film was released. Produced in Germany and starring Conrad Veidt as Phileas Fogg, the film&#x27;s original German title was &quot;Die Reise um die Erde in 80 Tagen&quot;. Its original 2 hour and 11 minute running time was later cut by seven minutes. The film was considered lost as of 2002.
* In 1923, a silent serial based on the book was released. Titled &quot;Around the World in 18 days&quot;, the serial told the story of Fogg&#x27;s descendant, Phileas Fogg III, and his attempt to recreate his grandfather&#x27;s journey.
* In 1938, a French/English co-production entitled &quot;An Indian Fantasy Story&quot; featured the wager at the Reform Club and the rescue of the Indian Princess. However, the production was never completed.
* In 1956, Michael Anderson directed a film adaptation starring David Niven and Cantinflas. The film won five Oscars, including Academy Award for Best Picture 
* In 1963, a comedy film &quot;The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze&quot; starring The Three Stooges in the Passepartout role was released to exploit the popularity of the 1956 film and the Stooges resurgence in popularity that began in 1959.
* In 1910, Serbian writer Branislav Nušić, inspired by the works of Jules Verne, wrote the comedy Travel Around the World (Put oko sveta). This play was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1964, directed by Soja Jovanović, one of the first female directors in the former Yugoslavia. The film was produced by Avala Film.
* In 2000, Warner Bros. released &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot; in which Tweety flies around the world in 80 days collecting cat paw prints in order to raise money for a children&#x27;s park. The film was also adapted into a game for the Game Boy Color that same year.
* In 2004, a film was made, loosely based on the book, starring Steve Coogan and Jackie Chan in the roles of Fogg and Passepartout respectively. The adaptation bears less resemblance to the book. The film was nominated for two Razzie Awards.

===Television===
* &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, a 1972 Australian animated television adaptation.
* &quot;The Wonderful World of Puss &#x27;n Boots&quot;, a 1976 Japanese cel-animated film.
* &quot;Wielka Podróż Bolka i Lolka&quot;, a 1978 Polish 15-episode miniseries in the &quot;Bolek and Lolek&quot; cartoon franchise, where Bolek and Lolek must compete with Fogg&#x27;s descendant in a bet to repeat his fabled journey.
* &quot;Around the World with Willy Fog&quot;, a 1984 Spanish animated television adaptation.
* Pierce Brosnan starred as Phileas Fogg in the 1989 mini series with Julia Nickson.

* &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, a 2021 international co-produced series starring David Tennant as Phileas Fogg.

===Games===
* There have been several board games based, often loosely, upon the story.
* The 2004 mobile video game &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; is based on the 2004 film.
* The 2005 PC video game &quot;80 Days&quot; (2005 video game), developed by Frogwares, is based on the novel.
* The 2014 game of the same name, &quot;80 Days&quot; (2014 video game), developed by Inkle, is loosely based on the novel while introducing various science fiction elements.
* The 2020 mobile video game &quot;Sherlock: Hidden Match-3 Cases&quot;, developed by G5 Entertainment, is partly based on the novel.

===Internet===
* Flightfox created a trip, &quot;Around the World in 80 Hours&quot;, to see if flight experts could find cheap flights following the same path as described in the book. The online travel company published a fiction eBook based on the results of the contest.

===Other===
* Worlds of Fun, an amusement park in Kansas City, Missouri, was conceived using the novel as its theme.
* Starting in the second half of the 20th century, and continuing up to the present day (2022), a number of airlines had &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; fares, in which one could take as many flights in one direction as one wanted within the requisite time frame.

<doc id="42611" wikidata="Q948164" url="?curid=42611" title="McLibel case">
<text>, known as &quot;the McLibel case&quot;, was an English lawsuit for libel filed by McDonald&#x27;s Corporation against environmental activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as &quot;The McLibel Two&quot;) over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two hearings in English courts found some of the leaflet&#x27;s contested claims to be libellous and others to be true.

The original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the BBC, made it the longest-running libel case in English history. McDonald&#x27;s announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts. Following the decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in &quot;Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom&quot; that the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair trial), and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression. The court awarded a judgment of £57,000 against the UK government. McDonald&#x27;s itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant state.

Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach made a documentary film, &quot;McLibel&quot;, about the case.

==History==

===Background===
Helen Steel and David Morris were two environmental activists of London Greenpeace, a small environmental campaigning group that existed between 1972 and 2001. In 1986 they distributed &quot;a few hundred copies&quot; of a six-page leaflet titled &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with McDonald&#x27;s: everything they don&#x27;t want you to know&quot; in Strand, London. The leaflet accused the company of paying low wages, cruelty to animals used in its products, damaging the environment, and other malpractices. The group were not affiliated with the larger Greenpeace International organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it as too &quot;centralised and mainstream&quot;.

===Libel charges===
In 1990, McDonald&#x27;s brought libel proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O&#x27;Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald&#x27;s threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including Channel 4 television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled and apologised.

Under English defamation law at the time, the defendant had to show that each disparaging statement made was substantively true. This could be an expensive and time-consuming process. Gravett, Clarke and O&#x27;Farrell apologised as requested by McDonald&#x27;s, but Steel and Morris chose to defend the case.

The two were denied legal aid, as was policy for libel cases, despite having limited income. Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant pro bono assistance, including from Keir Starmer. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about food poisoning, unpaid overtime, misleading claims about how much McDonald&#x27;s recycled, and &quot;corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace&quot;. McDonald&#x27;s spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald&#x27;s activities in that continent&#x27;s rainforests.

In its libel allegation, McDonald&#x27;s asserted all claims in the pamphlet to be false. They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a media circus. McDonald&#x27;s executives, including Ray Cesca, entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.

In June 1995 McDonald&#x27;s offered to settle the case (which &quot;was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court&quot;) by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to &quot;stop criticising McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald&#x27;s said the pair could criticise McDonald&#x27;s privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald&#x27;s ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.

===Judgment===

====High Court====
The case was adjudicated by Mr Justice Rodger Bell. On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered his more than 1,000-page judgment largely in favour of McDonald&#x27;s, finding the claims that McDonald&#x27;s was responsible for starvation and deforestation were false and libellous. The ruling was summarized by a 45-page paper read in court. Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true. McDonald&#x27;s considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge&#x27;s endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled that McDonald&#x27;s endangered the health of their workers and customers by &quot;misleading advertising&quot;, that they &quot;exploit children&quot;, that they were &quot;culpably responsible&quot; in the infliction of unnecessary cruelty to animals, and they were &quot;antipathetic&quot; to unionisation and paid their workers low wages. Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald&#x27;s legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.

In 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled &quot;McLibel&quot;. This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.

In September 1998, the pair sued the Metropolitan Police for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald&#x27;s and received £10,000 and an apology for the disclosure.

====Court of Appeal====
An appeal began on 12 January 1999, and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February. The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keene. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman (King&#x27;s College London). McDonald&#x27;s were represented by libel lawyer Richard Rampton, and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson, and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert. Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald&#x27;s employees worldwide &quot;do badly in terms of pay and conditions&quot; and true &quot;if one eats enough McDonald&#x27;s food, one&#x27;s diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease&quot;.

As a result of their further findings against the corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell&#x27;s award of £60,000 damages to McDonald&#x27;s by £20,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over public interest issues. Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the House of Lords, and then take the UK government to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

In response to the verdict, David Pannick said in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law of defamation in the minds of all right thinking people.&quot;

Steel and Morris appealed to the Law Lords, arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained solicitor Mark Stephens and barrister Keir Starmer to file a case with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), contesting the UK government&#x27;s policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular. In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair&#x27;s right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.

====European Court of Human Rights====

On 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people&#x27;s lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants&#x27; comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.

In particular the Court held:


In response to the European Court of Human Rights&#x27; decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:

Having largely beaten McDonald&#x27;s ... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the ... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald&#x27;s and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation&#x27;s business practices. 

===Post court developments===
In the course of the UK undercover policing relationships scandal it was revealed that one of the authors of the &quot;McLibel leaflet&quot; was Bob Lambert, an undercover police officer who infiltrated London Greenpeace. John Dines, another undercover officer, was Helen Steel&#x27;s partner for two years; she was unaware of his true identity and motives.

The Defamation Act 2013 brought some changes to libel cases, which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.

The McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies that raise them, similarly to the Streisand effect.

==McDonald&#x27;s response==
The &quot;McLibel&quot; film quoted McDonald&#x27;s as offering little comment on the European Court decision, other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald&#x27;s who was the losing party and that &quot;times have changed and so has McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.

On a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald&#x27;s stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation).

==Later events==
Chapter 5 of Paul Lewis and Rob Evans&#x27; 2012 book &quot;&quot; is titled &quot;McSpies&quot;. In recounting the history of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) it recounts the involvement of undercover policemen Bob Lambert and John Dines in the activities which led up to the trial. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later reported that Lambert had co-written the leaflet that was central to the libel trial. Steel has stated that Dines became treasurer of London Greenpeace.

Documents from the case showed that McDonald&#x27;s private investigators had been receiving information from the Metropolitan Police. The Metropolitan Police were sued over this, which was settled out of court and with an apology and the Metropolitan Police undertaking not to share information from police computers with corporations.

==Media==
A feature-length documentary film, &quot;McLibel&quot;, was made about the case by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005, with estimated viewing audience of 25 million.

The documentary features courtroom reconstructions of the trial. It also features interviews with Eric Schlosser (author of the 2001 book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;), Morgan Spurlock (writer/director of the 2004 film &quot;Super Size Me&quot;), Keir Starmer (who provided free legal support to the McLibel defendants for many years) and Howard Lyman who appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; about Mad Cow disease.

In April 2022 the case was the subject for a programme in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Reunion&quot;.

<text>The Price Revolution, sometimes known as the Spanish Price Revolution, was a series of economic events that occurred between the second half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, and most specifically linked to the high rate of inflation that occurred during this period across Western Europe. Prices rose on average roughly sixfold over 150 years. This level of inflation amounts to 1.2% per year compounded, a relatively low inflation rate for modern-day standards, but rather high given the monetary policy in place in the 16th century.

Generally it is thought that this high inflation was caused by the large influx of gold and silver from the Spanish treasure fleet from the New World; including Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and the rest of the Spanish Empire.

Specie flowed through Spain increasing its prices and those of allied European countries (e.g., the imperial territories of Charles V). Wealth then spread to the rest of Western Europe as a result of the Spanish balance of payments deficit, or was directly introduced to countries like Great Britain and France, using piracy to attack the Spanish fleet. This enlarged the monetary supply and price levels of many European countries.

==Background==
Most historians look at the end of the Renaissance as the start of the Price Revolution. An era that was often considered a time of peace for the Western European population, the Renaissance was a period when Western Europe experienced equilibrium in the price of commodities and labor. It also was a period when there was a high concentration of wealth in the hands of a few (the Black Death had wiped out nearly a third of the population a century before). Additionally, Europe experienced technological advancement in the mining industry, the stream of currency through debasement from royals, and the emergence of Protestantism.

The severe shortage of precious metals during the late 15th and early 16th centuries eased in the second half of the 16th century. The Spanish mined American gold and silver at minimal cost and flooded the European market with an abundance of specie. This influx caused a relative decrease in the value of these metals in comparison with agricultural and craft products. Furthermore, depopulation – specifically in southern Spain – resulted in a high rate of inflation. The failure of the Spanish to control the influx of gold and the price fluctuations of gold and silver from the American mines, combined with war expenditures, led to three bankruptcies of the Spanish monarchy by the end of the 16th century.

In the 16th century, prices increased consistently throughout Western Europe, and by the end of the century prices reached levels three to four times higher than at the beginning. The annual inflation rate ranged from 1% to 1.5%. Since the monetary system of the 16th century was based on specie (mostly silver) this inflation rate was significant. The specie-centered monetary organization had its own price-level stabilization property: rising commodity prices led to a fall in the purchasing power of the monetary metals, and therefore less incentive to mine them and more incentive to use them for non-monetary purposes. This stabilizing adjustment of the money supply led to long-run stability of price levels regardless of permanent shifts in money demand over time. Therefore, the long-run inflation can only be explained either by the devaluation of coins or by shifts in the supply of the specie. An increase in the productivity of mining in Peru led to a fall in the price of metals relative to rising prices for other commodities in Europe. This process is only remedied if the purchasing power of the metal is equal to its production costs.

==Causes==

===Influx of gold and silver===
From an economic viewpoint the discovery of new silver and gold deposits as well as the productivity increase in the silver mining industry perpetuated the price revolution. When precious metals entered Spain, this influx drove up the Spanish price level and caused a balance of payments deficit. This deficit occurred on account of Spanish demand for foreign products exceeding exports to foreign markets. The deficit was financed by the metals that entered these foreign countries and in turn increased their money supply and drove up their price levels.

The increased importation of specie to Spain started in Central Europe around the beginning of the sixteenth century. According to Michael North (1994) central European silver output doubled between 1470 and 1520, and increased even more in the 1520s with the new mine of Joachimsthal. Also during this time the Spanish and Portuguese brought a large amount of gold from the New World to Europe. Starting in the 1540s a growing amount of silver was shipped to Europe from Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Taxco mines in Mexico and the Potosí mountain in Peru. The production of the Potosí mine increased greatly in the 1560s after mercury deposits had been discovered in the Andes, as mercury was necessary to process the silver. Based on the records of Earl J. Hamilton (1934), the total imports of specie from the Americas during the 16th century amounted to around 210 million pesos, with 160 million of these pesos being imported in the second half of the 16th century. The total amount of silver imported added up to about 3,915 metric tons of silver. However these numbers underestimate the total amount imported to Spain because Hamilton only counted imports recorded by the official Casa de Contratación in Seville, not including the specie shipped directly to Cadiz by the Dutch and British East India Companies. The influx of these precious metals and the resulting money supply shocks help explain the price increase in Spain during the 16th century.

===European silver production===
Some accounts emphasize the role of increased silver production within Europe itself. According to Nef, the output of silver mines in Bohemia, Germany and Hungary increased rapidly from to . Production peaked in the 1530s, thereafter slowly declining for the next 30 years. After 1560, the decline in European silver production was rapid. Flynn contends that imports of silver from Spanish America is behind this decline in European silver mining.

=== Quantity theory of money ===

The first scholar to make a quantity-theory link between the influx of American &quot;treasure&quot; and the Price Revolution was supposedly the French philosopher Jean Bodin in his 1568 response to a 1566 treatise by the Royal Councilor Jean de Malestroit. Malestroit argued that lower-quality coins were the chief culprit of price influx—similar to the periodic inflations of the 14th and 15th centuries. Bodin dismissed this argument, contending that the growing influx of silver from the Spanish Americas was the primary cause of price inflation. Championed for the quantity theory of money, Bodin was able to demonstrate that the inflation of prices in France was due far more to Spanish-American influx than to any change in coin debasement.

Earl Hamilton, a contemporary price revolution theorist, found that no Spanish writer of the 16th century had voiced opinions similar to those of Jean Bodin despite having conducted meticulous research into Spanish treatises, letters, and other documents. This, however, was not true; less well known is an even earlier Spanish publication in a treatise from 1556 by the cleric Martín de Azpilcueta of the Salamanca School, which made virtually the same claim about the role of Spanish-American silver in the rise of prices.

=== Debasement ===

Regardless, Malestroit did put forth several valid claims about the price revolution that continue to hold up today, particularly his argument explaining the different price indexes and why the Spanish prices rose the least and the Brabantine the most. Spain, unlike most other European countries of this era, underwent no debasements of the gold and silver coinages during most of the period, but that all changed in 1599, when the new Spanish king Philip III (1598–1621) introduced the purely copper &quot;vellon&quot; coinage.

Following Henry VIII of England and his infamous &quot;Great Debasement&quot; programme that began 1526, the Spanish King Philip III tried to cement his Spanish legacy through changes in coinage strategy. Previously, Spanish kings (at least from 1471) issued a largely copper fractional coinage called blancas, with a nominal money-of-account value of 0.5 maravedí, but with a very small amount of silver to convince the public that it was indeed precious-metal &quot;money&quot;. The blanca issued in 1471 had a silver fineness of 10 grains or 3.47% (weighing 1.107 g). In 1497, that fineness was reduced to 7 grains (2.43% fine); in 1552, to 5.5 grains (1.909% fine); in 1566, to 4 grains (1.39% fine). By the start of the 17th century, inflation took hold of Spain as the gap between nominal and silver-based prices dramatically shifted. The purely copper coinage had done its damage to Spain. The difference between the silver- and vellon-based price indexes in Spain showed that the purely copper coinage other European countries used made up a much smaller proportion of the total coined money supply (something the Spanish kings had overlooked and Malestroit was able to pinpoint).

===Black Death===

Demographic factors also contributed to upward pressure on prices with the resurgence of European population growth after the century of depopulation following the Black Death (1347–1353). The price of food rose during the years of the plague, and then began to fall as the population of nations decreased. At the same time prices of manufactured goods rose because of a displacement of supply. As the nations began to recover and repopulate after the Black Death, the increase in population placed greater demands on agriculture. Later on, increased population placed greater demands on an agricultural area that had contracted significantly after the 1340s, or had been converted from arable to less intensive livestock production.

However, population growth and recovery in countries such as England are not consistent with inflation during the early stages of the price revolution. In 1520 at the beginning of the price revolution England&#x27;s population was roughly 2.5 million people. This is about half of the English population of 5 million in 1300. Critics of the population argument raise the question that if England at the beginning stages of the price revolution was very unpopulated, how could any renewed growth from such a low level immediately spark inflation? It can be argued that population growth led to a price increase in the agrarian sector because of an increase demand for food. Marginal lands that were not very fertile and far away from markets were unable to adopt the technological developments to offset the lower returns of farming. In turn this led to a higher marginal cost to farming and resulted in a price increase for grains and other agricultural goods that surpassed the price increase for non-agrarian commodities during the 16th and beginning of the 17th century. The resurgence of population after the plague is linked with the demand-pull explanation of the price revolution. This &quot;demand-pull&quot; theory states that an increase in the demand for money and the growth of economic activity produced the rise in prices and a pressure to increase the supply of money.

===Urbanization===
Some accounts emphasize the role of urbanization. Urbanization contributed to increased trade between Europe&#x27;s regions, which made prices more responsive to distant changes in demand, and provided a network for the flow of silver from Spain through western and central Europe. Urbanization is often connected with the increased velocity of money theory because the frequency of transactions increases as urban centers grow relative to rural areas. For example, in England, many lands held as common lands were enclosed so that only the landlord could graze his animals. This forced his former tenants either to pay an increased rent, or to leave their own farms. An increase in the number of people unable to afford their farms led to migration into the cities in search of employment. This in turn led to an increase in the velocity of monetary transactions, but was frustrated by the high demand and inelastic supply of food.

=== Population and agricultural growth ===
If the influx of Spanish silver was not the initial cause of the European Price Revolution then the best explanation for the Price Revolution is population growth. This theory developed under Earl Hamilton argues that prices were not driven by specie (which, at most, sets a floor to prices) but by the actions of monopolists (or governments) whose positions in this period were enhanced by the steady population growth in Western Europe. The resurgence of population after the plague is linked to the &quot;demand-pull&quot; explanation of the price revolution, which states that an increase in the demand for money and the growth of economic activity produced the rise in prices and a pressure to increase the supply of money.

The significant increase of European population in the period 1460–1620 meant that there were now more people to be fed, clothed, and housed raising the demand for goods of all kinds. Agricultural products then became crucial to the European market. Producers were unable to respond to the rising demand as new and less fertile land were cultivated. Essentially, marginal costs were increasing and per-capita yields were shrinking, while demand continued to rise. The price of agricultural commodities, especially grain, rose sooner and faster than those of other goods, and the inflation of agricultural prices eventually caused a general increase in price level in all industries. Until the mid-17th century, the number of mouths to feed outran the capacity of agriculture to supply basic foodstuffs, causing the vast majority of people to live in a constant state of hunger. Until food production could catch up with the increasing population, prices, especially those of the staple food, bread, continued to rise. Hamilton&#x27;s theory pointed to evidence of agricultural price growth, slow nonagricultural price growth and poor timing (of the specie outflow to the East) as tangible evidence of the failure to fix prices and feed the growing populace. Hamilton also pointed to monopolistic and other non-competitive techniques as the typical pricing behavior for European products and factor markets of the period.

== Effects ==

=== Spain ===
====External debt====
Rising costs to sustain Habsburg war efforts eventually led to a severe rise of the Spanish public debt, of which German and Italian bankers were the creditors. The Habsburg Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor was also King of Spain and borrowed enormous amounts of money from the Fuggers, the Welsers, and Genoese banking families, in order to be elected Emperor and sustain, for over 35 years, the Imperial foreign policy. To repay such loans, he relied primarily on the vast stream of bullion provided by Spanish America. In the 1520s and 1530s, ships full of Aztec and Inca treasures arrived from Mexico and Peru to the courts of Charles V as homage of Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro. Those treasures were usually minted into coins in Seville and transferred to German bankers in Antwerp, a port city of the Burgundian Low Countries where major agencies of the Fugger and Welser were located. This allowed Antwerp to become the center of the international economy and accelerated the capitalist transition of the Low Countries. Certain golden objects have survived in descriptions: for example, some were displayed in Brussels to the German artist Albrecht Dürer who wrote: &quot;In all my life, I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so much as these things&quot;. French corsaires were constantly disrupting this trade: notably, the treasure of the Aztec emperor Cuauhtémoc was captured by the French corsair Jean Fleury.

Silver arrived in large amounts, whereas gold was rarer to be found. In 1528, Charles V carved out a colony in Venezuela for his German bankers, hoping to discover the legendary golden city of El Dorado. In 1546, the project came to an end and the German colony was disbanded. In the 1540s and 1550s, the discovery of silver mines in the Americas (such as Potosí, Zacatecas, Taxco, Guanajuato, Sombrerete) increased the flows of precious metals. Overall, 15 million ducats&#x27; worth of bullion reached the Imperial treasury during Charles&#x27;s reign. This contributed to the higher inflation known as the Spanish price revolution: prices doubled in the first half of the 16th century. The rising costs of war had dramatic consequences on Habsburg finances: one campaign in the 1550s costed as much as one war in the 1520s. Charles V was forced to borrow even more and at higher interest rates, which grew from 17% to 48%.

Despite opposition from the , Charles V managed to impose this vicious circle that progressively weakened the Spanish finances. Furthermore, in the last years of his reign, Charles V could not be economically supported by his non-Spanish possessions: he exempted the Low Countries from taxation after the Revolt of Ghent in 1540, Germany was in the middle of the Schmalkaldic Wars, and the budget surplus of Italian states was wiped out by the Italian Wars. This ultimately put the financial burden of the Holy Roman Empire on the Spanish kingdoms and led to the bankruptcy of Spain. Unable to sustain his projects financially, Charles V abdicated in 1556 and retired to a monastery in 1558. Sovereign default was declared in 1557.
==== Landowners ====
Conditions in 16th century Europe support the view that the separation of constantly rising prices and fixed rents destroyed landowners. But this did not apply to Spain, where rent was not fixed and the power of landowners allowed them to raise rent and replace their tenants based on the tenants&#x27; ability to meet payments.

On the other hand, the price revolution brought impoverishment to those who lived on fixed income and small rents, as their earning could not keep pace with Spanish prices. Small landowners of the class, the lower clergy, government officials, and many others all found their standard of living reduced as commodity prices rose beyond their means. The situation of the peasants is less clear, for it is difficult to reconcile agricultural prosperity and the great rural emigration to the towns, which in turn makes it difficult to explain the alleged extension of cultivation in Spain. But one thing is certain—wages lagged behind prices.

==== Sellers and traders ====
But landowners and the rich were not the only ones gaining from the price revolution. Anyone with something to sell or trade could reap the benefits of inflation, particularly manufacturers and merchants. However in the second half of the century, when the conditions of the Price Revolution got worse and relentless inflation began to make Spanish enterprise less competitive in the international and colonial market, not all merchants and manufactures found life enjoyable. Only the more powerful merchants were able to survive foreign competition and in doing so prospered boundlessly. Enormous fortunes were made in the Indies trade (whose expansion was related directly to the rise of prices) and this encouraged more investment and profitable returns. Profitable returns were distributed beyond the merchant houses of Seville to entrepreneurs in other parts of Spain, as the American market took the oil and wine of Andalusia, the wool of Castile, the metallurgical products and ships of the Basque country. To at least the end of the 16th century there was still money to be made in Spain for selected merchants and manufactures.

==== The Crown ====
The Crown, like its ally the aristocracy, was less crippled by the price revolution than the majority of its subjects. Certainly the cost of administration, and of paying, feeding, and equipping its armed forces, rose for the Crown just as the cost of goods did for the private consumer; unlike other countries, Spain was willing to spend at a higher level to maintain their status as a world power. However, the aristocracy in contrast lost less of its savings than the Crown. The aristocracy could raise rents to increase revenue and not face the full consequences of the Price Revolution. The aristocracy allowed prices to remain high, while inflation alleviated the burden of loans, which became a substantial part of their income.

=== Republic of Genoa ===
Unlike many other states of the period, the Republic of Genoa gambled the majority of its economic interest on the Spanish monarchy—bankers invested their money in the crown and farmers of Spanish revenue, while Genoa&#x27;s merchants and nobles settled in Spain (Madrid, Seville, Kingdom of Naples and Sicily) marrying local nobility and monopolizing majority of the trade. As long as New Spain was sending silver and gold to the in Seville, Genoa could flourish. Genoa became a large credit market as the capital of Italian cities was all drained towards Genoa.

A multitude of small investors, Genoese and others, obtained from the Crown long-term securities () as collateral for their loans. Also short-term loans known as could be converted into long-term . The contracts specified that these securities would be sold if the Crown did not repay the loans. In essence, the Genoese bankers had worked out an interest rate swap. Furthermore, the Crown sold silver spot in Spain to the Genoese in exchange for future delivery of gold in Antwerp, where the gold was used to pay Spanish troops fighting in the Low Countries. Genoa benefited from the price revolution as they enjoyed the advantage of &quot;increasing returns to scale in international financial services&quot;. Genoa during the price revolution was a snapshot of global finance at its best. Unfortunately, the decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the decline of Genoa (due to the Spanish crown&#x27;s frequent bankruptcies); Genoa&#x27;s merchant houses particularly suffered. In 1684, Genoa was bombed by a French fleet as punishment for its long alliance with Spain. As a result the Genoese bankers and traders made new economic and financial links with Louis XIV.

== Long term decline of inflation ==
The inflation of eventually petered out with the end of the initial rush of New World bullion. Prices remained around or slightly below the levels of the first half of the 17th century until the onset of new inflationary pressures in the latter decades of the 18th century.

<text>Eridu (; Sumerian: eridugki; Akkadian: &quot;irîtu&quot;) was a Sumerian city located at Tell Abu Shahrain (), also Abu Shahrein or Tell Abu Shahrayn, an archaeological site in Lower Mesopotamia. It is located in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq, near the modern city of Basra. Eridu is traditionally considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia based on the Sumerian King List. Located 24 kilometers south-southwest of the ancient site of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of Sumerian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. The city gods of Eridu were Enki and his consort Damkina. Enki, later known as Ea, was considered to have founded the city. His temple was called E-Abzu, as Enki was believed to live in Abzu, an aquifer from which all life was thought to stem. According to Sumerian temple hymns, another name for the temple of Ea/Enki was called Esira (Esirra).
At nearby Ur there was a temple of Ishtar of Eridu (built by Lagash&#x27;s ruler Ur-Baba) and a sanctuary of Inanna of Eridu (built by Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu). Ur-Nammu also recorded building a temple of Ishtar of Eridu at Ur which is assumed to have been a rebuild.

One of the religious quarters of Babylon, containing the temple called the Esagila as well as the temple of Annunitum, among others, was also named Eridu.
==Archaeology==

Eridu is located on a natural hill in a basin approximately 15 miles long and 20 feet deep, which is separated from the Euphrates by a sandstone ridge called the &quot;Hazem&quot;. This basin, the &quot;As Sulaybiyat&quot; Depression (formerly: &quot;Khor en-Nejeif&quot;), becomes a seasonal lake (Arabic: Sebkha) during the rainy season from November to April. During this period, it is filled by the discharge of the Wadi Khanega. Adjacent to eastern edge of the seasonal lake are the Hammar Marshes.

In the 3rd Millennium BC a canal, Id-edin-Eriduga (NUN)ki &quot;the canal of the Eridug plain&quot;, connected Eridu to the Euphrates river, which later shifted its course. The path of the canal is marked by several low tells with 2nd Millennium BC surface pottery and later burials.
The site contains 8 mounds:

*Mound 1 - Abū Šahrain, 580 meters x 540 meters in area NW to WE, 25 meters in height, Enki Temple, Ur III Ziggurat (É-u₆-nir) Sacred Area, Early Dynastic plano-convex bricks found, Ubaid Period cemetery
*Mound 2 - 350 meters x 350 meters in area, 4.3 meters in height, 1 kilometer N of Abū Šahrain, Early Dynastic Palace, remnants of city wall built with plano-convex bricks
*Mound 3 - 300 × 150 meters in area, 2.5 meters high, 2.2 kilometers SSW of Abū Šahrain, Isin-Larsa pottery found
*Mound 4 - 600 × 300 meters in area, 2.5 kilometers SW of Abū Šahrain, Kassite pottery found
*Mound 5 - 500 × 300 meters in area, 3 meters high, 1.5 kilometers SE of Abū Šahrain, Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods
*Mound 6 - 300 × 200 meters in area, 2 meters high, 2.5 kilometers SW of Abū Šahrain
*Mound 7 - 400 × 200 meters in area, 1.5 meters high, 3 kilometers E of Abū Šahrai
*Mound 8 - Usalla, flat area, 8 kilometers NW of Abū Šahrain, Hajj Mohammed and later Ubaid

The site was initially excavated by John George Taylor, the British Vice-counsel at Basra, in 1855. Among the finds were inscribed bricks enabling the identification of the site as Eridu. Excavation on the main tell next occurred by R. Campbell Thompson from April 10 until May 8 in 1918, and H. R. Hall from April 21 until May 8 in 1919, who also conducted a survey in the area around the tell. An interesting find by Hall was a piece of manufactured blue glass which he dated to . The blue color was achieved with cobalt, long before this technique emerged in Egypt.

This lump of glass is currently dated to the twenty-first century BC or even earlier, and is considered as perhaps the earliest such glass object in the world in the History of glass. It was produced during the Akkadian Empire or the early Ur III period.
Excavation there resumed from 1946 to 1949 under Fuad Safar and Seton Lloyd of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities and Heritage. Among the finds were a Ubaid period terracotta boat model, complete with a socket amidship for a mast and hole for stays and rudder, bevel-rimmed bowls, and a &quot;lizard type&quot; figurine like those found in a sounding under the Royal Cemetery of Ur. Soundings in the cemetery showed it to have about 1000 graves, all from the end of the Ubaid period (Temple levels VI and VII). They found a sequence of 17 Ubaid Period superseding temples and an Ubaid Period graveyard with 1000 graves of mud-brick boxes oriented to the southeast. The temple began as a 2 meter by 3 meter mud brick square with a niche. At Level XI it was rebuilt and eventually reached its final tripartite form in Level VI. In Ur III times a 300 square meter platform was constructed as a base for a ziggurat. These archaeological investigations showed that, according to A. Leo Oppenheim, &quot;eventually the entire south lapsed into stagnation, abandoning the political initiative to the rulers of the northern cities&quot;, probably as a result of increasing salinity produced by continuous irrigation, and the city was abandoned in 600 BC. In 1990 the site was visited by A. M. T. Moore who found two areas of surface pottery kilns not noted by the earlier excavators.

In October 2014 Franco D’Agostino visited the site in preparation for the coming resumption of excavation, noting a number of inscribed Amar-Sin brick fragments on the surface. In 2019, excavations at Eridu were resumed by a joint Italian, French, and Iraqi effort which included the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Strasbourg. Work has included producing new detail topographic and photogrammetric maps and is mainly focused on the Ubaid period cemetery and its associated Ubaid residential area.

===Artifacts===

In March 2006, Giovanni Pettinato and S. Chiod from Rome&#x27;s La Sapienza University claimed to have discovered 500 Early Dynastic historical and literary cuneiform tablets on the surface at Eridu &quot;disturbed by an explosion&quot;. The tablets were said to be from 2600 to 2100 BC (rulers Eannatum to Amar-Sin) and be part of a library. A team was sent to the site by Iraq&#x27;s State Board of Antiquities and Heritage which found no tablets, only stamped bricks from Eridu and surrounding sites such as Ur. Nor was there a permit to excavate at the site issued to anyone. At this point Pettinato stated that they had actually found 70 inscribed bricks. This turned out to be stamped bricks used to build the modern Eridu dig-house. The dig-house had been built using bricks from the demolished Leonard Woolley’s expedition house at Ur (clearly spelled out in the 1981 Iraqi excavation report to avoid confusion to future archaeologists. Most of the bricks
in question were returned to Ur in 1962 fur use in restoration efforts.

===Architecture===
====Temple and ziggurat====
The urban nucleus of Eridu was Enki&#x27;s temple, called House of the Aquifer (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: ; Akkadian: ), which in later history was called House of the Waters (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: e₂-engur; Akkadian: &quot;bītu engurru&quot;). The name refers to Enki&#x27;s realm. His consort Ninhursag had a nearby temple at Ubaid.

During the Ur III period Ur-Nammu had a ziggurat built over the remains of previous temples.

Aside from Enmerkar of Uruk (as mentioned in the &quot;Aratta&quot; epics), several later historical Sumerian kings are said in inscriptions found here to have worked on or renewed the &quot;e-abzu&quot; temple, including Elili of Ur; Ur-Nammu, Shulgi and Amar-Sin of Ur-III, and Nur-Adad of Larsa.
==History==

Eridu is one of the earliest settlements in the region, founded  during the early Ubaid period, at that time close to the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Euphrates, although in modern times it is about 90 miles inland. Excavation has shown that the city was founded on a virgin sand dune site with no previous habitation. According to the excavators, construction of the Ur III ziggurat and associated buildings was preceded by the destruction of preceding construction and its use as leveling fill so no remains from that time were found. At a small mound 1 kilometer north of Eridu two Early Dynastic III palaces were found, with an enclosure wall. The palaces measured 45 meters by 65 meters with 2.6 meter wide walls and were constructed in the standard Early Dynastic period method of plano-convex bricks laid in a herringbone fashion.
With possible breaks in occupation in the Early Dynastic III and Akkadian Empire periods, the city was inhabited until the Neo-Babylonian Empire, though in later times it was primarily a cultic site.
During the Ubaid period the site extended out to an area of about 12 hectares (about 30 acres). Twelve neolithic clay tokens, the precursor to Proto-cuneiform, were found in the Ubaid levels of the site. Eighteen superimposed mudbrick temples at the site underlie the unfinished ziggurat of Amar-Sin (c. 2047–2039 BC). Levels XIX to VI were from the Ubaid period and Levels V to I were dated to the Uruk period. Significant habitation was found from the Uruk period with &quot;non-secular&quot; buildings being found in soundings. Uruk finds included decorative terracotta cones topped with copper, copper nails topped with gold, a pair of basalt stone lion statues, columns several meters in diameter coated with cones and gypsum, and extensive Uruk period pottery. Occupation increased in the Early Dynastic period with a monumental 100 meter by 100 meter palace being constructed. An inscription of Elulu, a ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur (), was found at Eridu. On a statue of the Early Dynastic ruler of Lagash named Entemena (), it reads, &quot;he built Ab-zupasira for Enki, king of Eridu ...&quot;,

Eridu was active during the Third Dynasty of Ur (22nd to 21st century BC) and royal building activity is known from inscribed bricks notably those of Ur-Nammu from his ziggurat marked &quot;Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, the one who built the temple of the god Enki in Eridu.&quot; Three Third Dynasty rulers designated Year Names based on the appointment of an &quot;en(tu)&quot;-priestess (high priestess) of the temple of Enki in Eridu, the highest religious office in the land at that time. In each the first two cases it was also used as the succeeding Year Name.

*Sulgi Year 28 - &quot;Year the szita-priest-who-intercedes-for-Szulgi, the son of Szulgi, the strong man, the king of Ur, the king of the four corners of the universe, was installed as en-priest of Enki in Eridu&quot;
*Amar-Sin Year 8 - &quot;Year (Ennune-kiag-Amar-Sin) Ennune-the beloved (of Amar-Sin, was installed as en-priestess of Enki in Eridu)&quot;
*Ibbi-Sin Year 11 - &quot;Year the szita-priest who prays piously for Ibbi-Sin was chosen by means of the omens as en-priest of Enki in Eridu&quot;
After the fall of Ur III the site was occupied and active during the Isin-Larsa period (early 2nd Millennium BC) as evidenced by a Year Name of Nur-Adad, ruler of Larsa &quot;Year the temple of Enki in Eridu was built&quot; and prior texts of Isin rulers Ishbi-Erra and  Ishme-Dagan showing control over Eridu. Inscribed construction bricks of Nur-Adad have also been found at Eridu. This continued in the Old Babylonian period with Hammurabi stating in his 33rd Year Name &quot;Year Hammu-rabi the king dug the canal (called) &#x27;Hammu-rabi is abundance to the people&#x27;, the beloved of An and Enlil, established the everlasting waters of plentifulness for Nippur, Eridu, Ur, Larsa, Uruk and Isin, restored Sumer and Akkad which had been scattered, overthrew in battle the army of Mari and Malgium and caused Mari and its territory and the various cities of Subartu to dwell under his authority in friendship&quot;
In an inscription of Kurigalzu I (), a ruler of the Kassite dynasty one of his epitaphs is &quot;[he one who ke]eps the sanctuary in Eridu in order&quot;.

An inscription of the Second Sealand Dynastic ruler Simbar-shipak (c. 1021–1004 BCE) mentions a priest of Eridu.

The Neo-Assyrian emperor Sargon II (722–705 BCE) awarded &quot;andurāru&quot;-status (described as &quot;a periodic reinstatement of goods and persons, alienated because of want, to their original status&quot;) to Eridu.

The Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) built at Eridu as evidenced by inscribed bricks found there.

===Mythology===
In some, but not all, versions of the Sumerian King List, Eridu is the first of five cities where kingship was received before a flood came over the land. The list mentions two rulers of Eridu from the Early Dynastic period, Alulim and Alalngar.
The bright star Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and represented the city of Eridu in the &quot;Three Stars Each&quot; Babylonian star catalogues and later around 1100 BC on the MUL.APIN tablets. Canopus was called MUL.NUNKI by the Babylonians, which translates as &quot;star of the city of Eridu&quot;. From most southern city of Mesopotamia, Eridu, there is a good view to the south, so that about 6000 years ago due to the precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis the first rising of the star Canopus in Mesopotamia could be observed only from there at the southern meridian at midnight. In the city of Ur this was the case only 60 years later.

In the flood myth tablet found in Ur, how Eridu and Alulim were chosen by gods as first city and first priest-king is described in more detail. The following is the English translation of the tablet:

Adapa, a man of Eridu, is depicted as an early culture hero. Although earlier tradition, Me-Turan/Tell-Haddad tablet, describes Adapa as postdiluvian ruler of Eridu, in late tradition, Adapa came to be viewed as Alulim’s vizier, and he was considered to have brought civilization to the city as the sage of King Alulim.
In Sumerian mythology, Eridu was the home of the Abzu temple of the god Enki, the Sumerian counterpart of the Akkadian god Ea, god of deep waters, wisdom and magic. Like all the Sumerian and Babylonian gods, Enki/Ea began as a local god who, according to the later cosmology, came to share the rule of the cosmos with Anu and Enlil. His kingdom was the sweet waters that lay below earth (Sumerian &quot;ab&quot;=water; &quot;zu&quot;=far).
The stories of Inanna, goddess of Uruk, describe how she had to go to Eridu in order to receive the gifts of civilization. At first Enki, the god of Eridu, attempted to retrieve these sources of his power but later willingly accepted that Uruk now was the centre of the land.
The fall of early Mesopotamia cities and empires was typically believed to be the result of falling out of favor with the gods. A genre called City Laments developed during the Isin-Larsa period, of which the Lament for Ur is the most famous. These laments had a number of sections (kirugu) of which only fragments have been recovered. The Lament for Eridu describes the fall of that city.

<text>The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness was a benefit concert held on Easter Monday, 20 April 1992, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, for an audience of 72,000. The concert was produced for television by Ray Burdis, directed by David Mallet and broadcast live on television and radio to 76 countries around the world, with an audience of up to one billion. The concert was a tribute to Queen&#x27;s lead vocalist, Freddie Mercury, who died of an AIDS-related illness on 24 November 1991. 

The show marked bassist John Deacon&#x27;s final full-length concert with Queen (save a short live appearance with Brian May, Roger Taylor and Elton John in 1997). The profits from the concert were used to launch the Mercury Phoenix Trust, an AIDS charity organization.

== History ==
Following Freddie Mercury&#x27;s death on 24 November 1991 from AIDS, the remaining members of Queen (John Deacon, Brian May and Roger Taylor) came together with their manager, Jim Beach, to organise a concert to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury (and to raise money for AIDS research and spread awareness about the disease). In the 1992 BRIT Awards ceremony, May and Taylor announced plans for the concert. When tickets finally went on sale, all 72,000 tickets sold out in just three hours, even though no performers were announced apart from the remaining members of Queen.

== Concert ==

The concert opened with a message from the three remaining members of Queen in tribute to Mercury. The music then commenced with short sets from artists that were influenced by the music of Queen, including Metallica, Extreme (playing a Queen medley), Def Leppard (who brought Brian May onstage for a version of &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;), and Guns N&#x27; Roses. Between bands, several video clips honouring Freddie Mercury were shown while roadies changed the stage for the following act&#x27;s performance. Elizabeth Taylor then gave an AIDS prevention speech, which was followed by a compilation of Mercury&#x27;s various interactions with audiences.

The second half of the concert featured the three remaining Queen members – John Deacon (on bass), Brian May (on guitar) and Roger Taylor (on drums) – along with guest singers and guitarists, including Elton John, Roger Daltrey (of The Who), Tony Iommi (of Black Sabbath), Ian Hunter, David Bowie, Mick Ronson, James Hetfield (of Metallica), George Michael, Seal, Paul Young, Annie Lennox, Lisa Stansfield, Robert Plant (of Led Zeppelin), Joe Elliott and Phil Collen (of Def Leppard), Axl Rose and Slash (of Guns N&#x27; Roses), Liza Minnelli, and others. Via satellite from Sacramento, California, U2 dedicated a live performance of &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; to Mercury.

== Home releases ==

The concert was originally released in VHS form (usually in two-tape releases worldwide), but due to time limitations, &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;More Than Words&quot; by Extreme, &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot; by Def Leppard, Spinal Tap&#x27;s &quot;The Majesty of Rock&quot;, U2&#x27;s &quot;Until The End of the World&quot;, Mango Groove&#x27;s &quot;Special Star&quot; and Robert Plant&#x27;s version of &quot;Innuendo&quot; were removed from the original release. The US release also omitted Bob Geldof&#x27;s performance of &quot;Too Late God&quot;, and Zucchero&#x27;s performance of &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot;.

In April 2002, for the 10th anniversary of the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the second half of the concert (featuring the performances by the surviving members of Queen) was released on DVD and entered the UK charts at No. 1. &quot;Innuendo&quot; was not included on the DVD, at Plant&#x27;s request. In addition, the original 4:3 footage had been cropped down to widescreen. The DVD was certified Gold in Poland.

On 24 June 2013, Queen announced on their Facebook page that a new remastered version of the concert would be released in late 2013 on DVD and Blu-ray. The DVD and Blu-ray was released on 2 September 2013. Like the earlier VHS release, this version excludes Extreme&#x27;s &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;More Than Words&quot;, Def Leppard&#x27;s &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot;, performance by Spinal Tap, U2 and Mango Groove from the opening acts segment, and Plant&#x27;s &quot;Innuendo&quot; from the Queen+ segment. It was certified Platinum in the UK.

Clips of rehearsals and of Metallica&#x27;s set (as well as James Hetfield&#x27;s performance of &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; with Queen and Tony Iommi) were featured in the 1992 documentary &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot;.

In May 2020, Queen announced that they would be premiering the concert on YouTube to raise money for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. It was available for 48 hours. In April 2022, Queen streamed the concert again to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the concert as well as the Mercury Phoenix Trust.

Several songs from the concert have also been released in audio-only format: 
*Metallica&#x27;s three-song performance was made into a UK tour edition single for &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, entitled &quot;Live at Wembley Stadium&quot; and released in Europe just one week after the concert, on 27 April 1992. The band later released in 2021 a re-mixed and re-mastered version of their performance as well as a rendition of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; with James Hetfield and Tony Iommi on the remastered box set of their album Metallica. 
*Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; performance of &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; was released in May 1992 as a double A-side, with the band&#x27;s studio recording of the song; it was also featured on their album &quot;Live Era &#x27;87–&#x27;93&quot;. The single entered the UK charts at No. 2. 
*Def Leppard released their version of &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; (with May) from the concert, as a B-side to their single &quot;Tonight&quot; in April 1993.
*An EP of the George Michael performances with Queen was released as &quot;Five Live&quot; in April 1993. It entered the UK singles chart at No. 1. 
*the Queen + Ian Hunter, Mick Ronson, David Bowie and Def Leppard performance of the song &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; was released on the Mick Ronson album &#x27;Heaven and Hull&#x27;.
*the Queen + David Bowie performances of the songs &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; and Heroes were released on the soundtrack album to the 2018 film &quot;Beside Bowie: The Mick Ronson Story&quot;.

<text>Grace Patricia Kelly (November 12, 1929 – September 14, 1982), also known as Grace of Monaco, was an American actress and Princess of Monaco as the wife of Prince Rainier III from their marriage on April 18, 1956, until her death in 1982. Prior to her marriage, she achieved stardom in several significant Hollywood films in the early to mid-1950s. She received an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, and was ranked 13th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 25 Greatest Female Stars list.

Kelly was born into a prominent Catholic family in Philadelphia. After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1949, she began appearing in New York City theatrical productions and television broadcasts. Kelly made her film debut in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; (1951) and gained stardom from her roles in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s western film &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), and John Ford&#x27;s adventure-romance &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953), the latter of which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the drama &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954). Other notable works include the war film &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (1954), the romantic comedy &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers: &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955).

Kelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry Rainier and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. Grace and Rainier had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess Stéphanie. Princess Grace&#x27;s charity work focused on young children and the arts. In 1964, she established the Princess Grace Foundation to support local artisans. Her organization for children&#x27;s rights, AMADE Mondiale, gained consultive status within UNICEF and UNESCO. Her final film role was narrating &quot;The Children of Theatre Street&quot; (1977), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

She died at the age of 52 at Monaco Hospital, from injuries sustained in a car crash. Her son, Prince Albert, helped establish the Princess Grace Awards in 1984 to recognize emerging performers in film, theatre, and dance.

== Early life and family ==

Grace Patricia Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an affluent and influential family. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., was born to Irish immigrants; he won three Olympic gold medals for sculling. He owned a successful brickwork contracting company that was well known on the East Coast. As the Democratic Party nominee in the 1935 election for mayor of Philadelphia, he lost by the closest margin in the city&#x27;s history. In later years, he served on the Fairmount Park Commission and, during World War II, was appointed by President Roosevelt as National Director of Physical Fitness. His brother Walter C. Kelly was a vaudeville star, who also made films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, and another brother named George was a Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist, screenwriter, and director. He built the family home at 3901 Henry Ave in the East Falls, Philadelphia neighborhood. The Kellys&#x27; former family home went up for sale for $1 million in June 2016. It wound up selling in September 2016 for $775,000.

Kelly&#x27;s mother, Margaret Majer, was of German ancestry. Margaret had taught physical education at the University of Pennsylvania and had been the first woman to coach women&#x27;s athletics at Penn. She also modeled for a time in her youth. After marrying John Kelly in 1924, Margaret focused on being a homemaker until all her children were of school age, following which she began actively participating in various civic organizations. Patrilineally, Margaret descended from Prof. (1741–1821) from Ludwigsburg, who worked as a political scientist, jurist and theologian, and was elected five times Rector of the University of Tübingen. Through him, Grace was descended from the Stauffenberg family and many other minor German noble families, such as von Plieningen, von Münchingen, von Ow, von Bettendorf, von Nippenburg, and von Roth.

Kelly had two older siblings, Margaret and John Jr., and a younger sister, Elizabeth. The children were raised in the Catholic faith, and Grace continued to practice the faith until her death, with Rita Gam describing her as a &quot;deeply religious person&quot;. Kelly grew up in a small, close-knit Catholic community. She was baptized and received her elementary education in the parish of Saint Bridget&#x27;s in East Falls. Founded in 1853 by Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget&#x27;s was a relatively young parish, with families very familiar with one another. While attending Ravenhill Academy, a Catholic girls&#x27; school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed the Animals&quot;, a play produced in East Falls by the Old Academy Players.

In May 1947, Kelly graduated from Stevens School, a private institution in nearby Chestnut Hill, where she participated in drama and dance programs. Her graduation yearbook listed her favorite actress as Ingrid Bergman and her favorite actor as Joseph Cotten. Written in the &quot;Stevens&#x27; Prophecy&quot; section was &quot;Miss Grace P. Kelly – a famous star of stage and screen&quot;. Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947. Despite her parents&#x27; initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. Her father was particularly displeased with her decision, as he viewed acting as &quot;a slim cut above streetwalker&quot; at the time. In 1947, Kelly signed with the Walter Thornton Model Agency gracing the covers of magazines.

In 1954, Kelly dated and was engaged to Oleg Cassini after his divorce from Gene Tierney.

== Career ==

=== 1949–1950: Beginnings ===
To start her career, she auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly&#x27;s &quot;The Torch-Bearers&quot; (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions department, and was admitted through George&#x27;s influence. Kelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot;, alongside Raymond Massey. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. Her uncle continued to advise and mentor Kelly throughout her acting career.

At her father&#x27;s insistence, she lived at the Barbizon Hotel for Women in Manhattan. She was hired as a model by the John Robert Powers agency, where some of her first modeling jobs were doing commercials for bug spray and cigarettes. Kelly was reportedly &quot;fond of dancing to Hawaiian music down the hallways of the Barbizon, and given to shocking her fellow residents by performing topless&quot;. She later wrote that she had &quot;wonderful memories of the three years I spent at the Barbizon&quot;.

Television producer Delbert Mann cast Kelly as the lead in an adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel &quot;Bethel Merriday&quot;; this was her first of nearly sixty live television programs. She was mentioned in &quot;Theatre World&quot; magazine as &quot;[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950&quot;. Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: &quot;The Father&quot;, &quot;The Rockingham Tea Set&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, &quot;The Mirror of Delusion&quot;, &quot;Episode&quot; (for Somerset Maugham&#x27;s tele-serial), among others.

Impressed by her work in &quot;The Father&quot;, Henry Hathaway, director of the Twentieth Century-Fox film &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; (1951), offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role opposite Paul Douglas, Richard Basehart, and Barbara Bel Geddes, as a young woman contemplating divorce. Douglas commented: &quot;In two senses, she did not have a bad side – you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental, cooperative people in the business.&quot; Following the release of the film, the &quot;Grace Kelly Fan Club&quot; was established, gaining popularity across the country with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as &quot;terrifically amusing&quot;.

Kelly was noticed during a visit to the set of &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; by Gary Cooper. However, Kelly&#x27;s performance in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; went largely unnoticed by critics and did not contribute to her film career&#x27;s momentum. She continued her work in the theater and on television, although she lacked &quot;vocal horsepower&quot;, and it was thought she would likely not have had a lengthy stage career.

=== 1951–1953: Early films and breakthrough ===

Kelly was performing at Colorado&#x27;s Elitch Theatre when producer Stanley Kramer offered her a role co-starring opposite Cooper in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), a Western filmed in Columbia, California. She accepted the role, and the film was shot in the late summer and early fall of 1951 over a 28-day shooting schedule in hot weather conditions. She was cast as a &quot;young Quaker bride to Gary Cooper&#x27;s stoic marshal&quot;, and wore a &quot;suitably demure vaguely Victorian dress&quot;. &quot;High Noon&quot; garnered four Academy Awards, and has since been ranked by some reviewers among the best films of all time.

Biographer H. Haughland stated: &quot;Miss Kelly&#x27;s acting did not excite the critics, or live up to her own expectations.&quot; Some critics scoffed at the conclusion of the film in which Cooper&#x27;s character has to be saved by Kelly&#x27;s. One critic argued that her pacifist character, killing a man who is about to shoot her husband, was cold and abstract. Alfred Hitchcock described her performance as &quot;rather mousey&quot;, and stated that it lacked animation. He said that it was only in her later films that she &quot;really blossomed&quot; and showed her quality.
After filming &quot;High Noon&quot;, Kelly returned to New York City and took private acting lessons, wanting to be taken seriously as an actress. She performed in a few dramas in the theater, and in TV serials. She appeared in several television plays, and screen-tested for the film &quot;Taxi&quot; in the spring of 1952. Director John Ford noticed Kelly in the screen test, and his studio flew her out to Los Angeles to audition in September 1952. Ford said that Kelly showed &quot;breeding, quality, and class&quot;. She was given the role, along with a seven-year contract at the relatively low salary of $850 a week (). Kelly signed the deal under two conditions: first, that one out of every two years, she had time off to work in the theatre; and second, that she be able to live in New York City at her residence in Manhattan House, at 200 E. 66th Street, now a landmark.

In November 1952, Kelly and the cast arrived in Nairobi to begin the production of the film &quot;Mogambo&quot;, replacing Gene Tierney, who dropped out at the last minute due to personal issues. Kelly later told Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, &quot;&quot;Mogambo&quot; had three things that interested me: John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa, with expenses paid. If &quot;Mogambo&quot; had been made in Arizona, I wouldn&#x27;t have done it.&quot; Kelly played Linda Nordley, a contemplative English wife with a romantic interest in Clark Gable&#x27;s character. Filming took place over the course of three months. The costumes were designed by Helen Rose. A break in the filming schedule afforded her and &quot;Mogambo&quot; co-star Ava Gardner a visit to Rome. The film was released in 1953, and had a successful run at the box office. Kelly won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

=== 1954–1956: Critical acclaim and final films ===

After the success of &quot;Mogambo&quot;, Kelly starred in the television play &quot;The Way of an Eagle&quot; with Jean-Pierre Aumont, before being cast in the film adaptation of Frederick Knott&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, opposite Ray Milland and Robert Cummings. Kelly played the role of the wealthy wife of a retired professional tennis player. Alfred Hitchcock became one of Kelly&#x27;s mentors during the last years of her career. She was subsequently lent by MGM to work in several Hitchcock films, which would become some of her most critically acclaimed and recognized work. Kelly began filming scenes for her next film, &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot;, in early 1954, with William Holden, for Paramount Pictures. The story, based on the novel by James Michener, is about American Navy jet fighters stationed to fight in Asia. Kelly played the role of Holden&#x27;s wife. Edith Head, with whom she had established a friendly relationship, did her costumes.

Kelly unhesitatingly turned down the opportunity to star alongside Marlon Brando in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954). Eva Marie Saint, who replaced her, went on to win an Academy Award for the role. Instead, Kelly played the role of Lisa Fremont in &quot;Rear Window&quot;. Kelly stated, &quot;All through the making of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, he (Hitchcock) sat and talked to me about &quot;Rear Window&quot; all the time, even before we had discussed my being in it.&quot; Kelly&#x27;s co-star, James Stewart, was highly enthusiastic about working with her. The role of Lisa Fremont, a wealthy Manhattan socialite and fashion model who &quot;never wore the same dress twice,&quot; was unlike any of the previous women she had played. This marked her first performance as an independent career woman. In line with their previous collaborations, Hitchcock provided the camera with a slow-sequenced silhouette of Kelly, along with close-ups of the two stars kissing, finally lingering closely on her profile. Hitchcock brought her elegance to the foreground by changing her dresses many times, including: &quot;glamorous evening short dresses, a sheer negligee over a sleek nightgown, a full-skirted floral dress, and a casual pair of jeans&quot;. Upon the film&#x27;s opening in October 1954, Kelly was again praised. &quot;Variety&quot;″s film critic remarked on the casting, commenting on the &quot;earthy quality to the relationship between Stewart and Miss Kelly&quot;, as &quot;both do a fine job of the picture&#x27;s acting demands&quot;.

Kelly played the role of Bing Crosby&#x27;s long-suffering wife, Georgie Elgin, in &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954), after a pregnant Jennifer Jones bowed out. Already familiar with the play, Kelly was highly interested in the part. To do it, MGM once again would have to lend Kelly to Paramount Pictures. Kelly was adamant, and threatened the studio, saying that if they did not allow her to do the film she would pack her bags and leave for New York for good. MGM eventually relented. Kelly also negotiated a more lucrative contract in light of her recent success. In the film, Kelly played the wife of a washed-up, alcoholic singer, played by Crosby. Her character becomes torn emotionally between her two lovers, played by Crosby and William Holden. She was again dressed by Edith Head to suit her role in the film, initially appearing in fashionable dresses, shifting to ordinary-looking cardigans toward the end of the film.

As a result of her performance in &quot;The Country Girl&quot;, Kelly won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her acceptance speech was brief: &quot;The thrill of this moment keeps me from saying what I really feel. I can only say thank you with all my heart to all who made this possible for me. Thank you.&quot; Her main competitor was Judy Garland for her performance in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. After receiving the Oscar nomination, Kelly won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best actress for her performances in her three big movie roles of 1954: &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot;, and &quot;The Country Girl&quot;. At the Golden Globe Awards in 1955, Kelly won the Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her performance in &quot;The Country Girl&quot; as &quot;excellent&quot;, and &quot;Rear Window&quot; got her marquee credits on par with, and beyond, those of Stewart and Hitchcock.

In April 1954, Kelly flew to Colombia for a 10-day shoot on her next project, &quot;Green Fire&quot;, with Stewart Granger. She played Catherine Knowland, a coffee plantation owner. Kelly told Hedda Hopper, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t pleasant. We worked at a pathetic village – miserable huts and dirty. Part of the crew got shipwrecked ... It was awful.&quot; After the consecutive filming of &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;Toko-Ri&quot;, &quot;Country Girl&quot;, and &quot;Green Fire&quot;, Kelly flew to the French Riviera to work on her third, and last, film for Hitchcock, &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;. Loaned to Paramount for the fifth time, Kelly played the role of a temptress who wears &quot;luxurious and alluring clothes&quot;, while Cary Grant played the role of a former cat burglar, then looking to catch a thief who is imitating him. Kelly and Grant developed a mutual bond and admiration for each other. Years later, when asked to name his all-time favorite actress, Grant replied: &quot;Well, with all due respect to dear Ingrid Bergman, I much preferred Grace. She had serenity.&quot;

In 1956, Kelly resided in a home rented from Bill Lear in the Pacific Palisades, California for the duration of her filming. She portrayed Princess Alexandra in the film &quot;The Swan&quot;, directed by Charles Vidor, opposite Alec Guinness and Louis Jourdan. Her final role was in Charles Walters&#x27;s musical film &quot;High Society&quot;, a re-make of MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). She portrayed Tracy Lord, opposite Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm in the other leads. When it was released in July 1956. &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones,&quot; and that it was &quot;possibly her most relaxed performance.&quot;

== Marriage ==

Kelly headed the U.S. delegation at the Cannes Film Festival in April 1955. While there, she was invited to participate in a photo session with Prince Rainier III, the sovereign of the Principality of Monaco, at the Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco. After a series of delays and complications, she met him at the palace on May 6, 1955. 
After a year-long courtship described as containing &quot;a good deal of rational appraisal on both sides,&quot; they married on April 19, 1956.

The Napoleonic Code of Monaco and the laws of the Catholic Church necessitated two ceremonies, civil and religious. The 16-minute civil ceremony took place in the Palace Throne Room of Monaco on April 18, 1956, and a reception later in the day was attended by 3,000 Monégasque citizens. The 142 official titles that she acquired in the union (counterparts of her husband&#x27;s) were formally recited. The church ceremony took place the following day at Monaco&#x27;s Saint Nicholas Cathedral, presided over by Bishop Gilles Barthe. The wedding was estimated to have been watched by over 30 million viewers on television, and was described by biographer Robert Lacey in 2010 as &quot;the first modern event to generate media overkill&quot;. Her wedding dress, designed by MGM&#x27;s Helen Rose, was worked on for 6 weeks by three dozen dress makers. The couple left that night for their seven-week Mediterranean honeymoon cruise on the prince&#x27;s yacht.

== Princess of Monaco ==
Princess Grace gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Princess Caroline, on January 23, 1957. Their next child and the heir to the throne, Prince Albert, was born on March 14, 1958. Their youngest, Princess Stéphanie, was born on February 1, 1965.

During her marriage, Grace discontinued her acting career. Instead, she performed her daily duties as princess and became involved in philanthropic work. As princess consort, she became the President of the Red Cross of Monaco (with her sister Peggy Davis and sister-in-law Princess Antoinette as the Vice-Presidents) and the Patron of Rainbow Coalition Children, an orphanage which was run by former dancer, singer and actress Josephine Baker. She hosted an annual Christmas celebration with presents for orphaned children in Monaco. The Princess also served as president of the Garden Club of Monaco, and president of the organizing committee of the International Arts Foundation. Grace retained her link to America by her dual U.S. and Monégasque citizenship.

Grace and her husband visited Ireland on three occasions, and in 1976 she purchased her family&#x27;s ancestral homestead in Drumilra, near Newport, County Mayo.

Grace founded AMADE Mondiale, a Monaco-based, non-profit organization which is recognized by the UN, after she witnessed the plight of Vietnamese children in 1963. According to UNESCO&#x27;s website, AMADE promotes and protects the &quot;moral and physical integrity&quot; and the &quot;spiritual well-being of children throughout the world, without distinction of race, nationality or religion, and in a spirit of complete political independence.&quot; The organization currently has cooperative branches across Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. They retain consultive status with UNICEF, UNESCO, and U.N. Economic &amp; Social Council, alongside participative status with The Council of Europe.

Princess Grace was active in improving the arts institutions of Monaco, forming the Princess Grace Foundation in 1964 to support local artisans. In 1965, she accepted the invitation to be an honorary member of La Leche League, a worldwide mother-to-mother support group which focuses on mothering through breastfeeding. She was a speaker at their 1971 conference in Chicago, addressing 1,400 mothers, 1,600 fathers and babies. Grace was a known advocate of breastfeeding, and successfully fed her three children. In 1975, Grace helped found the Princess Grace Academy, the resident school of the Monte Carlo Ballet. She later advocated to preserve the Belle Époque-era architecture of the principality. Grace hosted a yearly American Week in Monaco, where guests would play baseball and eat ice cream. The palace also celebrated American Thanksgiving annually.

Alfred Hitchcock offered Princess Grace the lead in his film &quot;Marnie&quot; in 1962. She was eager, but public outcry in Monaco against her involvement in a film where she would play a kleptomaniac made her reconsider and ultimately reject the project. Director Herbert Ross tried to interest her in a part in his film &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), but Rainier dismissed the idea. Later that year, she returned to the arts in a series of poetry readings on stage and narration of the documentary &quot;The Children of Theatre Street&quot;. She also narrated ABC&#x27;s made-for-television film &quot;The Poppy Is Also a Flower&quot; (1966).

Grace joined the board of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation in 1976, becoming one of its first female members. In 1980, she published &quot;My Book of Flowers&quot; with Gwen Robyns, detailing her sense of floral aesthetics, symbolism, and flower pressing. Grace and Rainier worked together on a 33-minute independent film titled &quot;Rearranged&quot; in 1979, which received interest from ABC TV executives in 1982 after its premiere in Monaco, on the condition that it be extended to an hour. Before more scenes could be shot, Grace died and the film was never released, nor was it publicly shown again.

In the early 1980s, Grace collaborated with Springmaid Company, the now-defunct bed linen brand. The collaboration was titled &quot;GPK&quot; after the initials of her maiden name and features bed linens, tablecloths, napkins, placemats, and others. Both collaborated after Neil Mandell, a newly hired Springmaid stylist, found the designs Grace made in a &quot;People&quot; magazine article on the exhibition in a Paris Gallery. Princess Grace received more than $1 million in royalties, which she donated to her favorite charities.

==Death and funeral==
On September 13, 1982, Grace suffered a mild cerebral hemorrhage while driving back to Monaco from her country home in Roc Agel. As a result, she lost control of her 1972 Rover P6 3500 and drove off the steep, winding road and down the mountainside. Her daughter Stéphanie, who was in the passenger seat, unsuccessfully tried to regain control of the car.

The Princess was taken to the Monaco Hospital (later named the Princess Grace Hospital Centre) with injuries to the brain and thorax and a fractured femur. Initially that afternoon, she was officially diagnosed with the cerebral hemorrhage and was said to be able to make a full recovery before a second, more severe, hemorrhage struck while at the hospital. With no reasonable chance of recovery, she died the following night at 10:55 p.m. after Rainier decided to turn off her life support.

Stéphanie suffered a light concussion and a hairline fracture of a cervical vertebra, and was unable to attend her mother&#x27;s funeral.

Princess Grace&#x27;s funeral was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate in Monaco-Ville, on September 18, 1982. After a Requiem Mass, she was buried in the Grimaldi family vault. Over 400 people attended, including Cary Grant, Nancy Reagan, Danielle Mitterrand, Empress Farah of Iran, and Diana, Princess of Wales.

Rainier, who did not remarry, was buried alongside her after his death in 2005.

== Legacy ==

Kelly left a lasting legacy as a theater artist, television actress, and iconic Hollywood film star. Kelly has been cited as one of the &quot;classic Hitchcock blondes&quot;, and as one of the most elegant women in cinematic and world history. One author describes her as the &quot;elegant glamour girl of the screen&quot;. In 1999, Kelly was listed by Joan McIver as one of &quot;30 Irish-American Women Who Changed Our World.&quot; In a 2019 edition of the &quot;American Journal of Irish Studies&quot;, she was described as &quot;Irish America&#x27;s poster girl&quot; and &quot;an understated Irish-American icon.&quot; Katherine Boyle of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that Kelly &quot;had dramatic effects on views of Irish Catholic immigrants in the 1950s. Indeed, America seemed to pardon her tainted blood, tuning into her televised nuptial Mass in droves despite aversion to the religious spectacle.&quot;

Kelly appeared on the cover of the January 31, 1955, issue of the weekly magazine &quot;Time&quot;. The magazine hailed her as the top movie star who brought about &quot;a startling change from the run of smoky film sirens and bumptious cuties&quot;. She was described as the &quot;Girl in White Gloves&quot; because she wore &quot;prim and noticeable white gloves&quot;, and journalists often called her the &quot;lady&quot; or &quot;Miss Kelly&quot; for this reason. In appreciation of her work with Hitchcock in three of his films, Kelly later wrote a foreword to the book &quot;The Art of Alfred Hitchcock&quot; by Donald Spoto. Spoto also has written &quot;High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly&quot;, a biography published 25 years after her death.

In 1982, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA was established by her husband to continue the work she had done anonymously during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America. Incorporated in 1982, PGF-USA is headquartered in New York City and is a tax-exempt, non-profit, publicly supported organization. The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 800 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $15 million to date. The foundation also says it &quot;holds the exclusive rights and facilitates the licensing of her name and likeness throughout the world.&quot; Her daughter Princess Caroline took over as president for both the Foundation and AMADE Mondiale after her death, with Prince Albert as vice president. The original Monaco branch of her foundation, named Fondation Princesse Grace, remains active and continues to provide direct aid to students and children within the Monaco and France regions.

In 1955, Kelly was photographed by Howell Conant in Jamaica. He photographed her without makeup in a naturalistic setting, a departure from the traditional portrayal of actresses. The resulting photographs were published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, with a celebrated photo of her rising from the water with wet hair making the cover. Following Grace&#x27;s marriage, Conant was the unofficial photographer to the House of Grimaldi and extensively photographed her, Rainier, and their three children. In 1992, Conant published &quot;Grace&quot;, a book of photographs that he took during her 26-year tenure as Princess of Monaco. Princess Grace has been depicted by many pop artists, including Andy Warhol and James Gill. Warhol made a portrait of her for the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia as a limited edition silkscreen in 1984.

In 2012, Grace&#x27;s childhood home was made a Pennsylvania historic landmark, and a historical marker was placed on the site. The house, located at 3901 Henry Avenue in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, was built by her father John B. Kelly Sr. in 1929. Grace lived in the house until 1950, and Prince Rainier III proposed to her there in 1955. The Kelly family sold the property in 1974. Prince Albert of Monaco purchased the property, speculating that the home would be used either as museum space or as offices for the Princess Grace Foundation.

=== Fashion and style ===

While pregnant with her daughter Caroline in 1956, Princess Grace was frequently photographed clutching a distinctive leather handbag manufactured by Hermès. The purse, or Sac à dépêches, was likely a shield to prevent her pregnant abdomen from being exposed to the prying eyes of the paparazzi. The photographs, however, popularized the purse and became so closely associated with the fashion icon that it would thereafter be known as the Kelly bag.

Grace was inaugurated into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1960 and in 1955, the Custom Tailored Guild of America listed her as the &quot;Best-Tailored Woman&quot;. Numerous exhibitions have been held of Kelly&#x27;s life and clothing. The Philadelphia Museum of Art presented her wedding dress in a 2006 exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of her marriage, and a retrospective of her wardrobe was held at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum in 2010. The V&amp;A exhibition continued in Australia at the Bendigo Art Gallery in 2012. This famous dress, seen around the world, took thirty five tailors six weeks to complete. An exhibition of her life as Princess of Monaco was held at the Ekaterina Cultural Foundation in Moscow in 2008 in conjunction with Monaco&#x27;s Grimaldi Forum. In 2009, a plaque was placed on the &quot;Rodeo Drive Walk of Style&quot; in recognition of her contributions to style and fashion.

After her death, Grace&#x27;s legacy as a fashion icon lived on. Modern designers, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Zac Posen, have cited her as a fashion inspiration. During her lifetime, she was known for introducing the &quot;fresh faced&quot; look, one that involved bright skin and natural beauty with little makeup. Her fashion legacy was even commemorated at the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, where an exhibit titled, &quot;Grace Kelly: Style Icon&quot; paid tribute to her impact on the world of fashion. The exhibit included 50 of her legendary ensembles. She is remembered for her &quot;college-girl&quot; everyday fashion, defined by her pulled-together yet simple look. In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; included her on the list &quot;10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous&quot;.

The look and style of TV series &quot;Mad Men&quot;″s Betty Draper is influenced by Grace Kelly, and she is frequently complimented in the show by other characters for resembling her. American actress Elle Fanning attended 78th Golden Globe Awards with mint-green Gucci gown designed by Alessandro Michele that was inspired by Grace Kelly&#x27;s gown worn at the 27th Academy Awards. According to &quot;Vogue&quot;, American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, who attended 2021 Met Gala, wore a red Oscar de la Renta gown inspired by Kelly&#x27;s gown worn in the 1955 film &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;. The gown was designed by Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim.

On July 15, 2021, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA launched &quot;Grace de Monaco&quot;, a luxury brand. The brand had been planned since 2019. On the same day, &quot;Grace de Monaco&quot; launched their first fragrance named &quot;Promenade sur le Rocher&quot;. The product was named after the official residence of the princely family for over seven centuries.

=== Monaco and elsewhere ===

A rose garden in Monaco&#x27;s Fontvieille district is dedicated to the memory of Kelly. It was opened in 1984 by Rainier. A hybrid tea rose, named Rosa &#x27;Princesse de Monaco&#x27;, was named after her. She is commemorated in a statue by Kees Verkade in the garden, which features 4,000 roses. Prince Rainier also established the Princess Grace Irish Library in her memory, containing her personal collection of over 9,000 books and sheet music. Avenue Princesse Grace in Monaco, &quot;the most expensive street in the world&quot;, is named for her, as is Boulevard Princesse Grâce de Monaco in Nice, France.

In 2007, Monaco hosted an international-scale exhibition in honor of Princess Grace, named &quot;The Grace Kelly Years, Princess of Monaco&quot;, containing letters, personal belongings, fashion accessories, and sound recordings on display. Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo was established in 1985, in accordance to the wishes of Princess Grace, with its first performance taking place on December 21. In 1993, Kelly appeared on a U.S. postage stamp, released in conjunction with a Monaco postage stamp featuring her image on the same day. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Kelly&#x27;s death, €2 commemorative coins were issued on July 1, 2007, with the &quot;national&quot; side bearing the image of her. In 2019, the government of Monaco released three designs of commemorative postage stamps, each depicting a different phase of her life, to mark the 90th anniversary of her birth.

In 2003, the Henley Royal Regatta renamed the Women&#x27;s Quadruple Sculls the &quot;Princess Grace Challenge Cup&quot;. The Henley Stewards invited her to present the prizes at the 1981 regatta, expiating the ill will from her father&#x27;s falling foul of its amateurism rules in 1920. Prince Albert presented the prizes at the 2004 regatta. Various hotels, including Hotel Bel-Air, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel de la Paix, the InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel, and the Shelbourne Hotel established suites inspired by her life and likeness. A yacht in Monaco, &quot;M/Y Grace&quot;, was named after her.

Cheryl Ladd portrayed Kelly in the made-for-TV film &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; in 1983. The film received mixed reviews. Nicole Kidman portrayed Kelly in &quot;Grace of Monaco&quot; (2014), directed by Olivier Dahan. Reaction to the film was largely negative; many people, including the princely family of Monaco, felt it was overly dramatic, had historical errors, and lacked depth.

In November 2022, the Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) issued silver and gold coins to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Grace Kelly&#x27;s death, with the consent of Prince Albert II.

<text>Gwyneth Kate Paltrow ( ; born September 27, 1972) is an American actress and businesswoman. The daughter of filmmaker Bruce Paltrow and actress Blythe Danner, she established herself as a leading lady appearing in mainly mid-budget and period films during the 1990s and early 2000s, before transitioning to blockbusters and franchises. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Paltrow gained notice for her early work in films such as &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (1998), and &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; (1998). She garnered wider acclaim for her role as Viola de Lesseps in the historical romance &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998) which earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. This was followed by roles in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), and &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001). She made her West End debut in the David Auburn play &quot;Proof&quot; (2003) earning a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress nomination, and reprised the role in the 2005 film of the same name.

After becoming a parent in 2004, Paltrow reduced her acting workload by making intermittent appearances in films such as &quot;Two Lovers&quot; (2008), &quot;Country Strong&quot; (2010), and &quot;Contagion&quot; (2011). Paltrow&#x27;s career revived through her portrayal of Pepper Potts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe from &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) to &quot;&quot; (2019). On television, she had a recurring guest role as Holly Holliday on the Fox musical television series &quot;Glee&quot; (2010–2011) for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. After starring in the Netflix series &quot;The Politician&quot; (2019–2020), she took a break from acting.

In 2005 Paltrow became a &quot;face&quot; of Estée Lauder Companies; she was previously the face of the American fashion brand Coach. She is the founder and CEO of the lifestyle company Goop, which has been criticized for promoting pseudoscience, and has written several cookbooks. She received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for the &quot;Brown Bear and Friends&quot; (2009). She hosted the documentary series &quot;The Goop Lab&quot; for Netflix in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Gwyneth Kate Paltrow was born on September 27, 1972, in Los Angeles, to actress Blythe Danner and film producer-director Bruce Paltrow. She has a younger brother, Jake, who is a director and screenwriter. Paltrow&#x27;s father was Jewish, while her mother is Christian. She was raised celebrating &quot;both Jewish and Christian holidays.&quot; Her brother had a traditional Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13. Her father&#x27;s Ashkenazi Jewish family emigrated from Belarus and Poland, while her mother has Pennsylvania Dutch (German) as well as some Irish and English ancestry. Paltrow&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather was a Rabbi in Nowogród, Poland, and a descendant of the well-known Paltrowicz family of rabbis from Kraków.

Paltrow is a half-cousin of actress Katherine Moennig, through her mother, and a second cousin of former U.S. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (AZ-08) through her father. (Giffords&#x27; husband is U.S. Senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona.) Paltrow&#x27;s godfather is director Steven Spielberg. Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner, is Paltrow&#x27;s cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: &quot;Hillary and I always had this in common, and to this day ... cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It&#x27;s how we were raised. It&#x27;s what we do.&quot; Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American billionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.

Paltrow was raised in Santa Monica, California, where she attended Crossroads School, before enrolling in the Spence School, an all-girls private school in Manhattan. Later, she studied art history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before dropping out to act. She is an &quot;adopted daughter&quot; of Talavera de la Reina (Spain), where at 15, she spent a year as an exchange student and learned to speak Spanish. She is also conversant in French, as her family frequently traveled to the South of France throughout her childhood.

==Career==
===1989–1995: Early work===
Her career beginnings can be credited to her acting family, as her acting debut was in &quot;High&quot; (1989), a TV film her father directed, and after spending several summers watching her mother perform at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts, Paltrow made her professional stage debut there in 1990. Her film debut followed with the musical romance film &quot;Shout&quot; (1991), starring John Travolta, and she was cast by her godfather Steven Spielberg in the commercially successful adventure feature &quot;Hook&quot; (1991) as the young Wendy Darling. Paltrow&#x27;s next roles were in the made-for-television movies &quot;Cruel Doubt&quot; (1992) and &quot;Deadly Relations&quot; (1993).

Her first plum feature film role was in the noir drama &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; (1993) as the much younger girlfriend of James Caan. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Paltrow as a scene-stealer &quot;who is Blythe Danner&#x27;s daughter and has her mother&#x27;s way of making a camera fall in love with her.&quot;

In 1995, she starred in the thriller &quot;Se7en&quot;, as the wife of a young detective (Brad Pitt), who is partnered with the retiring William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and then tasked with tracking down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as tropes in his murders. The seventh highest grossing film of the year, &quot;Se7en&quot; (also known as &quot;Seven&quot;) earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in &quot;Moonlight and Valentino&quot;, as a grieving chain-smoker, and in &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot;, portraying Martha Jefferson Randolph.

===1996–2001: Breakthrough and film stardom===
In 1996, Paltrow played the title character in the period film adaptation &quot;Emma&quot;, based on the 1815 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Director Douglas McGrath decided to bring in Paltrow to audition for the part of Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot;. On his decision to cast the actress, McGrath revealed: &quot;The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn&#x27;t recommend her to most people ... I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, &#x27;Everything is going to be fine; she&#x27;s going to be brilliant.&#x27;&quot; While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself to do research for the part; she studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the &quot;highly stylized&quot; manners and dialect during a 3-week rehearsal period. The film was released to critical acclaim and commercial success through arthouse cinemas. &quot;Variety&quot; proclaimed: &quot;Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen&#x27;s most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing, and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.&quot; Paltrow starred in the crime film &quot;Hard Eight&quot;.

1998 marked a turning point in Paltrow&#x27;s career as she took on leading roles in five high-profile film releases in the year&quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. In the adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, also starring Ethan Hawke, Robert De Niro, Anne Bancroft and Chris Cooper, she played the unrequited and haughty childhood love of a New York City painter. The British drama &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; saw her star as a woman whose life could take two central paths depending on whether or not she catches a train, causing different outcomes. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; both grossed over $55 million worldwide. Paltrow starred opposite Jessica Lange in the thriller &quot;Hush&quot;, as an unsuspecting woman living with her psychotic mother-in-law. The film made $13.5 million domestically and was generally panned by critics. In another thriller, &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot;, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1954 film, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, Paltrow starred alongside Michael Douglas, playing Emily Taylor, who was based on Grace Kelly&#x27;s character from the original film. Despite a mixed critical response towards &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot;, the film grossed $128 million globally. She was also considered for the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Her most critically acclaimed role in the year was that of the fictional lover of William Shakespeare in &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, opposite Joseph Fiennes in the titular part. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot;Best of all is Gwyneth Paltrow, who, at long last, has a movie to star in that&#x27;s as radiant as she is.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; summed up her performance as Viola thus: &quot;Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright&#x27;s guiding light.&quot; &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; made $289 million in box office receipts, and won Paltrow the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical, and Academy Award for Best Actress, among other honors. The pink Ralph Lauren dress she wore to the 71st Academy Awards in collecting her Oscar was extremely popular and was credited for bringing pink back into fashion.

In 1999, Paltrow co-starred alongside Jude Law, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in the psychological thriller &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, as the fiancée of a rich and spoiled millionaire playboy (Law) whose identity is adopted by a con artist (Damon). While &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noting the &quot;very underwritten&quot; female roles in the story, found her to be &quot;peaky and pallid&quot;, the film received positive reviews and grossed $80 million in North America. She showcased her singing ability in 2000s &quot;Duets&quot;, which was directed by her father and co-starred singer Huey Lewis. In the film, about &quot;the little known world of karaoke competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it&quot;, she portrayed the estranged daughter of a hustler (Lewis). She performed a cover version of Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Cruisin&#x27;, which was released as a single and went to number one in Australia, while her rendition of the Kim Carnes classic &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; reached number three. Also in 2000, Paltrow co-starred with Ben Affleck in the moderately successful romantic drama &quot;Bounce&quot; as Abby Janello.

She starred with Jack Black in the comedy &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001), about a shallow man falling in love with an overweight woman. Her role required that she wear a specially designed 25-pound fatsuit and heavy makeup. &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; opened with $22.5 million and grossed $70.7 million in North America and $141.1 million around the globe. Roger Ebert remarked that she was &quot;truly touching&quot; in the film, which he described as &quot;often very funny, but ... also surprisingly moving at times.&quot; In the Wes Anderson dramedy &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), co-starring Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, Paltrow took on the role of the adopted daughter in an estranged family of former child prodigies reuniting with their father. A positive critical response greeted the film upon its release, and it made $71.4 million worldwide.

===2002–2007: Career fluctuations===
In 2004, it was noted that since her Oscar win for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, Paltrow&#x27;s film career had been less noteworthy, and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad film choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, &quot;Proof&quot;, and &quot;Sylvia&quot; fell into the former category, while she signed on to &quot;View from the Top&quot; and &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; for the latter.

In 2002, Paltrow made small appearances in the documentary &quot;Searching for Debra Winger&quot; and the action satire comedy &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, while she starred in the thriller-drama &quot;Possession&quot; with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. The film made a lukewarm $14.8 million worldwide. In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy &quot;View from the Top&quot;, where she played the part of a woman from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at $30 million, the film only earned $7 million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed $15.6 domestically and $19,526,014 worldwide. She later disparaged the film, calling it &quot;terrible&quot;. Paltrow starred as the titular role in &quot;Sylvia&quot; (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, &quot;Sylvia&quot; made $2.9 million internationally. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its review of the film, wrote that &quot;her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her bright blue eyes have glazed over.&quot;

In 2004, she starred with her &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; co-star Jude Law and Angelina Jolie in the science fiction film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;. Her role was Polly Perkins, the reporter for the fictional &quot;New York Chronicle&quot;. Law became one of the film&#x27;s producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember &quot;any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.&quot; She said in an interview, &quot;I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it&#x27;s kind of breaking into new territory and it&#x27;s not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.&quot; While critical response was positive, with a budget of $70 million, &quot;Sky Captain&quot; only grossed $58 million at the international box office. Also in 2004, she was recognized as an outstanding woman in entertainment by Women in Film Los Angeles with the Crystal Award.

In the drama &quot;Proof&quot; (2005), she starred as the depressed daughter of a brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film was based on the play of the same name, in which Paltrow also played the same character at London&#x27;s Donmar Warehouse between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, &quot;Eye for Film&quot; remarked: &quot;As she has already shown in &quot;Sylvia&quot;, &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; and even &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women who are coming apart at the seams and her [character] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency, and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it.&quot; For her performance, Paltrow received her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

Paltrow filmed small roles for the 2006 films &quot;Love and Other Disasters&quot;, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; and &quot;Infamous&quot;, where she sang Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot; Her brother Jake Paltrow directed her in his feature debut, the romantic comedy &quot;The Good Night&quot; (2007), in which she starred opposite Penélope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as the wife of a former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics. &quot;View London&quot; believed the actress was &quot;clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and it just makes you wish she&#x27;d go back to playing lead roles again.&quot;

===2008–2013: Marvel Cinematic Universe and revival===
Paltrow saw a resurgence in her career in 2008 when she was cast in &quot;Iron Man&quot; as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark&#x27;s personal assistant, closest friend, and budding love interest. At first hesitant to appear in a big-budget project, Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked &quot;the fact that there&#x27;s a sexuality that&#x27;s not blatant&quot;. The director Jon Favreau wanted Potts and Stark&#x27;s relationship to be reminiscent of the 1940s screwball comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an &quot;innocent yet sexy&quot; way. &quot;Iron Man&quot; was favorably received by critics, and with a worldwide gross of $585 million, it became Paltrow&#x27;s highest-grossing film until &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012). She reprised her role in the sequels &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013). While the second film grossed $623.9 million internationally, the third entry went on to gross $1.215 billion. She also reprised the role in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019).

Paltrow starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the romantic drama &quot;Two Lovers&quot; (2008), playing the beautiful but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor. &quot;Two Lovers&quot; premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews, especially for Paltrow&#x27;s and Phoenix&#x27;s performances. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Phoenix is at his best with Paltrow&#x27;s bruised sparrow of a girl; he&#x27;s desperate to take care of her when he can&#x27;t even take care of himself. She is one of those actresses who understands the power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness.&quot; The film was an arthouse success, grossing $16 million worldwide.
In the musical drama &quot;Country Strong&quot; (2010), Paltrow starred as an emotionally unstable country music star who attempts to resurrect her career. She recorded the song &quot;Country Strong&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, and it was released to country radio stations in August 2010. The film received mediocre reviews and grossed a modest $20.2 million in North America. The consensus of review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes was: &quot;The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but &quot;Country Strong&quot;″s clichéd, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.&quot; At the 83rd Academy Awards, Paltrow performed another song from the film, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which was nominated for Best Original Song.

Paltrow made her first scripted television appearance on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Glee&quot;, as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, who fills in for Matthew Morrison&#x27;s character when he falls ill. Her role was developed by co-creator Ryan Murphy, a personal friend of Paltrow&#x27;s, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing abilities ahead of the release of &quot;Country Strong&quot;. In her first episode, &quot;The Substitute&quot;, she sang &quot;Nowadays&quot; from the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; with Lea Michele, CeeLo Green&#x27;s &quot;Forget You&quot;, and a mash-up of &quot;Singin&#x27; In the Rain&quot; and Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Umbrella&quot; with Morrison and the rest of the cast. Her debut on &quot;Glee&quot; attracted significant buzz and positive commentary from critics; she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Indeed, at the time, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Tim Stack and &quot;E! Online&quot;″s Kristin dos Santos called her appearance Emmy-worthy, with the former rating it among her best performances, and the latter stating that Holly received &quot;some of &quot;Glee&quot; best-ever one-liners&quot;.

Paltrow later performed &quot;Forget You&quot; with CeeLo Green himself and several puppet characters provided by The Jim Henson Company at the 2011 Grammy Awards. She reprised her role twice more that season, performing &quot;Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)&quot; by Gary Glitter, an acoustic version of &quot;Landslide&quot; by Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Kiss&quot; by Prince, and Adele&#x27;s &quot;Turning Tables&quot;. Paltrow was briefly featured in &quot;&quot; after being filmed while she performed &quot;Forget You&quot; as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011. Later that year, Paltrow appeared in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s film &quot;Contagion&quot;, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet and her &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; co-stars Matt Damon and Jude Law. The thriller follows the rapid progress of a lethal indirect contact transmission virus that kills within days. Paltrow played Elizabeth Emhoff, a &quot;working mom&quot; and one of the virus&#x27; first victims. &quot;Contagion&quot; received positive reviews and opened atop at the North American box office with $23.1 million; it went on to gross $75.6 million domestically and $135.4 million worldwide.

Paltrow reprised her role of Pepper Potts in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), which set numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in North America; it grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, becoming Paltrow&#x27;s most widely seen film. Also in 2012, she starred in the independent romantic dramedy &quot;Thanks for Sharing&quot;, opposite Mark Ruffalo as people learning to face a challenging and confusing road as they struggle together against sex addiction. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States, the film garnered mixed reviews and grossed $1 million domestically. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine noted that her role: &quot;...exhibits some of the same obsessive diet and exercise habits that Paltrow herself has been accused ofa kind of meta character trait that balances the power in [the main roles&#x27;] budding relationship.&quot;

===2014–present: Acting sporadically===
In 2014, Paltrow had a two-episode arc in the improvised online series &quot;Web Therapy&quot;, as Maya Ganesh, &quot;a new-age caricature&quot;. In 2015, she starred in &quot;Mortdecai&quot;, alongside Johnny Depp, Olivia Munn, and Paul Bettany. In it, she portrayed the wife of an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler (Depp). Budgeted at $60 million, the film only grossed $7.7 million in North America and $47.3 million internationally. Paltrow was featured on the track &quot;Everglow&quot;, which was included in Coldplay&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;A Head Full of Dreams&quot; (2015).

In June 2017, Paltrow announced that she would take a break from acting to focus on her business Goop, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m still going to do a little bit here and there, but [the company] really requires almost all of my time.&quot; In 2019, Paltrow reprised her role as Pepper Potts in &quot;&quot;. That same year, she played a supporting role in the Netflix comedy drama series &quot;The Politician&quot;, playing the mother of Ben Platt&#x27;s character. In October 2021, Netflix released &quot;Sex, Love, and Goop&quot;, a sex therapy-themed series produced by and starring Paltrow.

In 2023 Paltrow said that her responsibilities with Goop made her less likely to accept acting roles. She will return to acting with Josh Safdie&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Marty Supreme&quot;, starring Timothée Chalamet.

==Other ventures==
===Philanthropy and politics===
Paltrow is a Save the Children artist ambassador, raising awareness about World Pneumonia Day. She is on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that works to alleviate poverty in New York City. In October 2014, she hosted a Democratic fundraiser attended by President Barack Obama at her private residence in Los Angeles.

In May 2019, Paltrow and actor Bradley Whitford hosted a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

In April 2020, Paltrow, along with other celebrities, discussed the COVID-19 pandemic with Dr. Anthony Fauci on a one-hour-long zoom call. Fauci hoped the celebrities would use their social media &quot;megaphones&quot; to encourage proper precautions among their followers.

===Audiobooks===
In 2009, Paltrow narrated the audiobook &quot;The Brown Bear &amp; Friends&quot; by Bill Martin Jr., the first of a series of children&#x27;s audiobooks that she narrated. &quot;The Brown Bear &amp; Friends&quot; earned Paltrow a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children. Since, she has also narrated Bill Martin&#x27;s &quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&quot;, &quot;Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?&quot;, &quot;Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?&quot;, and &quot;Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?&quot;.

===Fashion===
In May 2005, Paltrow became the face of Estée Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures perfume. She appeared in Chicago on August 17, 2007, to sign bottles of the perfume, and on July 8, 2008, she promoted Lauder&#x27;s Sensuous perfume in New York with the company&#x27;s three other models. Estée Lauder donates a minimum of $500,000 of sales of items from the &#x27;Pleasures Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27; collection to breast cancer research. In 2006, she became the face for Bean Pole International, a Korean fashion brand and in 2014, she partnered with Blo Blow Bar, teaming up with the brand&#x27;s creative branch.

===Goop===

In September 2008, Paltrow launched the weekly lifestyle newsletter Goop, encouraging readers to &quot;nourish the inner aspect&quot;. Goop has expanded into a web-based company, Goop.com. According to Paltrow, the company&#x27;s name came from someone telling her that successful internet companies have double O&#x27;s in their name, and &quot;is a nickname, like my name is G.P., so that is really where it came from. And I wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything.&quot; Goop has expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops, launching a wellness summit, a print magazine, a podcast, and a documentary series streamed on Netflix.

Goop, and by extension Paltrow, have faced backlash for showcasing expensive products and promoting medically and scientifically impossible treatments, many of which have harmful consequences. The controversies have included vaginal steaming, the use of jade eggs, a dangerous coffee enema device, and &quot;Body Vibes&quot;, wearable stickers that were claimed to &quot;rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies&quot; and which Goop falsely claimed were made of a NASA-developed material. Goop settled a lawsuit regarding the health claims it made over the jade eggs.

Jill Avery, a brand analyst, has noted how Goop&#x27;s response to criticism seems designed to &quot;strengthen their brand and draw their customers closer&quot;, noting Goop&#x27;s references to feminism, traditional Asian medicines and Eastern philosophies, and anti-establishment politics to do so. Late Show host Stephen Colbert had repeatedly lampooned Goop products; in 2018 Paltrow appeared in a Late Show sketch seemingly making fun of her company&#x27;s approach.

On January 24, 2020, Netflix released &quot;The Goop Lab,&quot; a documentary series. The 6-part show promotes Goop, and covers pseudoscientific topics in energy healing, the use of psychedelic drugs, cold therapy, anti-aging, mediumship, and female sexuality. Critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix&#x27;s platform was a &quot;win for pseudoscience&quot;. Upon release of the first trailer, and again after the full six-episode series was available, the series sparked controversy concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.

On January 27, 2020, Truth in Advertising watchdog (TINA.org) filed another complaint with the district attorneys of California alleging that Goop has continued to engage in deceptive marketing, even after Goop was sued by the State of California earlier that year and agreed to refrain from &quot;making any claims regarding the efficacy or effects of any of its products without possessing competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the claims&quot; for a period of five years. TINA.org&#x27;s complaint alleges that Goop claims their products are &quot;clinically-proven&quot; to treat such symptoms as anxiety, depression, OCD and more.

In January 2021, it was announced that Paltrow was an early investor in Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce site focused on makeup, skincare, haircare, and wellness products owned by people of color and ally brands. In April 2021, Goop became Thirteen Lune&#x27;s first ally brand.

===Food===

In October 2007, Paltrow signed with PBS to make a television series, &quot;Spain... on the Road Again&quot;, which showcased the food and culture of Spain. In 2008, Paltrow co-wrote the book &quot;Spain... A Culinary Road Trip&quot; with Mario Batali. In 2011, she wrote a book titled &quot;My Father&#x27;s Daughter: Delicious, Easy Recipes Celebrating Family and Togetherness&quot;. That same year she penned the book &quot;Notes From the Kitchen Table&quot;. Two years later she published a book titled &quot;It&#x27;s All Good: Delicious Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great&quot;, which promoted an elimination diet that is unsupported by medical evidence. Included in that book was a recipe for avocado toast which was widely copied and adapted as part of a 2010s food trend. Also in 2013, Paltrow wrote a foreword for a book by Ross Mathews, &quot;Man Up! Tales of My Delusional Self-Confidence&quot;. In 2016, Paltrow published a cookbook: &quot;It&#x27;s All Easy: Delicious Weekday Recipes for the Super-Busy Home Cook&quot;.

The negative reaction from a group of scientist and science communication mothers to Paltrow&#x27;s 2015 video pushing for mandatory labeling of food containing genetically modified organisms led to the creation of a documentary, &quot;Science Moms&quot;. The film is about mothers who advocate for science-based decision-making concerning the health and nutrition of children.

In February 2021 it was reported that Paltrow was suffering from long COVID, leaving her with &quot;some long-tail fatigue and brain fog&quot;. She advocated treatments for it which involved a &quot;ketogenic and plant-based&quot; diet (with no sugar or alcohol), fasting until 11:00 every day, and taking infrared saunas. This advice was criticized by NHS England&#x27;s Professor Stephen Powis.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Paltrow practiced cupping therapy, attending a film premiere with bruises on her back. , Paltrow practices Transcendental Meditation.

In 2014, Paltrow, whose father was Jewish, was planning to convert to Judaism. In December 2024, she revealed that she celebrates Hanukkah each year with her family.

In 1997, Paltrow revealed that during the filming of &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), producer Harvey Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances toward her. She confided in her, then fiancé, Brad Pitt, who confronted the producer at an industry event. Weinstein later warned Paltrow not to tell anyone else. She was, in 2017, a major source for an article written by &quot;The New York Times&quot; investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about Weinstein&#x27;s sexual abuse cases.

Paltrow has received backlash from the scientific community and medical professionals for promoting unproven treatments based on pseudoscience through her company Goop.

===Relationships and marriages===
Paltrow became engaged in December 1996 to actor Brad Pitt, whom she dated from 1994 to 1997. According to Paltrow, they called off the engagement because she was not ready for marriage. She later said that, as this was her first high-profile relationship with another celebrity, it taught her the need for public discretion about her love life.

Paltrow began dating actor Ben Affleck in October 1997 after meeting at a Miramax dinner and they worked together on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998). Although they split in January 1999, months later Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in &quot;Bounce&quot; (2000) and they rekindled their relationship. They broke up for good in October 2000. In 2015, Paltrow said she and Affleck remain friends.

In October 2002, Paltrow met Chris Martin of the British band Coldplay backstage three weeks after the death of her father, Bruce Paltrow. The Coldplay song &quot;Fix You&quot; was written to help Paltrow through her grief. They married on December 5, 2003, at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse. She was pregnant at the time of their wedding. Paltrow and Martin have two children together: a daughter, Apple, born in May 2004, and a son, Moses, born in April 2006. Their son&#x27;s name was inspired by a song Chris Martin wrote for Paltrow. Simon Pegg and Martin&#x27;s bandmate Jonny Buckland are her daughter&#x27;s godfathers.

Paltrow cut down on work after becoming a mother. She also suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of her younger child in 2006. In March 2014, Paltrow announced that she and Martin had separated after ten years of marriage, describing the process as &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot;. In her official announcement, Paltrow had her doctor, Habib Sadeghi, and his dentist wife, Sherry Sami, explain conscious uncoupling as &quot;the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,&quot; Sadeghi explained. &quot;From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people, it&#x27;s about people as individuals, not just the relationship&quot;. In April 2015, Paltrow filed for divorce, which was finalized on July 14, 2016.

In 2014, Paltrow began dating producer Brad Falchuk, whom she met on the set of &quot;Glee&quot; in 2010. The couple went public with their relationship in April 2015 and announced their engagement on January 8, 2018. Their marriage ceremony was held on September 29, 2018, in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York.

===Ski crash lawsuit===
In January 2019, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow, claiming that three years earlier she collided with him on a ski slope at Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, causing him permanent traumatic brain injury. Paltrow counter-sued Sanderson that February, claiming that he was the one who crashed into her. She sought nominal damages of one dollar and repayment of her legal fees. At trial in March 2023, Sanderson claimed damages for $300,000. The jury found that Sanderson was at fault, not Paltrow, and awarded Paltrow $1 in damages.

The lawsuit was depicted in two separate musicals, &quot;I Wish You Well: The Gwyneth Paltrow Ski-Trial Musical&quot; and &quot;Gwyneth Goes Skiing&quot; by Linus Karp.

==Public image==
As an actress, Paltrow performed in mainly small and medium-budget films for most of her early career, starring in few blockbusters until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;. According to Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot;, much of these performances were defined by a &quot;blasé&quot; demeanor that made her endearing at times, but overall demonstrated &quot;a promising actress who needed some training to refine her potential&quot;. Similarly, Jose Solis of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said &quot;When she’s good, she’s absolutely brilliant, when she’s bad, she just seems deeply uninterested&quot;. Many of her characters were wealthy, privileged, and academic, and she was often labeled &quot;Hollywood royalty&quot; by the press. Many viewers mistook her as British due to her regular roles as ingénues in period films, and some publications have described her feigned British accent as one of the best among non-British actors. She was frequently compared to actress Grace Kelly, with whom she shared &quot;blondness, refinement, glacial good looks and all-round star quality&quot;, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;.

Christina Newland of BBC said Paltrow used her roles throughout the 1990s to cultivate &quot;an image off and on-screen ... as a chic social butterfly with charm to spare&quot;. She also established herself as a fashion icon, becoming recognized for her minimal style of dressing for public events. In April 2013, Paltrow was named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;Most Beautiful Woman&quot;. Film critic Owen Gleiberman described Paltrow as one of the industry&#x27;s finest actresses in 2011. He was perplexed by readers&#x27; negative comments towards her on his reviews of her work, but agreed that her reputation had suffered from a selection of weaker roles and reduced workload. Critic Wesley Morris defended her acting, calling Paltrow among the final generation of movie stars &quot;for whom stardom and skill seem scarily, thrillingly natural&quot; and &quot;for a while, the best young American actor in Hollywood&quot;. Paltrow herself has stated that her passion for acting waned early in her career due to the scrutiny she received as a young actress, with Morris theorizing that she pivoted away from acting towards an industry she could exercise complete autonomy over. In 2019, she claimed to have been only &quot;masquerading as an actor&quot; before founding Goop. 

Paltrow has been described as a polarizing and divisive public figure by the media for much her career. Although generally revered as an actress, her subsequent career endeavors as a businesswoman have garnered mixed reviews. Taylor wrote in 2004 that &quot;No star of the last 10 years has been such a magnet for the neuroses and prejudices of those who watch her than Paltrow&quot;, which the author surmised as due to her being &quot;rich, white, beautiful and successful&quot;. In 2023, Leanne Delap, a writer for Everything Zoomer, called her &quot;one of the most divisive personages of our time&quot;, equally beloved and hated. Many of her remarks regarding diet, health, wellness, and wealth have drawn public backlash and mockery, which some critics have used to justify dismissing her as a privileged and &quot;out of touch&quot; celebrity. Paltrow has attributed the public&#x27;s discourse surrounding her to the perception that her success hinges exclusively on the achievements and wealth of her parents, which she has attempted to dispel in interviews. The actress also maintains that the public&#x27;s shift in favor against her can be traced back to the moment she delivered an emotional acceptance speech when she won her Oscar for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; in 1998. Journalist Hadley Freeman believes Paltrow is completely in control of how she is perceived, describing her as a performer who has ingeniously cultivated an overexposed image that allows her career to benefit from being a parody of the modern-day celebrity.

According to entertainment journalist Dylan Howard, &quot;Inevitably, in a saga of Hollywood, people identify with either the sympathetic character or the villain ... When it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, she&#x27;s both the villain and sympathetic figure&quot;. Describing her as &quot;successful, opinionated and seemingly happy&quot; in 2013, journalist Tanya Gold attributed her unpopularity – particularly among women – to her &quot;venturing beyond the accepted Hollywood script and expressing her thoughts about clothing, motherhood and nutrition&quot;. Some journalists theorized that Paltrow&#x27;s brand and reputation benefited from the sympathy she gained during the ski crash trials, as reported by Edward Helmore of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; said &quot;The very trial that threatened to harm her reputation — one that has not been exempt from its fair amount of controversies over questionable advice ... ultimately invigorated the Hollywood actor’s image in the court of public opinion&quot;. However, Alex Abad-Santos of &quot;Vox&quot; argued that, rather than seek sympathy or relatability, Paltrow embraced the stereotypes her detractors had long accused her of perpetuating, ultimately to her own benefit. Paltrow&#x27;s penchant for wearing understated luxury-brand clothing during the trial also received widespread coverage, inspiring a trend known as &quot;courtcore&quot;, as coined by &quot;The New York Times&quot; fashion journalist Vanessa Friedman.

In a 2021 article for &quot;Vogue&quot;, Keaton Bell defined her as &quot;one of our last, true A-listers&quot; whose &quot;every move consumes daily headlines&quot;, observing that she &quot;is now better known as a fabulously out-of-touch entrepreneur than an actor, and she seems perfectly fine with that&quot;. In 2023, EJ Dickson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Paltrow had largely rehabilitated her image by &quot;lean[ing] into her own image as an out-of-touch celebutante&quot;, becoming &quot;regularly heralded as a scrappy, savvy, self-made entrepreneur&quot;. Newland agreed that &quot;in today&#x27;s relentlessly critical social media discourse, many find her schtick so over-the-top that they can&#x27;t help but find it entertaining&quot;. According to Charles Trepany of &quot;USA Today&quot;, Paltrow&#x27;s &quot;calm, unbothered demeanor&quot; had become virtually synonymous with her brand and public image by 2024.

<doc id="42622" wikidata="Q122880" url="?curid=42622" title="European Court of Human Rights">
<text>The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), also known as the Strasbourg Court, is an international court of the Council of Europe which interprets the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The court hears applications alleging that a contracting state has breached one or more of the human rights enumerated in the convention or its optional protocols to which a member state is a party. The court is based in Strasbourg, France.

The court was established in 1959 and decided its first case in 1960 in &quot;Lawless v. Ireland&quot;. An application can be lodged by an individual, a group of individuals, or one or more of the other contracting states. Aside from judgments, the court can also issue advisory opinions. The convention was adopted within the context of the Council of Europe, and all of its 46 member states are contracting parties to the convention. The court&#x27;s primary means of judicial interpretation is the living instrument doctrine, meaning that the Convention is interpreted in light of present-day conditions. 

International law scholars consider the ECtHR to be the most effective international human rights court in the world. Nevertheless, the court has faced challenges with verdicts not implemented by the contracting parties.

==History and structure==
On 10 December 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which aims to promote the universal recognition of rights set out therein, in order to strengthen the protection of human rights at the international level. While hugely important in setting a global standard for the first time, the declaration was essentially aspirational, and had no judicial enforcement mechanism. In 1949, the twelve member states of the newly created Council of Europe began work on the European Convention on Human Rights, drawing inspiration from the rights already set out in the Declaration, but with the crucial difference that—for the European countries which chose to sign up to it—there would be a judicial mechanism to ensure that they respected the basic rights of their citizens.

The court was established on 21 January 1959 on the basis of Article 19 of the European Convention on Human Rights when its first members were elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Initially, access to the court was restricted by the European Commission of Human Rights, abolished in 1998. The court kept a low profile during its first years and did not accumulate much case law, first finding a violation in &quot;Neumeister v Austria&quot; (1968). The convention charges the court with ensuring the observance of the engagement undertaken by the contracting states in relation to the convention and its protocols, that is ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the European Convention in the member states of the Council of Europe.

==As a court of the Council of Europe==
The European Court of Human Rights, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights, is the best known body of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe (CoE) (, CdE) is an international organisation founded in the wake of World War II to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. Founded in 1949, it now has 46 member states, covering a population of approximately 700 million, and operates with an annual budget of approximately 500 million euros.

The organisation is distinct from the 27-nation European Union (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original flag of Europe created by the Council of Europe in 1955, as well as the anthem of Europe. No country has ever joined the EU without first belonging to the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe is an official United Nations observer.

== Member states ==

The jurisdiction of the court has been recognized to date by all 46 member states of the Council of Europe. On 1 November 1998, the court became a full-time institution and the European Commission of Human Rights, which used to decide on admissibility of applications, was abolished by Protocol 11.

The accession of new states to the European Convention on Human Rights following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the court. The efficiency of the court was threatened seriously by the large accumulation of pending applications.

In 1999, 8,400 applications were allocated to be heard. In 2003, 27,200 cases were filed and the number pending rose to approximately 65,000. In 2005, the court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009, 57,200 applications were allocated, with 119,300 pending. At the time, more than 90 per cent of applications were declared to be inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided—around 60 per cent of the decisions by the court—related to what is termed &quot;repetitive cases&quot;: where the court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights or where well established case law exists on a similar case.

Protocol 11 was designed to deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.

== Judges ==

Judges are elected for a non-renewable nine-year term. The number of full-time judges sitting in the court is equal to the number of contracting states to the European Convention on Human Rights, currently 46. The convention requires that judges be of &quot;high moral character&quot; and have qualifications suitable for high judicial office, or be jurists of recognised competence.

Each judge is elected by majority vote in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from among three candidates nominated by each contracting state. Judges are elected whenever a sitting judge&#x27;s term has expired or when a new state accedes to the convention. The retiring age of judges is 70, but they may continue to serve as judges until a new judge is elected or until the cases in which they sit have come to an end.

Judges perform their duties in an individual capacity and are prohibited from having any institutional or similar ties with the state in respect of which they were elected. To ensure the independence of the court, judges are not allowed to participate in activity that may compromise the court&#x27;s independence. Judges cannot hear or decide a case if they have a familial or professional relationship with a party. A judge can be dismissed from office only if the other judges decide, by a two-thirds majority, that the judge has ceased to fulfil the required conditions. Judges enjoy, during their term as judges, the privileges and immunities provided for in Article 40 of the Statute of the Council of Europe.

The European Court of Human Rights is assisted by a registry made up of around 640 agents, of which a little less than half of lawyers divided into 31 sections. The registry carries out preparatory work for the judges., and performs the communication activities of the court, with the applicants, the public and the press. The registrar and the deputy registrar are elected by the Plenary Court.

==Plenary court and administration==
The plenary court is an assembly of all of the court&#x27;s judges. It has no judicial functions. It elects the court&#x27;s president, vice-president, registrar and deputy registrar. It also deals with administrative matters, discipline, working methods, reforms, the establishment of Chambers and the adoption of the Rules of Court.

The president of the court, the two vice-presidents (also section presidents) and the three other section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, Section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, a formation made up of the 46 elected judges of the court. The mandate of the holders is for a renewable period of three years. They are renowned for their morality and competence. They must be independent and there is incompatibility with other functions. They cannot be revoked by their state of origin, but only by decision of their peers, taken by a two-thirds majority and for serious reasons.

== Jurisdiction ==
The court has jurisdiction amongst the member states of the Council of Europe which includes almost every country in Europe except for Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Russia and Vatican City. The jurisdiction of the court is generally divided into inter-state cases, applications by individuals against contracting states, and advisory opinions in accordance with Protocol No.2. Applications by individuals constitute the majority of cases heard by the court. A committee is constituted by three judges, chambers by seven judges, and a Grand Chamber by 17 judges.

===Applications by individuals===
Applications by individuals against contracting states, alleging that the state violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, can be made by any person, non-governmental organisation, or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant&#x27;s representative.

Once registered with the court, the case is assigned to a Judge Rapporteur, who can make a final decision on whether the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of &quot;ratione materiae&quot;, &quot;ratione temporis&quot; or &quot;ratione personae&quot;, or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the four months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the court, or with another procedure of international investigation.

If the Judge Rapporteur decides that the case can proceed, the case is then referred to a chamber of the court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case.

The chamber of the court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the chamber of the court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.

===Interstate cases===
Any contracting state to the European Convention on Human Rights can sue another contracting state in the court for alleged breaches of the convention, although in practice this is very rare. , five interstate cases have been decided by the court:

* &quot;Ireland v. United Kingdom&quot; (no. 5310/71), judgement of 18 January 1978 on inhuman and degrading treatment in Northern Ireland (art. 3)
* &quot;Denmark v. Turkey&quot; (no. 34382/97), judgement of 5 April 2000 ratifying a friendly settlement of 450,000 DKK regarding a Danish national detained in Turkey (art. 3)
* &quot;Cyprus v. Turkey&quot; (IV) (no. 25781/94), judgements of 10 May 2001 on the treatment of missing persons (art. 2, 3 and 5), the right of return of Greeks who have fled to the south (art. 8, 13 and P1-1), the rights of Greeks still living in the north (art. 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, P1-1, P1-2) and trial by military courts (art. 6). A subsequent judgement of 12 May 2014 awarded €90 million in &#x27;just satisfaction&#x27; (art. 41)
* &quot;Georgia v. Russian Federation (I)&quot; (no. 13255/07), judgement of 3 July 2014 on the collective expulsion of Georgians from Russia (art. 3, 5, 13, 38, P4-4) and Russia not cooperating with the court (art. 38)
* &quot;Georgia v. Russian Federation (II)&quot; (no. 38263/08), judgement of 21 January 2021

===Advisory opinion===
The Committee of Ministers may, by majority vote, ask the court to deliver an advisory opinion on the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, unless the matter relates to the content and scope of fundamental rights which the court has already considered. Since 2018, member states can similarly request advisory opinions on questions of principle concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention, on the basis of Protocol No. 16. This mechanism aims to foster dialogue between national courts and the ECtHR, thereby preempting Convention violations and minimizing the latter&#x27;s caseload. Unlike preliminary references under EU law, advisory opinions may only be solicited by the &quot;highest courts and tribunals&quot; of a member state. Although Article 5 of Protocol No. 16 states that &quot;Advisory opinions shall not be binding,&quot; they nonetheless enter the ECtHR&#x27;s case law and may be enforced through later individual complaints if contravened.

===&quot;Erga omnes&quot; effects===
ECtHR rulings have &quot;erga omnes&quot; effects (that is, they are potentially binding on all member states), because the court &quot;determines issues on public-policy grounds in the common interest, thereby extending human rights jurisprudence throughout the community of European Convention States&quot;, although &quot;erga omnes&quot; effect &quot;is not regarded by all States Parties as a legal requirement&quot;.

==Procedure and decisions==


After the preliminary finding of admissibility the court examines the case by hearing representations from both parties. The court may undertake any investigation it deems necessary on the facts or issues raised in the application and contracting states are required to provide the court with all necessary assistance for this purpose.

The European Convention on Human Rights requires all hearings to be in public, unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the holding of a private hearing. In practice the majority of cases are heard in private following written pleadings. In confidential proceedings the court may assist both parties in securing a settlement, in which case the court monitors the compliance of the agreement with the convention. However, in many cases, a hearing is not held.

The judgment of the Grand Chamber is final. Judgments by the chamber of the court become final three months after they are issued, unless a reference to the Grand Chamber for review or appeal has been made. If the panel of the Grand Chamber rejects the request for referral, the judgment of the chamber of the court becomes final. The Grand Chamber is made up of 17 judges: the court&#x27;s president and vice-presidents, the section presidents and the national judge, together with other judges selected by drawing of lots. Grand Chambers include a public hearing, which is transmitted as a webcast on the ECHR site. After the public hearing, the judges deliberate.

The court&#x27;s chamber decides both issues regarding admissibility and merits of the case. Generally, both these issues are dealt with in the same judgment. In final judgments the court makes a declaration that a contracting state has violated the convention, and may order the contracting state to pay material and/or moral damages and the legal expenses incurred in domestic courts and the court in bringing the case.

The court&#x27;s judgments are public and must contain reasons justifying the decision. Article 46 of the convention provides that contracting states undertake to abide by the court&#x27;s final decision. On the other hand, advisory opinions are, by definition, non-binding. The court has to date decided consistently that under the convention it has no jurisdiction to annul domestic laws or administrative practices which violate the convention.

The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is charged with supervising the execution of the court&#x27;s judgments. The Committee of Ministers oversees the contracting states&#x27; changes to their national law in order that it is compatible with the convention, or individual measures taken by the contracting state to redress violations. Judgments by the court are binding on the respondent states concerned and states usually comply with the Court&#x27;s judgments.

Chambers decide cases by a majority. Any judge who has heard the case can attach to the judgment a separate opinion. This opinion can concur or dissent with the decision of the court. In case of a tie in voting, the president has the casting vote.

=== Exhaustion of domestic remedies ===
Article 35 of the European Convention on Human Rights establishes as a precondition on referral to the European Court of Human Rights, the exhaustion of domestic remedies. This condition is the consequence of the subsidiary jurisdiction of the supranational court, which monitors the application of the convention and seeks to eradicate human rights violations. The applicant must establish the inability of the national courts to remedy the breaches, by exercising the appropriate remedies effective and adequate, and in substance alleging a violation of the Convention.

=== Interim measures ===
Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court permits the ECtHR to &quot;indicate to the parties any interim measure which they consider should be adopted in the interests of the parties or of the proper conduct of the proceedings.&quot; Interim measures are binding and afford litigants temporary protections on an expedited basis, although the ECtHR has chosen to only impose them in cases concerning imminent danger to life and limb. Such measures are often deployed to prevent extradition or expulsion to countries with inadequate human rights guarantees, whereas requests to prevent potentially damaging publications or property seizures seldom elicit similar responses.

==Just satisfaction==
The court may award or non-pecuniary damages, called &quot;just satisfaction&quot;. The awards are typically small in comparison to verdicts by national courts and rarely exceed £1,000 plus legal costs. Non-pecuniary damages are more closely correlated to what the state can afford to pay than the specific harm suffered by the complainant. In some cases, repeated patterns of human rights violations lead to higher awards in an effort to punish the responsible state, but paradoxically in other cases they lead to lower awards, or the cases being struck entirely.

==Judicial interpretation==
The court&#x27;s primary method of judicial interpretation is living instrument doctrine, meaning that the text of the Convention &quot;must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions&quot; rather than the intent of its framers. In &quot;Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey&quot; (2008), the court emphasized that it &quot;upholds individual rights as practical and effective, rather than theoretical and illusory protections&quot;. Another key part of the Court&#x27;s interpretation is the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 

One area that the living instrument doctrine has changed ECtHR jurisprudence over time is with regard to differential treatment exclusively based on ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, which it is increasingly likely to label unjustified discrimination. In addition, with the proliferation of alternative family arrangements, the court has expanded its definition of family under Article 8, for example to same-sex couples, as in &quot;Oliari and Others v Italy&quot; (2015). Although defenders argue that living instrument doctrine is necessary for the court to stay relevant and its rulings to adapt to the actual conditions, such interpretations are labeled overreach or judicial activism by critics.

===Margin of appreciation===

The Court uses the doctrine of margin of appreciation, referring to the member states&#x27; rights to set moral standards within reason. Over time, the court has narrowed the margin of appreciation (to the point, according to some commentators, of a &quot;demise&quot; of margin of appreciation). Narrowing margin of appreciation is a target of criticism for those who believe that the ECtHR should minimize its role, especially from the United Kingdom.

Proponents of a stronger recognition of margin of appreciation cite local conceptions of human rights, specific to the context of each country and its culture, and the risk of handing down judgements that lack local cultural and grassroots legitimacy. Critics argue that the principle of &quot;emerging consensus&quot; of the member states on which the ECtHR operates is fundamentally flawed, because such a consensus often relies on trends, and historically in many instances social and political consensus was retrospectively acknowledged to have been wrong.

Such an approach is accused of risking stigmatisation and coercion of the few dissenting countries, encouraging a pack mentality. Furthermore, critics argue that the EHCR has claimed that such consensus exists even when objectively it did not, due to the judicial activism of its judges. It has been said that in failing to distinctly define how a consensus is reached reduces its legitimacy. Furthermore, as the ECtHR grows, the consensus between the members diminishes.

However, the margin of appreciation doctrine has also come under sharp criticism from jurists and academics who say that it undermines the universal nature of human rights.

=== Proportionality analysis ===
Proportionality analysis governs much of the Court&#x27;s jurisprudence. The guarantees of ECHR Articles 8, 9, 10, and 11 are subject to whatever limitations may be &quot;necessary in a democratic society,&quot; citing factors including national security, public safety, health and morals, and the rights and freedoms of others. Such conditions require the balancing of individual rights and community interests, as first articulated in the &quot;Belgian Linguistic Case&quot;. Critics maintain that proportionality engenders largely subjective rulings: a judge&#x27;s personal preferences and beliefs may color their perceptions of rights&#x27; relative importance. The Court has established certain formulas to ensure consistency across such decisions, but these guidelines cover only a small fraction of its case law.

==Relationship with other courts==

===European Court of Justice===
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is not institutionally related to the European Court of Human Rights: the two courts are related to distinct organizations. However, since all EU states are members of the Council of Europe and so are parties of the Convention on Human Rights, there are concerns about consistency in case law between the two courts. The CJEU refers to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and treats the Convention on Human Rights as if it were part of the EU&#x27;s legal system since it forms part of the legal principles of the EU member states.

Even though its member states are party to the convention, the European Union itself is not a party, as it did not have competence to do so under previous treaties. However, EU institutions are bound under Article 6 of the EU Treaty of Nice to respect human rights under the convention. Furthermore, since the Treaty of Lisbon took effect on 1 December 2009, the EU is expected to sign the convention. That would mean that the Court of Justice is bound by the judicial precedents of the Court of Human Rights&#x27; case law and so is subject to its human rights law, which would avoid issues of conflicting case law between these two courts. In December 2014, the CJEU released Opinion 2/13 rejecting accession to the Convention.

Despite the European Union&#x27;s failure to accede to the Convention, the ECtHR has consistently held that member states are bound by ECHR guarantees even when executing and implementing EU law. Nevertheless, the Court has simultaneously sought to promote international cooperation and avoid interfering in internal Union affairs. It has balanced the conflicting aims of fostering European harmony and avoiding ECHR circumvention via the &quot;Bosphorus Presumption&quot;, a policy of conditional deference articulated in &quot;Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v Ireland&quot;. Because the CJEU represents a &quot;comparable&quot; human rights enforcement mechanism, the ECtHR may presume &quot;that a State has not departed from the requirements of the Convention when it does no more than implement legal obligations flowing from its [EU] membership.&quot; This presumption may be refuted in any particular instances where protections of Convention rights are &quot;manifestly deficient.&quot;

===National courts===
Most of the contracting parties to the European Convention on Human Rights have incorporated the convention into their own national legal systems, either through constitutional provision, statute or judicial decision. The ECtHR increasingly considers judicial dialogue with national courts to be a &quot;high priority&quot;, especially when it comes to implementation of judgements. According to a 2012 study, the ECTtHR tends to justify its decisions with citations to its own case law in order to convince national courts to accept its rulings.

In 2015, Russia adopted a law declaring it legal to overrule judgements from the ECtHR, codifying an earlier Russian Constitutional Court decision which ruled that Russia could refuse to recognize an ECtHR decision if it conflicted with the Constitution of Russia, and in 2020 Russia made constitutional amendments stipulating that the Russian Constitution supersedes international law. (In March 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a history of disregard for the principles of the Convention, Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe.) Other countries have also moved to restrict the binding nature of the ECtHR judgments, subject to the countries&#x27; own constitutional principles. In 2004, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that judgements handed down by the ECtHR are not always binding on German courts. The Italian Constitutional Court also restricts the applicability of ECtHR decisions.

A 2016 book characterizes Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden to be mostly friendly to ECtHR judgements; France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey to be moderately critical; the United Kingdom to be strongly critical; and Russia to be openly hostile. In 2019, south Caucasus states were judged partially compliant in a law review article.

==Effectiveness==
International law scholars consider the ECtHR to be the most effective international human rights court in the world. According to Michael Goldhaber in &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the European Court of Human Rights&quot;, &quot;Scholars invariably describe it with superlatives&quot;.

===Implementation===

The court lacks enforcement powers. Some states have ignored ECtHR verdicts and continued practices judged to be human rights violations. Although all damages must be paid to the applicant within the time frame specified by the court (usually three months) or else will accumulate interest, there is no formal deadline for any more complex compliance required by the judgement. However, by leaving a judgement unimplemented for a long period of time, brings into question the state&#x27;s commitment to addressing human rights violations in a timely fashion.

The number of non-implemented judgements rose from 2,624 in 2001 to 9,944 at the end of 2016, 48% of which had gone without implementation five years or more. In 2016, all but one of the 47 member countries of the Council of Europe had not implemented at least one ECtHR verdict in a timely fashion, although most non-implemented verdicts concern a few countries: Italy (2,219), Russia (1,540), Turkey (1,342), and Ukraine (1,172). More than 3,200 non-implemented judgements &quot;concerned violations by security forces and poor detention conditions&quot;.

Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, stated: &quot;Our work is based on cooperation and good faith. When you don&#x27;t have that, it&#x27;s very difficult to have an impact. We kind of lack the tools to help countries that don&#x27;t want to be helped.&quot; Russia systematically ignores ECtHR verdicts, paying compensation in most cases but refusing to fix the problem, leading to a high number of repeat cases. Russian legislation has set up a specific fund for paying the claimants in successful ECtHR verdicts.

Notable non-implemented judgements include:
*In &quot;Hirst v. United Kingdom&quot; (2005), and several subsequent cases, the court found that a blanket deprivation of suffrage to British prisoners violated Article 3 of Protocol 1, which guarantees the right to vote. A minimal compromise was implemented in 2017.
*The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was first ruled to be discriminatory in 2009 (&quot;Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;), for preventing Bosnian citizens who were not of Bosniak, Croat, or Serb ethnicity from being elected to certain state offices. As of December 2019, the discriminatory provisions have yet to be repealed or amended, despite three subsequent cases confirming their incompatibility with the Convention.
*In &quot;Alekseyev v. Russia&quot; (2010), the ban on Moscow Pride was judged to violate freedom of assembly. In 2012, Russian courts banned the event for the next 100 years. The ECtHR confirmed its ruling that bans on pride parades violate freedom of assembly rights in &quot;Alekseyev and Others v. Russia&quot; (2018).
* &quot;Bayev and Others v. Russia&quot; (2017), relating to the Russian gay propaganda law and related laws, which the court judged to abridge freedom of speech.
*Azerbaijani opposition politician Ilgar Mammadov, whose imprisonment the ECtHR ruled illegal in 2014; he was still in jail in 2017.
*Following &quot;Burmych and Others v. Ukraine&quot; (2017), the ECtHR dismissed all 12,143 cases following the pattern of &quot;Ivanov v. Ukraine&quot; (2009) as well as any future cases following that pattern, handing them to the Department of Execution at the Council of Europe for enforcement. These cases all involved complainants not being paid money they were due under Ukrainian law. In the eight years between &quot;Ivanov&quot; and &quot;Burmych&quot;, Ukraine made no effort to resolve these cases, leading the ECtHR to &quot;effectively [give] up on trying to incentivize Ukraine to comply with its judgments&quot;. As of 2020, the money owed to the complainants in these cases remains unpaid.

Another issue is delayed implementation of judgements.

===Caseload===

The caseload of the court expanded rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union, growing from fewer than 8,400 cases filed in 1999 to 57,000 in 2009. Most of these cases concern nationals of the former Eastern Bloc where there is less trust in the court system. In 2009, the court had a backlog of 120,000 cases which would have required 46 years to process at the previous rate, leading to reforms. According to the BBC, the court began &quot;to be seen as a victim of its own success&quot;.

Between 2007 and 2017, the number of cases dealt with each year was relatively constant (between 1,280 and 1,550); two-thirds of cases were repetitive and most concerned a few countries: Turkey (2,401), Russia (2,110), Romania (1,341), and Poland (1,272). Repetitive cases indicate a pattern of human rights violations in a given country.
The 2010 Interlaken Declaration stated that the court would reduce its caseload by cutting back on the number of repetitive cases it dealt with. 

As a result of Protocol 14 reforms to reduce caseload, single judges were empowered to reject applications as inadmissible and a system of &quot;pilot judgements&quot; was created to handle repetitive cases without a formal finding for each one. Pending applications peaked at 151,600 in 2011 and were reduced to 59,800 by 2019.

These reforms led to an increasing number of applications being declared inadmissible or bypassed a ruling under the new pilot procedure. According to Steven Greer, &quot;large numbers of applications will not, in practice, be examined&quot;, and this situation is qualified as a &quot;structural denial of justice for certain categories of meritorious applicants whose cases cannot be handled&quot;. Access to justice may also be de facto impeded the lack of legal aid and other factors.

===Impact===
ECtHR rulings have expanded the protection of human rights in every signatory country. Notable rights secured include:
*Article 2: right to life including the abolition of capital punishment, and effective investigation of deaths in custody and due to domestic violence
*Article 3: freedom from torture and ill-treatment, ending police brutality and excessively poor conditions in prisons, banning forced sterilization
*Article 4: Article 4 cases have resulted in the criminalization of forced labor and human trafficking in several countries
*Article 5: liberty and security, such as ending excessive pretrial detention that resulted in innocent people jailed for years
*Article 6: right to a fair trial, including quashing wrongful convictions, limiting the length of judicial proceedings to avoid unfair delays, and securing judicial impartiality
*Article 8: 
**Right to privacy, which has included limits on wiretapping and decriminalization of homosexuality
**Right to family life, including ending child custody regimes which discriminated against men, LGBT people, and religious minorities
*Article 9: freedom of conscience and religion including conscientious objection, right to proselytize, undue burdens on exercise of religion, state interference in religious organizations
*Article 10: freedom of expression protections, including quashing of defamation laws that prohibited expressing unflattering opinions or imposed excessive penalties, protection for whistleblowers and journalists who exposed political corruption or criticized the government
*Article 11: freedom of association and peaceful assembly, such as the right to organize pride parades and political demonstrations
*Article 14 and Protocol 12: right to equal treatment, such as ruling against forms of institutional racism against Romani people
*Protocol 1, Article 1: property rights, including restoration of property illegally confiscated by the state and fair compensation for expropriation

==Honours and awards==
In 2010, the court received the Freedom Medal from the Roosevelt Institute. In 2020, the Greek government nominated the court for the Nobel Peace Prize.

<text>Roxette is a Swedish pop rock duo originally consisting of Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, both of whom were already established musicians in Sweden prior to the band&#x27;s formation. Fredriksson had released a number of successful solo albums, while Gessle had been the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider, a band which had three number one albums in Sweden. Acting on the advice of Rolf Nygren, the CEO of their mutual record label EMI, Fredriksson and Gessle collaborated to record &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, the first single from Roxette&#x27;s 1986 debut album &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot;, which were both hits in Sweden. 

Their international breakthrough came with the release of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; in 1988. The album contained two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones: &quot;The Look&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;. &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, from the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, reached number one as well, as did the lead single of their third studio album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Joyride&quot;. That album is Roxette&#x27;s most successful, selling eleven million copies worldwide. They performed to over 1.5 million people during the &quot;Join the Joyride! Tour&quot;. Subsequent albums included 1992&#x27;s &quot;Tourism&quot;, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;, and 1995&#x27;s greatest hits compilation &quot;Don&#x27;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!&quot;, which each sold at least five million copies worldwide.

&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Room Service&quot; were released in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and earned numerous gold and platinum awards in Europe and Latin America. Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2002, leading to an extended hiatus. The two then released several solo albums, with Gessle also reuniting with Gyllene Tider. Roxette reformed in 2009 for an extensive world tour, which ran until 2016. During this period, they released the albums &quot;Charm School&quot;, &quot;Travelling&quot;, and &quot;Good Karma&quot;. Fredriksson announced her retirement from touring in 2016 due to poor health, and died on 9 December 2019 due to complications stemming from her brain tumour diagnosis.

Roxette is Sweden&#x27;s second-best-selling music act, after ABBA. They sold between 75 and 80 million records worldwide, and are recognised as one of the highest-certified acts of all time in Germany, achieving sales of almost six million units. They had nineteen top 40 hits in the United Kingdom, where the British Phonographic Industry awarded them certifications of over three million units. In the US, they achieved four number ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and have been certified for sales of over three million units by the Recording Industry Association of America. Since 2021, Gessle has released music under the name PG Roxette; their debut album &quot;Pop-Up Dynamo!&quot; was issued in 2022. In 2024, he announced a Roxette tour, with Lena Philipsson hired as vocalist.

== History ==
=== 1978–1987: Formation and &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; ===
Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson had been friends since 1978. Both musicians had successful careers in Sweden in the early 1980s. Gessle was a member of Gyllene Tider, (English: Golden Ages), whose first two albums each sold at least 150,000 copies in Sweden. In 1981, Fredriksson performed backing vocals on Gyllene Tider&#x27;s song &quot;Ingenting av vad du behöver&quot; (English: &quot;Nothing of What You Need&quot;). The following year, Gessle invited Fredriksson to audition for Gyllene Tider&#x27;s producer Lars-Göran &quot;Lasse&quot; Lindbom. Lindbom was impressed by Fredriksson&#x27;s voice, and offered her a recording contract as a solo artist with the Swedish branch of EMI. However, she refused the deal, saying she &quot;lacked the confidence&quot; and was &quot;too nervous&quot; to be a solo artist. She then joined Lindbom&#x27;s band as a backing vocalist for an extensive tour of Sweden.

In 1984, Fredriksson recorded backing vocals for Gyllene Tider&#x27;s debut English album &quot;The Heartland Café&quot;, released in Sweden under the band&#x27;s original name and in EP format in North America under the name Roxette—derived from the Dr. Feelgood song of the same name. Soon after, Fredriksson began releasing folk-based solo albums, beginning with &quot;Het vind&quot; (English: &quot;Hot Wind&quot;) in 1984. Gessle also turned to solo work, releasing his second Swedish-language solo album, &quot;Scener&quot; (English: &quot;Scenes&quot;), in 1985, again featuring Fredriksson on background vocals. Fredriksson issued her second solo album, &quot;Den sjunde vågen&quot; (English: &quot;The Seventh Wave&quot;), in February 1986.

Around this time, the CEO of EMI, Rolf Nygren, suggested Fredriksson and Gessle collaborate together to record a song in English. Fredriksson was warned by friends and industry advisers to not participate with the project, fearing it may impact her burgeoning solo career. Gessle translated a song he wrote called &quot;Svarta glas&quot; (English: &quot;Black Glasses&quot;) into English, which became their first single, &quot;Neverending Love&quot;. It was released in the summer of 1986 under the name Roxette, and the single sold over 50,000 copies in Sweden. Roxette quickly recorded their debut album &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot;, which was issued later in 1986. The album eventually sold over 280,000 copies in Sweden. &quot;Neverending Love&quot; and subsequent single &quot;Soul Deep&quot; were issued as singles internationally, but failed to chart outside Sweden.

In 1987, Roxette issued &quot;Dance Passion&quot;, a remix album of songs from their debut, and embarked on &quot;Rock runt riket&quot; (English: &quot;Rock Around the Kingdom&quot;), a co-headlining tour of Sweden with Eva Dahlgren and Ratata. All three acts collaborated to record &quot;I Want You&quot;, which was released as a non-album single in July. Fredriksson released her third solo album &quot;Efter stormen&quot; (English: &quot;After the Storm&quot;) in October 1987. It was her most successful solo album to date, peaking at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart and being certified platinum by Swedish Recording Industry Association. It won Best Swedish Album at the 1987 Rockbjörnen awards, where Fredriksson also won the award for Best Swedish Female.

Later that year, Roxette released &quot;It Must Have Been Love (Christmas For the Broken Hearted)&quot;. The song was written by Gessle in response to the German division of EMI asking Gessle to &quot;come up with an intelligent Christmas single.&quot; The track was a top five hit in Sweden. However, international divisions of EMI – including Germany – chose not to release the song as a single.

=== 1988–1991: International breakthrough ===
In the duo&#x27;s native Sweden, &quot;Dressed for Success&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; were chosen as the first two singles from their second album &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;, as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to highlight Fredriksson&#x27;s singing. Gessle said, &quot;I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn&#x27;t part of the plan, not for me anyway.&quot; Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No. 1 position for 14 weeks. Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: &quot;To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle&#x27;s once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense.&quot; However, the album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.
When the third single from &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;, &quot;The Look&quot;, became another top 10 single in their home country, Roxette were still unknown internationally. While studying in Sweden an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman, heard &quot;The Look&quot; and brought a copy of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; home for the 1988 holiday break. He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station, KDWB 101.3 FM. The station started playing &quot;The Look&quot;; based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular, and quickly spread to other radio stations. The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market. The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden. Fredriksson dismissed rumors that Cushman was paid to take the record to the radio station.

EMI had previously rejected Roxette as unsuitable for the American market and they did not have a recording contract there, but after the popularity of &quot;The Look&quot; in the US, EMI officials made the decision to release and market the single worldwide. &quot;The Look&quot; and pressed copies of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; were issued in early 1989 to record stores and radio stations. &quot;The Look&quot; became their first No. 1 in the US on 8 April 1989, where it remained for one week. The breakthrough for Roxette became international when the song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, and at the end of the year, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;The Look&quot; one of the 20 biggest Hot 100 singles of the year.

&quot;Dressed for Success&quot;, featuring Fredriksson on lead vocals with Gessle singing short parts, was the second international single. The single peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100 as well as at No. 3 in Australia. &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; was released thereafter; it differed from previous singles and instead resembled the guitar-heavy ballads of Heart. Spending a single week at No. 1 in the US in November 1989, it bore the distinction of being the first US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 not to be commercially available on 7-inch vinyl.

A fourth single, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, was released at the end of the year, entering the Hot 100 at the end of December. The single, a duet between Gessle and Fredriksson, spent two weeks at No. 2 on the Hot 100 in February 1990, and again becoming a worldwide success by reaching the top 10 in important music markets such as Germany and Australia. &quot;Dangerous&quot; was released as a double A-side single in the UK with &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;.

==== &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; – &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; soundtrack ====
It was around this time that Touchstone Pictures approached EMI and Roxette about contributing a song to the soundtrack of an upcoming film, &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Gessle maintained that &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, by then a two-year-old recording, was chosen because Roxette had no time to compose and record a new song. The film&#x27;s producers turned it down, asking for another song, but Gessle declined to produce another song. Some weeks later after re-editing the film before release, the producers re-requested &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, but Roxette had to remove the Christmas lyrics. Gessle and producer Clarence Öfwerman then took the old recording, had Fredriksson replace a single Christmas-reference line in the song and added some instrumentation and background vocal overlays.

Though it was not the first single released from the soundtrack, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; would prove to be Roxette&#x27;s most successful single release. The song spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in June 1990, three months after the film&#x27;s release, and stayed for two additional weeks at No. 2, spending a total of seventeen weeks in the top 40. &quot;Billboard&quot; named the song the No. 2 Hot 100 single of the year, behind Wilson Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Hold On&quot;. The single also topped the charts in more than 20 other countries (including Australia) around the world. In Germany the single spent 9 months in the top 75, and peaked at No. 3 in the UK, the duo&#x27;s highest singles chart position there. The soundtrack went on to be certified three times platinum by the RIAA.

=== 1991–1992: &quot;Joyride&quot; ===
As 1990 wound down, Roxette completed their tour and returned to Sweden to record their follow-up to &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; The 15-track collection titled &quot;Joyride&quot;, which was released in March 1991, became a critical and commercial success. It topped the charts in a number of countries and became Roxette&#x27;s best selling album. Their record company EMI invested almost 2 million dollars on promotion for the album, which stayed at No. 1 in Germany for 13 weeks, while staying on the US album chart for over a year. J.D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine reviewed &quot;Joyride&quot;: &quot;By emphasizing its sense of personality, Roxette delivers more than just well-constructed hooks; this music has heart, something that makes even the catchiest melody more appealing.&quot; The album&#x27;s success brought the duo two Rockbjörnen awards for Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group, the second time they had achieved that feat.

The single &quot;Joyride&quot; became Roxette&#x27;s first No. 1 in their home country. It also topped the charts in more than 25 countries around the world, including Germany, Australia and the US; it was their fourth and last No. 1 in the US. The single also charted well in the UK, and achieved success in Canada, which resulted in the song being nominated in 1992 for a Juno Award in the category, Best Selling Single by a Foreign Artist. Its follow-up, &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)&quot;, a power ballad similar to &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, with Fredriksson on lead, spent a week at No. 2 in the US in July and achieved success in other big markets as well.
Roxette then embarked on an ambitious worldwide tour. The Join the Joyride! World Tour 1991/92 tour eventually reached more than 1.5 million fans in 107 concerts around the world, including a few dates in the US. On reviewing their Universal Amphitheater performance, Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Fredriksson is squandering her talents in pop&#x27;s low-rent district. She&#x27;s clearly superior to Roxette&#x27;s uncomplicated, hook-crammed material...&quot;

The end of 1991 saw the merger of SBK, Chrysalis and EMI record companies, to form EMI Records Group North America. The resulting merger saw many personnel changes that resulted in a downturn in publicity for Roxette. Though &quot;Joyride&quot; was certified platinum and made impressive worldwide sales, the subsequent singles from the album—the ballad &quot;Spending My Time&quot; and &quot;Church of Your Heart&quot;—failed to reach the heights of previous singles in the US charts.

In late 1991, the band was honoured with its own postage stamp in Sweden, along with Lena Philipsson and Jerry Williams.

Music tastes in the U.S. were changing, with the emergence of new genres such as new jack swing, grunge, harder-core rap and hip-hop. As William Ruhlmann of AllMusic later wrote, &quot;Americans probably lost interest [in Roxette] at about the time that Nirvana came roaring in from the Northwest.&quot; In a 2009 interview with BBC News, Gessle highlighted the popularity of Nirvana and grunge music as a contributor to Roxette&#x27;s downturn in success. Although Roxette&#x27;s commercial momentum in America was slowing down dramatically, elsewhere, singles from the &quot;Joyride&quot; album continued to become hits when &quot;Spending My Time&quot; and &quot;The Big L.&quot; charted in many countries.

=== 1992–1993: &quot;Tourism&quot; ===
Roxette continued the &quot;Join the Joyride&quot; tour into 1992. It was during this tour that most of the material for &quot;Tourism: Songs from Studios, Stages, Hotelrooms &amp; Other Strange Places&quot; was recorded. Instead of releasing an album of brand-new material, Gessle and Fredriksson re-mastered older recordings, including several slated for, but not included on, &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot;. They also recorded some of their live performances, recorded a country music-inspired version of &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; in a Los Angeles studio, and recorded new material in various locations around the world – an empty dance club, a hotel room – and compiled everything on to the album. Released in October 1992, Gessle and Fredriksson said &quot;Tourism&quot; was meant to &quot;capture the energy within the band&quot;.

The first single off the album was &quot;How Do You Do!&quot; followed by the ballad &quot;Queen of Rain&quot; and an electrified version of the song &quot;Fingertips&quot;, originally recorded acoustically for the album and re-titled &quot;Fingertips &#x27;93&quot; for single release. Singles from &quot;Tourism&quot; barely dented the American radio and record charts but in the rest of the world, the first single &quot;How Do You Do!&quot;, hit the top 5 in most European and South American countries. The album &quot;Tourism&quot; also charted well outside of the US, reaching No. 1 in Germany and Sweden, No. 2 in the UK as well as peaking at No. 3 in Australia. The album sold 6 million copies worldwide. The duo&#x27;s success reflected in an ECHO Award nomination for International Group of the Year. At home, Roxette won a Rockbjörnen Award for Best Swedish Group. It remains the last Rockbjörnen the duo received. In October 1992, Fredriksson released her first solo album in Swedish for five years, titled &quot;Den ständiga resan&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Journey&quot;).
In early 1993, Roxette became the first non-native-English speaking artists to be featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; series, though the songs from the performance were never released on an official &quot;Unplugged&quot; album. In the same year, Roxette recorded and released &quot;Almost Unreal&quot;, a song originally slated for the film &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; starring Bette Midler. However, the song was moved to the soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay, &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; managed to briefly reach the lower end of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10, the group&#x27;s first time there since &quot;Joyride&quot; two years before. Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song, with Fredriksson saying it was &quot;not one of our most inspired moments.&quot; On the other hand, Gessle stated: &quot;I still like the song in a way... but if you wanted to make a parody of Roxette, it would probably sound something like this.&quot; To coincide with the UK television premiere of the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; was re-issued in September 1993 and entered the UK and Irish singles charts for the second time.

=== 1994–1998: &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!&quot; ===
 Roxette changed their musical style with the 1994 release of &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; Bryan Buss of Allmusic wrote, &quot;They rock harder than on their pop-friendly albums prior to this, and the result shows growth but not the fun that made them so popular in the first place... Though the two have an edge on this album, they almost seem to have become a bit bored.&quot;

Although &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; saw chart success (No. 1 in Sweden, No. 2 in Germany and No. 3 in Australia and the UK), it sold fewer copies than had their previous albums, selling 5 million copies worldwide. EMI America were reluctant to release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track &quot;Favorites&quot; CD in association with McDonald&#x27;s. The &quot;Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald&#x27;s promotion CD (and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John) led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion for several reasons, including that it bypassed established music stores and that the price of the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI&#x27;s distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. The duo&#x27;s relations with EMI&#x27;s North American subsidiary, which had never been smooth, collapsed after the release of this album. &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; became the last Roxette release EMI issued in the US until &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.

The first single release from &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; was &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot;. The distortion guitar-heavy pop song, born out of anger and frustration of the album&#x27;s grown up nature, reached No. 2 in Canada, as well as the top 10 in 7 European countries (including No. 1 in Sweden) as well as the top 15 in the UK, Australia and Germany. However, in the US, it was less successful, reaching only No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Subsequent releases--the album&#x27;s title selection, &quot;Fireworks&quot;, and &quot;Run to You&quot;—were less successful but managed to reach the charts in some countries.

Roxette then embarked on another, albeit scaled-down, worldwide tour, skipping North America in the process. The &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang! Tour&quot; saw Roxette becoming the first Western band to be allowed to perform in China (Workers&#x27; Indoor Arena, Beijing) since Wham! in 1985. The procedure to get permission for this concert took over a year, and included self-censorship of lyrics. In 2008 they were ordered to pay 4.5 million kronor in unpaid taxes to the Swedish Tax Agency, for money earned during the German part of the 1994/95 tour.

In October 1995, Roxette released their first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!&quot; This reached the top 5 in many European countries, including the UK, as well as the top 10 in Australia. The compilation sold 6 million copies worldwide, and featured four new songs, three of which were released as singles, including the ballad &quot;You Don&#x27;t Understand Me&quot;, co-written by Desmond Child. Also that year, a compilation of demos, B-sides and remixes, alongside some of the 1993 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; material, was released in Japan and parts of South America under the title &quot;Rarities&quot;.

Gessle briefly reunited with Gyllene Tider in 1996, then Roxette took instrumental masters of many of its ballads and recorded translated Spanish lyrics over them. The resulting album, &quot;Baladas En Español&quot;, sold well in Spanish-speaking regions, reaching 2× platinum in Spain and platinum in Argentina. The single &quot;Un día sin ti&quot; (&quot;Spending My Time&quot;) accompanied by a video directed by Jonas Åkerlund, became their first Latin Pop Airplay chart entry. The duo then released solo albums, &quot;I en tid som vår&quot; (&quot;In a Time Like Ours&quot;) by Fredriksson and &quot;The World According to Gessle&quot; by Gessle, with both charting in Sweden.

=== 1999–2001: &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Room Service&quot; ===
Gessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 to record material for a new Roxette album, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, which was released in February 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe. It entered at No. 1 in Sweden and No. 2 in Germany. The first single, &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot;, became their highest-charting UK single since 1993 (No. 11). In Sweden it charted at No. 4, their best position since &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot;. Although the second single, &quot;Anyone&quot;, did not chart well in Europe, &quot;Stars&quot;, the third single, charted well in Scandinavian and German-speaking countries. &quot;NME&quot;″s review called &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; &quot;...another clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock.&quot; A review of &quot;I Wish I Could Fly&quot; written by Håkan Steen of &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; said, &quot;The come-back single is a disappointment. The lyrics, which convey a sense of distance in a relationship, are not particularly engaging.&quot; The album, according to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, was under discussion for release in the US, but ultimately, it was not released there.

In 2000, Fredriksson released a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation called &quot;Äntligen&quot; (&quot;At Last&quot;), which went on to be a big seller in Sweden, peaking at No. 1 for three weeks. Meanwhile, Roxette signed a US distribution deal with Edel Music, which re-released &quot;Don&#x27;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!&quot; In doing so, it replaced some non-US hits with songs from &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. To promote the release the duo did a small tour of The United States, performing at the Boston Mixfest and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. The single &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot;, included on the album, reached No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and No. 40 on the Adult Top 40 chart.

&quot;Room Service&quot; followed in 2001, to a mixed response from critics. &quot;Probably the best Roxette album since &quot;Joyride&quot;,&quot; wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic, &quot;&quot;Room Service&quot; is an exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed.&quot; Per Bjurman from Swedish tabloid &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; was critical of the album. &quot;It is not very good.&quot; he wrote. He did praise the three singles, &quot;Real Sugar&quot;, &quot;The Centre of the Heart&quot;, and &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot;, but he ended the review with the prediction: &quot;Roxette is not finished. But soon, I suspect.&quot;

The album topped the Swedish charts and reached No. 3 in Germany, but it received little attention in the UK. A planned US release through Edel America Records did not happen as the label was disbanded due to financial difficulties, though it did peak at No. 2 on CNN&#x27;s Worldbeat album chart. The first single, &quot;The Centre of the Heart&quot; topped the charts in Sweden, made the top 10 in Spain, and the top 15 in Finland. The other singles, &quot;Real Sugar&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track and &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot; were less successful. Roxette again went on tour, this time in Europe only, as concerts planned in South Africa were cancelled after the 11 September 2001 attacks. On reviewing their Löfbergs Lila Arena concert, Bjurman from &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; wrote, &quot;Roxette succeed in all cases, to never leave the 80s.&quot; His review criticised Roxette&#x27;s playlist, which consisted of some of their early hits. Johan Lindqvist from &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot; was more positive, scoring their Munich concert four stars out of five.

=== 2002–2008: Fredriksson&#x27;s illness, compilation albums and solo work ===
Roxette received an honorary award from the Swedish government at the February 2002 Grammis ceremony. On 11 September 2002, Fredriksson had an epileptic seizure and fractured her skull after collapsing in her bathroom. Following MRI scans, it was confirmed that Fredriksson had a brain tumour. The diagnosis led to the cancellation of Roxette&#x27;s planned performance at the 2002 Night of the Proms concert series. After waiting several weeks for the fracture to subside, she underwent surgery to remove the malignant tumour, followed by months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Fredriksson was unable to speak for a considerable period of time afterward, and for the rest of her life was unable to read, was blind in one eye, and had limited hearing and mobility.

Roxette issued two greatest hits compilations, &quot;The Ballad Hits&quot; in late 2002 and &quot;The Pop Hits&quot; in early 2003. On December 1, 2002, a 600-page discography book titled &quot;The Look for Roxette&quot; was released, which included a four-song EP of previously unreleased material. The release of &quot;The Ballad Hits&quot; was delayed until Valentine&#x27;s Day 2003 in English-speaking territories such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In January 2003, Roxette received the Litteris et Artibus (&quot;Culture and Education&quot;) award from King of Sweden Carl Gustaf XVI, for &quot;achievements in Sweden and internationally&quot;. &quot;The Ballad Hits&quot; sold over a million copies within a year, and was the best-selling album released by a Scandinavian act that year. The duo received a World Music Award for the Best Selling Scandinavian Artist in October 2003. 

In 2003, Gessle released &quot;Mazarin&quot; (&quot;Cake&quot;), which became his most successful solo album. The record sold over 335,000 copies in Sweden as of January 2005, and received numerous awards. Gyllene Tider reformed to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2004, releasing the studio album &quot;Finn 5 fel!&quot; (&quot;Find 5 Errors!&quot;) in June, their first new material since 1996. That album was also successful, selling 230,000 copies in Sweden by January 2005. 

Fredriksson released her first English-language solo album, &quot;The Change&quot;, in October 2004, which debuted atop the Swedish albums chart. Despite being unable to read or write, Fredriksson rediscovered her love of drawing during her illness, and began using charcoal to create artwork as a form of therapy. She drew the cover art for &quot;The Change&quot;, and held her first art exhibition – titled &quot;After the Change&quot; – at the vernissage of the Doktor Glas gallery in Kungsträdgården, Stockholm in October 2005. The following month, Gessle released his second English-language studio solo album, &quot;Son of a Plumber&quot;.

Also in 2005, several remixes of Roxette songs became hit singles. A remix of &quot;Fading Like a Flower&quot; by Dancing DJs was a top twenty hit in the UK, while Belgian dance group DHT&#x27;s 2003 trance cover of &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; became a top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was certified gold by the RIAA. 

Fredriksson released her seventh solo album in June 2006, an album of Swedish cover songs titled &quot;Min bäste vän&quot; (&quot;My Best Friend&quot;). To commemorate their 20th anniversary, Roxette issued the four-disc box set &quot;The Rox Box/Roxette 86–06&quot; on 18 October 2006. The set also included a DVD containing all their music videos and a previously-unreleased 1993 concert for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. Roxette recorded two new songs for the box set, &quot;One Wish&quot; and &quot;Reveal&quot;, which both featured on a new greatest hits album, &quot;A Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs!&quot;, released on the same date as &quot;The Rox Box&quot;. Gessle released two more solo albums: &quot;En händig man&quot; (&quot;A Handy Man&quot;) in 2007 and &quot;Party Crasher&quot; in 2008.

=== 2009–2016: Reformation, touring and studio albums ===

Rumours of a Roxette reunion began in April 2009 when Gessle was interviewed by the BBC, where he said he world &quot;love to do more Roxette and I would love to do more recordings as well, because [Marie is] a great person and a great singer, but I don&#x27;t want to push her at all. It&#x27;s really up to her. If she calls me up and tells me &#x27;I&#x27;m ready&#x27;, I&#x27;d say &#x27;Let&#x27;s go for it&#x27;.&quot; Fredriksson joined Gessle on stage during the 6 May 2009 date of Gessle&#x27;s &quot;Party Crasher Tour&quot; in Amsterdam. Immediately after the concert, Gessle announced to Swedish publication &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; that Roxette would perform at the 2009 edition of Night of the Proms. Roxette was scheduled to perform at the 2002 edition of the tour, but withdrew because of Fredriksson&#x27;s illness. The tour began on 23 October 2009 and consisted of 42 dates in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. On the same date the tour began, Gessle confirmed to Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; that Roxette had been recording material for a new album since May.

In 2010, the band performed a series of warm-up concerts in Europe, along with a June concert at the Stockholm Concert Hall for the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling. Roxette embarked on &quot;The Neverending World Tour&quot; at the beginning of 2011, an extensive worldwide tour. Their eighth studio album, &quot;Charm School&quot;, was released on 11 February 2011, preceded by lead single &quot;She&#x27;s Got Nothing On (But the Radio)&quot; on 10 January. The song was Roxette&#x27;s highest-peaking single in Germany since 1992&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Do!&quot;, while the album was their first since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Tourism&quot; to peak at number one in Germany. The album was certified gold and peaked within the top twenty of numerous European territories. It sold half a million copies worldwide by the end of 2011.

During &quot;The Neverending World Tour&quot;, Roxette recorded &quot;Travelling&quot;, an album of new studio recordings, live tracks and soundcheck performances. The album was issued in March 2012, and was preceded by &quot;It&#x27;s Possible&quot; as the lead single. The song was A-listed on BBC Radio 2. By April 2012, Roxette had performed to over a million people during &quot;The Neverending World Tour&quot;. In 2013, Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider. The band embarked on a tour of large arenas and stadiums in Sweden, and released the album &quot;Dags att tänka på refrängen&quot; (&quot;Time to Think About the Chorus&quot;). That same year, Fredriksson issued the solo album &quot;Nu!&quot; (&quot;Now!&quot;), and also embarked on a solo tour of Sweden. Roxette issued their first live album in late 2013, &quot;&quot;, which was also issued as part of a DVD and Blu-ray box set.

Roxette resumed touring in late 2014. They issued another greatest hits compilation, &quot;Roxette XXX – The 30 Biggest Hits&quot;, from late 2014, while an updated version of their 2006 box set &quot;The Rox Box/Roxette 86–06&quot;, titled &quot;The RoxBox!: A Collection of Roxette&#x27;s Greatest Songs&quot;, was released in Australia in early 2015. They continued touring in 2015, and in July released &quot;The Look (2015 Remake)&quot;, a new recording of their 1988 single. French DJ Sebastien Drums created a remix and music video for a new Roxette song titled &quot;Some Other Summer&quot;, which was released in late 2015. &quot;Roxette Diaries&quot;, a documentary directed by Jonas Åkerlund, was released on video on demand services in March 2016. The following month, Fredriksson announcing her retirement from touring. She was advised by doctors to stop all touring activity, due to poor health. She issued a statement saying: &quot;Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that [have] followed us on our long and winding journey.&quot; By the end of the tour, Roxette had performed to 2.5 million people (excluding music festival appearances) in over 50 countries.

Roxette&#x27;s tenth and final studio album, &quot;Good Karma&quot;, was released in June 2016. The album is more electronic than the other albums the duo released following their reformation. It was produced by Gessle alongside regular producers Clarence Öfwerman and Christoffer Lundquist, and Swedish duo Addeboy vs. Cliff, with whom Roxette had collaborated on the 2015 remix of &quot;The Look&quot;. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;It Just Happens&quot;, &quot;Some Other Summer&quot;, and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Bring Me Flowers?&quot;.

===2017–2023: Fredriksson and Alsing&#x27;s deaths, vault releases and PG Roxette===
Fredriksson and Gessle resumed solo work following the release of &quot;Good Karma&quot;. Gessle released two Swedish-language solo albums in 2017, &quot;En vacker natt&quot; (&quot;A Beautiful Night&quot;) and &quot;En vacker dag&quot; (&quot;A Beautiful Day&quot;). His tenth solo album, &quot;Small Town Talk&quot;, was released in 2018, and consisted of English versions of songs from &quot;En vacker natt&quot; and &quot;En vacker dag&quot;. All three records were recorded in Nashville. Fredriksson released the non-album singles &quot;Alone Again&quot; and &quot;I Want to Go&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Sing Me a Song&quot; in 2018. Roxette issued a 30th-anniversary edition of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; in October 2018, containing a bonus disc of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. Gessle toured Europe in October and November 2018 as &quot;Per Gessle&#x27;s Roxette&quot;, with set lists for the tour consisting primarily of songs from Roxette&#x27;s back catalogue.

Marie Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019, at the age of 61. Her cause of death was not initially specified, but it was later confirmed she died from complications stemming from her 2002 brain tumour diagnosis. Paying tribute to Fredriksson, Gessle said she was &quot;the most wonderful friend for over 40 years&quot;, and &quot;an outstanding musician, a master of the voice, an amazing performer.&quot; Gessle released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Gammal kärlek rostar aldrig&quot; (&quot;Old Love Never Rusts&quot;), in November 2020. A four-disc compilation of Roxette outtakes titled &quot;Bag of Trix&quot; was released the following month. An outtake from the &quot;Good Karma&quot; sessions, &quot;Let Your Heart Dance with Me&quot;, was issued as the lead single from the compilation two months earlier. It was one of the final songs Fredriksson recorded before her death. On 19 December 2020, Roxette&#x27;s longtime drummer Pelle Alsing died at the age of 60.

In 2021, Roxette released a 30th-anniversary edition of &quot;Joyride&quot;, containing two bonus discs of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. That same year, Gessle created a new project called PG Roxette. The band features Gessle alongside vocalists Helena Josefsson and Dea Norberg, who had both provided vocals on Gessle&#x27;s previous work, either on his solo material or as backing vocalists on Roxette&#x27;s live shows. The band&#x27;s first release was a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, released on &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot; in September 2021. The following year, Roxette digitally issued a triple volume compilation of remixes titled &quot;ROX RMX (Remixes from the Roxette Vaults)&quot;. PG Roxette released their debut album, &quot;Pop-Up Dynamo!&quot;, in October 2022, with a 4-track EP titled &quot;Incognito&quot; following in 2023.

=== 2024–present: Live reformation and musical ===
On 2 May 2024, Gessle announced the live reformation of Roxette. With Lena Philipsson taking over on lead vocals, the band will tour Australia and South Africa from February 2025. A 3-CD box set of &quot;ROX RMX (Remixes from the Roxette Vaults)&quot; was released in September 2024. A musical titled &quot;Joyride – The Musical&quot;, based on Roxette&#x27;s music and Jane Fallon&#x27;s book &quot;Got You Back&quot;, will run at Malmö Opera from September 2024 until April 2025.

==Impact and legacy==

Roxette is Sweden&#x27;s best-selling music act after ABBA. Roxette have sold between 75 and 80 million records worldwide. They sold over 5.7 million records in Germany, where they are recognised as one of the highest-certified acts of all time. In the United Kingdom, Roxette had nineteen top 40 hits, and the British Phonographic Industry have certified the band for shipments of over 3 million units.

In the United States, the RIAA awarded them certifications of 3.5 million units. They have sold over two million albums in the country since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in May 1991. Roxette achieved four number one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;The Look&quot;, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot;. Gessle is the sole-credited writer on three of these songs, making him one of the most successful solo songwriters on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 history. Roxette songs continue to receive extensive airplay. In 2014, both &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; and &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; received awards from music publisher Broadcast Music, Inc., after each song had been played on US radio five million times. &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; received an updated award in 2021, following its six millionth play.

<text>A serial killer (also called a serial murderer) is a person who murders three or more people, with the killings taking place over a significant period of time in separate events. Their psychological gratification is the motivation for the killings, and many serial murders involve sexual contact with the victims at different points during the murder process. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that the motives of serial killers can include anger, thrill-seeking, attention seeking, and financial gain, and killings may be executed as such. The victims tend to have things in common, such as demographic profile, appearance, gender, or race. As a group, serial killers suffer from a variety of personality disorders. Most are often not adjudicated as insane under the law. Although a serial killer is a distinct classification that differs from that of a mass murderer, spree killer, or contract killer, there are overlaps between them.

==Etymology and definition==
The English term and concept of &quot;serial killer&quot; are commonly attributed to former Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Robert Ressler, who used the term &quot;serial homicide&quot; in 1974 in a lecture at Police Staff College, in Bramshill, Hampshire, England. Author Ann Rule postulates in her 2004 book &quot;Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, that the English-language credit for coining the term goes to Los Angeles Police Department detective Pierce Brooks, who created the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) system in 1985.

The German term and concept were coined by criminologist Ernst Gennat, who described Peter Kürten as a &quot; (&#x27;serial-murderer&#x27;) in his article &quot; (1930). In his book, &quot;Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters&quot; (2004), criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky notes that while Ressler might have coined the English term &quot;serial homicide&quot; within the law in 1974, the terms &quot;serial murder&quot; and &quot;serial murderer&quot; appear in John Brophy&#x27;s book &quot;The Meaning of Murder&quot; (1966). The Washington, D.C., newspaper &quot;Evening Star&quot;, in a 1967 review of the book:

Vronsky states that the term &quot;serial killing&quot; first entered into broader American popular usage when published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in early 1981, to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams. Subsequently, throughout the 1980s, the term was used again in the pages of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, one of the major national news publications of the United States, on 233 occasions. By the end of the 1990s, the use of the term had increased to 2,514 instances in the paper.

When defining serial killers, researchers generally use &quot;three or more murders&quot; as the baseline, considering it sufficient to provide a pattern without being overly restrictive. Independent of the number of murders, they need to have been committed at different times, and are usually committed in different places. The lack of a cooling-off period (a significant break between the murders) marks the difference between a spree killer and a serial killer. The category has, however, been found to be of no real value to law enforcement, because of definitional problems relating to the concept of a &quot;cooling-off period.&quot; Cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent &quot;cooling off period&quot; or &quot;return to normality&quot; have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of &quot;spree-serial killer&quot;.

In &quot;Controversial Issues in Criminology&quot;, Fuller and Hickey write that &quot;[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers&quot;, later elaborating that spree killers &quot;will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks&quot; while the &quot;methods of murder and types of victims vary&quot;. Andrew Cunanan is given as an example of spree killing, while Charles Whitman is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and Jeffrey Dahmer with serial killing.

In 2005, the FBI hosted a multi-disciplinary symposium in San Antonio, Texas, which brought together 135 experts on serial murder from a variety of fields and specialties with the goal of identifying the commonalities of knowledge regarding serial murder. The group also settled on a definition of serial murder which FBI investigators widely accept as their standard: &quot;The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events&quot;. Serial homicide researcher Enzo Yaksic found that the FBI was justified in lowering the victim threshold from three to two victims given that serial murderers from these groups share similar pathologies.

==History==

===Early accounts===
Historical criminologists suggest that there have been serial killers throughout history. Some sources suggest that legends such as werewolves and vampires were inspired by medieval serial killers. In Africa, there have been periodic outbreaks of murder by leopard men. Liu Pengli of China, nephew of the Han Emperor Jing, was made Prince of Jidong in the sixth year of the middle period of Jing&#x27;s reign (144 BC). According to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, he would &quot;go out on marauding expeditions with 20 or 30 slaves or with young men who were in hiding from the law, murdering people and seizing their belongings for sheer sport&quot;. Although many of his subjects knew about these murders, it was not until the 29th year of his reign that the son of one of his victims finally sent a report to the emperor. Eventually, it was discovered that he had murdered at least 100 people. The officials of the court requested that Liu Pengli be executed; however, the emperor could not bear to have his own nephew killed, so Liu Pengli was made a commoner and banished. In the 9th century (year 257 of the Islamic Calendar), &quot;a strangler from Baghdad was apprehended. He had murdered a number of women and buried them in the house where he was living.&quot; 

===Inside and outside the United States===

The majority of documented serial killers were active in the United States. In one study of serial homicide in South Africa, many patterns were similar to established patterns in the U.S., with some exceptions: no offenders were female, offenders were lower educated than in the U.S., and both victims and offenders were predominantly black. 

In the 15th century, one of the wealthiest men in Europe and a former companion-in-arms of Joan of Arc, Gilles de Rais, was alleged to have sexually assaulted and killed peasant children, mainly boys, whom he had abducted from the surrounding villages and had taken to his castle. It is estimated that his victims numbered between 140 and 800. Similarly, the Hungarian aristocrat Elizabeth Báthory, born into one of the wealthiest families in Transylvania, allegedly tortured and killed as many as 650 girls and young women before her arrest in 1610.

Between 1564 and 1589, German farmer Peter Stumpp killed 14 children, including his own son. He also murdered two pregnant women and had an incestuous relationship with his daughter. Stumpp claimed to have been granted the ability to turn into a werewolf by the Devil. As punishment for his crimes, Stumpp was put on a torture wheel and executed. His head was later severed and put on a pole next to the figure of a wolf to scare other people away from claiming themselves werewolves too. 

Members of the Thuggee cult in India may have murdered a million people between 1740 and 1840. Thug Behram, a member of the cult, may have murdered as many as 931 victims. In his 1886 book, &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;, psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing noted a case of a serial murderer in the 1870s, a Frenchman named Eusebius Pieydagnelle who had a sexual obsession with blood and confessed to murdering six people.
The unidentified killer Jack the Ripper, who has been called the first modern serial killer, killed at least five women, and possibly more, in London in 1888. He was the subject of a massive manhunt and investigation by the Metropolitan Police, during which many modern criminal investigation techniques were pioneered. A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries, forensic material was collected and suspects were identified and traced. Police surgeon Thomas Bond assembled one of the earliest character profiles of the offender.

The Ripper murders also marked an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists. While not the first serial killer in history, Jack the Ripper&#x27;s case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. The dramatic murders of financially destitute women in the midst of the wealth of London focused the media&#x27;s attention on the plight of the urban poor and gained coverage worldwide. Jack the Ripper has also been called the most infamous serial killer of all time, and his legend has spawned hundreds of theories on his real identity and many works of fiction.

H. H. Holmes was a serial killer in the United States, responsible for the death of at least nine victims in the early 1890s. The case was one of the first involving a serial murderer that gained widespread notoriety and publicity through sensationalized accounts in William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspapers. However, at the same time of the Holmes case, in France, Joseph Vacher became known as &quot;The French Ripper&quot; after killing and mutilating 11 women and children. He was executed in 1898 after confessing to his crimes.

Another notable non-American serial killer is Pedro Lopez, a murderer from South America, who killed a minimum of 110 young girls between 1969 and 1980. However, he claims that the number is over 300. He was released from a mental facility in 1998 and his whereabouts are still unknown. He is commonly nicknamed the &quot;Monster of the Andes&quot;. An additional non-American serial killer is Luis Garavito from Colombia. Garavito would kill and torture boys using various disguises. He murdered around 140 boys ranging in ages from 8 to 16. He would dump his victims&#x27; bodies in mass graves.

===Late 20th century===
The serial killing phenomenon in the United States was especially prominent from 1970 to 2000, which has been described as the &quot;golden age of serial murder&quot;. The cause of the spike in serial killings has been attributed to urbanization, which put people in close proximity and offered anonymity. The number of active serial killers in the United States peaked in 1989 and has been steadily trending downward since, coinciding with an overall decrease in crime in the United States since that time. The decline in serial killers has no known single cause but is attributed to a number of factors. Mike Aamodt, emeritus professor at Radford University in Virginia, attributes the decline in number of serial killings to less frequent use of parole, improved forensic technology, and people behaving more cautiously. Causes for the general reduction in violent crime following the 1990s include increased incarceration in the United States, the end of the crack epidemic in the United States, and decreased lead exposure in early childhood.

==Characteristics==
Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following:
* They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness or psychopathy, which may contribute to their homicidal behavior.
** For example, someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities.
** Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and predatory behavior. Psychopaths can seem &#x27;normal&#x27; and often quite charming, a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the &quot;mask of sanity&quot;.
* They were often abused—emotionally, physically, or sexually—by a family member.
* Serial killers may be more likely to engage in fetishism, partialism or necrophilia, which are paraphilias that involve a strong tendency to experience the object of erotic interest almost as if it were a physical representation of the symbolized body. Individuals engage in paraphilias which are organized along a continuum; participating in varying levels of fantasy perhaps by focusing on body parts (partialism), symbolic objects which serve as physical extensions of the body (fetishism), or the anatomical physicality of the human body; specifically regarding its inner parts and sexual organs (one example being necrophilia).
* A disproportionate number exhibit Macdonald triad predictors of future violent behavior:
** Many are fascinated with fire setting.
** They are involved in sadistic activity; especially in children who have not reached sexual maturity, this activity may take the form of torturing animals.
** More than 60 percent, or simply a large proportion, wet their beds beyond the age of 12.
* They were frequently bullied or socially isolated as children. For example, Henry Lee Lucas was ridiculed as a child and later cited the mass rejection by his peers as a cause for his hatred of everyone. Kenneth Bianchi was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants, suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.
* Some were involved in petty crimes, such as fraud, theft, vandalism, or similar offenses.
* Often, they have trouble staying employed and tend to work in menial jobs. The FBI, however, states, &quot;Serial murderers often seem normal; have families and/or a steady job.&quot; Other sources state they often come from unstable families.
* Studies have suggested that serial killers who got caught generally have an average or low-average IQ, although they are often described, and perceived, as possessing IQs in the above-average range. A sample of 202 IQs of serial killers who got caught had a median IQ of 89. Some organized serial killers who got caught have a slightly higher IQ score averaging a little bit over 99, to where disorganized killers average just under 93 in theirs. The average IQ of serial killers who got caught is 94.7.

There are exceptions to these criteria, however. For example, Harold Shipman was a successful professional (a General Practitioner working for the NHS). He was considered a pillar of the local community; he even won a professional award for a children&#x27;s asthma clinic and was interviewed by Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; on ITV. Dennis Nilsen was an ex-soldier turned civil servant and trade unionist who had no previous criminal record when arrested. Neither was known to have exhibited many of the tell-tale signs. Vlado Taneski, a crime reporter, was a career journalist who was caught after a series of articles he wrote gave clues that he had murdered people. Russell Williams was a successful and respected career Royal Canadian Air Force Colonel who was convicted of murdering two women, along with fetish burglaries and rapes.
===Development===
Many serial killers have faced similar problems in their childhood development. Hickey&#x27;s Trauma Control Model explains how early childhood trauma can set the child up for deviant behavior in adulthood; the child&#x27;s environment (either their parents or society) is the dominant factor determining whether or not the child&#x27;s behavior escalates into homicidal activity.

Family, or lack thereof, is the most prominent part of a child&#x27;s development because it is what the child can identify with on a regular basis. &quot;The serial killer is no different from any other individual who is instigated to seek approval from parents, sexual partners, or others.&quot; This need for approval is what influences children to attempt to develop social relationships with their family and peers. &quot;The quality of their attachments to parents and other members of the family is critical to how these children relate to and value other members of society.&quot;

Wilson and Seaman (1990) conducted a study on incarcerated serial killers, and what they concluded was the most influential factor that contributed to their homicidal activity. Almost all of the serial killers in the study had experienced some sort of environmental problems during their childhood, such as a broken home caused by divorce, or a lack of a parental figure to discipline the child. Nearly half of the serial killers had experienced some type of physical or sexual abuse, and more of them had experienced emotional neglect.

When a parent has a drug or alcohol problem, the attention in the household is on the parents rather than the child. This neglect of the child leads to the lowering of their self-esteem and helps develop a fantasy world in which they are in control. Hickey&#x27;s Trauma Control Model supports how parental neglect can facilitate deviant behavior, especially if the child sees substance abuse in action. This then leads to disposition (the inability to attach), which can further lead to homicidal behavior, unless the child finds a way to develop substantial relationships and fight the label they receive. If a child receives no support from anyone, then they are unlikely to recover from the traumatic event in a positive way. As stated by E. E. Maccoby, &quot;the family has continued to be seen as a major—perhaps &quot;the&quot; major—arena for socialization&quot;.

====Chromosomal makeup====
There have been studies looking into the possibility that an abnormality with one&#x27;s chromosomes could be the trigger for serial killers. Two serial killers, Bobby Joe Long and Richard Speck, came to attention for reported chromosomal abnormalities. Long had an extra X chromosome. Speck was erroneously reported to have an extra Y chromosome; in fact, his karyotype was performed twice and was normal each time. While attempts have been made to link the XYY karyotype to violence, including serial murder, research has consistently found little or no association between violent criminal behaviour and an extra Y chromosome.

====Fantasy====
Children who do not have the power to control the mistreatment they suffer sometimes create a new reality to which they can escape. This new reality becomes their fantasy that they have total control of and becomes part of their daily existence. In this fantasy world, their emotional development is guided and maintained. According to Garrison (1996), &quot;the child becomes sociopathic because the normal development of the concepts of right and wrong and empathy towards others is retarded because the child&#x27;s emotional and social development occurs within his self-centered fantasies. A person can do no wrong in his own world and the pain of others is of no consequence when the purpose of the fantasy world is to satisfy the needs of one person&quot; (Garrison, 1996). Boundaries between fantasy and reality are lost and fantasies turn to dominance, control, sexual conquest, and violence, eventually leading to murder. Fantasy can lead to the first step in the process of a dissociative state, which, in the words of Stephen Giannangelo, &quot;allows the serial killer to leave the stream of consciousness for what is, to him, a better place&quot;.

Criminologist Jose Sanchez reports, &quot;The young criminal you see today is more detached from his victim, more ready to hurt or kill. The lack of empathy for their victims among young criminals is just one symptom of a problem that afflicts the whole society.&quot; Lorenzo Carcaterra, author of &quot;Gangster&quot; (2001), explains how potential criminals are labeled by society, which can then lead to their offspring also developing in the same way through the cycle of violence. The ability for serial killers to appreciate the mental life of others is severely compromised, presumably leading to their dehumanization of others. This process may be considered an expression of the intersubjectivity associated with a cognitive deficit regarding the capability to make sharp distinctions between other people and inanimate objects. For these individuals, objects can appear to possess animistic or humanistic power while people are perceived as objects. Before he was executed, serial killer Ted Bundy stated media violence and pornography had stimulated and increased his need to commit homicide, although this statement was made during last-ditch efforts to appeal his death sentence.

===Organized, disorganized, and mixed===
In the 1970s and 1980s, FBI profilers instigated a simple division of serial killers into &quot;organized&quot; and &quot;disorganized&quot;; that is, those who plan their crimes, and those who act on impulse. The FBI&#x27;s &quot;Crime Classification Manual&quot; now places serial killers into three categories: &quot;organized&quot;, &quot;disorganized&quot;, and &quot;mixed&quot; (i.e., offenders who exhibit organized and disorganized characteristics). Some killers descend from organized to disorganized as their killings continue, as in the case of psychological decompensation or overconfidence due to having evaded capture.

Organized serial killers often plan their crimes methodically, usually abducting victims, killing them in one place and disposing of them in another. They often lure the victims with ploys appealing to their sense of sympathy. Others specifically target prostitutes, who are likely to go voluntarily with a stranger. These killers maintain a high degree of control over the crime scene and usually have a solid knowledge of forensic science that enables them to cover their tracks, such as burying the body or weighing it down and sinking it in a river. They follow their crimes in the news media carefully and often take pride in their actions as if it were all a grand project.

Often, organized killers have social and other interpersonal skills sufficient to enable them to develop both personal and romantic relationships, friends and lovers and sometimes even attract and maintain a spouse and sustain a family including children. Among serial killers, those of this type are in the event of their capture most likely to be described by acquaintances as kind and unlikely to hurt anyone. Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are examples of organized serial killers. In general, the IQs of organized serial killers tend to be normal range, with a mean of 98.7.

Disorganized serial killers are usually far more impulsive, often committing their murders with a random weapon available at the time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body. They are likely to be unemployed, a loner, or both, with very few friends. They often turn out to have a history of mental illness, and their modus operandi (M.O.) or lack thereof is often marked by excessive violence and sometimes necrophilia or sexual violence. Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 89.4. Mixed serial killers, with both organized and disorganized traits, have an average IQ of 100.9, but a low sample size.

===Medical professionals===
Some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death tend to be attracted to medical professions or acquiring such a job. These kinds of killers are sometimes referred to as &quot;angels of death&quot; or angels of mercy. Medical professionals will kill their patients for money, for a sense of sadistic pleasure, for a belief that they are &quot;easing&quot; the patient&#x27;s pain, or simply &quot;because they can&quot;. Perhaps the most prolific of these was the British doctor Harold Shipman. Another such killer was nurse Jane Toppan, who admitted during her murder trial that she was sexually aroused by death. She would administer a drug mixture to patients she chose as her victims, lie in bed with them and hold them close to her body as they died.

Another medical professional serial killer is Genene Jones. It is believed she killed 11 to 46 infants and children while working at Bexar County Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, United States. She is currently serving a 99-year sentence for the murder of Chelsea McClellan and the attempted murder of Rolando Santos, and became eligible for parole in 2017 due to a law in Texas at the time of her sentencing to reduce prison overcrowding. A similar case occurred in Britain in 1991, where nurse Beverley Allitt killed four children at the hospital where she worked, attempted to kill three more, and injured a further six over the course of two months. A 21st-century example is Canadian nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer, who murdered elderly patients in the nursing homes where she worked. William George Davis is another hospital nurse who was sentenced to death in Texas for the murder of four patients.

===Female===

Female serial killers are rare compared to their male counterparts. Sources suggest that female serial killers represented less than one in every six known serial murderers in the United States between 1800 and 2004 (64 females from a total of 416 known offenders), or that around 15% of U.S. serial killers have been women, with a collective number of victims between 427 and 612. The authors of &quot;Lethal Ladies&quot;, Amanda L. Farrell, Robert D. Keppel, and Victoria B. Titterington, state that &quot;the Justice Department indicated 36 female serial killers have been active over the course of the last century.&quot; According to &quot;The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology&quot;, there is evidence that 16% of all serial killers are women.

Michael D. Kelleher and C. L. Kelleher created several categories to describe female serial killers. They used the classifications of &quot;&quot;, &quot;angel of death&quot;, &quot;sexual predator&quot;, &quot;revenge&quot;, &quot;profit or crime&quot;, &quot;team killer&quot;, &quot;question of sanity&quot;, &quot;unexplained&quot;, and &quot;unsolved&quot;. In using these categories, they observed that most women fell into the categories of the black widow or team killer. Although motivations for female serial killers can include attention seeking, addiction, or the result of psychopathological behavioral factors, female serial killers are commonly categorized as murdering men for material gain, usually being emotionally close to their victims, and generally needing to have a relationship with the victim, hence the traditional cultural image of the &quot;black widow&quot;.
The methods that female serial killers use for murder are frequently covert or low-profile, such as murder by poison (the preferred choice for killing). Other methods used by female serial killers include shootings (used by 20%), suffocation (16%), stabbing (11%), and drowning (5%). They commit killings in specific places, such as their home or a health-care facility, or at different locations within the same city or state. A notable exception to the typical characteristics of female serial killers is Aileen Wuornos, who killed outdoors instead of at home, used a gun instead of poison, and killed strangers instead of friends or family. One &quot;analysis of 86 female serial killers from the United States found that the victims tended to be spouses, children or the elderly&quot;. Other studies indicate that since 1975, increasingly strangers are marginally the most preferred victim of female serial killers, or that only 26% of female serial killers kill for material gain only. Sources state that each killer will have her own proclivities, needs and triggers. A review of the published literature on female serial murder stated that &quot;sexual or sadistic motives are believed to be extremely rare in female serial murderers, and psychopathic traits and histories of childhood abuse have been consistently reported in these women.&quot;

A study by Eric W. Hickey (2010) of 64 female serial killers in the United States indicated that sexual activity was one of several motives in 10% of the cases, enjoyment in 11% and control in 14% and that 51% of all U.S. female serial killers murdered at least one woman and 31% murdered at least one child. In other cases, women have been involved as an accomplice with a male serial killer as a part of a serial killing team. A 2015 study published in &quot;The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology&quot; found that the most common motive for female serial killers was for financial gain and almost 40% of them had experienced some sort of mental illness.

Peter Vronsky in &quot;Female Serial Killers&quot; (2007) maintains that female serial killers today often kill for the same reason males do: as a means of expressing rage and control. He suggests that sometimes the theft of the victims&#x27; property by the female &quot;black widow&quot; type serial killer appears to be for material gain, but really is akin to a male serial killer&#x27;s collecting of totems (souvenirs) from the victim as a way of exerting continued control over the victim and reliving it. By contrast, Hickey states that although popular perception sees &quot;black widow&quot; female serial killers as something of the Victorian past, in his statistical study of female serial killer cases reported in the United States since 1826, approximately 75% occurred since 1950.

Elizabeth Báthory is sometimes cited as the most prolific female serial killer in all of history. Formally countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (Báthory Erzsébet in Hungarian, August 7, 1560 – August 21, 1614), she was a countess from the Báthory family. Before her husband&#x27;s death, Elizabeth took great pleasure in torturing the staff, by jamming pins under the servant&#x27;s fingernails or stripping servants and throwing them into the snow. After her husband&#x27;s death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and young women, with one witness attributing to them over 600 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later.

A 2010 article by Perri and Lichtenwald addressed some of the misconceptions concerning female criminality. In the article, Perri and Lichtenwald analyze the current research regarding female psychopathy, including case studies of female psychopathic killers featuring Munchausen syndrome by proxy, cesarean section homicide, fraud detection homicide, female kill teams, and a female serial killer.

===Juvenile===
Juvenile serial killers are rare. There are three main categories that juvenile serial killers can fit into: primary, maturing, and secondary killers. There have been studies done to compare and contrast these three groups and to discover similarities and differences between them. Although these types of serial killers are less common, oftentimes adult serial killers may make their debut at an early age and it can be an opportunity for researchers to study what factors brought about the behavior. While juvenile serial killers are rare, the youngest felon on death row is a juvenile serial killer named Harvey Miguel Robinson who was 17 at the time of his crimes and 18 at the time of his arrest.

===Ethnicity and demographics in the United States===
There is a myth that most serial killers are white males. However, according to the FBI, based on percentages of the U.S. population, white males are not more likely than other races to be serial killers. White males are actually greatly under-represented among serial killers in proportion to their overall numbers in the United States. According to a 2016 study, since the year 2000, African Americans accounted for roughly 60% of all serial killers in the United States.

Anthony Walsh found that the prevalence of non-white serial killers has typically been drastically underestimated in both professional research literature and the mass media. Black males were over-represented among serial killers by a factor of 2. Walsh argues that the popular media ignores black serial killers because of a fear of allegations of racism, and that this may enable black serial killers to operate more effectively, as their crimes do not get the same media attention as the crimes of non-black serial killers.

==Motives==

The motives of serial killers are generally placed into four categories: &quot;visionary&quot;, &quot;mission-oriented&quot;, &quot;hedonistic&quot;, and &quot;power or control&quot;; however, the motives of any given killer may display considerable overlap among these categories.

===Visionary===
Visionary serial killers suffer from psychotic breaks with reality, sometimes believing they are another person or are compelled to murder by entities such as the Devil or God. The two most common subgroups are &quot;demon mandated&quot; and &quot;God mandated&quot;.

Herbert Mullin believed the American casualties in the Vietnam War were preventing California from experiencing the Big One. As the war wound down, Mullin claimed his father instructed him via telepathy to raise the number of &quot;human sacrifices to nature&quot; to delay a catastrophic earthquake that would plunge California into the ocean. David Berkowitz (&quot;Son of Sam&quot;) may also be an example of a visionary serial killer, having claimed a demon transmitted orders through his neighbor&#x27;s dog and instructed him to commit murder. Berkowitz later described those claims as a hoax, as originally concluded by psychiatrist David Abrahamsen.

===Mission-oriented===

Mission-oriented killers typically justify their acts as &quot;ridding the world&quot; of certain types of people perceived as undesirable, such as the homeless, ex-cons, homosexuals, drug users, prostitutes, or people of different ethnicity or religion; however, they are generally not psychotic. Some see themselves as attempting to change society, often to cure a societal ill.

An example of a mission-oriented killer would be Joseph Paul Franklin, an American white supremacist who exclusively targeted Jewish, biracial, and African American individuals for the purpose of inciting a &quot;race war&quot;. Saeed Hanaei was a serial killer convicted of murdering at least sixteen women in his native Iran, many of whom were sex workers. He reported his goal was to cleanse his city of &quot;moral corruption&quot; and that his mission was sanctioned by God.

===Hedonistic===
This type of serial killer seeks thrills and derives pleasure and satisfaction from killing, seeing people as expendable means to this goal. Forensic psychologists have identified three subtypes of the hedonistic killer: &quot;lust&quot;, &quot;thrill&quot;, and &quot;comfort&quot;.

====Lust====
Sex is the primary motive of lust killers, whether or not the victims are dead, and fantasy plays a large role in their killings. Their sexual gratification depends on the amount of torture and mutilation they perform on their victims. The sexual serial murderer has a psychological need to have absolute control, dominance, and power over their victims, and the infliction of torture, pain, and ultimately death is used in an attempt to fulfill their need. They usually use weapons that require close contact with the victims, such as knives or hands. As lust killers continue with their murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both.

Kenneth Bianchi, one of the &quot;Hillside Stranglers&quot;, murdered women and girls of different ages, races, and appearance because his sexual urges required different types of stimulation and increasing intensity. Jeffrey Dahmer searched for his perfect fantasy lover—beautiful, submissive and eternal. As his desire increased, he experimented with drugs, alcohol, and exotic sex. His increasing need for stimulation was demonstrated by the dismemberment of victims, whose heads and genitals he preserved, and by his attempts to create a &quot;living zombie&quot; under his control (by pouring acid into a hole drilled into the victim&#x27;s skull).

Dahmer once said, &quot;Lust played a big part of it. Control and lust. Once it happened the first time, it just seemed like it had control of my life from there on in. The killing was just a means to an end. That was the least satisfactory part. I didn&#x27;t enjoy doing that. That&#x27;s why I tried to create living zombies with acid and the drill.&quot; He further elaborated on this, also saying, &quot;I wanted to see if it was possible to make—again, it sounds really gross—uh, zombies, people that would not have a will of their own, but would follow my instructions without resistance. So after that, I started using the drilling technique.&quot; He experimented with cannibalism to &quot;ensure his victims would always be a part of him&quot;.

====Thrill====

The primary motive of a thrill killer is to induce pain or terror in their victims, which provides stimulation and excitement for the killer. They seek the adrenaline rush provided by hunting and killing victims. Thrill killers murder only for the kill; usually, the attack is not prolonged, and there is no sexual aspect. Usually, the victims are strangers, although the killer may have followed them for a period of time. Thrill killers can abstain from killing for long periods of time and become more successful at killing as they refine their murder methods. Many attempt to commit the perfect crime and believe they will not be caught.

Robert Hansen took his victims to a secluded area, where he would let them loose and then hunt and kill them. In one of his letters to San Francisco Bay Area newspapers in San Francisco, California, the Zodiac Killer wrote &quot;[killing] gives me the most thrilling experience it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl&quot;. Carl Watts was described by a surviving victim as &quot;excited and hyper and clappin&#x27; and just making noises like he was excited, that this was gonna be fun&quot; during the 1982 attack. Slashing, stabbing, hanging, drowning, asphyxiating, and strangling were among the ways Watts killed.

====Comfort (profit)====
Material gain and a comfortable lifestyle are the primary motives of comfort killers. Usually, the victims are family members and close acquaintances. After a murder, a comfort killer will usually wait for a period of time before killing again to allow any suspicions by family or authorities to subside. They often use poison, most notably arsenic, to kill their victims. Female serial killers are often comfort killers, although not all comfort killers are female.

Dorothea Puente killed her tenants for their Social Security checks and buried them in the backyard of her home. H. H. Holmes killed for insurance and business profits. Puente and Holmes had previous records of crimes such as theft, fraud, non-payment of debts, embezzlement and others of a similar nature. Dorothea Puente was finally arrested on a parole violation, having been on parole for a previous fraud conviction. Contract killers (&quot;hitmen&quot;) may exhibit similar characteristics of serial killers, but are generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional incentives. Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that are labeled as both a hitman and a serial killer.

===Power/control===
The main objective for this type of serial killer is to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes abused as children, leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers sexually abuse their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim. Ted Bundy is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.

===Media influences===
Many serial killers claim that a violent culture influenced them to commit murders. During his final interview, Ted Bundy stated that hardcore pornography was responsible for his actions. Others idolise figures for their deeds or perceived vigilante justice, such as Peter Kürten, who idolized Jack the Ripper, or John Wayne Gacy and Ed Kemper, who both idolized the actor John Wayne.

Killers who have a strong desire for fame or to be renowned for their actions desire media attention as a way of validating and spreading their crimes; fear is also a component here, as some serial killers enjoy causing fear. An example is Dennis Rader, who sought attention from the press during his murder spree.

===Theories===

====Biological and sociological====
Theories for why certain people commit serial murder have been advanced. Some theorists believe the reasons are biological, suggesting serial killers are born, not made, and that their violent behavior is a result of abnormal brain activity. Holmes believe that &quot;until a reliable sample can be obtained and tested, there is no scientific statement that can be made concerning the exact role of biology as a determining factor of a serial killer personality.&quot;

The &quot;Fractured Identity Syndrome&quot; (FIS) is a merging of Charles Cooley&#x27;s &quot;looking glass self&quot; and Erving Goffman&#x27;s &quot;virtual&quot; and &quot;actual social identity&quot; theories. The FIS suggests a social event, or series of events, during one&#x27;s childhood results in a fracturing of the personality of the serial killer. The term &quot;fracture&quot; is defined as a small breakage of the personality which is often not visible to the outside world and is only felt by the killer.

&quot;Social Process Theory&quot; has also been suggested as an explanation for serial murder. Social process theory states that offenders may turn to crime due to peer pressure, family and friends. Criminal behavior is a process of interaction with social institutions, in which everyone has the potential for criminal behavior. A lack of family structure and identity could also be a cause leading to serial murder traits. A child used as a scapegoat will be deprived of their capacity to feel guilt. Displaced anger could result in animal torture, as identified in the Macdonald triad, and a further lack of basic identity.

====Military====
The &quot;military theory&quot; has been proposed as an explanation for why serial murderers kill, as some serial murderers have served in the military or related fields. According to Castle and Hensley, 7% of the serial killers studied had military experience. This figure may be a proportional under-representation when compared to the number of military veterans in a nation&#x27;s total population. For example, according to the United States census for the year 2000, military veterans comprised 12.7% of the U.S. population; in England, it was estimated in 2007 that military veterans comprised 9.1% of the population. Though by contrast, about 2.5% of the population of Canada in 2006 consisted of military veterans.

There are two theories that can be used to study the correlation between serial killing and military training: &quot;Applied learning theory&quot; states that serial killing can be learned. The military is training for higher kill rates from servicemen while training the soldiers to be desensitized to taking a human life. &quot;Social learning theory&quot; can be used when soldiers get praised and accommodated for killing. They learn or believe that they learn, that it is acceptable to kill because they were praised for it in the military. Serial killers want accreditation for the work that they have done.

In both military and serial killing, the offender or the soldier may become desensitized to killing as well as compartmentalized; the soldiers do not see enemy personnel as &quot;human&quot; and neither do serial killers see their victims as humans. The theories do not imply that military institutions make a deliberate effort to produce serial killers; to the contrary, all military personnel are trained to recognize when, where, and against whom it is appropriate to use deadly force, which starts with the basic &quot;Law of Land Warfare&quot;, taught during the initial training phase, and may include more stringent policies for military personnel in law enforcement or security.

==Investigation==

===FBI: Issues and practices===
In 2008, the FBI published a handbook titled &quot;Serial Murder&quot; which was the product of a symposium held in 2005 to bring together the many issues surrounding serial murder, including its investigation.

====Identification====
According to the FBI, identifying one, or multiple, murders as being the work of a serial killer is the first challenge an investigation faces, especially if the victim(s) come from a marginalized or high-risk population and is normally linked through forensic or behavioral evidence. Should the cases cross multiple jurisdictions, the law enforcement system in the United States is fragmented and thus not configured to detect multiple similar murders across a large geographic area. Ted Bundy was particularly famous for such geographic exploitations. He used his knowledge about the lack of communication between multiple jurisdictions to avoid arrest and detection. The FBI suggests utilizing databases and increasing interdepartmental communication. Keppel suggests holding multi-jurisdictional conferences regularly to compare cases giving departments a greater chance to detect linked cases and overcome linkage blindness.

One collaboration, the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative, was formed in 2010 and made serial murder data widely accessible after multiple experts combined their databases to aid in research and investigation. Another collaboration, the &quot;Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Project&quot; was proposed at the 2012 FDIAI Annual Conference. Utilizing Radford&#x27;s Serial Killer Database as a starting point, the new collaboration, hosted by FGCU Justice Studies, has invited and is working in conjunction with other universities to maintain and expand the scope of the database to also include spree and mass murders. Utilizing over 170 data points, multiple-murderer methodology and victimology; researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies can build case studies and statistical profiles to further research the &quot;Who, What, Why and How&quot; of these types of crimes.

====Leadership====
Leadership, or administration, should play a small or virtually non-existent role in the actual investigation past assigning knowledgeable or experienced homicide investigators to lead positions. The administration&#x27;s role is not to run the investigation but to establish and reaffirm the primary goal of catching the serial killer, as well as provide support for the investigators. The FBI (2008) suggests completing Memorandums of Understanding to facilitate support and commitment of resources from different jurisdictions to an investigation. Egger takes this one step further and suggests completing mutual aid pacts, which are written agreements to provide support to each other in a time of need, with surrounding jurisdictions. Doing this in advance would save time and resources that could be used on the investigation.

====Organization====
The structural organization of an investigation is key to its success, as demonstrated by the investigation of Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer. Once a serial murder case was established, a task force was created to track down and arrest the offender. Over the course of the investigation, for various reasons, the task force&#x27;s organization was radically changed and reorganized multiple times – at one point including more than 50 full-time personnel, and at another, only a single investigator. Eventually, what led to the end of the investigation was a conference of 25 detectives organized to share ideas to solve the case.

The FBI handbook provides a description of how a task force should be organized but offers no additional options on how to structure the investigation. While it appears advantageous to have a full-time staff assigned to a serial murder investigation, it can become prohibitively expensive. For example, the Green River Task Force cost upwards of $2 million per year, and as was witnessed with the Green River Killer investigation, other strategies can prevail where a task force fails. A common strategy, already employed by many departments for other reasons, is the conference, in which departments get together and focus on a specific set of topics. With serial murders, the focus is typically on unsolved cases, with evidence thought to be related to the case at hand.

Similar to a conference is an information clearing-house in which a jurisdiction with a suspected serial murder case collects all of its evidence and actively seeks data that may be related from other jurisdictions. By collecting all of the related information into one place, they provide a central point in which it can be organized and easily accessed by other jurisdictions working toward the goal of arresting an offender and ending the murders. A task force provides for a flexible, organized, framework for jurisdictions depending on the needs of the investigation. Unfortunately due to the need to commit resources (manpower, money, equipment, etc.) for long periods of time it can be an unsustainable option.

In the case of the investigation of Aileen Wournos, the Marion County Sheriff coordinated multiple agencies without any written or formal agreement. While not a specific strategy for a serial murder investigation, this is certainly a best practice in so far as the agencies were able to work easily together toward a common goal. Finally, once a serial murder investigation has been identified, the use of an FBI Rapid Response Team can assist both experienced and inexperienced jurisdictions in setting up a task force. This is completed by organizing and delegating jobs, by compiling and analyzing clues, and by establishing communication between the parties involved.

====Resource augmentation====
During the course of a serial murder investigation, it may become necessary to call in additional resources; the FBI defines this as Resource Augmentation. Within the structure of a task force, the addition of a resource should be thought of as either long-term or short-term. If the task force&#x27;s framework is expanded to include the new resource, then it should be permanent and not removed. For short-term needs, such as setting up roadblocks or canvassing a neighborhood, additional resources should be called in on a short-term basis. The decision of whether resources are needed short or long term should be left to the lead investigator and facilitated by the administration.

The confusion and counter productiveness created by changing the structure of a task force mid investigation is illustrated by the way the Green River Task Force&#x27;s staffing and structure was changed multiple times throughout the investigation. This made an already complicated situation more difficult, resulting in the delay or loss of information, which allowed Ridgway to continue killing. The FBI model does not take into account that permanently expanding a task force, or investigative structure, may not be possible due to cost or personnel availability. Egger (1998) offers several alternative strategies including; using investigative consultants, or experienced staff to augment an investigative team. Not all departments have investigators experienced in serial murder and by temporarily bringing in consultants, they can educate a department to a level of competence then step out. This would reduce the initially established framework of the investigation team and save the department the cost of retaining the consultants until the conclusion of the investigation.

====Communication====
The FBI handbook (2008) and Keppel (1989) both stress communication as paramount. The difference is that the FBI handbook concentrates primarily on communication within a task force, while Keppel makes getting information out to and allowing information to be passed back from patrol officers a priority. The FBI handbook suggests having daily e-mail or in-person briefings for all staff involved in the investigation and providing periodic summary briefings to patrol officers and managers. Looking back on a majority of serial murderer arrests, most are exercised by patrol officers in the course of their everyday duties and unrelated to the ongoing serial murder investigation.

Keppel provides examples of Larry Eyler, who was arrested during a traffic stop for a parking violation, and Ted Bundy, who was arrested during a traffic stop for operating a stolen vehicle. In each case, it was uniformed officers, not directly involved in the investigation, who knew what to look for and took the direct action that stopped the killer. By providing up-to-date (as opposed to periodic) briefings and information to officers on the street the chances of catching a serial killer, or finding solid leads, are increased.

====Data management====
A serial murder investigation generates staggering amounts of data, all of which needs to be reviewed and analyzed. A standardized method of documenting and distributing information must be established and investigators must be allowed time to complete reports while investigating leads and at the end of a shift (FBI 2008). When the mechanism for data management is insufficient, leads are not only lost or buried but the investigation can be hindered and new information can become difficult to obtain or become corrupted.

During the Green River Killer investigation, reporters would often find and interview possible victims or witnesses ahead of investigators. The understaffed investigation was unable to keep up the information flow, which prevented them from promptly responding to leads. To make matters worse, investigators believed that the journalists, untrained in interviewing victims or witnesses of crimes, would corrupt the information and result in unreliable leads.

==Memorabilia==
Notorious and infamous serial killers number in the thousands and a subculture revolves around their legacies. That subculture includes the collection, sale, and display of serial killer memorabilia, dubbed &quot;murderabilia&quot; by Andrew Kahan, one of the best-known opponents of collectors of serial killer remnants. Kahan is the director of the Mayor&#x27;s Crime Victims Office in Houston. He is backed by the families of murder victims and &quot;Son of Sam laws&quot; existing in some states that prevent murderers from profiting from the publicity generated by their crimes.

Such memorabilia includes the paintings, writings, and poems of these killers. Recently, marketing has capitalized even more upon interest in serial killers with the rise of various merchandise such as trading cards, action figures, and books. Some serial killers attain celebrity status in the way they acquire fans and may have previous personal possessions auctioned off on websites like eBay. A few examples of this are Ed Gein&#x27;s 150-pound stolen gravestone and Bobby Joe Long&#x27;s sunglasses.

<doc id="42627" wikidata="Q83516" url="?curid=42627" title="1968 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1968 Democratic National Convention was held August 26–29 at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Earlier that year incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced he would not seek reelection, thus making the purpose of the convention to select a new presidential nominee for the Democratic Party. Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine were nominated for president and vice president, respectively. 

The event was among the most tense and confrontational political conventions in American history, and became notorious for the televised heavy-handed police tactics of the host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. The most contentious issues were the continuing American military involvement in the Vietnam War, and expanding the right to vote to draft-age soldiers by lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years old. Dissatisfaction with the convention led to significant changes in the rules governing delegate selection, ushering in the modern primary election system. 

The year 1968 was a time of riots, political turbulence, and mass civil unrest. The assassination of Martin Luther King in April of that year, following his opposition to the Vietnam War, further inflamed racial tensions, and protest riots in more than 100 cities followed. The convention also followed the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a candidate in the primary, on June 5. Currently second in delegates at the time of his death to the pro-war Humphrey, the loss of Kennedy saw his committed delegates go for Humphrey over candidate Eugene McCarthy, who had been third in delegates.

The Humphrey–Muskie ticket failed to win the confidence of Democratic voters, to unite liberals, or to attract anti-war voters. They were later defeated in the presidential election by the &quot;silent majority&quot; Republican ticket of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.

==Before the convention==

The Democratic Party, which controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House in 1968, was divided. Senator Eugene McCarthy entered the campaign in November 1967, challenging incumbent President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Senator Robert F. Kennedy entered the race in March 1968.

Johnson, facing dissent within his party, never entered the 1968 race but won the New Hampshire presidential primary in March 1968 as a write-in candidate; he then announced on March 31 that he would not seek re-election. The Wisconsin primary was scheduled for April 2, and public opinion polls showed Johnson as third in the race, behind McCarthy and Kennedy. In his television address announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race, Johnson also announced the United States would stop bombing North Vietnam north of the 19th parallel and was willing to open peace talks. On April 27 Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered the race but did not compete in any primaries; instead he inherited the delegates previously pledged to Johnson and then collected delegates in caucus states, especially in caucuses controlled by local Democratic bosses.

Vietnam War peace talks had begun in Paris on May 13, 1968, but almost immediately became deadlocked as Xuan Thuy, the head of the North Vietnamese delegation, demanded that the U.S. give a promise to unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam, a demand rejected by W. Averell Harriman of the American delegation. From the start of the bombing under Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, the North Vietnamese had demanded the U.S. unconditionally halt the bombing as the first step towards peace. It soon became apparent that no progress would be possible in Paris until the U.S. promised to unconditionally cease bombing, as the talks floundered on that issue through the spring, summer and fall of 1968.

After Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on June 5, the Democratic Party&#x27;s divisions grew. At the moment of Kennedy&#x27;s death the delegate count stood at Humphrey 561.5, Kennedy 393.5, McCarthy 258. Kennedy&#x27;s murder left his delegates uncommitted. Support within the Democratic Party was divided between McCarthy, who ran a decidedly anti-war campaign and was seen as the peace candidate; Humphrey, who was seen as the candidate representing the more hawkish Johnson point of view; and Senator George McGovern, who appealed to some of Kennedy&#x27;s supporters.

When Vice President Humphrey arrived in Chicago, Daley was not at the airport to greet him, instead sending a police bagpipe band to welcome him. As Humphrey was driven to the Conrad Hilton hotel, he noticed that no one in the streets cheered him, in marked contrast to the arrival of McCarthy, who had been greeted by 5,000 cheering supporters.

==Convention==

The convention was among the most tense and confrontational political conventions ever in American history, marked by fierce debate and protest over the Vietnam peace talks and controversy over the heavy-handed police tactics of the convention&#x27;s host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. The keynote speaker was Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.

Before the start of the convention on August 26, several states had competing slates of delegates attempting to be seated at the convention. Some of these delegate credential fights went to the floor of the convention on August 26, where votes were held to determine which slates of delegates representing Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina would be seated at the convention. The more racially integrated challenging slate from Texas was defeated. 

=== Vietnam war plank and Johnson&#x27;s influence ===
Within the convention, tensions arose between pro-war and anti-war Democrats. One of the principal issues at the peace talks in Paris was the North Vietnamese demand that the U.S. unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam before discussing any other matters. The more dovish Democrats favored the North Vietnamese demand while more hawkish Democrats demanded the North Vietnamese promise to close the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the price of a bombing pause, a demand the North Vietnamese rejected. Vice President Humphrey, confronted with a divided party, attempted to craft a party platform that would appeal to both factions, calling for a bombing pause that &quot;took into account, most importantly, the risk to American troops as well as the response from Hanoi.&quot; Humphrey&#x27;s platform tacitly implied that he would order a complete bombing pause if elected. Anticipating the &quot;Vietnamization&quot; strategy later carried out by Richard Nixon, Humphrey&#x27;s platform called for the &quot;de-Americanization&quot; of the war as the U.S. gradually pulled American troops out from South Vietnam and shifted the burden of fighting back to the South Vietnamese.

Johnson, despite spending the week at his Texas ranch, maintained tight control over the proceedings, going so far as to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation illegally tap Humphrey&#x27;s telephones to find out his plans. Humphrey previewed his platform to two of Johnson&#x27;s more hawkish advisers, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow. Rostow very reluctantly gave his approval while Rusk told Humphrey, &quot;We can live with this, Hubert.&quot; Johnson angrily rejected Humphrey&#x27;s compromise peace plank as a personal affront, telling Humphrey in a telephone call to change it at once. When Humphrey protested that &quot;Dean Rusk approved it,&quot; Johnson shouted over the phone: &quot;That&#x27;s not the way I hear it. Well, this just undercuts our whole policy, and by God, the Democratic Party ought not to be doing that to me, and you ought not to be doing it. You&#x27;ve been a part of the policy.&quot; To put further pressure on Humphrey, Johnson called up General Creighton Abrams, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, to ask if a complete bombing pause would endanger the lives of American soldiers; Abrams, unaware of the intra-Democratic dispute, wrote back that it would. Johnson gave a copy to Hale Boggs, chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), who in turn showed it to various leading delegates to show how reckless and &quot;unpatriotic&quot; Humphrey was in contemplating a bombing pause. Faced with Johnson&#x27;s fury, Humphrey gave in and accepted a plank more to Johnson&#x27;s liking. Johnson always felt contempt for Humphrey and liked to bully him, telling Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford that he would respect Humphrey more if only he &quot;showed he had some balls&quot;. Though some of Humphrey&#x27;s advisors counseled him to defy the lame-duck president, Humphrey resignedly stated: &quot;Well, it would not look like an act based on principle or conviction; it would seem like a gimmick. It would seem strange. And it would enrage the president.&quot;

The platform that Humphrey had written on Johnson&#x27;s dictation was introduced onto the floor of the convention and prompted a passionate three-hour long floor debate as anti-war Democrats obstinately objected. The platform was passed with 1,567 delegates (60%) voting for the platform and 1,041 (40%) voting against. When the platform was passed, the delegation from New York put on black armbands and began to sing &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; in protest. Humphrey later stated that his biggest mistake of the election was to give in to Johnson, contending that if he stuck to his original platform it would have shown his independence and given him a lead in the polls. Humphrey always believed that if he had given his planned speech (which he instead gave in Salt Lake City on September 30, 1968) calling for an unconditional bombing pause of North Vietnam as &quot;an acceptable risk for peace&quot;, that he would have won the election.

Humphrey also complained that the convention had been held in late August to coincide with Johnson&#x27;s birthday, which cost him a month to organize, preferring to have the convention held in July. Complicating the election was the third party candidacy of Alabama governor George Wallace, who ran on a white supremacist platform promising to undo the changes of the Civil Rights Movement. Conservative whites in the South had long voted as a bloc for the Democrats, but in the 1960s many were starting to move away from the Democratic Party. Nixon had embarked on his Southern strategy of wooing conservative Southern whites over to the Republicans, but Wallace, more extreme on racial questions than was possible for Nixon, threatened to preempt the Southern strategy. Johnson had wanted Humphrey to nominate as his running mate a conservative white Southern Democrat who might prevent Southern whites from voting for Wallace or Nixon, bringing back one of the most loyal Democratic voting blocs of the past century. Humphrey mustered the courage to defy Johnson and choose as his running mate Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, a dignified, centrist Democrat.

Humphrey had been well known as a liberal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he felt that with Nixon and Wallace competing for the conservative white Southern voters there was no realistic opportunity for him to appeal to that group. In 1948, Humphrey, at that time the mayor of Minneapolis, had first come to national attention when he delivered a speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention denouncing racial injustices in the South. However, over the protests of liberals, Humphrey did not resist Johnson&#x27;s decision to seat several all-white delegations from several Southern states despite the complaints that Black Americans (and in the case of the Texas delegation, Mexican-Americans) had been systematically excluded. 

Though Johnson had publicly dropped out of the presidential election, he entertained thoughts of re-entering it. He sent his friend, Texas Governor John Connally, to meet with other souther Democratic governors attending the convention to inquire if they would be willing to support nominating Johnson after all. Mayor Daley, a strong Johnson supporter, was enthusiastic about having Johnson re-enter. Daley, who was apparently oblivious of the deep antagonism between Johnson and the Kennedy family, favored Senator Ted Kennedy for Johnson&#x27;s running mate, saying that an &quot;LBJ-TEK&quot; ticket would win easily. Daley was so committed to having Johnson re-enter the race that he had secretly printed up signs reading &quot;We Love LBJ&quot;. He also called up Kennedy to discuss his plans, but Kennedy, who was seriously depressed after the assassination of his brother Robert, was not interested. It remains unclear if Johnson was serious about re-entering, or if he was merely using the prospect as a threat to control Humphrey. In the end, Connally&#x27;s polling found the general feeling about the plan to be &quot;No way!&quot;

===Nomination results===
In the end, the Democratic Party nominated Humphrey. The delegates had defeated the peace plank by to . The loss was perceived to be the result of Johnson and Daley influencing behind the scenes. Humphrey, who had not entered any of the thirteen state primary elections, won the Democratic nomination shortly after midnight, and many delegates shouted, &quot;No! No!&quot; when his victory was announced. The nomination was watched by 89 million Americans. As a sign of racial reconciliation, Humphrey had intended for his nomination to be seconded by a speech by Carl Stokes, the Black mayor of Cleveland, Ohio. Stokes&#x27;s speech was not shown on live national television as planned, as the networks instead broadcast live the &quot;Battle of Michigan Avenue&quot; that was taking place in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 presidential election to the Republican Richard Nixon.

==Richard J. Daley and the convention==

The convention&#x27;s host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, intended to showcase his and the city&#x27;s achievements to national Democrats and the news media. Instead, the proceedings became notorious for the large number of demonstrators and the use of force by the Chicago police during what was supposed to be, in the words of Yippie activist organizers, &quot;A Festival of Life.&quot; Crowd control against the demonstrators by the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois National Guard devolved into a police riot. The disturbances were well publicized by the mass media, with some journalists and reporters being caught up in the violence. Network newsmen Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, and Edwin Newman were assaulted by the police while inside the convention hall.

=== Preparation ===
The Democratic National Convention had been held in Chicago twelve years earlier. Daley had played an integral role in the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. In 1968, however, it did not seem that Daley had maintained the clout which would allow him to bring out the voters again to produce a Democratic victory as he had in 1960.

President Johnson had wanted the Democratic convention to be held in Houston, but Daley had successfully lobbied the president to hold it in Chicago to showcase to the national media Daley&#x27;s successes in his fifteen years as mayor. On October 7, 1967, Daley and Johnson had a private meeting at a fund raiser for Johnson&#x27;s re-election campaign, with an entry fee of one thousand dollars per plate (approximately $7,200 in 2016 dollars). During the meeting, Daley explained to the president that there had been a disappointing showing of Democrats in the 1966 congressional races, and the president might lose the swing state of Illinois with its 26 electoral votes if the convention were not held there. Johnson&#x27;s pro-war policies had already created a great division within the party; he hoped that the selection of Chicago for the convention would eliminate further conflict with opposition. The DNC head for selecting the location was David Wilentz of New Jersey, who gave the official reason for choosing Chicago as, &quot;It is centrally located geographically which will reduce transportation costs and because it has been the site of national conventions for both Parties in the past and is therefore attuned to holding them.&quot; The conversation between Johnson and Daley was leaked to the press and published in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and several other papers.

Daley ruled Chicago with a tight grip, and was determined to stop the protests which threatened to ruin his moment of triumph. In preparation, Daley had walls erected along the roads to the Amphitheatre through his own neighborhood of Bridgeport to obscure from sight rundown housing in the neighborhood.

=== Daley&#x27;s fear of the protestors ===
Ten thousand demonstrators gathered in Chicago for the convention, where they were met by 23,000 police and National Guardsmen. When asked about anti-war demonstrators, Daley repeated to reporters that &quot;no thousands will come to our city and take over our streets, our city, our convention&quot;. 

Daley later said his primary reason for calling in so many Guardsmen and police was reports he received of plots to assassinate Democratic Party leaders including himself. One of Daley&#x27;s aides told the media that the anti-war demonstrators were &quot;revolutionaries bent on the destruction of America&quot;. When the media reported that Daley had given orders to the police to restrict the activities of Democratic delegates loyal to McCarthy, Daley gave an outraged press conference saying, &quot;This is a vicious attack on this city and its mayor&quot;.

The leaders of the Yippies (Youth International Party), Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, specialized in outlandish, bizarre rhetoric to provoke media attention, and Daley took many of their outrageous threats seriously. 

=== Daley and the media ===
Daley&#x27;s heavy-handed security measures incensed the media. Walter Cronkite complained of &quot;a totally unwarranted restriction of free and rapid access to information&quot;. With the convention taking place days after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Eric Sevareid stated that Chicago &quot;runs the city of Prague a close second right now as the world&#x27;s least attractive tourist destination&quot;. 

On the second night of the convention, CBS News correspondent Dan Rather was grabbed by security guards and roughed up while trying to interview a Georgia delegate being escorted out of the building. CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite turned his attention towards the area where Rather was reporting from the convention floor. Rather was grabbed by security guards after he walked toward the delegate who was being hauled out, and asked him, &quot;What is your name, sir?&quot; Rather was wearing a microphone headset and was then heard on national television repeatedly saying to the guards &quot;don&#x27;t push me&quot; and &quot;take your hands off me unless you plan to arrest me&quot;.

After the guards let go of Rather, he told Cronkite:&quot;Walter ... we tried to talk to the man and we got violently pushed out of the way. This is the kind of thing that has been going on outside the hall, this is the first time we&#x27;ve had it happen inside the hall. We ... I&#x27;m sorry to be out of breath, but somebody belted me in the stomach during that. What happened is a Georgia delegate, at least he had a Georgia delegate sign on, was being hauled out of the hall. We tried to talk to him to see why, who he was, what the situation was, and at that instant the security people, well as you can see, put me on the deck. I didn&#x27;t do very well.&quot; An angry Cronkite tersely replied, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.&quot;

On the last night, NBC News switched back and forth between images of the violence to the festivities over Humphrey&#x27;s victory in the convention hall, highlighting the division in the Democratic Party.

=== &quot;Gestapo tactics&quot; Ribicoff incident ===
Daley&#x27;s security measures were so intense that it was not possible to walk across the convention floor without jostling other delegates, which added to the tensions as Democrats fiercely argued about whether to accept Johnson&#x27;s war plank to the platform. All of it was captured live on national television. Pro-war Democrats challenged the presence of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was serving as the floor manager for McCarthy, and sought to have him expelled. Inside the convention hall were televisions showing the police beating and clubbing demonstrators outside, which increased the tension. Robert Maytag, the chairman of the Colorado delegation asked: &quot;Is there any rule under which Mayor Daley can be compelled to suspend the police state terror being perpetrated at this minute on kids in front of the Conrad Hilton [hotel]?&quot; Daley&#x27;s face flushed with anger while his supporters began to boo Maytag. 

On the convention floor, Senator Abraham Ribicoff rose to give a speech nominating McGovern as the Democratic candidate. During his speech, Ribicoff pointed to Daley and said: &quot;With George McGovern, we wouldn&#x27;t have Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago,&quot; as raucous dissension broke out. Daley rose up to scream at Ribicoff (as interpreted by lip readers): &quot;Fuck you, you Jew son of bitch! You lousy motherfucker! Go home!&quot; Ribicoff mildly replied: &quot;How hard it is to accept the truth. How hard it is.&quot; Four of Daley&#x27;s Chicago officials jumped up to usher Ribicoff away, helped by Daley&#x27;s bodyguards.

Defenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling Ribicoff a faker, a charge denied by Daley and refuted by Mike Royko&#x27;s reporting. 

==Protests and police response==

=== Preparations ===
In 1968, the Yippies and the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) had already begun planning a youth festival in Chicago to coincide with the convention, and other groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) would also make their presence known. Two SDS leaders, Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, had planned to keep their protests peaceful, although the lack of permits and threats of violence by the Chicago police made this unlikely to happen. Todd Gitlin, another SDS leader, was highly worried about the potential for violence, and at a speech paraphrased a lyric from &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;, saying: &quot;If you&#x27;re going to Chicago, be sure to wear some armor in your hair&quot;.

Chicago mayor Daley thought that one way to prevent &quot;anti-patriotic&quot; demonstrators from coming to Chicago was to refuse to grant permits which would allow for people to protest legally. The mayor announced restrictions on how close protestors could approach the convention, on their numbers, and on their activities, making very clear his hostility to protesters in his city.

Over 10,000 people had arrived in Chicago to protest the Vietnam War. Daley had the International Amphitheatre, where the convention was being held, ringed with barbed wire while putting the 11,000 officers of the Chicago Police Department on twelve-hour shifts. In addition, there were 6,000 armed men from the Illinois National Guard called up to guard the International Amphitheatre, adding up to a total of 23,000 police and National Guardsmen. Intelligence agents had infiltrated among the protesters, including some from the Central Intelligence Agency, who contrary to American law had been sent to spy upon domestic politics. The Chicago police raided the mostly black neighborhoods of South Chicago to stage mass arrests of the Blackstone Rangers, a black power group that was allegedly planning to assassinate Humphrey.

=== Yippie publicity stunts ===
The leaders of the Yippies (Youth International Party), Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, attempted to provoke authorities by proclaiming: &quot;We are dirty, smelly, grimy and foul...we will piss and shit and fuck in public...we will be constantly stoned or tripping on every drug known to man&quot;. Surrounded by reporters on August 23, 1968, Yippie leader Rubin, folk singer Phil Ochs, and other activists held their own convention with their candidate Pigasus, an actual pig. When the Yippies paraded Pigasus at the Civic Center, ten policemen arrested Ochs, Rubin, Pigasus, and six others, attracting media attention.

A peaceful demonstration was held in Lincoln Park led by Rubin and Hoffman, with the Yippie leaders calling the demonstrators to respect the 11pm curfew. The Beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg ended the demonstration by chanting &quot;Om&quot;. The next day was supposed to be the &quot;Festival of Life&quot; in Lincoln Park, but the police confiscated the truck upon which a rock band was to play. The demonstrators and police began shouting insults at each other while the police fired tear gas into the crowd and beat up the photographers and journalists present. Tom Hayden, one of the leaders of the SDS and co-organizer of the protests, was arrested.

The next day, what was billed as &quot;Unbirthday Party&quot; for President Johnson was planned to be held in Lincoln Park. Hayden, who had been freed on bail after his arrest the previous day, attended the &quot;Unbirthday Party&quot;. He was recognized by a policeman, Constable Ralph Bell, who beat him and then arrested him for violating his bail conditions. Also attending the &quot;Unbirthday Party&quot; were Rubin and Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, who both called for &quot;roasting pigs&quot; in their speeches. In the evening, a demonstration was held at Grant Park opposite the Hilton Hotel, which was peaceful as bands such as Peter, Paul and Mary played folk music. When 600 Illinois National Guardsmen appeared, Hayden, who had been bailed out a second time, picked up his megaphone to shout that everybody should go home.

===Riots===

On August 28, 1968, around 10,000 protesters gathered in Grant Park for the demonstration, intending to march to the International Amphitheatre where the convention was being held. At approximately 3:30 pm, a young man lowered the American flag that was in the park. The police broke through the crowd and began beating the young man, while the crowd pelted the police with food, rocks, and chunks of concrete. The chants of some of the protesters shifted from, &quot;Hell no, we won&#x27;t go!&quot; to, &quot;Pigs are whores!&quot;

Hayden encouraged protesters to move out of the park to ensure that if the police used tear gas on them, it would have to be done throughout the city. The police regained control of the situation after firing tear gas and chased the demonstrators down the streets, beating them with clubs and rifle butts and arresting them. The amount of tear gas used to suppress the protesters was so great that it made its way to the Conrad Hilton, where it disturbed Humphrey while in his shower. The police sprayed demonstrators and bystanders with mace and were taunted by some protesters with chants of, &quot;Kill, kill, kill!&quot; The police responded by shouting, &quot;Get out of here, you cocksuckers!&quot;. Police indiscriminately attacked all who were present, regardless of if they were involved in the demonstrations or not. Dick Gregory, the comedian who attended the protests, told the crowd that the police were merely following the orders of Daley and &quot;the crooks downtown&quot;.

The MOBE leaders then decided to march down Michigan Avenue to the Conrad Hilton hotel, where many of the Democratic delegates were staying. The Illinois National Guard guarding the hotel fired tear gas while the police moved in to beat the demonstrators. The police assault in front of the hotel during the evening of August 28 became the most famous image of the Chicago demonstrations of 1968, as the entire event took place live under television lights for seventeen minutes while the crowd chanted, &quot;The whole world is watching&quot;. Samuel Brown, one of the organizers for Senator McCarthy, lamented the violence, saying: &quot;Instead of nice young people ringing doorbells, the public saw the image of mobs shouting obscenities and disrupting the city&quot;. Brown stated the demonstrations at Chicago had been a disaster for the anti-war movement, as the American people saw the protesters as the trouble-makers and the heavy-handed police response as justified. The general feeling at the time was the hippies were intent upon destroying everything good in America and the Chicago police had acted correctly in beating such dangerous anti-social types bloody. In a telephone call to President Johnson on Saturday, September 7, 1968, Daley described some of the activity undertaken by elements of the protesters, which he described as &quot;Professional Trouble Makers&quot;. These activities included the burning of the American Flag, raising of the Viet Cong flag and throwing both manure and urine at the police.

=== Aftermath ===
The Chicago Study Team (Walker Report) that investigated the violent clashes between police and protesters at the convention stated that the police response was characterized by:

unrestrained and indiscriminate police violence on many occasions, particularly at night. That violence was made all the more shocking by the fact that it was often inflicted upon persons who had broken no law, disobeyed no order, made no threat. These included peaceful demonstrators, onlookers, and large numbers of residents who were simply passing through, or happened to live in, the areas where confrontations were occurring.
The Walker Report, &quot;headed by an independent observer from Los Angeles police – concluded that: &#x27;Individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest. To read dispassionately the hundreds of statements describing at firsthand the events of Sunday and Monday nights is to become convinced of the presence of what can only be called a police riot.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;[a]fter four days and nights of violence, 668 people had been arrested, 425 demonstrators were treated at temporary medical facilities, 200 were treated on the spot, 400 given first aid for tear gas exposure and 110 went to hospital. A total of 192 police officers were injured.&quot;

After the Chicago protests, some demonstrators believed the majority of Americans would side with them over what had happened in Chicago, especially because of police behavior. The controversy over the war in Vietnam overshadowed their cause. Daley shared he had received 135,000 letters supporting his actions and only 5,000 condemning them. Public opinion polls demonstrated that the majority of Americans supported the mayor&#x27;s tactics. It was often commented through the popular media that on that evening, America decided to vote for Richard Nixon.
After the convention, which had very publicly exposed the fault-lines between hawkish and dovish Democrats, Humphrey was 22 points behind Nixon in the polls. By contrast to the violence and chaos in Chicago, the Republican convention in Miami had been a model of order and unity, which made Nixon appear better qualified to be president as even Humphrey himself conceded in private.

On September 30, 1968, Humphrey gave a speech in Salt Lake City that he had intended to deliver at the convention in Chicago, saying he was willing to unconditionally stop the bombing of North Vietnam to break the deadlock in the peace talks in Paris. At this point, Humphrey, who was behind in the polls, saw his numbers began to rise; Nixon was certainly concerned in October 1968 that he might lose the election. By late October 1968, Humphrey had a slight lead with 44% intending to vote for him compared to 43% for Nixon. The election of 1968 was one of the closest ever in American history with Nixon winning 31.7 million votes, Humphrey 31.2 million votes and Wallace 10 million votes.

===Chicago Seven===

A grand jury charged eight defendants with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other federal crimes following the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The defendants became known as the Chicago Eight: Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, and Lee Weiner. During the trial, the case against Bobby Seale was declared a mistrial, and the Chicago Eight then became the Chicago Seven. Demonstrations were held daily during the trial, organized by the MOBE, the Young Lords led by Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, and the local Black Panther Party led by chairman Fred Hampton. In February 1970, five of the seven defendants were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and all were acquitted of conspiracy. Froines and Weiner were acquitted on all charges.

While the jury was deliberating, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced the defendants and their attorneys to jail terms ranging from months to 4 years for contempt of court. In 1972, the convictions were reversed on appeal, and the government declined to bring the case to trial again.

==The McGovern–Fraser Commission==
In response to the party disunity and electoral failure that came out of the convention, the party established the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection (informally known as the McGovern–Fraser Commission), to examine current rules on the ways candidates were nominated and make recommendations designed to broaden participation and enable better representation for minorities and others who were underrepresented. The commission documented that in many places in America the Democratic Party was &quot;an autocratic, authoritarian organization&quot; that engaged in the &quot;shameful exploitation of the voter&quot;.

The commission established more open procedures and affirmative action guidelines for selecting delegates. The changes imposed by the commission required that the number of delegates who were Black, women, Hispanic and between the ages of 18 and 30 reflected the proportion of the people in those groups in every congressional district. In addition the commission required all delegate selection procedures to be open; party leaders could no longer handpick the delegates in secret. The changes brought about by the commission ended the ability of local bosses who headed political machines such as Daley to ensure delegations that were subservient to them attended conventions. The rule changes brought by the commission also marked the beginning of the end of the Democratic delegations that were almost entirely male and usually entirely white, ensuring in the future Democratic delegations would be more diverse. An unforeseen result of these rules was a large shift toward state presidential primaries. Prior to the reforms, Democrats in two-thirds of the states used state conventions to choose convention delegates. In the post-reform era, over three-quarters of the states use primary elections to choose delegates, and over 80% of convention delegates are selected in these primaries.

<doc id="42632" wikidata="Q3282146" url="?curid=42632" title="Flood (They Might Be Giants album)">
<text>Flood is the third studio album by Brooklyn-based alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants, released in January 1990. &quot;Flood&quot; was the duo&#x27;s first album on the major label Elektra Records. It generated three singles: &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;, &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;, and the domestic promotional track &quot;Twisting&quot;. The album is generally considered to be the band&#x27;s definitive release, as it is their best-selling and most recognizable album, and is regarded by some as one of the best albums of the 1990s. Despite minimal stylistic and instrumental differences from previous releases, &quot;Flood&quot; is distinguished by contributions from seasoned producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. John Linnell and John Flansburgh also took advantage of new equipment and recording techniques, including unconventional, home-recorded samples, which were programmed through Casio FZ-1 synthesizers. The album was recorded in New York City at Skyline Studios, which was better equipped than studios the band had worked in previously.

Promotion for &quot;Flood&quot; included television appearances, promotional videos, and an international tour. The album&#x27;s mainstream promotion and success contributed to its status as the band&#x27;s most well known album. Many fans, including young viewers of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, were first exposed to They Might Be Giants&#x27;s music through &quot;Flood&quot;.

The album was initially issued on CD, LP, and cassette. Upon its release, &quot;Flood&quot; was met with praise from critics and achieved moderate success on sales charts. In 2013, the album was reissued as part of a CD series spanning They Might Be Giants&#x27; four Elektra releases. In 2014, it was reissued on LP in Europe by Music On Vinyl and in the United States by Asbestos Records for Record Store Day and Black Friday, and it was reissued again on LP in 2015 and in 2023 on the band&#x27;s label, Idlewild Recordings.

==Background==
&quot;Flood&quot; was They Might Be Giants&#x27; first release on a major label. Elektra Records approached the band in 1989 following the unexpected success of their second album, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was largely due to the work of Susan Drew, an A&amp;R worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability to take advantage of the label&#x27;s resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by several guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the electronic drums for the album.

==Recording and production==

The album was recorded in the fall of 1989 at Skyline Studios in New York City. Skyline was only a few blocks away from the Public Access Synthesizer Studio, where the band had recorded their previous albums. Alan Bezozi and John Flansburgh worked together to create atypical drum tracks, including one that samples the sound of Flansburgh&#x27;s kitchen sink and refrigerator being struck with a drum stick. An Alesis SR-16 drum machine was used to program the drums.

Two-thirds of the album&#x27;s budget was exhausted for the production of four songs: &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;, &quot;Your Racist Friend&quot;, &quot;We Want a Rock&quot;, and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;. These four tracks were produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.

==Style and composition==
Like many of They Might Be Giants&#x27; early releases, &quot;Flood&quot; features a range of stylistic eclecticism. The press release for the album notes the &quot;rock rave-up &#x27;Twisting&#x27; ... the [country] inflected &#x27;Lucky Ball &amp; Chain&#x27; ... the existential oom-pah of &#x27;Particle Man&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;tender night-light metaphor and melody&quot; of the lead single, &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. Jon Pareles wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the album &quot;shrug[s] off most typecasting&quot;. He added that through releases like &quot;Flood&quot;, They Might Be Giants and a new wave of alternative musicians were gainsaying the standard practice of sticking to only one genre.

Regardless of the genre employed, They Might Be Giants are noted for unconventional lyrics, characterized by &quot;bizarre&quot; cleverness. &quot;Flood&quot; includes abundant examples of this style, manifested in unusual subject matter, unreliable narrators, and wordplay. However, John Linnell and Flansburgh took care to avoid using humor excessively, acknowledging the requirement that recorded music withstand repeated listens without losing value. Linnell has pointed out that in general, he writes melodies prior to writing lyrics. This creates the challenge of fitting the appropriate syllables and stresses into each line; often, demos were recorded with dummy lyrics to simplify the process. Linnell&#x27;s melodies are often based around scales. D. X. Ferris, with commentary from John Linnell and John Flansburgh, outlined each individual track from &quot;Flood&quot; in a retrospective article published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;Theme From Flood&quot; acts as a tongue-in-cheek introduction to the album, and it is regarded by scholars Elizabeth Sandifer and Alex Reed to be one of the first in a recurring trend of processional tunes composed by John Linnell. It is followed by the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. Although the melody for &quot;Birdhouse&quot; was written years prior to the lyrics, the lyrics were &quot;shoehorned in to match the melody&quot;, according to Linnell. The narrative is given from the point of view of a child&#x27;s nightlight. According to John Linnell, the song was almost wrecked when he attempted to underscore it with a more dramatic drum track. Producers Winstanley and Langer opposed this decision and the drum track was scrapped. Linnell speculates that had this not been the case, the entire album might have suffered. Reed and Sandifer also note that the song makes an unanticipated jump from the key of C major to E-flat major and then back to C major. The track&#x27;s later shifts to F-sharp minor and A major lead to the division of the octave into equal intervals. Reed and Sandifer call &quot;Flood&quot; in general &quot;modular&quot; in its movement between musical ideas, which they accredit partly to its largely digital composition: the band&#x27;s MIDI sequencer made it easy to transpose sections of a song out of the original key.

&quot;Lucky Ball and Chain&quot; employs the unreliable narrator motif, according to Linnell. Influenced by the country-western musical tradition, the song is a &quot;simple regret song&quot; dealing with &quot;the one that got away&quot;. The fourth track and second single, &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;, a cover of the 1953 original, was added by Flansburgh and Linnell to their repertoire in the early 1980s to lengthen their live sets. From that point, it evolved from a folk-inspired cover to the baroque pop rendition that appears on &quot;Flood&quot;. A Casio FZ-1 synthesizer was used to perform the song in the studio. &quot;Dead&quot;, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;one of TMBG&#x27;s most abstract and personal songs&quot;, follows the story of someone dying and then being &quot;reincarnated as a bag of groceries&quot;. According to Linnell, &quot;The dreamlike relationship between returning expired groceries and returning from the grave after you expire appealed to me.&quot;

&quot;Your Racist Friend&quot;, produced by Langer and Winstanley, is a politically charged song which follows a fairly straightforward narrative. The song, which depicts a social conflict, is considered to be the band&#x27;s most clear &quot;political statement&quot;. On the other hand, the accordion-tinged &quot;Particle Man&quot; lightheartedly chronicles the disputes of four characters, the titular Particle Man, Universe Man, Person Man, and Triangle Man. Linnell has claimed that the character Triangle Man was inspired by Robert Mitchum&#x27;s appearance in the 1955 film &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;. The final single, &quot;Twisting&quot;, was selected over &quot;Your Racist Friend&quot;, in part because it was more lyrically ambiguous. The song references both The Young Fresh Fellows and The dB&#x27;s, two groups that influenced the sound of the track itself. Flansburgh has noted that, while recording the song, Bezozi accidentally erased the entire drum track for &quot;Twisting&quot;. Flansburgh then had to recreate the track from scratch. The cryptic &quot;We Want a Rock&quot; features a violin performance by Mark Feldman, and &quot;Someone Keeps Moving My Chair&quot; revolves around petty concerns and their importance &quot;when everything else is going haywire&quot;. &quot;Hearing Aid&quot; features the mixing of standard They Might Be Giants sounds with an Arto Lindsay guitar solo and vacuum cleaner synth sounds, experimentations that Flansburgh found difficult to achieve.

&quot;Minimum Wage&quot;, which features only those two words, saw the band dabbling in sampling (specifically the 1966 Frank Sinatra recording of &quot;Downtown&quot;). The sound of the whip was crafted in the studio when the band was unable to find a suitable stock sound effect; the effect was a composite of a wind sound from Linnell&#x27;s Moog keyboard and the crack of a wet towel, courtesy of Roger Moutenot. &quot;Letterbox&quot;, which was also considered as a potential single from the album, was another track that had been in live setlists years prior to the release of the album. For &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot;, Flansburgh and Linnell wanted the bass drum to be extremely pronounced, although they were later unhappy with the result. Linnell noted that, lyrically, the song is about two men who engage in a fight, only for the listener to soon learn that they are both in prison. &quot;Hot Cha!&quot; references the name of a wooden horse in the Parker Brothers board game &quot;Derby Day&quot;; musically, the song is a mix of eclectic sounds (such as the noise of mallets and drumsticks banging on a sink and base of a refrigerator), samples (such as a door buzzer), and unique recording methods (such as running horn samples through a guitar fuzz box). In the cheerful tune &quot;Women and Men&quot;, the band examines human reproduction from a &quot;disengaged view&quot;, and &quot;Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love&quot; takes its title from a Mahavishnu Orchestra album cut of the same name. &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; operates as the band&#x27;s manifesto and was inspired by The Monkees song &quot;(Theme From) The Monkees&quot;. &quot;Flood&quot; concludes with &quot;Road Movie to Berlin&quot;, which was written by John Flansburgh in Germany in 1989 (at which point the Berlin Wall still stood). The song deals with the clash between absurdism and existentialism that the band encountered while touring Europe. Flansburgh&#x27;s voice was slowed down for this song, an effect that he later called &quot;creepy&quot;. Due to the haste with which the final portion of the album was recorded, the band accidentally forgot to include an entire verse of the song in the finished product; Linnell and Flansburgh felt that they did not have the time to fix it, so the mistake remained. The song also makes use of &quot;synthetic or sampled&quot; trumpet sounds, one of which was also included in &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;.

==Artwork==
The photograph used for the cover of the album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together washbasins. The image was captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band&#x27;s name, inked by Flansburgh&#x27;s former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.

==Promotion==
To promote &quot;Flood&quot;, Elektra produced a promotional video featuring Linnell and Flansburgh facetiously extolling the album&#x27;s merits. One sarcastic quip was that the album included nineteen songs, which made it inherently better than other albums with fewer tracks. The video also included a live performance of &quot;Particle Man&quot; and a sample of the lead single &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. The band also produced a music video, directed by Adam Bernstein, for &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. In April, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; to perform the song with Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band. Severinsen&#x27;s unusually fast count-in resulted in a performance with a noticeably higher tempo than the album recording. Linnell and Flansburgh would later adopt a similar tempo for subsequent live performances.

===Tour===
In support of &quot;Flood&quot;, They Might Be Giants toured North America and Europe, including a series of shows in Germany. Due to the scale of the tour, the band&#x27;s road crew doubled in size—increasing from two members to four. Linnell and Flansburgh have recounted the unfamiliarity of touring outside of North America. In Europe, they report that crowds acted differently due to cultural gaps.

The band continued to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum. Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was received as a boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination of old and new material. As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a metronome in lieu of a full rhythm section.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Flood&quot; received generally positive reviews, though some critics expressed reservations. Chris Heim wrote for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that the album is a rare example of success for a &quot;quirky cult band&quot; signed to a major label. Steve Simels, writing for &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, compared the album&#x27;s structural complexities to The Beach Boys at the peak of their career. Simels praised the album&#x27;s originality and intellect, while heavily criticizing other contemporary music for lacking those characteristics. Writing in &quot;Spin&quot;, Ira Robbins called &quot;Flood&quot; &quot;another captivating variety show of art-rock, swing, the Bonzo Dog Band, cow-pop, show tunes and the Schmenge Brothers ... Boundless imagination, loopy mix-and-match arrangements and a gyroscopic sense of what makes a pop tune click are still responsible for the easy and abiding appeal of TMBG&#x27;s ingenious material.&quot; In a retrospective AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that despite some inconsistencies and awkward selections, the album is musically superior to its predecessors. He observed that through &quot;Flood&quot;, Flansburgh and Linnell &quot;exchange quirky artiness for unabashed geekiness&quot;. Six of the album&#x27;s nineteen tracks are designated as AllMusic &quot;picks&quot;. Reviewing the album in 2022 for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Quinn Moreland commented that the duo&#x27;s &quot;ability to grab listeners with sharp, catchy songwriting was never more evident than on ... &quot;Flood&quot;, where their expansive imagination was matched by major label money.&quot;

Reviews in the UK were also mostly positive. In a review for &quot;Q&quot;, Peter Kane lauded the record for its uniqueness and for the sheer quantity of tracks, which he said ensured that the listener would enjoy at least one song, and concluded that &quot;Flood&quot; was &quot;as playful an entertainment as will be heard all year&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot; Jerry Smith called the collection &quot;a weird and wonderful varied combination of the zany, trivial, witty and wacky, delivered with a spritely foot-tapping ease that belies their bizarre subject matter&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Iestyn George observed that &quot;if it&#x27;s to be faulted, the album is a mite too cluttered for its own good, but the virtues of imagination and originality that these native New Yorkers display are worthy of enthusiastic approval&quot;. Andy Ross of &quot;Sounds&quot; believed that it was the duo&#x27;s melodic talents that prevented them from becoming just a novelty act, and wrote that &quot;Flood&quot; was &quot;a real cryptic crossword of an album, requiring perseverance and application with ultimately rewarding and fulfilling results&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s David Browne found &quot;Flood&quot; to be unremarkable overall. Both critics chastised the band&#x27;s novelty, which they found to be wearing thin as time progressed. In the UK Caroline Sullivan of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; felt that enjoyment of &quot;Flood&quot; &quot;hinges upon one&#x27;s general feelings about similarly zany characters like Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. If their very American, very beatnik, surrealism spells instant yawnorama, forget TMBG—they&#x27;re the same thing, but minus the good tunes.&quot; However, in a 2009 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article revisiting &quot;Flood&quot; near its twentieth anniversary, D. X. Ferris praised the album as both the band&#x27;s most iconic release and one that revolutionized the college radio scene.

===Commercial response===
&quot;Flood&quot; peaked at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, spending 22 weeks on the chart. The lead single from the album, &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;, reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single also charted in Ireland and the UK. &quot;Twisting&quot;, which was released as a domestic promotional single, peaked at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album also contains two of the band&#x27;s most well known songs, &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; and &quot;Particle Man&quot;. The former was released as a single, reaching number 61 on the UK Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the US.

&quot;Flood&quot; was the first album released by They Might Be Giants to receive the RIAA Platinum sales award—indicating sales over one million copies—which it achieved on July 10, 2009. It is also certified Gold by the BPI in the United Kingdom.

==Legacy==

&quot;Flood&quot; is They Might Be Giants&#x27; best-selling album, and it is widely regarded as their most iconic. Due to the acclaim with which it was received, the album is considered to have cemented the band&#x27;s reputation as a staple of alternative and college rock. Curtis Silver, in a retrospective for &quot;Wired&quot;, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, many of whom were first exposed to the band through &quot;Flood&quot;. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band&#x27;s old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band&#x27;s earliest albums as their favorites—though often not &quot;Flood&quot;, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success. Pitchfork ranked it the 25th best album of the 1990s, while
Strange Currencies ranked it the 80th best of the 1990s,
and Treble named it the 95th best out of 150.

In April 1990, the band performed &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;, in a faster-tempo version accompanied by bandleader Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band.

In February 1991, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; aired animated music videos for two tracks from the album, &quot;Particle Man&quot; and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;. Through the program, the band was exposed to a younger set of fans. This ultimately led the band to begin releasing children&#x27;s music alongside their &quot;rock albums&quot; over a decade later.

They Might Be Giants has performed &quot;Flood&quot; live in its entirety on numerous occasions. In 2015, the band released the live album &quot;Flood Live in Australia&quot;, a recording of the album played live in 2013, in which the songs are performed in reverse order, starting with &quot;Road Movie to Berlin&quot; and ending with &quot;Theme from Flood&quot;. The band has performed multiple &quot;Flood&quot; concerts in the reverse-order format. In other shows, the songs are played out of sequence.

The band planned to perform a series of &quot;Flood&quot; concerts in early 2020 to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, but the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dates were rescheduled to between September 2020 and May 2021, but these were also postponed. Following this, the shows were rescheduled in early 2022, with 43 dates from June 2022 to May 2023. Some early tour dates were additionally postponed to later in the schedule due to Flansburgh suffering broken ribs in a car accident.

<text>The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Capitol Records in the US and on 16 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of the former band member Syd Barrett, who had departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.

The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd&#x27;s earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band&#x27;s earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. The engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of the session singer Clare Torry, who appears on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.

&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band&#x27;s road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to the keyboardist Richard Wright&#x27;s request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design which would represent the band&#x27;s lighting and the album&#x27;s themes. The album was promoted with two singles: &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;.

&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; has received widespread critical acclaim and is often featured in professional listings of the greatest albums of all time. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is certified 14× platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, where it has charted for 990 weeks. By 2013, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling release, the best-selling album of the 1970s, and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

== Background ==
Following &quot;Meddle&quot; in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States that December. In a band meeting at the home of the drummer, Nick Mason, in North London, the bassist, Roger Waters, proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters conceived an album that dealt with things that &quot;make people mad&quot;, focusing on the pressures associated with the band&#x27;s arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the mental health problems suffered by the former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with the 1969 concert suite &quot;The Man&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;The Journey&quot;. In an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the guitarist, David Gilmour, said: &quot;I think we all thought and Roger definitely thought that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.&quot;
The band approved of Waters&#x27; concept for an album unified by a single theme, and all the members participated in writing and producing material. Waters created demo tracks in a small studio in a garden shed at his home in Islington. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of &quot;Breathe&quot; came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of &quot;The Body&quot;, and the basic structure of &quot;Us and Them&quot; was borrowed from an original composition, &quot;The Violent Sequence&quot;, by the keyboardist, Richard Wright, for &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones and at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries. This would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). After discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to &quot;Eclipse&quot;. The new material was premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head&#x27;s album the title was changed back to the band&#x27;s original preference.

&quot;Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics&quot;, as it was then known, was performed for an assembled press on 17 February 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, more than a year before its release, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of &quot;The Times&quot; described the piece as &quot;bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.&quot; Derek Jewell of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote &quot;The ambition of the Floyd&#x27;s artistic intention is now vast.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was less enthusiastic: &quot;Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London Zoo.&quot; The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album. Differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as &quot;On the Run&quot;, and Clare Torry&#x27;s vocals on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; replaced by readings from the Bible.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for the French director Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s film &quot;La Vallée&quot;. They performed in Japan, returned to France in March to complete work on the film, played more shows in North America, then flew to London and resumed recording in May and June. After more concerts in Europe and North America, the band returned to London on 9 January 1973 to complete the album.

== Concept ==
&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, although it lacked the extended instrumental excursions which, according to the critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band following the departure of the founding member Syd Barrett in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett&#x27;s replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as &quot;that psychedelic noodling stuff&quot;. He and Waters cited 1971&#x27;s &quot;Meddle&quot; as a turning point towards what would later be realised on the album. &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;″s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death and insanity, the last inspired in part by Barrett&#x27;s deteriorating mental state. The album contains musique concrète on several tracks.

Each side of the vinyl album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, &quot;empathy&quot;. &quot;Speak to Me&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one&#x27;s own life &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid to care&quot;. By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental &quot;On the Run&quot; evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright&#x27;s fear of flying. &quot;Time&quot; examines the manner in which its passage can control one&#x27;s life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in &quot;Breathe (Reprise)&quot;. The first side of the album ends with Wright and Clare Torry&#x27;s soulful metaphor for death, &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.

&quot;Money&quot;, the first track on side two, opens with the sound of cash registers and rhythmically jingling coins. The song mocks greed and consumerism with sarcastic lyrics and cash-related sound effects. &quot;Money&quot; became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful track and was covered by other artists. &quot;Us and Them&quot; addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; tackles the illusion of choice one has in society. &quot;Brain Damage&quot; looks at mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line &quot;and if the band you&#x27;re in starts playing different tunes&quot; reflects the mental breakdown of Syd Barrett. The album ends with &quot;Eclipse&quot;, which espouses the concepts of otherness and unity, while encouraging the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.

== Recording ==

&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in approximately 60 days between 31 May 1972 and 9 February 1973. Pink Floyd were assigned the staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as the assistant tape operator on their fifth album, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; (1970), and had gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles albums &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; sessions made use of advanced studio techniques, as the studio was capable of 16-track mixes which offered greater flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes Pink Floyd had previously worked with, although the band often used so many tracks that second-generation copies were still needed to make more space available on the tape. The mix supervisor Chris Thomas recalled later, &quot;There were only two or three tracks of drums when we came to mixing it. Depending on the song, there would be one or two tracks of guitar, and these would include the solo and the rhythm guitar parts. One track for keyboard, one track for bass, and one or two sound effects tracks. They had been very, very efficient in the way they&#x27;d worked.&quot;

The first track recorded was &quot;Us and Them&quot; on 31 May, followed seven days later by &quot;Money&quot;. For &quot;Money&quot;, Waters had created effects loops in an unusual time signature from recordings of money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl in his wife&#x27;s pottery studio. These were re-recorded to take advantage of the band&#x27;s decision to create a quadraphonic mix of the album, although Parsons later expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, which he attributed to a lack of time and a shortage of multitrack tape recorders.

&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for a tour of the United States. The recording sessions were frequently interrupted: Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop to watch &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; on television while Parsons worked on the tracks. Gilmour recalled, &quot;...but when we were on a roll, we would get on.&quot;
After returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;, and fine-tuned work from previous sessions. Four female vocalists were assembled to sing on &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, and the saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;. With the director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for &quot;Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii&quot;. The album was completed and signed off at Abbey Road on 9 February 1973. Gilmour recalled the band listening to the finished album for the first time as &quot;a moment of great joy and of satisfaction and the feeling of achievement that we&#x27;d really gone that extra mile&quot;.

=== Instrumentation ===
The album features metronomic sound effects during &quot;Speak to Me&quot; and tape loops for the opening of &quot;Money&quot;. Mason created a rough version of &quot;Speak to Me&quot; at his home before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of &quot;Breathe&quot;. Mason received a rare solo composing credit for &quot;Speak to Me&quot;.

The sound effects on &quot;Money&quot; were created by splicing together Waters&#x27; recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a 7-beat effects loop. This was later adapted to four tracks to create a &quot;walk around the room&quot; effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album. At times, the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the studio engineers and all four band members to operate the mixing console&#x27;s faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs, particularly &quot;On the Run&quot;.

Along with conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd introduced prominent synthesisers to their sound. The band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;, and a Synthi A on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;. They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as assistant engineer Peter James running around the studio&#x27;s echo chamber during &quot;On the Run&quot;, and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat during &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, &quot;On the Run&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot;. This heartbeat is most prominent in the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.
=== Voices ===
Several tracks, including &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, demonstrated Wright&#x27;s and Gilmour&#x27;s ability to harmonise their similar-sounding voices, and the engineer Alan Parsons used techniques such as double tracking vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. Prominent use was also made of flanging and phase-shifting on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels, most notably in the quadraphonic mix of &quot;On the Run&quot;, where the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker swirls around the listener.

Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; features Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter and a regular at Abbey Road. Parsons liked her voice, and when the band decided to use a female vocalist he suggested that she could sing on the track. The band explained the album concept to her, but they were unable to tell her exactly what she should do, and Gilmour, who was in charge of the session, asked her to try to express emotions rather than sing words. In a few takes on a Sunday night, Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright&#x27;s emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth and wanted to apologise to the band, who were impressed with her performance but did not tell her so. Her takes were edited to produce the version used on the track. She left the studio under the impression that her vocals would not make the final cut, and she only became aware that she had been included in the final mix when she picked up the album at a local record store and saw her name in the credits. For her contribution she was paid her standard session fee of £30, equivalent to about £ in 2025.

In 2004, Torry sued EMI and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.

In the final week of recording, Waters asked staff and others at Abbey Road to respond to questions printed on flashcards and some of their replies were edited into the final mix. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3 and shown such questions as &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite colour?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite food?&quot;, before moving on to themes central to the album, including those of madness, violence, and death. Questions such as &quot;When was the last time you were violent?&quot;, followed immediately by &quot;Were you in the right?&quot;, were answered in the order they were presented.

Roadie Roger &quot;The Hat&quot; Manifold was recorded in a conventional sit-down interview. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with a motorist, and Manifold replied &quot;... give &#x27;em a quick, short, sharp shock ...&quot; Asked about death, he responded, &quot;Live for today, gone tomorrow, that&#x27;s me ...&quot; Another roadie, Chris Adamson, recorded the words that open the album: &quot;I&#x27;ve been mad for fucking years. Absolutely years. Over the edge... It&#x27;s working with bands that does it.&quot;

The band&#x27;s road manager Peter Watts (father of the actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, as well as the line &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything to say&quot;. His second wife, Patricia &quot;Puddie&quot; Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the &quot;geezer&quot; who was &quot;cruisin&#x27; for a bruisin, used in the segue between &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and the words &quot;I never said I was frightened of dying&quot; halfway through &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.

Several of the responses – &quot;I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do, I don&#x27;t mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There&#x27;s no reason for it  ... you&#x27;ve got to go sometime&quot;; &quot;I know I&#x27;ve been mad, I&#x27;ve always been mad, like most of us have&quot;; and the closing &quot;There is no dark side in the moon really. Matter of fact, it&#x27;s all dark&quot; – came from the studios&#x27; Irish doorman, Gerry O&#x27;Driscoll. &quot;The bit you don&#x27;t hear,&quot; said Parsons, &quot;is that, after that, he said, &#x27;The only thing that makes it look alight is the sun.&#x27; The band were too overjoyed with his first line, and it would have been an anticlimax to continue.&quot;

Paul and Linda McCartney were interviewed, but their answers – judged to be &quot;trying too hard to be funny&quot; – were not used. The McCartneys&#x27; Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I was really drunk at the time.&quot;

=== Completion ===
When the flashcard sessions were finished, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide &quot;a fresh pair of ears&quot; for the final mix. Thomas&#x27;s background was in music rather than engineering; he had worked with Beatles producer George Martin and was an acquaintance of Pink Floyd&#x27;s manager, Steve O&#x27;Rourke. The members of the band were said to have disagreed over the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;clean&quot; mix that made more use of the non-musical elements and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more &quot;echoey&quot; mix. Thomas said later, &quot;There was no difference in opinion between them, I don&#x27;t remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.&quot;

Thomas&#x27;s intervention resulted in a compromise between Waters and Gilmour, who were both satisfied with the result. Thomas was responsible for significant changes, including the perfect timing of the echo used on &quot;Us and Them&quot;. He was also present for the recording of &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;. Waters said in an interview in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio:

== Packaging ==
The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band&#x27;s previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism, as they were employed by the band. For &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Wright suggested something &quot;smarter, neater more classy&quot;, and simple, &quot;like the artwork of a Black Magic chocolate box&quot;.

The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a beam of white light projected through it and emerging in the colours of the visible spectrum that Thorgerson had found in a 1963 physics textbook, as well as by an illustration by Alex Steinweiss, the inventor of album cover art, for the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s 1942 performance of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Emperor Concerto. The artwork was created by an associate of Hipgnosis, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered a choice of seven designs for the sleeve, but all four members of the band agreed that the prism was the best. &quot;There were no arguments,&quot; said Roger Waters. &quot;We all pointed to the prism and said &#x27;That&#x27;s the one&#x27;.&quot;

The design depicts a glass prism dispersing white light into colours and represents three elements: the band&#x27;s stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright&#x27;s request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design. At Waters&#x27; suggestion, the spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson&#x27;s suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, to make possible interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo, compared with the usual division of the visible spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.

The band were so confident of the quality of Waters&#x27; lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album&#x27;s sleeve.

== Release ==
As the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was played over a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Roy Hollingworth described Side One as &quot;so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow&quot;, but praised Side Two, writing: &quot;The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.&quot; Steve Peacock of &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;ve never heard a note of the Pink Floyd&#x27;s music in your life, I&#x27;d unreservedly recommend everyone to &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;&quot;. In his 1973 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Loyd Grossman declared &quot;Dark Side&quot; &quot;a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious, but called it a &quot;kitsch masterpiece&quot; that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry&#x27;s saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour&#x27;s guitar solos.

&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart&#x27;s number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.

=== Label ===
Much of the album&#x27;s early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd&#x27;s US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band&#x27;s 1971 studio album &quot;Meddle&quot;. Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O&#x27;Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon&#x27;s enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;.

In some countries notably the UK Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Point Me at the Sky&quot;, and unusually &quot;Money&quot; was released as a single on 7 May, with &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; on the B-side. It reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word &quot;bullshit&quot; removed from the song leaving &quot;bull&quot; in its place however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with &quot;Time&quot; on one side, and &quot;Us and Them&quot; on the opposite side. Menon&#x27;s efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).

=== Sales ===
&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; became one of the best-selling albums of all time and is in the top 25 of a list of best-selling albums in the United States. Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for 736 nonconsecutive weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 16 July 1988). Of those first 736 charted weeks, the album had two notable consecutive runs in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart: 84 weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 19 October 1974) and 593 weeks (from 18 December 1976 to 23 April 1988). It made its final appearance in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart during its initial run on the week ending 8 October 1988, in its 741st charted week. It re-appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in the issue dated 25 May 1991, and was still a perennial feature ten years later. It reached number one on the Pop Catalog chart when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000 copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006 &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; achieved a combined total of 1,716 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Pop Catalog charts.

After a change in chart methodology in 2009 which allowed catalogue titles to be included in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; since then, with the total at 990 weeks on the chart as of May 2024. &quot;On a slow week&quot; between 8,000 and 9,000 copies are sold. As of April 2013, the album had sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for &quot;Billboard&quot;. One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of 50 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy.

&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was released before the introduction of platinum certification in 1976 by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and therefore held only a gold certification until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11 times platinum. On 4 June 1998, the RIAA certified the album 15× platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States. This makes it Pink Floyd&#x27;s biggest-selling work there; &quot;The Wall&quot; is 23 times platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5 million. &quot;Money&quot; has sold well as a single, and as with &quot;Time&quot;, remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, &quot;Time&quot; was played on 13,723 occasions, and &quot;Money&quot; on 13,731 occasions. In 2017, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was the seventh-bestselling album of all time in the UK and the highest-selling album never to reach number one. As one of the blockbuster LPs of the album era (1960s–2000s), &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; also led to an increase in record sales overall into the late 1970s. In 2013, industry sources suggested that worldwide sales of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; totalled about 45 million.In 1993, Gilmour attributed the album&#x27;s success to the combination of music, lyrics and cover art: &quot;All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise.&quot; Mason said that, when they finished the album, Pink Floyd felt confident it was their best work to date, but were surprised by its commercial success. He said it was &quot;not only about being a good album but also about being in the right place at the right time&quot;.

=== Reissues and remasters ===

In 1979, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their &quot;Ultradisc&quot; gold CD format. It was released by EMI and Harvest on CD in Japan in June 1983 and in the US and Europe in August 1984. In 1992, it was rereleased as a remastered CD in the box set &quot;Shine On&quot;. This version was re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year, with a cover design by Thorgerson. On some pressings, an orchestral version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is faintly audible after &quot;Eclipse&quot; over the closing heartbeats.

==== 30th-anniversary 5.1 surround sound mix ====

A quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. For the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons&#x27; quadraphonic mix, and instead had the engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1 channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since their eleventh album, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and had previously worked on surround versions of &quot;The Wall&quot; for DVD-Video and Waters&#x27; &quot;In the Flesh&quot; for SACD. In 2003, Parsons expressed disappointment with Guthrie&#x27;s SACD mix, suggesting he was &quot;possibly a little too true to the original mix&quot;, but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and sold more than 800,000 copies.

The cover image of the 30th-anniversary edition was created by a team of designers including Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the &quot;sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound ...&quot; The image was created out of a desire to be &quot;the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new&quot;.

==== Later reissues ====
&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was rereleased in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl and mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering. It included slightly different versions of the posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th-anniversary poster.

In 2007, the album was included in &quot;Oh, by the Way&quot;, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011, it was reissued featuring a remastered version with various other material.

In 2023, Pink Floyd released the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon 50th Anniversary&quot; box set, including a newly remastered edition of the album, surround sound mixes (including the 5.1 mix and a new Dolby Atmos mix), a photo book, and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Live at Wembley 1974&quot;, on vinyl.

In 2024, the 50th Anniversary LP edition was rereleased as The Dark Side Of The Moon 50th Anniversary 2 LP UV Printed Clear Vinyl Collector&#x27;s Edition. The new edition uses 2 clear LP instead of one, just one side is playable so the UV artwork can be printed on the non-groove side.

== Legacy ==

The success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. The group were fans of the British comedy troupe Monty Python, and as such, some of the profits were invested in the production of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: &quot;I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Part of the legacy of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs. It is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in &quot;&#x27;Speak to Me&#x27;: The Legacy of Pink Floyd&#x27;s The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (2006) that the two albums share a theme that &quot;the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world&quot;.

In a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests &quot;encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire&quot;. They had similarities, in that both albums&#x27; cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favour of &quot;inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside &quot;more&quot; meaning)&quot;. But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward &quot;conquering the world&quot; and were known at the time for their outrageous sexual antics on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward &quot;overcoming your own hang-ups&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; frequently appears on professional rankings of the greatest albums. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the 35th best album of the preceding 20 years. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 43 on its 2003 and 2012 lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and number 55 in its 2020 list, Pink Floyd&#x27;s highest placement. Both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; have listed &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; as the best progressive rock album.

In 2006, Australian Broadcasting Corporation viewers voted &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; their favourite album. &quot;NME&quot; readers voted it the eighth-best album in a 2006 poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted it the greatest of all time. The album is also number two on the &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers &quot;in celebration of the art form of the record album&quot;. It ranked 29th in &quot;The Observer&quot;″s 2006 list of &quot;The 50 Albums That Changed Music&quot;, and 37th in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 1997 list of the &quot;100 Best Albums Ever&quot;, as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album. It was voted number 9 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). In 2007, VH1 named &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; the fourth-greatest album cover.

=== Covers, tributes and samples ===
&quot;Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd&quot;, released in 2006, is a cover album of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; featuring artists such as Adrian Belew, Tommy Shaw, Dweezil Zappa, and Rick Wakeman. In 2000, The Squirrels released &quot;The Not So Bright Side of the Moon&quot;, which features a cover of the entire album. The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released &quot;Dub Side of the Moon&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Dubber Side of the Moon&quot; in 2010. The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album &quot;Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella&quot;, a complete a cappella version of the album. The bluegrass band Poor Man&#x27;s Whiskey frequently play the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite &quot;Dark Side of the Moonshine&quot;. A string quartet version of the album was released in 2003. In 2009, the Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians.

Several notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers have used samples from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in their own material. Jam-rock band Phish performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part of their show on 2 November 1998 in West Valley City, Utah. Progressive metal band Dream Theater have twice covered the album in their live shows, and in May 2011 Mary Fahl released &quot;From the Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, a song-by-song &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the album. Milli Vanilli used the tape loops from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; to open their track &quot;Money&quot;, followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch on &quot;Music for the People&quot;.

=== &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; ===

In the 1990s, it was discovered that playing &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; alongside the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; produced moments of apparent synchronicity, and it was suggested that this was intentional. Such moments include Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric &quot;no one told you when to run&quot; during &quot;Time&quot;, balancing on a fence, tightrope-style, during the line &quot;balanced on the biggest wave&quot; in &quot;Breathe&quot;, and putting her ear to the Tin Man&#x27;s chest as the album&#x27;s closing heartbeats are heard. Parsons and members of Pink Floyd denied any connection, with Parsons calling it &quot;a complete load of eyewash ... If you play any record with the sound turned down on the TV, you will find things that work.&quot;

=== &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot; ===

For the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Waters recorded a new version, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot;, released in October 2023. It was recorded with no other members of Pink Floyd, and features spoken word sections and more downbeat arrangements, with no guitar solos. Waters said he wanted to &quot;bring out the heart and soul of the album musically and spiritually&quot;. He also said it is intended to be taken from the perspective of an older man, as &quot;not enough people recognised what it&#x27;s about, what it was I was saying then&quot;.

<doc id="42635" wikidata="Q485508" url="?curid=42635" title="Charles Manson">
<text>Charles Milles Manson (; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader, and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some cult members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.

Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. While gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson&#x27;s song &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;, renamed &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot; as a single B-side, but Manson was uncredited. Afterward, he attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful.

Manson would often talk about the Beatles, including their eponymous 1968 album. According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles&#x27; lyrics and adopted the term &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson&#x27;s friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson himself denied having ordered any murders. Nevertheless, he served his time in prison and died from complications from colon cancer in 2017.

== 1934–1967: Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Charles Milles Maddox was born on November 12, 1934, to 15-year-old Ada Kathleen Maddox (1919–1973) of Ashland, Kentucky, in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson&#x27;s biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott, Sr. (1910–1954) of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, against whom Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and had a local reputation as a con artist. He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel, although &quot;Colonel&quot; was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant, he informed her that he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning. Manson never knew his biological father.

In August 1934, before Manson&#x27;s birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (1909–1961), a laborer at a dry cleaning business. Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther Elbert Maddox (1916–1950), leaving Charles with babysitters. Maddox and her husband divorced on April 30, 1937, after William alleged &quot;gross neglect of duty&quot; by Maddox. Charles retained William&#x27;s last name of Manson. On August 1, 1939, Kathleen and Luther were arrested for assault and robbery, and sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment, respectively.

Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia. His mother was paroled in 1942. Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life. Weeks after her release, Manson&#x27;s family moved to Charleston, West Virginia, where he continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking. She was arrested for grand larceny, but not convicted. The family later moved to Indianapolis, where Maddox met alcoholic Lewis Woodson Cavender Jr. (1916–1979) through Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and married him in August 1943.

=== First offenses ===
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Manson stated that when he was aged 9, he set his school on fire. He also got repeatedly in trouble for truancy and petty theft. Although there was a lack of foster home placements, in 1947, at the age of 13, Manson was placed in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana, a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests. Gibault was a strict school, where punishment for even the smallest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap. Manson ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods, under bridges and wherever else he could find shelter.

Manson fled home to his mother and spent Christmas 1947 at his aunt and uncle&#x27;s house in West Virginia. However, his mother returned him to Gibault. Ten months later, he ran away to Indianapolis. It was there, in 1948, Manson committed his first documented crime by robbing a grocery store, at first to simply find something to eat. However, Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars, which he used to rent a room on Indianapolis&#x27; Skid Row and to buy food.

For a time, Manson had a job delivering messages for Western Union in an attempt to live honestly. However, he quickly began to supplement his wages through theft. He was eventually caught, and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town, a juvenile facility in Omaha, Nebraska. After four days at Boys Town, he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car. They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson&#x27;s uncle in Peoria, Illinois. Nielson&#x27;s uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices. Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the Indiana Boys School, a strict reform school outside of Plainfield, Indiana.

At the Indiana Boys School, other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten. He ran away from the school eighteen times. Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the &quot;insane game&quot;, in which he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince stronger aggressors that he was insane. After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February 1951. The three escapees robbed filling stations while attempting to drive to California in stolen cars until they were arrested in Utah. For the federal crime of driving a stolen car across state lines, Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.&#x27;s National Training School for Boys. On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate but had an above-average IQ of 109. His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial.

=== First imprisonment ===
On a psychiatrist&#x27;s recommendation, Manson was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a minimum security institution in Virginia. His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and help him find work. Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in Petersburg, Virginia, where he committed a further &quot;eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts&quot;. He was then moved to a maximum security reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio, where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.
In January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie &quot;Rosie&quot; Jean Willis (January 28, 1939 – August 21, 2009). Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years&#x27; probation. Manson&#x27;s failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment at Terminal Island in Los Angeles.

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson Jr. (April 10, 1956 – June 29, 1993). During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years&#x27; probation and his parole was denied.

=== Second imprisonment ===
Manson received five years&#x27; parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a ten-year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman named Leona Rae &quot;Candy&quot; Stevens, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a &quot;tearful plea&quot; before the court that she and Manson were &quot;deeply in love ... and would marry if Charlie were freed&quot;. Before the year&#x27;s end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so she would not be required to testify against him.

Manson took Leona and another woman to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the Mann Act. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a bench warrant was issued. An indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960. Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in Laredo, Texas, and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten-year sentence.

Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington. There, he took guitar lessons from Barker–Karpis gang leader Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis, and obtained from another inmate the contact information of Phil Kaufman, a producer at Universal Studios in Hollywood. Among Manson&#x27;s fellow prisoners during this time was future actor Danny Trejo, with the two participating in several hypnosis sessions together. Manson&#x27;s mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rule/Guinn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. Manson&#x27;s September 1961 annual review noted he had a &quot;tremendous drive to call attention to himself&quot;, an observation echoed in September 1964. In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther Manson. According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late-1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.

In June 1966, Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his thirty-two years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.

== 1967–1968: San Francisco and cult formation==
=== Parolee and patient ===
Less than a month after his 1967 release, Manson moved to Berkeley from Los Angeles, which could have been a probation violation. Instead, after calling the San Francisco probation office upon his arrival, he was transferred to the supervision of criminology doctoral researcher and federal probation officer Roger Smith. Until the spring of 1968, Smith worked at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC), which Manson and his family came to frequent. Roger Smith, as well as the HAFMC&#x27;s founder David Smith, received funding from the National Institutes of Health, and reportedly the CIA, to study the effects of drugs like LSD and methamphetamine on the counterculture movement in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight–Ashbury District. The patients at the HAFMC became subjects of their research, including Manson and his expanding group of mostly female followers, who came to see Roger Smith regularly.

Manson received permission from Roger Smith to move from Berkeley to the Haight-Ashbury District. He first took LSD and would use it frequently during his time there. David Smith, who had studied the effects of LSD and amphetamines in rodents, wrote that the change in Manson&#x27;s personality during this time &quot;was the most abrupt Roger Smith had observed in his entire professional career.&quot; Manson also read the book &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, a science fiction novel by Robert Heinlein. Inspired by the burgeoning free love philosophy in Haight–Ashbury during the Summer of Love, Manson began preaching his own philosophy based on a mixture of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, the Bible, Scientology, Dale Carnegie and the Beatles, which quickly earned him a following. He may have also borrowed some of his philosophy from the Process Church of the Final Judgment, whose members believed Satan would become reconciled to Jesus and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity.

=== Involvement with Scientology ===
Manson began studying Scientology while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner, and in July 1961 listed Scientology as his religion. A September 1961 prison report argues that Manson &quot;appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through his study of this discipline&quot;. Another prison report in August 1966 stated that Manson was no longer an advocate of Scientology. Upon his release in 1967, Manson traveled to Los Angeles where he reportedly &quot;met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars&quot;. Manson completed 150 hours of auditing. His &quot;right hand man&quot;, Bruce Davis, worked at the Church of Scientology headquarters in London from November 1968 to April 1969.

=== San Francisco followers ===

Shortly after relocating to San Francisco, Manson became acquainted with Mary Brunner, a 23-year-old graduate of University of Wisconsin–Madison. Brunner was working as a library assistant at the University of California, Berkeley, and Manson, until that point making his living by panhandling, moved in with her. Manson then met teenaged runaway Lynette Fromme, later nicknamed &quot;Squeaky,&quot; and convinced her to live with him and Brunner. According to a second-hand account, Manson overcame Brunner&#x27;s initial resistance to him bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner&#x27;s residence with eighteen other women. Manson targeted individuals for manipulation who were emotionally insecure and social outcasts.

Manson established himself as a guru in Haight-Ashbury which, during the Summer of Love, was emerging as the signature hippie locale. Manson soon had the first of his groups of followers, most of them female. They were later dubbed as the &quot;Manson Family&quot; by Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and the media. Manson allegedly taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians, and that The Establishment could be characterized as the Romans.

Sometime around 1967, Manson began using the alias &quot;Charles Willis Manson&quot;. Before the end of summer, he and some of his followers began traveling in an old school bus they had adapted, putting colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They eventually settled in the Los Angeles areas of Topanga Canyon, Malibu and Venice along the coast. 

In 1967, Brunner became pregnant by Manson. On April 15, 1968, she gave birth to their son, whom she named Valentine Michael, in a condemned house where they were living in Topanga Canyon. She was assisted by several of the young women from the fledgling Family. Brunner, like most members of the group, acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: &quot;Marioche&quot;, &quot;Och&quot;, &quot;Mother Mary&quot;, &quot;Mary Manson&quot;, &quot;Linda Dee Manson&quot; and &quot;Christine Marie Euchts&quot;.

In his book &quot;Love Needs Care&quot; about his time at the HAFMC, David Smith claimed that Manson attempted to reprogram his followers&#x27; minds to &quot;submit totally to his will&quot; through the use of &quot;LSD and … unconventional sexual practices&quot; that would turn his followers into &quot;empty vessels that would accept anything he poured&quot;. Manson Family member Paul Watkins testified that Manson would encourage group LSD trips and take lower doses himself to &quot;keep his wits about him&quot;. Watkins stated that &quot;Charlie&#x27;s trip was to program us all to submit.&quot; By the end of his stay in the Haight in April 1968, Manson had attracted twenty or so followers, all under the supervision of Roger Smith and many of the staff at the HAFMC. The core members of Manson&#x27;s following eventually included: Brunner; Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson, a musician and former actor; Bobby Beausoleil, a former musician and pornographic actor; Susan Atkins; Patricia Krenwinkel; and Leslie Van Houten.

=== Subsequent arrests ===
Supervised by his ostensible parole officer Roger Smith, Manson grew his family through drug use and prostitution without interference from the authorities. Manson was arrested on July 31, 1967, for attempting to prevent the arrest of one of his followers, Ruth Ann Moorehouse. Instead of Manson being sent back to prison, the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and Manson was given three additional years of probation. He avoided prosecution again in July 1968, when he and the family were arrested while moving to Los Angeles, when his bus crashed into a ditch; Manson and members of his family, including Brunner and Manson&#x27;s new-born baby, were found sleeping naked by police. Afterwards, he was again arrested and released only a few days later, this time on a drug charge.

=== Involvement with the Beach Boys ===

On April 6, 1968, Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys was driving through Malibu when he noticed two female hitchhikers, Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey. He picked them up and dropped them off at their destination. On April 11, Wilson noticed the same two girls hitchhiking again and this time took them to his home at 14400 Sunset Boulevard. Wilson later recalled that he &quot;told [the girls] about our involvement with the Maharishi and they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie [Manson] who&#x27;d recently come out of jail after twelve years.&quot; Wilson then went to a recording session; when he returned later that night, he was met in his driveway by Manson, and when Wilson walked into his home, about a dozen people were occupying the premises, most of them young women. By Manson&#x27;s own account, he had met Wilson on at least one prior occasion: at a friend&#x27;s San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana. Manson claimed that Wilson invited him to visit his home when Manson came to Los Angeles.

Wilson was initially fascinated by Manson and his followers, referring to him as &quot;the Wizard&quot; in a &quot;Rave&quot; magazine article at the time. The two struck a friendship, and over the next few months members of the Manson Family – mostly women who were treated as servants – were housed in Wilson&#x27;s residence. This arrangement persisted for about six months.

Wilson introduced Manson to a few friends in the music business, including the Byrds&#x27; producer Terry Melcher. Manson recorded numerous songs at Brian Wilson&#x27;s home studio, although the recordings remain unheard by the public. Band engineer Stephen Desper said that the Manson sessions were done &quot;for Dennis [Wilson] and Terry Melcher&quot;. In September 1968, Wilson recorded a Manson song for the Beach Boys, originally titled &quot;Cease to Exist&quot; but reworked as &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;, as a single B-side released the following December. The writing was credited solely to Wilson. When asked why Manson was not credited, Wilson explained that Manson relinquished his publishing rights in favor of &quot;about a hundred thousand dollars&#x27; worth of stuff&quot;. Around this time, the Family destroyed two of Wilson&#x27;s luxury cars.

Wilson eventually distanced himself from Manson and moved out of the Sunset Boulevard house, leaving the Family there, and subsequently took residence at a basement apartment in Santa Monica. Virtually all of Wilson&#x27;s household possessions were stolen by the Family; the members were evicted from his home three weeks before the lease was scheduled to expire. When Manson subsequently sought further contact, he left a bullet with Wilson&#x27;s housekeeper to be delivered with a threatening message.

Band manager Nick Grillo recalled that Wilson became concerned after Manson had got &quot;into a much heavier drug situation ... taking a tremendous amount of acid and Dennis wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it and asked him to leave. It was difficult for Dennis because he was afraid of Charlie.&quot; Writing in his 2016 memoir, Mike Love recalled Wilson saying he had witnessed Manson shooting a black man &quot;in half&quot; with an M16 rifle and hiding the body inside a well. Melcher said that Wilson had been aware that the Family &quot;were killing people&quot; and had been &quot;so freaked out he just didn&#x27;t want to live anymore. He was afraid, and he thought he should have gone to the authorities, but he didn&#x27;t, and the rest of it happened.&quot;

=== Spahn Ranch ===
Manson established a base for the Family at the Spahn Ranch in August 1968, after their eviction from Wilson&#x27;s residence. The ranch had been a television and movie set for Westerns, but the buildings had deteriorated by the late-1960s. The ranch then derived revenue primarily from selling horseback rides. Female Family members did chores around the ranch and, occasionally, had sex on Manson&#x27;s orders with the nearly blind 80-year-old owner, George Spahn; the women also acted as guides for him. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.

=== Doomsday beliefs ===

The Manson Family evolved into a doomsday cult when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America&#x27;s Black minority and the larger White population. A white supremacist, Manson told some of the Family that Black people would rise up and kill the entire White population except for Manson and his followers, but that they were not intelligent enough to survive on their own; they would need a white man to lead them, and so they would serve Manson as their &quot;master&quot;. In late-1968, Manson adopted the term &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, taken from a song on the Beatles&#x27; recently released &quot;White Album&quot;, to refer to this upcoming war.

=== Tate encounter ===
On March 23, 1969, Manson entered the grounds of 10050 Cielo Drive, which he had known as Melcher&#x27;s residence. He was not invited. As he approached the main house, Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer who had befriended film director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate during the making of the documentary &quot;Mia and Roman&quot;. Hatami was there to photograph Tate before she departed for Rome the following day. Seeing Manson approach, Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted. Manson said that he was looking for Melcher, whose name Hatami did not recognize. Hatami told him the place was the Polanski residence and then advised him to try the path to the guest house beyond the main house. Tate appeared behind Hatami in the house&#x27;s front door and asked him who was calling. Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson went back to the guest house without a word, returned to the front a minute or two later and left.

That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went to the guest house. He entered the enclosed porch and spoke with Altobelli, the owner, who had just come out of the shower. Manson asked for Melcher, but Altobelli felt that Manson was instead looking for him. It was later discovered that Manson had apparently been to the property on earlier occasions after Melcher left. Altobelli told Manson through the screen door that Melcher had moved to Malibu and said that he did not know his new address, although he did.

Altobelli told Manson he was leaving the country the next day, and Manson said he would like to speak with him upon his return. Altobelli said that he would be gone for more than a year. Manson said that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli asked Manson not to disturb his tenants. Altobelli and Tate flew together to Rome the next day. Tate asked him whether &quot;that creepy-looking guy&quot; had gone to see him at the guest house the day before.

==1969–1971: Crimes and trial==

=== Crowe shooting ===
Tex Watson became involved in drug dealing and robbed a 22-year-old rival named Bernard &quot;Lotsapoppa&quot; Crowe. Crowe allegedly responded with a threat to kill everyone at Spahn Ranch. In response, Manson shot Crowe on July 1, 1969, at Manson&#x27;s Hollywood apartment. Manson&#x27;s belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles.

Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, establishing night patrols by armed guards. Watson would later write, &quot;Blackie was trying to get at the chosen ones.&quot; Manson brought in members of the Straight Satans Motorcycle Club to act as security.
=== Hinman murder ===
34-year-old Gary Alan Hinman, a music teacher and graduate student at UCLA, had previously befriended members of the Family and allowed some to occasionally stay at his home in Topanga Canyon. According to Atkins, Manson believed Hinman was wealthy and sent her, Brunner, and Beausoleil to Hinman&#x27;s home to convince him to join the Family and turn over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited. The three held Hinman hostage for two days in late July 1969, as he denied having any money. During this time, Manson arrived with a sword and slashed his face and ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, allegedly on Manson&#x27;s instruction. Before leaving the residence, Beausoleil or one of the women used Hinman&#x27;s blood to write &quot;political piggy&quot; on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.

According to Beausoleil, he came to Hinman&#x27;s house to recover money paid to Hinman for mescaline provided to the Straight Satans that had supposedly been bad. Beausoleil added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along to visit Hinman. Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directed Beausoleil, Brunner and her to go to Hinman&#x27;s and get the supposed inheritance of $21,000. She said that two days earlier Manson had told her privately that, if she wanted to &quot;do something important&quot;, she could kill Hinman and get his money. Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he was caught driving Hinman&#x27;s car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well.
===Tate murders===
On the night of August 8, 1969, Watson took Atkins, Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian to 10050 Cielo Drive. Watson later claimed that Manson had instructed him to go to the house and &quot;totally destroy&quot; everyone in it, and to do it &quot;as gruesome as you can&quot;. Manson told the women to do as Watson instructed them.

The occupants of the Cielo Drive house that evening were Tate, aged 26, who was 8 months pregnant; her friend and former lover 35-year-old Jay Sebring, a noted celebrity hairstylist; Polanski&#x27;s friend 32-year-old Wojciech Frykowski; and Frykowski&#x27;s 25-year-old girlfriend Abigail Anne Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune and daughter of Peter Folger. Also present on the property were 19-year-old caretaker William Garretson and his friend, 18-year-old Steven Earl Parent. Polanski was in Europe working on a film. Music producer Quincy Jones was a friend of Sebring who had planned to join him that evening before changing his mind.

Watson and the three women arrived at Cielo Drive just past midnight on August 9. Watson climbed a telephone pole near the entrance gate and cut the phone line to the house. The group then backed their car to the bottom of the hill that led to the estate before walking back up to the house. Thinking that the gate might be electrified or equipped with an alarm, they climbed a brushy embankment to the right of the gate and entered the grounds. 

Headlights approached the group from within the property, and Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes. He stepped out and ordered the approaching driver, Parent, to halt. Watson leveled a .22 caliber revolver at Parent, who begged him not to hurt him, claiming that he would not say anything. Watson lunged at Parent with a knife, giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand that severed tendons and tore the boy&#x27;s watch off his wrist, then shot him four times in the chest and abdomen, killing him in the front seat of his white 1965 AMC Ambassador coupe. Watson ordered the women to help push the car up the driveway.

Watson next cut the screen of a window, then told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; she walked over to Parent&#x27;s car and waited. Watson removed the screen, entered through the window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door. He whispered to Atkins and awoke Frykowski, who was sleeping on the living room couch. Watson kicked him in the head, and Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there. Watson replied, &quot;I&#x27;m the devil, and I&#x27;m here to do the devil&#x27;s business.&quot;

On Watson&#x27;s direction, Atkins found the house&#x27;s three other occupants with Krenwinkel&#x27;s help and forced them to the living room. Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with a long nylon rope which he had brought, then slung it over one of the living room&#x27;s ceiling beams. Sebring protested the rough treatment of the pregnant Tate, so Watson shot him. Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, and she gave the murderers $70. Watson then stabbed Sebring seven times. Frykowski&#x27;s hands had been bound with a towel, but he freed himself and began struggling with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs with a knife. He fought his way out the front door and onto the porch, but Watson caught up with him, struck him over the head with the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly and shot him twice.

Kasabian had heard &quot;horrifying sounds&quot; and moved toward the house from her position in the driveway. She told Atkins that someone was coming in an attempt to stop the murders. Inside the house, Folger escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area. Krenwinkel pursued her and caught her on the front lawn, where she stabbed her and tackled her to the ground. Watson then helped kill her; her assailants stabbed her a total of twenty-eight times. Frykowski struggled across the lawn, but Watson continued to stab him, killing him. Frykowski suffered fifty-one stab wounds; he had also been struck thirteen times in the head with the butt of Watson&#x27;s gun, which bent the barrel and broke off one side of the gun grip, which was recovered at the scene.

In the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to give birth and offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child. Instead both Atkins and Watson stabbed Tate sixteen times, killing her. The coroner&#x27;s inquest found that Tate was still alive when she was hanged with the nylon rope, although the cause of her death was determined as a &quot;massive hemorrhage&quot;, while in Sebring&#x27;s murder it was found that he was hanged lifeless.

According to Watson, Manson had told the women to &quot;leave a sign—something witchy&quot;. Atkins wrote &quot;pig&quot; on the front door in Tate&#x27;s blood. Atkins claims she did this to copycat the Hinman murder scene in order to get Beausoleil out of jail, who was in custody for that murder.

=== LaBianca murders ===
The four murderers plus Manson, Leslie Van Houten and Clem Grogan went for a drive the following night. Manson was allegedly displeased with the previous night&#x27;s murders, so he told Kasabian to drive to a house at 3301 Waverly Drive in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. Located next door to a home where Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year, it belonged to 44-year-old supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his 43-year-old wife, Rosemary LaBianca, co-owner of a dress shop.

According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say that he had tied up the house&#x27;s occupants. Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the property. Watson claims in his autobiography that Manson went up alone, then returned to take him up to the house with him. Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, and the two entered through the unlocked back door. Watson claims Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. Rosemary was brought into the living room from the bedroom, and Watson covered the couple&#x27;s heads with pillowcases which he bound in place with lamp cords. Manson left, and Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the house.

Watson had complained to Manson earlier of the inadequacy of the previous night&#x27;s weapons. Watson sent the women from the kitchen to the bedroom, where Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, while he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated bayonet. The first thrust went into his throat. Watson heard a scuffle in the bedroom and went in there to discover Rosemary LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. He stabbed her several times with the bayonet, then returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of twelve times. He then carved the word &quot;WAR&quot; into his abdomen.

Watson returned to the bedroom and found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary with a knife from the kitchen. Van Houten stabbed her approximately sixteen times in the back and the exposed buttocks. Van Houten claimed at trial that Rosemary LaBianca was already dead during the stabbing. Evidence showed that many of the forty-one stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem. Watson then cleaned off the bayonet and showered, while Krenwinkel wrote &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Death to pigs&quot; on the walls and &quot;Healter [sic] Skelter&quot; on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca&#x27;s blood. She gave Leno LaBianca fourteen puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat.

Meanwhile, Manson drove the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening to the Venice home of the Lebanese actor Saladin Nader. Manson left them there and drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home. According to Kasabian, Manson wanted his followers to murder Nader in his apartment, but Kasabian claims she thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. The group abandoned the murder plan and left, but Atkins defecated in the stairwell on the way out.

=== Shea murder ===
35-year-old Hollywood stuntman Donald Jerome &quot;Shorty&quot; Shea was murdered on August 26, 1969, more than two weeks after the Tate–LaBianca murders, when Manson told Shea, Bruce Davis, Tex Watson, and Steve Grogan to go on a ride to a nearby car parts yard on the Spahn Ranch. According to Davis, he sat in the back seat with Grogan, who then hit Shea with a pipe wrench and Watson stabbed him. They brought Shea down a hill behind the ranch and stabbed and brutally tortured him to death. Bruce Davis recalled at his parole hearings:

In December 1977, Shea&#x27;s skeletal remains were discovered on a nondescript hillside near Santa Susana Road next to Spahn Ranch after Grogan, one of those convicted of the murder, agreed to aid authorities in the recovery of Shea&#x27;s body by drawing a map to its location. According to the autopsy report, his body suffered multiple stab and chopping wounds to the chest, and blunt force trauma to the head.

=== Suspected murders ===

In total, Manson and his followers were convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder. However, the LAPD believes that the Family could have claimed up to at least twelve more victims. Cliff Shepard, a former LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division detective, said that Manson &quot;repeatedly&quot; claimed to have killed many others. Prosecutor Stephen Kay supported this assertion: &quot;I know that Manson one time told one of his cellmates that he was responsible for 35 murders.&quot; Tate&#x27;s younger sister, Debra Tate, has also claimed that investigators are &quot;just scraping the surface&quot; when it comes to the number of Manson&#x27;s victims and has further elaborated on how Manson sent her a taunting map of the Panamint Range, with crosses on it that she believed were meant to represent buried bodies. This has resulted in several excavations that have been undertaken at Manson&#x27;s Barker Ranch, but they have not resulted in any bodies being found. 
* Nancy Warren, 64, and Clyda Dulaney, 24, were both found near Ukiah, California at the antique store owned by Warren on October 13, 1968. They had both been beaten and strangled to death with thirty-six leather thongs. After the Family members were arrested, they became suspects when it was discovered that members of the Family had been in the Ukiah area at the time of the murders. However, no one in the Family was ever charged with the murders and no arrests were ever made in the case.
* Marina Elizabeth Habe, 17, was murdered on December 30, 1968. She was a student at the University of Hawaii home on vacation when she was murdered in Los Angeles. According to the autopsy report, Habe&#x27;s throat had been slashed and she had received numerous knife wounds to the chest. She suffered multiple contusions to the face and throat, and had been garrotted. There was no evidence of rape. Habe was abducted outside the home of her mother in West Hollywood, 8962 Cynthia Avenue. A former Manson Family associate claimed members of the Family had known Habe and it was conjectured she had been one of their victims.
* Darwin Morell Scott, 64, was the uncle of Manson and the brother of Manson&#x27;s father, Colonel Scott. On May 27, 1969, Scott was found brutally stabbed to death in his Ashland, Kentucky apartment. His body was pinned to the kitchen floor with a butcher knife, and he had been stabbed nineteen times. After Manson&#x27;s arrest, it was reported that local residents claimed to have seen a man resembling Manson using the alias, &quot;Preacher&quot;, in the area at the time Darwin was murdered. Manson was on parole in California at the time of the murder, but the murder occurred when Manson was out of touch with his parole officers.
* Mark Walts, 16, was an acquaintance of the Family members and was even known to associate with them at the Spahn Ranch. On July 17, 1969, Walts hitchhiked to the Santa Monica Pier so he could go fishing. His fishing pole was found abandoned at the pier, and his body was found the next day near Mulholland Drive. He had been shot three times in the chest. Though the Family was reportedly &quot;shocked&quot; by Walts&#x27; murder, his brother was convinced that Manson was responsible for his death and even called him in order to directly accuse him of his murder. The Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department investigated Spahn Ranch in regard to Walts&#x27; murder, but no links were found, and the murder was never solved.
* John Philip Haught, 22, was an Ohio native who had moved to California and met Manson in the summer of 1969. He joined the Manson Family and was amongst the group who was arrested in the October raid of the clan for the Tate-LaBianca murders; Manson suspected him of being an informant. On November 5, 1969, Haught was associating with some members of the Family. According to all present, Haught suddenly found a gun in the room, picked it up, and promptly shot himself while attempting a game of Russian roulette. However, when police investigated the death, they found that the gun, rather than having zero bullets and one spent shell casing, instead contained seven bullets and one spent shell. Moreover, the gun had been wiped free of prints. Additionally, a male witness who had held Haught&#x27;s head after the shooting told Cohen he had entered the room to find a female Manson follower with the gun in her hand. Despite this, police concluded Haught had killed himself.
* James Sharp, 15, and Doreen Gaul, 19, were both found stabbed to death in an alley in Los Angeles on November 7, 1969. The murder of the two young Scientologists involved both being stabbed between fifty and sixty times. Police immediately noted the similarities to these murders and those of the Tate-LaBianca murders; the killings of Sharp and Gaul happened close to where the Labianca&#x27;s lived. In &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, author Vincent Bugliosi wrote that Gaul was rumoured to be a former girlfriend of Manson Family member Bruce Davis—Davis had lived at the same housing complex as Gaul, but in a police interview he denied knowing her.
* Reet Jurvetson, 19, was a young woman found stabbed to death on November 16, 1969. Her body was found with over one hundred and fifty stab wounds from a penknife to her neck and upper body, along with defensive wounds on her hands and arms. She had been disposed of along Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, California. Some witnesses claimed to have seen a woman named &quot;Sherry&quot; who matched Jurvetson&#x27;s description among members of the Manson Family, but it turned out that this individual was alive. Manson himself denied any involvement in killing Jurvetson. Detectives within the Los Angeles Police Department have noted &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the method of murder of both Jurvetson and Habe, but no firm connection between both murders has ever been established.
* Joel Pugh, 29, was found dead in the Talgarth Hotel in London, England, on December 1, 1969. His wrists had been cut and his throat was slit twice. British authorities listed the death a drug-induced suicide, saying Pugh had been depressed. Pugh was a Family member who was married to another member of the Family, Sandra Good. Stephen Kay and others claim Manson hated Pugh. &quot;He had no reason to commit suicide, and Manson was very unhappy that Sandy was with Pugh&quot;, Kay has said. Pugh&#x27;s death occurred when a number of Manson Family members were being arrested for the Tate-LaBianca murders. Manson follower Bruce Davis was in London at the time Pugh died.
* Ronald Hughes, 35, was an American attorney who represented Leslie Van Houten, a member of the Manson Family. Hughes disappeared while on a camping trip during a ten-day recess from the Tate-LaBianca murder trial in November 1970. The badly decomposed body of Hughes was found in March 1971 wedged between two boulders in Ventura County. It was rumoured, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes, though he might have perished in flooding. Attorney Stephen Kay has stated that while he is &quot;on the fence&quot; about the Family&#x27;s involvement in Hughes&#x27; death, Manson had open contempt for Hughes during the trial. Kay added, &quot;The last thing Manson said to him [Hughes] was, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to see you in the courtroom again,&#x27; and he was never seen again alive.&quot; Family member Sandra Good stated that Hughes was &quot;the first of the retaliation murders&quot;.
* On November 8, 1972, the body of 26-year-old Vietnam Marine combat veteran James Lambert Willett was found by a hiker near Guerneville, California. Months earlier, he had been forced to dig his own grave, and then was shot and poorly buried. His station wagon was found outside a house in Stockton where several Manson followers were living, including Priscilla Cooper, Lynette Fromme, and Nancy Pitman. Police forced their way into the house and arrested several of the people there. The body of Willett&#x27;s 19-year-old wife Lauren Chavelle Willett was found buried in the basement. She had been killed very recently by a gunshot to the head, in what the Family members initially claimed was an accident. It was later suggested that she was killed out of fear that she would reveal who killed her husband. Michael Monfort pleaded guilty to murdering Lauren and Priscilla Cooper, James Craig, and Nancy Pitman pleaded guilty as accessories after the fact. Monfort and William Goucher later pleaded guilty to the murder of James, and James Craig pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact. The group had been living in the house with the Willetts while committing various robberies. Shortly after killing Willett, Monfort had used Willett&#x27;s identification papers to pose as Willett after being arrested for an armed robbery of a liquor store. Willett was not involved in the robberies and wanted to move away but was presumably killed out of fear that he would talk to police.
* Laurence Merrick, 50, was an American film director and author. He is best known for co-directing the Oscar nominated documentary Manson in 1973. Sharon Tate was a former student at Merrick&#x27;s Academy of Dramatic Arts. Merrick was killed by a gunman on January 26, 1977. He was shot in the back in the carpark of his acting school. Merrick&#x27;s murder went unsolved until October 1981 when 35-year-old Dennis Mignano confessed to police. At his subsequent trial, Mignano was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a mental hospital. Mignano was an unemployed would-be actor and singer with a long history of psychiatric problems and a possible prior relationship with the Manson clan.
* Six months after the murder of Merrick, Mignano&#x27;s sister Michele Mignano, 21, a topless dancer, was also murdered. Her body was found on June 13, 1977, 350 ft into a Western Pacific railroad tunnel in Niles Canyon. Authorities referred to her death as an &quot;execution-style slaying&quot; with her dying from exsanguination due to multiple gunshot wounds. A number of bullet cartridges were found near her body. She was shoeless yet fully clothed with jewellery so sexual assault and robbery were both ruled out as motives. Her murder has never been solved.

=== Investigation ===
The Tate murders became national news on August 9, 1969, after the Polanskis&#x27; housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, arrived for work that morning. On August 10, detectives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed Los Angeles Police Department detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. According to Vincent Bugliosi, because detectives believed the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team initially ignored this and other evidence of similarities between the crimes.

During the Tate autopsies, detectives working on the Hinman case noticed similarities in the weapons used, the stab wounds, and the writing in blood on the walls. They brought the information to detectives working on the Tate murders. According to Detective Charlie Guenther, &quot;Vince [Bugliosi] didn&#x27;t want anything to do with the Hinman case. Hinman was a nothing case. Vince didn&#x27;t want to prosecute it.&quot;

Held briefly as a Tate suspect, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a polygraph examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes. The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at 10:30 p.m. on August 10, approximately nineteen hours after the murders were committed, when 15-year-old Frank Struthers, Rosemary&#x27;s son from a prior marriage and Leno&#x27;s stepson, returned from a camping trip.

On August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides. On August 16, the sheriff&#x27;s office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and twenty-five others, as &quot;suspects in a major auto theft ring&quot; that had been stealing Volkswagen Beetles and converting them into dune buggies. Weapons were seized, but, because the search warrant had been misdated, the group was released a few days later. In a report at the end of August, the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and &quot;the singing group the Beatles&#x27; most recent album.&quot;

Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff&#x27;s office in mid-October about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case and also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil&#x27;s girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of the Manson Family.

The arrests, for car thefts, had taken place at the desert ranches to which the Family had moved. A joint force of National Park Service Rangers and officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Inyo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office: federal, state, and county personnel, had raided both the Myers and Barker ranches after following evidence left when Family members had burned an earthmover owned by Death Valley National Monument. The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles, and arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker&#x27;s bathroom sink.

Following up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger, LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to recruit as bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch. Meanwhile, a dormitory mate of Susan Atkins informed LAPD of the Family&#x27;s involvement in the crimes. Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told sheriff&#x27;s detectives that she had been involved in it. Transferred to Sybil Brand Institute, a detention center in Monterey Park, California, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.

=== Apprehension ===
On December 1, 1969, the LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects&#x27; involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized. Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest, with authorities in McKinney, Texas, and Mobile, Alabama, having picked them up on notice from LAPD. Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Concord, New Hampshire on December 2.

Physical evidence such as Krenwinkel&#x27;s and Watson&#x27;s fingerprints, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive, was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard &quot;Buntline Special&quot; revolver Watson used on Parent, Sebring, and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence. In mid-December, when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney, Weiss&#x27;s father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.

Acting on that same newspaper account, a local ABC television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers. The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and by LAPD. A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.
The trial began on June 15, 1970. The prosecution&#x27;s main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Since Kasabian, by all accounts, had not participated in the killings, she was granted immunity in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes. Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn. Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.

Originally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to act as his own attorney. Because of Manson&#x27;s conduct, including violations of a gag order and submission of &quot;outlandish&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot; pretrial motions, the permission was withdrawn before the trial&#x27;s start. Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge Charles Older. On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was &quot;considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self&quot;—and had &quot;X&#x27;d [him]self from [the establishment&#x27;s] world.&quot; Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.

The prosecution argued the triggering of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was Manson&#x27;s main motive. The crime scene&#x27;s bloody White Album reference, &quot;helter skelter&quot;, written by Susan Atkins, and the writing of &quot;pigs&quot; was correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders Black people would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of &quot;pigs&quot; on walls in victims&#x27; blood. The defendants testified that the writing in blood on the walls was to copy that of the Hinman murder scene, not an apocalyptic race war. According to Bugliosi, Manson directed Kasabian to hide a wallet taken from the scene in the women&#x27;s restroom of a service station near a Black neighborhood. However, as co-prosecutor Stephen Kay later pointed out the wallet was left about twenty miles away in a predominantly White neighborhood, Sylmar.

=== Ongoing disruptions ===
During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom proper, the prosecution subpoenaed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying. When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, some members wore sheathed hunting knives that, although in plain view, were carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on their forehead.

Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses Paul Watkins and Juan Flynn were both threatened; Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van. Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard Susan Atkins describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of LSD. Found sprawled on a Honolulu curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.

On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; front page whose headline was &quot;Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares&quot;. This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media&#x27;s glamorization of Manson. Voir dired by Judge Charles Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon&#x27;s remark, there was no point in going on with the trial.

On October 5, Manson was denied the court&#x27;s permission to question a prosecution witness whom defense attorneys had declined to cross-examine. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin. Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.

=== Defense rests ===
On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.

In chambers, the women&#x27;s lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved. By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten&#x27;s attorney, Ronald Hughes, vehemently stated that he would not &quot;push a client out the window&quot;. In the prosecutor&#x27;s view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself. Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, &quot;The entire proceedings were scripted—by Charlie.&quot;

The next day, Manson testified. The jury was removed from the courtroom. According to Vincent Bugliosi it was to make sure Manson&#x27;s address did not violate the California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;People v. Aranda&quot; by making statements implicating his co-defendants. However, Bugliosi argued Manson would use his hypnotic powers to unfairly influence the jury. Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that &quot;the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment.&quot; He said, &quot;Why blame it on me? I didn&#x27;t write the music.&quot; &quot;To be honest with you,&quot; Manson also stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t recall ever saying &#x27;Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.

As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip. When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes&#x27; absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts. No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution&#x27;s closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the guilt phase. This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.

=== Conviction and penalty phase ===
On January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the twenty-seven separate counts against them. Not far into the trial&#x27;s penalty phase, the jurors saw the defense that Manson—in the prosecution&#x27;s view—had planned to present. Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as &quot;copycat&quot; versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil—Linda Kasabian. Among the narrative&#x27;s weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written &quot;political piggy&quot; at the Hinman house in the first place.

Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, &quot;I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.&quot; In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state&#x27;s request for the death penalty. The effort to exonerate Manson via the &quot;copycat&quot; scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts. On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.

== 1971–2017: Third imprisonment ==
=== 1970s–1980s ===

Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. In 1972, the California Supreme Court ruled that the state&#x27;s death penalty statutes was unconstitutional, Manson was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His initial death sentence was modified to life on February 2, 1977.

On December 13, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969, death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Shea. Following the 1972 decision of &quot;California v. Anderson&quot;, California&#x27;s death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that &quot;any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death.&quot; Manson was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years&#x27; incarceration. His first parole hearing took place on November 16, 1978, at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, where his petition was rejected.

====Gerald Ford assassination attempt====

On September 5, 1975, the Family returned to national attention when Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. The attempt took place in Sacramento, to which she and fellow Manson follower Sandra Good had moved so that they could be near Manson while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and another Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good&#x27;s conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail service and for transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. The threats involved corporate executives and U.S. government officials vis-à-vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part.

Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under United States Code Title 18, chapter 84 (1965), which made it a federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States. In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia. She was trying to reach Manson because she heard that he had testicular cancer; she was apprehended within days. She was released on parole from Federal Medical Center, Carswell on August 14, 2009.

=== 1980s–1990s ===

In the 1980s, Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media. The first, recorded at California Medical Facility and aired on June 13, 1981, was by Tom Snyder for NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot;. The second, recorded at San Quentin State Prison and aired on March 7, 1986, was by Charlie Rose for &quot;CBS News Nightwatch&quot;, and it won the national news Emmy Award for Best Interview in 1987. The third, with Geraldo Rivera in 1988, was part of the journalist&#x27;s prime-time special on Satanism. At least as early as the Snyder interview, Manson&#x27;s forehead bore a swastika in the spot where the X carved during his trial had been. Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary &quot;Charles Manson Superstar&quot;. Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration.

On September 25, 1984, Manson was imprisoned in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured paint thinner on him and set him on fire, causing second and third degree burns on over 20 percent of his body. Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and verbally threatened him. After 1989, Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County. The unit housed inmates whose safety would be endangered by general-population housing. He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison, California Medical Facility in Vacaville, Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison.
In June 1997, a prison disciplinary committee found that Manson had been trafficking drugs. He was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison a month later.

=== 2000s–2017 ===
On September 5, 2007, MSNBC aired &quot;The Mind of Manson&quot;, a complete version of a 1987 interview at California&#x27;s San Quentin State Prison. The footage of the &quot;unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly&quot; Manson had been considered &quot;so unbelievable&quot; that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on &quot;Today&quot;, for which it had been recorded.

In 2009, Los Angeles disc jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson&#x27;s biological son. Roberts&#x27; biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by Manson; she returned to her parents&#x27; home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and put Roberts up for adoption. CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson&#x27;s known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012, showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA. Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related.

In 2010, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes. Manson also recorded an album of acoustic pop songs with additional production by Henry Rollins, titled &quot;Completion&quot;. Only five copies were pressed: two belong to Rollins, while the other three are presumed to have been with Manson. The album remains unreleased.

In 2013, Manson stated that he was bisexual, saying &quot;Sex to me is like going to the toilet. Whether it&#x27;s a girl or not. It doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t play that girl-guy shit. I&#x27;m not hung up in that game.&quot; In 2014, the imprisoned Manson became engaged to 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton and obtained a marriage license on November 7. Manson gave Burton the nickname &quot;Star&quot;. She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence. The wedding license expired on February 5, 2015, without a marriage ceremony taking place. Journalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was canceled after Manson discovered that Burton wanted to marry him only so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death. According to Simone, Manson believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts. Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical. Manson had an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors. She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place.

== Psychology ==
On April 11, 2012, Manson was denied release at his twelfth parole hearing, which he did not attend. After his March 27, 1997, parole hearing, Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings. The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a &quot;history of controlling behavior&quot; and &quot;mental health issues&quot; including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder, and was too great a danger to be released. The panel also noted that Manson had received 108 rules violation reports, had no indication of remorse, no insight into the causative factors of the crimes, lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes, had an exceptional, callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans. At the April 11, 2012, parole hearing, it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another fifteen years, not before 2027, at which time he would have been 92. According to a recent re-analysis of Manson&#x27;s psychological state, researchers suggest that he may have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Instead, they propose that Manson had bipolar disorder and psychopathy.

== Illness and death ==
On January 1, 2017, Manson was being held at Corcoran Prison, when he was rushed to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield, because he had gastrointestinal bleeding. A source told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Manson was very ill, and TMZ reported that his doctors considered him &quot;too weak&quot; for surgery that normally would be performed in cases such as his. He was returned to prison on January 6, and the nature of his treatment was not disclosed. On November 15, 2017, an unauthorized source said that Manson had returned to a hospital in Bakersfield, but the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not confirm this in conformity with state and federal medical privacy laws. He died from cardiac arrest resulting from respiratory failure, brought on by colon cancer, at the hospital on November 19.

Three people stated their intention to claim Manson&#x27;s estate and body. Manson&#x27;s grandson Jason Freeman stated his intent to take possession of Manson&#x27;s remains and personal effects. Manson&#x27;s pen-pal Michael Channels claimed to have a Manson will dated February 14, 2002, which left Manson&#x27;s entire estate and Manson&#x27;s body to Channels. Manson&#x27;s friend Ben Gurecki claimed to have a Manson will dated January 2017 which gives the estate and Manson&#x27;s body to Matthew Roberts, another alleged son of Manson. In 2012, CNN ran a DNA match to see if Freeman and Roberts were related to each other and found that they were not. According to CNN, two prior attempts to DNA-match Roberts with genetic material from Manson failed, but the results were reportedly contaminated. On March 12, 2018, the Kern County Superior Court in California decided in favor of Freeman in regard to Manson&#x27;s body. A funeral service was held for Manson on March 17, 2018, after which Freeman had his remains cremated and scattered on a California hillside.

== Legacy ==
=== Cultural impact ===
In June 1970, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; made Manson their cover story. Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground reportedly said of the Tate murders: &quot;Dig it, first they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into the pig Tate&#x27;s stomach! Wild!&quot; Manson fanatic James Mason claimed to be acting on a suggestion from Charles Manson based on his interpretation of something Manson said in a televised interview, when Mason founded the Universal Order, a neo-Nazi group that has influenced other movements such as the terrorist group the Atomwaffen Division. Bugliosi quoted a BBC employee&#x27;s assertion that a &quot;neo-Manson cult&quot; existed in Europe, represented by approximately 70 rock bands playing songs by Manson and &quot;songs in support of him&quot;.

=== Music ===
Manson was a struggling pop musician, seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969. The Beach Boys recorded one of his songs. Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started. On March 6, 1970, &quot;&quot;, an album of Manson music, was released. This included &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;, a Manson song the Beach Boys had recorded with modified lyrics and the title &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;. Over the next couple of months only about 300 of the album&#x27;s 2,000 copies sold.

There have been several other releases of Manson recordings – both musical and spoken. One of these, &quot;The Family Jams&quot;, includes two compact discs of Manson&#x27;s songs recorded by the Family in 1970, after Manson and the others had been arrested. Guitar and lead vocals are supplied by Steve Grogan; additional vocals are supplied by Lynette Fromme, Sandra Good, Catherine Share, and others. &quot;One Mind&quot;, an album of music, poetry, and spoken word, new at the time of its release, in April 2005, was put out under a Creative Commons license.

American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses recorded Manson&#x27;s &quot;Look at Your Game, Girl&quot;, included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; &quot;My Monkey&quot;, which appears on &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; by the American rock band Marilyn Manson, includes the lyrics &quot;I had a little monkey / I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread / Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo / And now my monkey&#x27;s dead.&quot; These lyrics are from Manson&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Man&quot;, which is heard on &quot;&quot;. Crispin Glover covered &quot;Never Say &#x27;Never&#x27; to Always&quot; on his album &quot;The Big Problem ≠ The Solution. The Solution=Let It Be&quot; released in 1989.

Musical performers such as Kasabian, Spahn Ranch, and Marilyn Manson derived their names from Manson and his lore.
