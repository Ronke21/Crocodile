<text>The governor general of Canada () is the federal representative of the . The king or queen of Canada is also monarch and head of state of 14 other Commonwealth realms and resides in the United Kingdom. The monarch, on the advice of his or her Canadian prime minister, appoints a governor general to administer the government of Canada in the monarch&#x27;s name. The commission is for an indefinite period—known as serving &quot;at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;—though, five years is the usual length of term. Since 1959, it has also been traditional to alternate between francophone and anglophone officeholders. The 30th and current governor general is Mary Simon, who was sworn in on 26 July 2021. An Inuk leader from Nunavik in Quebec, Simon is the first aboriginal person to hold the office.

As the sovereign&#x27;s representative, the governor general carries out the day-to-day constitutional and ceremonial duties of the monarch. The constitutional duties include appointing lieutenant governors, Supreme Court justices, and senators; signing orders-in-council; summoning, proroguing, and dissolving the federal parliament; granting royal assent to bills; calling elections; and signing commissions for officers of the Canadian Armed Forces. The ceremonial duties include delivering the speech from the throne at the state opening of parliament; accepting letters of credence from incoming ambassadors; and distributing honours, decorations, and medals. Per the tenets of responsible government, the governor general acts almost always (except on the matter of honours) on the advice of the prime minister.

The office began in the 17th century, when the French Crown appointed governors of the colony of Canada and, following the British conquest of the colony in 1763, the British monarch appointed governors of the Province of Quebec (later the Canadas). Consequently, the office is, along with the Crown, the oldest continuous institution in Canada. The present version of the office emerged with Canadian Confederation and the passing of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;.

Although the post initially still represented the government of the United Kingdom (that is, the monarch in his British council), the office was gradually Canadianized until, with the passage of the &quot;Statute of Westminster, 1931&quot;, and the establishment of a separate and uniquely Canadian monarchy, the governor general became the direct personal representative of the independently Canadian sovereign (the monarch in his Canadian council). Throughout this process of gradually increasing Canadian independence, the role of governor general took on additional responsibilities, such as acting as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian militia in the monarch&#x27;s stead, and, in 1927, the first official international visit by a governor general was made. In 1947, King George VI issued letters patent allowing the viceroy to exercise almost all powers on behalf of the monarch. As a matter of law, however, the governor general is not in the same constitutional position as the sovereign; the office itself does not independently possess any powers of the royal prerogative. Any constitutional amendment that affects the Crown, including the office of governor general, requires the unanimous consent of each provincial legislative assembly as well as the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.

==Appointment==
The position of governor general is mandated by both the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;), and the letters patent issued in 1947 by King George VI. As such, on the recommendation of the Canadian prime minister, the Canadian monarch appoints the governor general by commission, prepared in Canada, and issued under the Great Seal of Canada and with the royal sign-manual. (Until the appointment of Vincent Massey in 1952, the royal commission was authorized by the monarch&#x27;s signature and signet.) That individual is, from then until being sworn in, referred to as the &quot;governor general-designate&quot;.

Besides the administration of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a governor general-designate. Though there may therefore be variations to the following, the appointee will usually travel to Ottawa, there receiving an official welcome and taking up residence at 7 Rideau Gate, and will begin preparations for their upcoming role, meeting with various high-level officials to ensure a smooth transition between governors general. The sovereign will also hold an audience with the appointee and will at that time induct both the governor general-designate and their spouse into the Order of Canada as Companions, as well as appointing the former as a Commander of both the Order of Military Merit and the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (should either person not have already received either of those honours).

The incumbent will generally serve for at least five years; though, this is only a developed convention and has been criticized as too short for an office meant to represent a Crown and sovereign meant to embody continuity. The governor general serves &quot;at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot; (or the &quot;royal pleasure&quot;), meaning the prime minister may recommend to the King that the viceroy remain in his service for a longer period of time; some governors general have been in office for more than seven years. No additional formalities are necessary for such an &quot;extension&quot;; the governor general carries on until death, resignation, or the appointment of his or her successor. Only once, with the Earl Alexander of Tunis, has a royal proclamation been issued to end a governor general&#x27;s incumbency.

Should a governor general die, resign, or leave the country for longer than one month, the chief justice of Canada (or, if that position is vacant or unavailable, the senior puisne justice of the Supreme Court) serves as the administrator of the government of Canada and exercises all powers of the governor general.

===Selection===
In a speech on the subject of Confederation, made in 1866 to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, John A. Macdonald said of the planned governor, &quot;we place no restriction on Her Majesty&#x27;s prerogative in the selection of her representative ... The sovereign has unrestricted freedom of choice ... We leave that to Her Majesty in all confidence.&quot; However, between 1867 and 1931, governors general were appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British Cabinet; until 1890, by the secretary of state for the colonies for approval by the prime minister. After that, a policy of consulting the Canadian Cabinet was established; though, this process was not always followed.

The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognized the governor general as no longer a stand-in for the British government, but, rather a direct representative of the Crown. At the Imperial Conference in 1930, it was decided that the Commonwealth ministers would &quot;tender their formal advice after informal consultation with His Majesty&quot;, thereby settling the current procedure wherein the monarch appoints the governor general on the advice of the Canadian prime minister only. This was codified in the &quot;Statute of Westminster, 1931&quot;.

How many names the prime minister puts forward to the sovereign has varied. Richard Bennett suggested a number of names in an informal letter to King George V in 1930, all of which the King approved, leading Bennett to pick Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough. Mackenzie King in 1945 gave three names to King George VI, who chose Harold Alexander (later the Viscount Alexander of Tunis). Mackenzie King then made the formal recommendation to the King, which was accepted. Louis St. Laurent, however, gave only one name—Massey&#x27;s—to George VI. There is typically informal consultation between the prime minister and sovereign, either directly or via the incumbent governor general, on the appointment of the next viceroy before the prime minister gives his official advice to the monarch.
The only time the leader of the opposition was consulted on the choice of name to put forward to the monarch for appointment as viceroy was when Lord Tweedsmuir&#x27;s predecessor, Bessborough, wished to resign as governor general coincidentally just ahead of Parliament reaching the end of its maximum five year life in July 1935, after which an election was required. Mackenzie King, at the time leader of the opposition, expected to win a majority in the upcoming election and stated he would not accept a governor general recommended by then-Prime Minister Bennett, which was a constitutionally unjustifiable position for Mackenzie King to take. King George V became concerned and instructed Bessborough to either remain in office until after the election or bring Bennett and Mackenzie King together to agree on a nominee for his replacement. The Governor General consulted with the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition and settled on Tweedsmuir.

Until 1952, all governors general were members of the British aristocracy or former British military officers, diplomats, or politicians raised to the peerage. These viceroys had spent no or little time in Canada prior to their appointment; though it was claimed as their travel schedules were so extensive that they could &quot;learn more about Canada in five years than many Canadians in a lifetime&quot;. The idea of a Canadian being appointed governor general was raised as early as 1919, when, at the Paris Peace Conference, Canadian prime minister Sir Robert Borden, consulted with South African prime minister Louis Botha, and the two agreed that the viceregal appointees should be long-term residents of their respective dominions. Calls for just such an individual to be made viceroy came again in the late 1930s, but, it was not until Massey&#x27;s appointment by King George VI in 1952 that the position was filled by a Canadian-born individual. The prime minister at the time, Louis St. Laurent, wrote in a letter to the media, &quot;[i]t seems to me no one of the King&#x27;s subjects, wherever he resides, should be considered unworthy to represent the King, provided he has the personal qualifications and a position in the community which are consonant with the dignity and responsibility of that office.&quot; Massey stated of this, &quot;a Canadian [as governor general] makes it far easier to look on the Crown as our own and on the Sovereign as Queen of Canada.&quot;

This practice continued until 1999, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative Adrienne Clarkson, a Hong Kong-born refugee to Canada. Moreover, the practice of alternating between francophone and anglophone Canadians was instituted with the appointment of Vanier, a francophone who succeeded the anglophone Massey. All persons whose names are put forward to the for approval must first undergo background checks by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
Although required by the tenets of constitutional monarchy to be nonpartisan while in office, governors general were often former politicians; a number held seats in the British House of Lords by virtue of their inclusion in the peerage. Appointments of former ministers of the Crown in the 1980s and 1990s were criticized by Peter H. Russell, who stated in 2009: &quot;much of [the] advantage of the monarchical system is lost in Canada when prime ministers recommend partisan colleagues to be appointed governor general and represent [the ].&quot; Clarkson was the first governor general in Canadian history without either a political or military background, as well as the first Asian-Canadian and the second woman, following on Jeanne Sauvé. The third woman to hold this position was also the first Caribbean-Canadian governor general, Michaëlle Jean.

There have been, from time to time, proposals put forward for modifications to the selection process. Citizens for a Canadian Republic has advocated the election of the nominee to the sovereign, either by popular or parliamentary vote; a proposal echoed by Clarkson, who called for the prime minister&#x27;s choice to not only be vetted by a parliamentary committee, but, also submit to a televised quiz on Canadiana. Constitutional scholars, editorial boards, and the Monarchist League of Canada have argued against any such constitutional tinkering with the viceregal appointment process, stating that the position being &quot;not elected is an asset, not a handicap&quot;, and that an election would politicize the office, thereby undermining the impartiality necessary to the proper functioning of the governor general. Retired University of Ottawa professor John E. Trent proposed the governor general be head of state and selected by the Officers of the Order of Canada, something Chris Selley argued would politicize both the head of state and the Order of Canada, itself. In 2021, Grand Chief Vernon Watchmaker and Chief Germaine Anderson of the Six Nations of the Grand River wrote to Queen Elizabeth II, suggesting that the federal Cabinet consult treaty nations before the appointment of a new governor general, stating, &quot;we are partners with the Crown.&quot;

A new approach was used in 2010 for the selection of David Johnston as governor general-designate. For the task, Prime Minister Stephen Harper convened a special search group—the Governor General Consultation Committee—which was instructed to find a non-partisan candidate who would respect the monarchical aspects of the viceregal office and conducted extensive consultations with more than 200 people across the country. In 2012, the committee was made permanent and renamed as the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments, with a modified membership and its scope broadened to include the appointment of provincial lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners (though, the latter are not personal representatives of the monarch). However, the next ministry, headed by Justin Trudeau, disbanded the committee in 2017, before he recommended Payette as Johnston&#x27;s successor that year. Following Payette&#x27;s resignation, Trudeau formed the Advisory Group on the Selection of the Next Governor General, which selected Mary Simon for appointment as vicereine.

===Swearing-in ceremony===
The swearing-in ceremony begins with the arrival at 7 Rideau Gate of one of the ministers of the Crown, who then accompanies the governor general-designate to Parliament Hill, where a Canadian Forces guard of honour (consisting of the Army Guard, Royal Canadian Air Force Guard, and Flag Party of the Royal Canadian Navy) awaits to give a general salute. From there, the party is led by the &#x27;s parliamentary messenger—the usher of the Black Rod—to the Senate chamber, wherein all justices of the Supreme Court, senators, members of Parliament, and other guests are assembled. The &#x27;s commission for the governor general-designate is then read aloud by the secretary to the governor general and the required oaths are administered to the appointee by either the chief justice or one of the puisne justices of the Supreme Court; the three oaths are: the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Office as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief, and the Oath as Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada. With the affixing of their signature to these three solemn promises, the individual is officially the governor general, and at that moment the flag of the governor general of Canada is raised on the Peace Tower, the &quot;Vice Regal Salute&quot; is played by the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces, and a 21-gun salute is conducted by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. The governor general is seated on the throne while a prayer is read, and then receives the Great Seal of Canada (which is passed to the registrar general for protection), as well as the chains of both the chancellor of the Order of Canada and of the Order of Military Merit. The governor general then gives a speech, outlining causes they will champion during their time as viceroy.

==Role==

Canada shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and that individual, in the monarch&#x27;s capacity as the Canadian sovereign, has 10 other legal personas within the Canadian federation. As the sovereign works and resides in the United Kingdom, the governor general&#x27;s primary task is to perform federal constitutional duties on behalf of the monarch. As such, the governor general carries on &quot;the government of Canada on behalf and in the name of the sovereign&quot;.

The governor general acts within the principles of parliamentary democracy and responsible government as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and as a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. For the most part, however, the powers of the Crown are exercised on a day-to-day basis by elected and appointed individuals, leaving the governor general to perform the various ceremonial duties the sovereign otherwise carries out when in the country; at such a moment, the governor general removes him or herself from public, though the presence of the monarch does not affect the governor general&#x27;s ability to perform governmental roles.

Past governor general John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, said of the job, &quot;it is no easy thing to be a governor general of Canada. You must have the patience of a saint, the smile of a cherub, the generosity of an Indian prince, and the back of a camel&quot;, and the Earl of Dufferin stated that the governor general is &quot;a representative of all that is august, stable, and sedate in the government, the history and the traditions of the country; incapable of partizanship and lifted far above the atmosphere of faction; without adherents to reward or opponents to oust from office; docile to the suggestions of his Ministers and, yet, securing to the people the certainty of being able to get rid of an administration or parliament the moment either had forfeited their confidence.&quot;

===Constitutional role===
All executive, legislative, and judicial power in and over Canada is vested in the monarch. The governor general is permitted to exercise most of this power, including the royal prerogative, in the sovereign&#x27;s name; some as outlined in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and some through various letters patent issued over the decades, particularly those from 1947 that constitute the Office of Governor General of Canada. The 1947 letters patent state, &quot;and We do hereby authorize and empower Our Governor General, with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada or of any members thereof or individually, as the case requires, to exercise all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to Us in respect of Canada.&quot; The office itself does not, however, independently possess any powers of the royal prerogative, only exercising the Crown&#x27;s powers with its permission; a fact the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, left unchanged. Among other duties, the monarch retains the sole right to appoint the governor general. It is also stipulated that the governor general may appoint deputies—usually Supreme Court justices and the secretary to the governor general—who can perform some of the viceroy&#x27;s constitutional duties in the governor general&#x27;s absence, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court (or a puisne justice in the chief justice&#x27;s absence) will act as the administrator of the government upon the death or removal, as well as the incapacitation, or absence of the governor general for more than one month.
The governor general is required by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, to appoint for life persons to the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, who are all technically tasked with tendering to the monarch and viceroy guidance on the exercise of the royal prerogative. Convention dictates, though, that the governor general must draw from the Privy Council an individual to appoint as prime minister. In almost all cases, this is the member of Parliament who commands the confidence of the House of Commons, whom the governor general must appoint to the Privy Council, if that person is not already a member, so the individual can be appointed prime minister. The prime minister then advises the governor general to appoint other members of parliament to a committee of the Privy Council known as the Cabinet and it is, in practice, only from this group of ministers of the Crown that the king and governor general will take advice on the use of executive power; an arrangement called the &quot;king-in-Council&quot; or, more specifically, the &quot;governor-in-Council&quot;. In this capacity, the governor general will issue royal proclamations and sign orders in council. The governor-in-Council is also specifically tasked by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, to appoint in the monarch&#x27;s name, the lieutenant governors of the provinces, senators, the speaker of the Senate, superior, district, and county court judges in each province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and high commissioners and ambassadors. The advice given by the Cabinet is, in order to ensure the stability of government, by political convention typically binding. The governor general has mainly only the right to advise, encourage, and warn; to offer valued counsel to the prime minister.

Both the King and his viceroy, however, may in exceptional circumstances invoke the reserve powers, which remain the Crown&#x27;s final check against a ministry&#x27;s abuse of power. The reserve power of dismissal has never been used in Canada, although other reserve powers have been employed to force the prime minister to resign on two occasions: In 1896, Prime Minister Charles Tupper refused to step down after his party failed to win a majority in the House of Commons during that year&#x27;s election, leading Governor General the Earl of Aberdeen to no longer recognize Tupper as prime minister and disapprove of several appointments Tupper had recommended. In 1925, the King–Byng affair took place, in which Prime Minister Mackenzie King, facing a non-confidence motion in the House of Commons, advised Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy to dissolve the new parliament, but Byng refused.

Peter Hogg, a constitutional scholar, has opined that &quot;a system of responsible government cannot work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers.&quot; Further, Eugene Forsey stated &quot;the reserve power is indeed, under our Constitution, an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy. It takes the place of the legal and judicial safeguards provided in the United States by written Constitutions, enforceable in the courts.&quot;

Within the Dominions, until the 1920s, most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the British Cabinet, with the latter taking precedence. After the Imperial Conference of 1926 produced the Balfour Declaration, formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of Commonwealth governments, governors general ceased to be advised in any way by British ministers.

It was decided at the same Imperial Conference that the governor general &quot;should be kept as fully informed as His Majesty the King in Great Britain of Cabinet business and public affairs.&quot; How frequently governors general and their prime ministers conversed has varied; some prime ministers have valued their meetings with the viceroy at the time. However, the practice is usually informal and the prime minister will typically schedule a telephone call to request the governor general perform a significant task. The governor general regularly receives the minutes from Cabinet meetings and any documents referred to in those minutes. 
The governor general also summons Parliament, reads the speech from the throne, and prorogues and dissolves Parliament. The governor general grants royal assent in the King&#x27;s name; legally, the governor general has three options: grant royal assent (making the bill a law), withhold royal assent (vetoing the bill), or reserve the bill for the signification of the king&#x27;s pleasure (allowing the sovereign to personally grant or withhold assent). If the governor general withholds the King&#x27;s assent, the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill, thereby annulling the law in question. No governor general has denied royal assent to a bill. Provincial viceroys, however, are able to reserve royal assent to provincial bills for the governor general, which was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.

===Ceremonial role===
With most constitutional functions lent to Cabinet, the governor general acts in a primarily ceremonial fashion. The governor general will host members of Canada&#x27;s royal family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state, and will represent the and country abroad on state visits to other nations, though the monarch&#x27;s permission is necessary, via the prime minister, for the viceroy to leave Canada. Also as part of international relations, the governor general issues letters of credence and of recall for Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners and receives the same from foreign ambassadors and other Commonwealth countries&#x27; high commissioners appointed to Canada.
The governor general is also tasked with fostering national unity and pride. Queen Elizabeth II stated in 1959, to then-Governor General Vincent Massey, &quot;maintain[ing] the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada [is] the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction.&quot; One way in which this is carried out is travelling the country and meeting with Canadians from all regions and ethnic groups in Canada, continuing the tradition begun in 1869 by Governor General the Lord Lisgar. The governor general will also induct individuals into the various national orders and present national medals and decorations. Similarly, the viceroy administers and distributes the Governor General&#x27;s Awards, and will also give out awards associated with private organizations, some of which are named for past governors general. During a federal election, the governor general will curtail these public duties, so as not to appear as though they are involving themselves in political affairs.

Although the constitution of Canada states that the &quot;Command-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada, is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen,&quot; the governor general acts in place as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces and is permitted through the 1947 Letters Patent to use the title &quot;Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada&quot;. The position technically involves issuing commands for Canadian troops, airmen, and sailors, but is predominantly a ceremonial role in which the viceroy will visit Canadian Forces bases across Canada and abroad to take part in military ceremonies, see troops off to and return from active duty, and encourage excellence and morale amongst the forces. The governor general also serves as honorary Colonel of three household regiments: the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards and Canadian Grenadier Guards. This ceremonial position is directly under that of Colonel-in-Chief, which is held by the . Since 1910, the governor general was also always made the chief scout for Canada, which was renamed &quot;Chief Scout of Canada&quot; after 1946 and again in 2011 as &quot;Patron Scout&quot;.

==Residences and household==
Rideau Hall, located in Ottawa, is the official residence of the Canadian monarch and of the governor general and is thus the location of the viceregal household and the Chancellery of Honours. For a part of each year since 1872, governors general have also resided at the Citadel () in Quebec City, Quebec. A governor general&#x27;s wife is known as the of Rideau Hall, though there is no equivalent term for a governor general&#x27;s husband.
The viceregal household aids the governor general in the execution of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties and is managed by the secretary to the governor general. The Chancellery of Honours depends from the and is thus also located at Rideau Hall and administered by the governor general. As such, the viceroy&#x27;s secretary &quot;ex officio&quot; holds the position of Herald Chancellor of Canada, overseeing the Canadian Heraldic Authority—the mechanism of the Canadian honours system by which armorial bearings are granted to Canadians by the governor general in the name of the sovereign. These organized offices and support systems include aides-de-camp, press officers, financial managers, speech writers, trip organizers, event planners, protocol officers, chefs and other kitchen employees, waiters, and various cleaning staff, as well as visitors&#x27; centre staff and tour guides at both official residences. In this official and bureaucratic capacity, the entire household is often referred to as &quot;Government House&quot; and its departments are funded through the normal federal budgetary process, as is the governor general&#x27;s salary of CAD$288,900, which has been taxed since 2013. Additional costs are incurred from separate ministries and organizations such as the National Capital Commission, the Department of National Defence, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The governor general&#x27;s air transportation is assigned to 412 Transport Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The squadron uses Bombardier Challenger 600 VIP jets to transport the governor general to locations within and outside of Canada.

==Symbols and protocol==
As the personal representative of the monarch, the governor general follows only the sovereign in the Canadian order of precedence, preceding even other members of the Royal Family. Though the federal viceroy is considered &quot;primus inter pares&quot; amongst provincial counterparts, the governor general also outranks the lieutenant governors in the federal sphere; at provincial functions, however, the relevant lieutenant governor, as the &#x27;s representative in the province, precedes the governor general. The incumbent governor general and their spouse are also the only people in Canada, other than serving Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners, entitled to the use of the style &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot; and the governor general is granted the additional honorific of &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; for their time in office and for life afterwards.
Until 1952, all governors general of Canada were members of the peerage or heir apparent to a peerage. Typically, individuals appointed as federal viceroy were already a peer, either by inheriting the title, such as the Duke of Devonshire, or by prior elevation by the sovereign in their own right, as was the case with Earl Alexander of Tunis. None were life peers, the Life Peerages Act 1958 postdating the beginning of the tradition of appointing Canadian citizens as governor general. John Buchan was, in preparation for his appointment as governor general, made the Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield in the County of Oxford by King George V, six months before Buchan was sworn in as viceroy. The leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition at the time, Mackenzie King, felt Buchan should serve as governor general as a commoner. However, George V insisted he be represented by a peer. With the appointment of Massey as governor general in 1952, governors general ceased to be members of the peerage; successive prime ministers since that date have held to the non-binding and defeated (in 1934) principles of the 1919 Nickle Resolution.

Under the orders&#x27; constitutions, the governor general serves as Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada, Chancellor of the Order of Military Merit, and Chancellor of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces. The governor general also upon installation automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Prior and Chief Officer in Canada of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. As acting commander-in-chief, the governor general is further routinely granted the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration by the chief of the Defence Staff on behalf of the monarch. All of these honours are retained following an incumbent&#x27;s departure from office, with the individual remaining in the highest categories of the orders, and they may also be further distinguished with induction into other orders or the receipt of other awards.

The Viceregal Salute — composed of the first six bars of the Royal Anthem (&quot;God Save the &quot;) followed by the first and last four bars of the national anthem (&quot;O Canada&quot;) — is the salute used to greet the governor general upon arrival and departure from most official events. To mark the viceroy&#x27;s presence at any building, ship, airplane, or car in Canada, the governor general&#x27;s flag is employed. The present form was adopted on 23 February 1981 and, in the federal jurisdiction, takes precedence over all other flags except for the &#x27;s personal Canadian standard. When the governor general undertakes a state visit, however, the national flag is generally employed to mark governor general&#x27;s presence. This flag is also, along with all flags on Canadian Forces property, flown at half-mast upon the death of an incumbent or former governor general.
The crest of the Royal Arms of Canada is employed as the badge of the governor general, appearing on the viceroy&#x27;s flag and on other objects associated with the person or the office. This is the fourth such incarnation of the governor general&#x27;s mark since confederation.

The governor general may also wear the uniform and corresponding cap or hat badge of a flag or general officer, with a special flag or general officer sleeve braid embellished with the governor general&#x27;s badge, and a large embroidered governor general&#x27;s badge on the shoulder straps or boards, facing forward.
==History==
===French and British colonies===
French colonization of North America began in the 1580s and Aymar de Chaste was appointed in 1602 by King Henry IV as Viceroy of Canada. The explorer Samuel de Champlain became the first unofficial Governor of New France in the early 17th century, serving until Charles Huault de Montmagny was in 1636 formally appointed to the post by King Louis XIII. The French Company of One Hundred Associates then administered New France until King Louis XIV took control of the colony and appointed Augustin de Saffray de Mésy as the first governor general in 1663, after whom 12 more people served in the post.

With the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, France relinquished most of its North American territories, including Canada, to Great Britain. King George III then issued in that same year a royal proclamation establishing, amongst other regulations, the Office of the Governor of Quebec to preside over the new Province of Quebec. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick remained completely separate colonies, each with their own governor, until the cabinet of William Pitt adopted in the 1780s the idea that they, along with Quebec and Prince Edward Island, should have as their respective governors a single individual styled as &quot;governor-in-chief&quot;. The post was created in 1786, with Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester as its first occupant. However, the governor-in-chief directly governed only Quebec. It was not until the splitting in 1791 of the Province of Quebec, to accommodate the influx of United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American revolutionary war, that the king&#x27;s representative, with a change in title to &quot;Governor General&quot;, directly governed Lower Canada, while the other three colonies were each administered by a lieutenant governor in his stead.

Following the 1783 recognition of the independence of the 13 continental colonies that became the United States of America and the transfer of East Florida and West Florida to Spain, the remaining British colonies of North America, including Bermuda, were partly integrated as British North America. During the War of 1812, Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost was appointed as &quot;Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and Over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and Their Several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the Same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty&#x27;s Forces in the Said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and Their Several Dependencies, and in the Islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton, and the Bermudas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot;

===Responsible government===

The Rebellions of 1837 brought about great changes to the role of the governor general, prompting, as they did, the British government to grant responsible government to the Canadian provinces. As a result, the viceroys became largely nominal heads, while the democratically elected legislatures and the premiers they supported exercised the authority belonging to the Crown; a concept first put to the test when, in 1849, Governor-General of the Province of Canada and Lieutenant-Governor of Canada East James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin granted Royal Assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, despite his personal misgivings towards the legislation.

This arrangement continued after the reunification in 1840 of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, and the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. The governor general carried out in Canada all the parliamentary and ceremonial functions of a constitutional monarch—amongst other things, granting Royal Assent, issuing Orders-in-Council, and taking advice from the Canadian Privy Council. However, the governor still remained not a viceroy, in the true sense of the word, being still a representative of and liaison to the British government—the Queen in her British council of ministers—who answered to the secretary of state for the colonies in London and who, as a British observer of Canadian politics, held well into the First World War a suite of offices in the East Block of Parliament Hill. But, the new position of Canadian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, created in 1880, began to take over the governor general&#x27;s role as a link between the Canadian and British governments, leaving the viceroy increasingly as a personal representative of the monarch. As such, the governor general had to retain a sense of political neutrality; a skill that was put to the test when John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, disagreed with his Canadian prime minister, John A. Macdonald, over the dismissal of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Luc Letellier de St-Just. On the advice of the colonial secretary, and to avoid conflict with the Canadian Cabinet, Campbell did eventually concede and released St-Just from duty. The governor general was then in May 1891 called upon to resolve the Dominion&#x27;s first cabinet crisis, wherein Macdonald died, leaving Lord Stanley of Preston to select a new prime minister.
As early as 1880, the viceregal family and court attracted minor ridicule from the Queen&#x27;s subjects: in July of that year, someone under the pseudonym &quot;Captain Mac&quot; included in a pamphlet called &quot;Canada: from the Lakes to the Gulf&quot;, a coarse satire of an investiture ceremony at Rideau Hall, in which a retired inn-keeper and his wife undergo the rigorous protocol of the royal household and sprawl on the floor before the Duke of Argyll so as to be granted the knighthood for which they had &quot;paid in cold, hard cash&quot;. Later, prior to the arrival of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (the uncle of King George V), to take up the post of governor general, there was a &quot;feeble undercurrent of criticism&quot; centring on worries about a rigid court at Rideau Hall; worries that turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple was actually more relaxed than their predecessors.

===Emerging nationality to an independent kingdom===

During the First World War, into which Canada was drawn due to its association with the United Kingdom, the governor general&#x27;s role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, Governor General Prince Arthur donned his Field Marshal&#x27;s uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on Military Secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke &quot;laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General&quot;. Prince Arthur&#x27;s successor, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as members of the official opposition, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting on the pulse of the nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruchési, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.

Canada&#x27;s national sentiment had gained fortitude through the country&#x27;s sacrifices on the battlefields of the First World War and, by war&#x27;s end, the interference of the British government in Canadian affairs was causing ever-increasing discontent amongst Canadian officials; In 1918, &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; was even advocating the end of the office. The governor general&#x27;s role was also changing to focus less on the larger Empire and more on uniquely Canadian affairs, including the undertaking of official international visits on behalf of Canada, the first being that of the Marquess of Willingdon to the United States, where he was accorded by President Calvin Coolidge the full honours of representative of a head of state. It would be another decade, however, before the King-Byng Affair: another catalyst for change in the relationship between Canada—indeed, all the dominions—and the United Kingdom, and thus the purpose of the governor general.
In 1926, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, facing a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons over a scandal in his party, requested that Governor General Viscount Byng of Vimy dissolve parliament and call an election. Byng, however, refused his Canadian prime minister&#x27;s advice, citing both the facts that King held the minority of seats in the house and that a general election had been held only months earlier; he thus called on Arthur Meighen to form a government. Within a week however, Meighen&#x27;s Conservative government lost its own non-confidence vote, forcing the Governor General to dissolve parliament and call elections that saw Mackenzie King returned to power. King then went on to the Imperial Conference that same year and there pushed for reorganizations that resulted in the Balfour Declaration, which declared formally the practical reality that had existed for some years: namely, that the Dominions were fully autonomous and equal in status to the United Kingdom. These new developments were codified in the Statute of Westminster, through the enactment of which on 11 December 1931, Canada, along with the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State, immediately obtained formal legislative independence from the UK. In addition, the Balfour Declaration also held that the governor general would cease to act as the representative of the British government. Accordingly, in 1928, the United Kingdom appointed its first High Commissioner to Canada thus effectively ending the governor general&#x27;s diplomatic role as the British government&#x27;s envoy.

The governor general thus became solely the representative of the monarch within Canadian jurisdiction, ceasing completely to be an agent of the British Cabinet, and as such would be appointed only on the advice of his Canadian prime minister. The Canadian Cabinet&#x27;s first recommendation under this new system was still, however, a British subject born outside of Canada, John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir).

Tweedsmuir&#x27;s birthplace aside, though, the professional author took further than any of his predecessors the idea of a distinct Canadian identity, travelling the length and breadth of the country, including, for the first time for a governor general, the Arctic regions. Not all Canadians, however, shared Tweedsmuir&#x27;s views; the Baron raised the ire of imperialists when he said in Montreal in 1937: &quot;a Canadian&#x27;s first loyalty is not to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but to Canada and Canada&#x27;s King&quot;, a statement the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; dubbed as &quot;disloyal&quot;. During Tweedsmuir&#x27;s time as viceroy, which started in 1935, calls began to emerge for a Canadian-born individual to be appointed as governor general; but Tweedsmuir died suddenly in office in 1940, while Canada was in the midst of the Second World War, and Mackenzie King did not feel it was the right time to search for a suitable Canadian. The Earl of Athlone was instead appointed by King George VI, Athlone&#x27;s nephew, to be his viceroy for the duration of the war.

===Quebec nationalism and constitutional patriation===
It was in 1952, a mere five days before King George VI&#x27;s death, that Vincent Massey became the first Canadian-born person to be appointed as a governor general in Canada since the Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal was made Governor General of New France on 1 January 1755, as well as the first not to be elevated to the peerage since Sir Edmund Walker Head in 1854. There was some trepidation about this departure from tradition and Massey was intended to be a compromise: he was known to embody loyalty, dignity, and formality, as expected from a viceroy.

As his viceregal tenure neared an end, it was thought that Massey, an anglophone, should be followed by a francophone Canadian; and so, in spite of his Liberal Party attachments, Georges Vanier was chosen by Conservative prime minister John Diefenbaker as the next governor general. Vanier was subsequently appointed by Queen Elizabeth II, in person, at a meeting of her Canadian Cabinet, thus initiating the convention of alternating between individuals from Canada&#x27;s two main linguistic groups. This move did not, however, placate those who were fostering the new Quebec nationalist movement, for whom the monarchy and other federal institutions were a target for attack. Though Vanier was a native of Quebec and fostered biculturalism, he was not immune to the barbs of the province&#x27;s sovereigntists and, when he attended &quot;la Fête St-Jean-Baptiste&quot; in Montreal in 1964, a group of separatists held placards reading &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Vanier sold out&quot;) and &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Vanier Queen&#x27;s jester&quot;).

In light of this regional nationalism and a resultant change in attitudes towards Canadian identity, images and the role of the monarchy were cautiously downplayed, and Vanier&#x27;s successor, Roland Michener, was the last viceroy to practice many of the office&#x27;s ancient traditions, such as the wearing of court uniform by the governor general, the requirement of court dress for state occasions, and expecting women to curtsey before the governor general. At the same time, he initiated new practices for the viceroy, including regular conferences with the lieutenant governors and the undertaking of state visits. He presided over Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations and the coincidental Expo 67, to which French president Charles de Gaulle was invited. Michener was with de Gaulle when he made his infamous &quot;&quot; speech in Montreal and was cheered wildly by the gathered crowd while they booed and jeered Michener. With the additional recognition of the monarchy as a Canadian institution, the establishment of a distinct Canadian honours system, an increase of state visits coming with Canada&#x27;s growing role on the world stage, and the more prevalent use of television to visually broadcast ceremonial state affairs, the governor general became more publicly active in national life.
The Cabinet in June 1978 proposed the constitutional amendment Bill C-60, that, amongst other changes, vested executive authority directly in the governor general and renamed the position as &quot;First Canadian&quot;, but the proposal was thwarted by the provincial premiers. When the constitution was patriated four years later, the new amending formula for the documents outlined that any changes to the Crown, including the Office of the Governor General, would require the consent of all the provincial legislatures plus the federal parliament. By 1984, Canada&#x27;s first female governor general, Jeanne Sauvé, was appointed. While it was she who created the Canadian Heraldic Authority, as permitted by letters patent from Queen Elizabeth II, and who championed youth and world peace, Sauvé proved to be a controversial vicereine, closing to the public the grounds of the Queen&#x27;s residence and self-aggrandizingly breaching protocol on a number of occasions.

===Withering and renaissance===
Sarah, Duchess of York, said in 2009 that sometime during her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, her husband was offered the position of governor general of Canada, and she speculated in hindsight that their agreement to refuse the commission may have been a contributing factor in their eventual break-up. Instead, Sauvé&#x27;s tenure as governor general was book-ended by a series of appointments—Edward Schreyer, Ray Hnatyshyn, and Roméo LeBlanc—that have been generally regarded as mere patronage postings for former politicians and friends of the incumbent prime minister at the time, and despite the duties they carried out, their combined time in the viceregal office is generally viewed as unremarkable at best, and damaging to the office at worst. As David Smith described it: &quot;Notwithstanding the personal qualities of the appointees, which have often been extraordinary, the Canadian governor general has become a hermetic head of state—ignored by press, politicians and public.&quot; It was theorized by Peter Boyce that this was due, in part, to widespread misunderstanding about the governor general&#x27;s role coupled with a lack of public presence compared to the media coverage dedicated to the increasingly presidentialized prime minister.
It was with the Queen&#x27;s appointment of Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, that a shift in the office took place. Clarkson was the first Canadian viceroy to have not previously held any political or military position—coming as she did from a background of television journalism with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation—was the first since 1952 to have been born outside of Canada, the first from a visible minority (she is of Chinese ancestry), and, by her being accompanied to Rideau Hall by her husband, author and philosopher John Ralston Saul, the official appointment brought an unofficial pair to the viceregal placement, in that the governor general would not be the only person actively exploring Canadian theory and culture. Clarkson managed to bring the viceregal office back into the collective consciousness of Canadians, winning praise for touring the country more than any of her predecessors, her inspiring speeches, and her dedication to the military in her role as the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s representative. This did not come without a cost, however, as the attention also drew widespread criticism of the governor general&#x27;s increased spending on state affairs, for which the office was symbolically rebuked by parliament when it voted in favour of cutting by 10% the viceregal budget it had earlier supported, as well as for fostering the notion, through various demonstrations, that the governor general was ultimately the Canadian head of state above the Queen herself, an approach that was said by Jack Granatstein to have caused &quot;a fury&quot; with the Queen on one occasion in 2004. This attitude was not unique to Clarkson, though; it had been observed that, for some decades, staff at Rideau Hall and various government departments in Ottawa had been pushing to present the governor general as head of state, part of a wider Liberal policy on the monarchy that had been in effect at least since the proposed constitutional changes in the 1970s, if not the 1964 Truncheon Saturday riot in Quebec City. Indeed, international observers opined that the viceroys had been, over the years, making deliberate attempts to distance themselves from the sovereign, for fear of being too closely associated with any &quot;Britishness&quot; the monarch embodied.
Prime Minister Paul Martin followed Chrétien&#x27;s example and, for Clarkson&#x27;s successor, put forward to the Queen the name of Michaëlle Jean, who was, like Clarkson, a woman, a refugee, a member of a visible minority, a CBC career journalist, and married to an intellectual husband who worked in the arts. Her appointment initially sparked accusations that she was a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, and it was observed that she had on a few occasions trodden into political matters, as well as continuing to foster the notion that the governor general had replaced the Queen as head of state, thereby &quot;unbalancing ... the federalist symmetry&quot;. But Jean ultimately won plaudits, particularly for her solidarity with the Canadian Forces and the indigenous peoples in Canada, as well as her role in the parliamentary dispute that took place between December 2008 and January 2009.

With the appointment of academic David Johnston, former principal of McGill University and subsequently president of the University of Waterloo, there was a signalled emphasis for the governor general to vigorously promote learning and innovation. Johnston stated in his inaugural address: &quot;[We want to be] a society that innovates, embraces its talent and uses the knowledge of each of its citizens to improve the human condition for all.&quot; There was also a recognition of Johnston&#x27;s expertise in constitutional law, following the controversial prorogations of Parliament in 2008 and 2009, which initiated some debate about the governor general&#x27;s role as the representative of Canada&#x27;s head of state.

In late 2021, the Governor General&#x27;s office confirmed that its internal office network was breached as part of a &quot;sophisticated cyber incident&quot;. Officials were unable to determine the extent of the information that was accessed. Former security officials speculated that another country may be responsible. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, a branch of the Communications Security Establishment, is investigating the incident.

==Activities post-retirement==
Retired governors general usually either withdraw from public life or go on to hold other public offices. Edward Schreyer, for instance, was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Australia upon his departure from the viceregal role in 1984, and Michaëlle Jean became the UNESCO special envoy to Haiti and, later, the secretary-general of La Francophonie. Schreyer also become the first former governor general to run for elected office in Canada when he unsuccessfully vied for a seat in the House of Commons as a New Democratic Party candidate. Prior to 1952, several former viceroys returned to political careers in the United Kingdom, sitting with party affiliations in the House of Lords and, in some cases, taking a position in the British Cabinet. The Marquess of Lorne was elected a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom in 1895, and remained so until he became the Duke of Argyll and took his seat in the House of Lords. Others were made governors in other countries or territories: Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Dublin, the Earl of Aberdeen was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Earl of Dufferin, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, and the Earl of Willingdon all subsequently served as Viceroy of India.

An outgoing governor general may leave an eponymous award as a legacy, such as the Stanley Cup, the Clarkson Cup, the Vanier Cup, or the Grey Cup. They may found an institution, as Vanier did with the Vanier Institute of the Family and Clarkson with the Institute for Canadian Citizenship. Three former governors general have released memoirs: Lord Tweedsmuir (&quot;Memory Hold-the-Door&quot;), Massey (&quot;What&#x27;s Past is Prologue&quot;), and Clarkson (&quot;Heart Matters&quot;).

As of 2021, former governors general are entitled to a lifetime pension of nearly $150,000 and also to claim an additional $206,000 in expenses each year.

==Spelling of the title==
The letters patent constituting the office and official publications of the government of Canada spell the title &quot;governor general&quot;, without a hyphen, unlike in the other Commonwealth realms, which do include a hyphen. As &quot;governor&quot; is the noun, the title is pluralized as &quot;governors general&quot;, rather than &quot;governor generals&quot;.

<doc id="38153" wikidata="Q82380" url="?curid=38153" title="Hydra 70">
<text>The Hydra 70 rocket is an American made diameter fin-stabilized unguided rocket used primarily in the air-to-ground role. It can be equipped with a variety of warheads, and in more recent versions, guidance systems for point attacks. The Hydra is widely used by US and allied forces, competing with the Canadian CRV7, with which it is physically interchangeable.

==Overview==
The Hydra 70 is derived from the diameter Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket developed by the United States Navy for use as a free-flight aerial rocket in the late 1940s. The Mk 40 was used during the Korean and Vietnam wars to provide close air support to ground forces from about 20 different firing platforms, both fixed-wing and armed helicopters.

The main change made to produce the Hydra was the Mk. 66 motor which uses a new propellant that offers considerably more thrust, (Mod 2/3) (Mod 4). The fins of the Mk 40 flipped forward from the rear when the rocket left the launching tube, but in the Hydra they are curved to match the outside diameter of the rocket fuselage and flip sideways to open, which is referred to as WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket) instead of FFAR (folding-fin aerial rocket). To improve stability during the time the fins are still opening, the four motor nozzles have a slight cant angle to impart a spin while the rocket is still in the launch tube.

Today, the OH-58D(R) Kiowa Warrior and AH-64E Apache Longbow, as well as the Marine Corps&#x27; versatile UH-1 Huey and AH-1 Cobra, carry the Hydra rocket launcher standard on its weapon pylons.

===Mk 66 rocket motor variants===
==Service==

The family of Hydra 70 (70 mm) 2.75 inch rockets perform a variety of functions. The war reserve unitary and cargo warheads are used for anti-materiel, anti-personnel, and suppression missions. The Hydra 70 family of folding-fin aerial rockets also includes smoke screening, illumination, and training warheads. Hydra 70 rockets are known mainly by either their warhead type or by the rocket motor designation, Mk 66 in US military service.

===United States===
In the U.S. Army, Hydra 70 rockets are fired from the AH-64 Apache and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter variants using M261 19-tube rocket launchers, and the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior using seven-tube M260 rocket launchers. In the U.S. Marine Corps, either the M260 or M261 launchers are employed on the AH-1W SuperCobra and AH-1Z Viper, depending upon the mission. The M260 and M261 are used with the Mk 66 series of rocket motor, which replaced the Mk 40 series. The Mk 66 has a reduced system weight and provides a remote fuze setting interface. Hydra 70s have also been fired from UH-60 and AH-6 series aircraft in US Army service.

The AH-1G Cobra and the UH-1B &quot;Huey&quot; used a variety of launchers including the M158 seven-tube and M200 19-tube rocket launchers designed for the Mk 40 rocket motor; however, these models have been replaced by upgraded variants in the U.S. Marine Corps because they were not compatible with the Mk 66 rocket motor. The Hydra 70 rocket system is also used by the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Air Force.

===Common U.S. Mk 66 compatible launchers===

===Accidents===
In 2019, a 72-year-old Taiwanese man was killed after a discarded Hydra rocket which he had cut into with an electric saw exploded. He had believed it to be a length of pipe. The rocket had been caught in the net of a fishing vessel and then discarded by the crew ashore as scrap metal.

==Warheads==
Hydra 70 warheads fall into three categories:
* Unitary warheads with impact-detonating fuzes or remote-set multi-option fuzes.
* Cargo warheads with air burst-range, with settable fuzes using the &quot;wall-in-space&quot; concept or fixed standoff fuzes.
* Training warheads.

===Fuzing options===
===Common warheads===
The most common warhead for the Hydra 70 rocket is the M151 &quot;10-Pounder,&quot; which has a blast radius of 10 meters and lethal fragmentation radius of around 50 meters. The M247 HEDP warheads have similar penetration to the standard M72 LAW warhead (~300 mm of rolled homogenous armor).

==Precision guided Hydra 70==
There are several design efforts to turn the Hydra 70 rocket into a precision guided munition (PGM) to produce a weapon with greater accuracy but at less cost than other guided missiles. These include:
* The BAE Systems Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II
* U.S. Navy Low-Cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR)
* Lockheed Martin Direct Attack Guided Rocket (DAGR)
* The ATK/Elbit Guided Advanced Tactical Rocket – Laser (GATR-L)
* Raytheon TALON
* Forges de Zeebrugge SAL-Laser Guided Rocket (FZ275 LGR)

The APKWS was the first to be fielded in March 2012, and the TALON entered full rate production for the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces in September 2014.

The Turkish ROKETSAN Cirit is a similar missile compatible with 70 mm rocket launchers, but it was developed from scratch and doesn&#x27;t use Hydra 70 components.

<doc id="38156" wikidata="Q200562" url="?curid=38156" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?">
<text>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions – only one contestant plays at a time. Similar to radio quizzes, contestants are given the question before deciding whether to answer, and have no time limit to answer questions. The cash prize increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult, with the maximum offered in most variants of the format being an aspirational value in the respective local currency, such as £1 million in the UK version, $1 million in the US version and 75 million (7.5 crore) in the Indian version.

The original British version debuted on 4 September 1998 on the ITV network, hosted by Chris Tarrant, and ran until 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired in May 2018, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, and ITV renewed the show for several more series. 

Since its debut, international variants of the show have been aired in around 100 countries, making it the best-selling TV format in television history, and is credited by some as paving the way for the boom in the popularity of reality television.

==History==
The format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant&#x27;s morning show on Capital FM radio, such as the bong game. Tentatively known as &quot;Cash Mountain&quot;, the show took its finalised title from a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film &quot;High Society&quot;, starring Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their copyright. While many pursued litigation, they were all unsuccessful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.

In March 2006, original producer Celador announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to &quot;Millionaire&quot;, together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company&#x27;s format and production divisions. British television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing Armani suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version. Some of Smith&#x27;s rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise&#x27;s development has progressed.

Dutch company 2waytraffic ultimately acquired &quot;Millionaire&quot; and all of Celador&#x27;s other programmes. Two years later, Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased 2waytraffic for £137.5 million. Sony Pictures Television currently owns and licences the show&#x27;s format.

==Gameplay==
===Rules===
A group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called &quot;Fastest Finger First&quot;. All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999–2002), contestants have to answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for the round begins. After time&#x27;s up, the computer and the host will reveal the correct order (or the correct answer in the latter&#x27;s case). The contestant who answers correctly in the fastest time goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly and with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker to determine who will make a start into the game. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode among those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.

Once a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, to which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling more difficult questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two &quot;safety nets&quot; – if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones might prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their &quot;final answer&quot; – if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.

====Original format====
During the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show&#x27;s format focused on fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows (questions at guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):
Between 2007 and 2014, the number of questions was reduced to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international markets over a period of four years, including the Arab world, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, France, Poland, Spain, and Turkey. The payout structure, as a whole, was subsequently changed as a result, with the second safety net relocated to £50,000 at question 7 (questions at guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):

The game show&#x27;s revival for British television in 2018 reverted to the original arrangement used before 2007, but with one notable difference, in that the second safety net was made adjustable – once a contestant reached £1,000, the host asked them, before giving the next question, if they wished to set the next cash prize amount as the second safety net, with this allowing them to set up as high as £500,000 in their game as a result.

====American format====
The American version premiered on ABC in August 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by Regis Philbin. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched in January 2000 and ran until June 2002. The syndication of the game show was conceived and debuting in September 2002. The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length – 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name &quot;Fastest Finger&quot; included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed &quot;Super Millionaire&quot;, in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000; and for the 10th anniversary special of the American edition, which ran during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round later occurred in other international versions, including the British original before its reinstatement in the renewed series.

=====Clock format=====
In 2008, the American version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:

The clock started immediately after a question was given and the four possible answers appeared. The clock paused when a lifeline was used. If the clock ran out with no answer locked in, the contestant walked away with any prize money won up to that point, unless the &quot;Double Dip&quot; lifeline had been used, in which case a failure to give a second answer was treated the same as a wrong answer. This format change was later adopted into other international versions – the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010. The Indian version followed on 11 October 2010.

=====Shuffle format=====
On 13 September 2010, the American version adopted another significant change to its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question, was randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round was &quot;not&quot; tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant did not know what amount they won unless they provided a correct answer or chose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walked away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000. If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved on to the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show – the remaining questions were set to general knowledge and featured cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant could, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the American version but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.

In 2015, the so-called &quot;shuffle format&quot; was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.

====Other international formats====
=====Risk format=====
In 2007, the German version modified the show&#x27;s format with the inclusion of a new feature called &quot;Risk Mode&quot;. During the main game, contestants are given the choice of choosing this feature, in which if they choose to use it, they gain the use of a fourth lifeline that allows them to discuss question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net – if they get any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This format became adopted in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.

A different variant has only one custom safety net before the start of the contestant&#x27;s game.

The Taiwanese version did not have any safety nets or any option to quit; the contestant&#x27;s winnings won up until they were incorrect on any question was cut by half.

=====Hot Seat format=====

In November 2008, the Italian version modified the format of the show under the title (). In this variation of the game, six contestants take part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the American version, this variation on the format grants a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered – if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; if the final question is answered incorrectly, or the last contestant is eliminated, they win a small prize, provided they reach the fifth-question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four-year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Norway, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, and Chile.

In 2009, the Australian version was modified to use the new Italian format, and the name was also changed from &quot;Extraordinary Edition&quot; to &quot;Hot Seat&quot;. In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided.

=====Gamblers&#x27; Special format=====
In 2013, the German version modified the show&#x27;s format, which runs concurrent with the original format, where only one guaranteed level exists, at €1,000, and maximum prize is €2,000,000.

===Lifelines===
During a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines which each can be used only once per game. More than one lifeline can be used on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:

* 50:50 (Fifty-Fifty) - The game&#x27;s computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer. From 2000, the selection of two incorrect answers were random.
* Phone-a-Friend - The contestant is connected with a friend over a phone line and is given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance. The time begins as soon as the contestant starts reading the question. In the Colombian version, the timer only starts after the question has been read out.
* Ask the Audience - The audience takes voting pads attached to their seats and votes for the answer that they believe is correct. The computer tallies the results and displays them as percentages to the contestant. Many versions around the world removed this lifeline as the episodes were taped without an audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the US, &quot;Ask the Audience&quot; and &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; had corporate sponsorship at different periods. The original AT&amp;T sponsored &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version&#x27;s first season; the current AT&amp;T sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, AOL sponsored &quot;Ask the Audience&quot; and allowed users of Instant Messenger to participate in the lifeline by adding the screen name &quot;MillionaireIM&quot; to their contact list. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users received an instant message with the question and the four possible answers and voted for the correct answer. The computer tallied these results alongside the results from the studio audience.

Contestants pre-select multiple friends for &quot;Phone a Friend&quot;. As soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and wait for three rings before answering. On 11 January 2010, the American version eliminated the use of &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; in response to an increasing trend of contestants&#x27; friends using web search engines and other internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with internet access an unfair advantage; they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline: friends provided assistance based on what they knew.

During recordings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants&#x27; friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During &quot;The People Play&quot; specials in 2012 and 2013, friends travelled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.

====Unique lifelines====
During the course of the game show&#x27;s history, there were a number of unique lifeline additions in various versions of the programme. These include, but are not limited, to:

* Switch the Question – Used in the American version between 2004 and 2008, and in the British original during celebrity specials between 2002 and 2003 and standard episodes between 2010 and 2014, this lifeline became available after a contestant answered the tenth question of the game. The computer replaced the current question with another of the same difficulty. The contestant could not reinstate any lifelines used on the original question. A variation of this lifeline for the American version called &quot;Cut the Question&quot;, was brought into use in 2014 for a week-long run of special episodes that featured child contestants, in which the computer replaced the current question with an easier one, and it could only be used within the first ten questions. In the Indian version, this lifeline gives out a question from one out of 11 categories that the contestant chooses before filming instead of a random question. This lifeline was also included in the 2021 specials and the Hot Seat version of the Australian market.
* Double Dip – One of two lifelines created for the &quot;Super Millionaire&quot; spin-off of the American version. When used, this lifeline allowed contestants to have two guesses at a question but forbade them from using any other remaining lifelines or from walking away with their current winnings. Contestants can first use &quot;50:50&quot; and then used &quot;Double Dip&quot; on the same question, guaranteeing them the correct answer. When the standard US format incorporated a time limit on questions, the show retired &quot;50:50&quot; and replaced it with &quot;Double Dip&quot;. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version (without a clock format) but did not replace &quot;50:50&quot;.
* Three Wise Men – The other lifeline created for &quot;Super Millionaire&quot;. When chosen, a sequestered panel of three experts (chosen by the producers) appears via face-to-face audio and video feed to provide assistance. Like &quot;Phone a Friend&quot;, this lifeline incorporated a 30-second time limit for its use. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version between 2006 and 2008 but did not feature experts. A variation, known as Ask the Star, which uses a panel of celebrities instead of quiz experts, was used in the final season of the Norwegian version and in the Swedish version since 2020.
* Two Wise Men – Used in the Vietnamese version of the show from episodes broadcast since 5 May 2020, replacing &quot;Ask Three of the Audience&quot;. It has the same function as &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;, however there are only two experts instead of three. It becomes available after the fifth question.
* Ask the Expert – Inspired by &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;, this lifeline provided the contestant with one person, an expert selected for them, to help with the question. Unlike its predecessor, this lifeline had no time limit on its use, but was only available after the fifth question; after &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; was removed in 2010, it was made readily available at any time in the game. In the US version, the lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds. In the Hong Kong edition, it replaced the &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; lifeline for a one-off special in 2001 and for two celebrity specials in 2018, though, with the celebrity contestants able to ask a panel of experts for help, present in the audience, all of whom had the question and possible answers visible to them.
* Ask One of the Audience – Used in the German version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its &quot;Risk Mode&quot; format. When used, the contestant selects someone from the audience, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it is correct, the audience member is given a small cash prize in return. This lifeline was implemented as part of other versions such as the 25th anniversary of the French version (the lifeline is renamed &quot;Vox Populi&quot;). 
* Ask Three of the Audience – This lifeline was designed for use as part of its original format. Used in the Vietnamese version of the show in episodes broadcast starting 20 May 2008, later replaced by &quot;Two Wise Men&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When used, the contestant selects three from the audience, whereupon the host re-reads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves to be correct, the audience members are given a small cash prize in return (600,000 ₫ divided between those of the 3 members that answered correctly). This lifeline is made available passing the first safety net. In the Philippines version, the lifeline is called &quot;People Speak&quot;, which can be used at any point in the game.
* Jump the Question – Used in the American version of the show, as part of the &quot;shuffle format&quot;, from the start of the ninth season to the end of the thirteenth season. When used, prior to giving a final answer, a contestant skipped the current question and moved on to the next one but earned no money from the question they skipped; the lifeline could not be used if they have reached the final question. Unlike other lifelines, it could be used twice during a game, except for the thirteenth season – the introduction of &quot;Plus One&quot; led to the lifeline being modified as a result. The lifeline was removed following the 2014–2015 season.
* Crystal Ball – Used in the US version of the show, as part of specially designated weeks that used the &quot;shuffle format&quot;. When used during the first round, the contestant is allowed to see the cash amount that is designated to the question they are currently on.
* Plus One – Used in the American version of the show from 2015 to 2019 and from 2020 to 2021. Based on &quot;Ask One of the Audience&quot;, the lifeline allows a contestant to invite on a friend from the audience to come and help them answer the question. There is no time limit, but after that question has been answered the friend has to return to the audience.
* Ask the Host – Used in the 20th anniversary revival of the original British version; the Danish, French and Italian revivals; Slovenia; Bulgaria (since September 2024); Russia (January 2021 – June 2022) and the 2020 reboot of the American version. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question&#x27;s subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host has no connection to the outside world or knowledge of the question and its possible answers in advance of it being shown to the contestant.

===Top prize winners===
Out of all contestants who have played the game, relatively few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was John Carpenter, who won the top prize on the American version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter famously did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; to call his father, not for help, but to tell him he was about to become a millionaire.

Other notable top-prize winners include:
* Judith Keppel was the first winner of the original British version.
* In the American version, Kevin Olmstead won a progressive jackpot of $2.18 million.
* In the Australian version, Martin Flood was investigated by producers after suspicions that he had cheated, much like Charles Ingram, but was later cleared.
* In the Indian version, Sushil Kumar is often referred to in Western media as the &quot;real-life &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;&quot;.
* In the Japanese version, Mana Ashida is the youngest winner in the &quot;Millionaire&quot; franchise.
* David Chang was the first celebrity winner of the American version.

==Original version==
&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; debuted in Britain on 4 September 1998, with episodes broadcast on the ITV network. When it began airing, the show was hosted by Chris Tarrant, and became an instant hit – at its peak in 1999, one edition of the show was watched by over 19 million viewers. While most of the contestants were predominantly members of the general public who had applied to take part, the show later featured special celebrity editions during its later years, often coinciding with holidays and special events.

On 22 October 2013, Tarrant decided to leave the programme after hosting it for 15 years. His decision subsequently led ITV to make plans to cancel the programme at the end of his contract, with no further specials being made other than those that were already planned. Tarrant&#x27;s final episode was a special clip show entitled &quot;Chris&#x27; Final Answer&quot;, which aired on 11 February 2014.

Four years later, ITV revived the programme for a special 7-episode series, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the British original. This series of special episodes was hosted by Jeremy Clarkson and aired every evening between 5 and 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, and, as well as high viewing figures, led to ITV renewing the show for another series with Clarkson returning as host.

==International versions==

Since the British original debuted in 1998, several different versions of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; have been created across the world, including Australia, the United States, South Africa and India. In total over 100 different international variations have been made.

===Australia ===
On 18 April 1999, Nine Network launched an Australian version of the game show for its viewers. This version ran until its final episode, aired on 3 April 2006. After the first version ended, a second version was created, running for six episodes across October and November 2007, before a third version, entitled &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot;, made its debut on 20 April 2009. The original version was hosted by Eddie McGuire, until he was forced to sacrifice his on-air commitments upon being made the CEO of the network; after his resignation from this role, he resumed his duties as host of subsequent versions of the programme.

===United States===
On 16 August 1999, ABC launched an American version of the game show for its primetime viewers. Hosted by Regis Philbin, it proved to be a ratings success, becoming the highest-rated television show during the 1999–2000 season, with its average audience figures reaching approximately 29 million viewers. After a drop in ratings, this version was cancelled, with its final episode aired on 27 June 2002. On 16 September 2002, Meredith Vieira launched a daily syndicated version of the programme, which she hosted for 11 seasons, until May 2013. After her departure, the show was hosted by Cedric the Entertainer in 2013, and Terry Crews in 2014, before Chris Harrison took full hosting responsibilities in Autumn 2015. On 17 May 2019, the American version was cancelled after a total of 17 seasons and 20 years encompassing both primetime and first-run syndication; the final episode of the series was broadcast on 31 May.

Subsequent Indian versions were also made. The original Indian version became immortalised in 2008, within the plot of Danny Boyle&#x27;s award-winning drama film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, adapted from the 2005 Indian novel &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; by Vikas Swarup.

In 2019, the show relaunched again on TV2, hosted by experienced quizshow leader Gábor Gundel-Takács. Nevertheless, the revival aired only 42 times, thus it went off weeknights, which led to a radical decline from the start of 5% SHR in ratings. The host told the audience in a Facebook video that the show would have been needed to air earlier than 21:20 (CET) to avoid timeshift changes due to the popular reality show Exatlon Hungary.

==Hallmarks==
===Music===
The musical score most commonly associated with the franchise was composed by father-and-son duo Keith and Matthew Strachan. The Strachans&#x27; score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, &quot;Millionaire&quot;″s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans&#x27; main &quot;Millionaire&quot; theme song takes inspiration from the &quot;Mars&quot; movement of Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game. On Game Show Network (GSN)&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Hall of Fame&quot; special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as &quot;mimicking the sound of a beating heart&quot;, and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is &quot;perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse&quot;.

The Strachans&#x27; &quot;Millionaire&quot; soundtrack was honoured by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000. A British album of the musical stings was released in 2000, while a remix of the theme tune became a UK chart hit the same year. The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the US version&#x27;s clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the &quot;ticking&quot; sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the US version altogether for the introduction of the &quot;shuffle format&quot; in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company Ah2 Music.

===Set===

The basic set design used in the &quot;Millionaire&quot; franchise was conceived by British production designer Andy Walmsley, and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history. Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, &quot;Millionaire&quot;″s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a thriller movie than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in &quot;Hot Seats&quot;, which are slightly modified, -high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an LG computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.

The lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show&#x27;s lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.

When the US &quot;Millionaire&quot; introduced its &quot;shuffle format&quot;, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer. Also, two video screens were installed – one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant&#x27;s cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show&#x27;s transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.

===Catchphrase===
&quot;Millionaire&quot; has made catchphrases out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host&#x27;s question &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot;, asked whenever a contestant&#x27;s answer needs to be verified. The question is asked because the nature of the game allows contestants to ponder the options aloud before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions (and sometimes on tier-two), a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant&#x27;s statement of their final answer and the host&#x27;s acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.

Many parodies of &quot;Millionaire&quot; have capitalised on the &quot;final answer&quot; catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country&#x27;s version, to the extent that TV Land listed it in its special &quot;100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases&quot;, which aired in 2006.

On the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with &quot;Lock it in?&quot;; likewise, the hosts of the Indian version have used varying &quot;lock&quot; catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of &quot;Millionaire&quot; where the host does not ask &quot;[Is that your] final answer?&quot; or a literal translation thereof. Besides the &quot;final answer&quot; question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants&#x27; requests to use lifelines, such as &quot;I&#x27;d like to phone a friend&quot;; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, &quot;Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.&quot; Another popular catchphrase heard throughout the show is spoke by Tarrant to encourage the player when he hands over the cheque, &quot;But we don&#x27;t want to give you that!&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show. It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the best selling TV format in television history, and is credited by some as paving the way for the boom in the popularity of reality television.

===Awards, accolades and honours===
In 2000, the British Film Institute honoured the UK version of &quot;Millionaire&quot; by ranking it number 23 on its &quot;BFI TV 100&quot; list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country. The UK &quot;Millionaire&quot; also won the 1999 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Programme, and seven National Television Awards for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 1999 to 2005.

The original primetime version of the US &quot;Millionaire&quot; won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show in 2000 and 2001. Philbin was honoured with a Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001, while Vieira received one in 2005 and another in 2009, making her the second woman to win an Emmy Award for hosting a game show, and the first to win multiple times. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the US &quot;Millionaire&quot; No. 7 on its 2001 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, and later ranked it No. 6 on its 2013 &quot;60 Greatest Game Shows&quot; list. GSN ranked &quot;Millionaire&quot; No. 5 on its August 2006 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, and later honoured the show in January 2007 on its first, and so far only, &quot;Gameshow Hall of Fame&quot; special.

==Charles Ingram cheating scandal==
In September 2001, British Army Major Charles Ingram apparently won the top prize in the UK &quot;Millionaire&quot;, but his flip-flopping on each of the final two questions raised suspicion of cheating. When the footage was reviewed, staff made a connection between Fastest Finger contestant Tecwen Whittock&#x27;s coughing and Ingram&#x27;s answers. The prize was withheld, and police were called in to investigate the matter further.

In March 2003, the Ingrams and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution noted that his coughing stopped upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences. After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram&#x27;s entire game, with coughing sounds amplified. As a joke, Benylin paid to have the first commercial shown during the programme&#x27;s commercial break.

In April 2020, ITV aired a three part drama titled &quot;Quiz&quot; based upon the scandal.

==Other media==
===Merchandise===
Three board game adaptations of the UK &quot;Millionaire&quot; were released by Upstarts in 1998, and a junior edition recommended for younger players was introduced in 2001. The US version also saw two board games of its own, released by Pressman Toy Corporation in 2000. Other &quot;Millionaire&quot; board games have included a game based on the Australian version&#x27;s Hot Seat format, which was released by UGames; a game based on the Italian version released by Hasbro; and a game based on the French version which was released by TF1&#x27;s games division.

An electronic tabletop version of the game was released by Tiger Electronics in 2000. Six different DVD games based on the UK &quot;Millionaire&quot;, featuring Tarrant&#x27;s likeness and voice, were released by Zoo Digital Publishing and Universal Studios Home Entertainment between 2002 and 2008. In 2008, Imagination Games released a DVD game based on the US version, based on the 2004–2008 format and coming complete with Vieira&#x27;s likeness and voice, as well as a quiz book and a 2009 desktop calendar.

===Video game adaptations===
The UK &quot;Millionaire&quot; saw five video game adaptations for personal computers and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast consoles, as well as Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance, produced by Hothouse Creations and Eidos Interactive. Between 1999 and 2001, Jellyvision produced five games based on the US network version for PCs and the PlayStation, all of them featuring Philbin&#x27;s likeness and voice. The first of these adaptations – &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; – was published by Disney Interactive, while the later four were published by Buena Vista Interactive which had just been spun off from DI when it reestablished itself in attempts to diversify its portfolio. Of the five games, three featured general trivia questions, one was sports-themed, and another was a &quot;Kids Edition&quot; featuring easier questions. Eurocom ported the game to the Game Boy Color for the second edition. Two additional US &quot;Millionaire&quot; games were released by Ludia in conjunction with Ubisoft in 2010 and 2011; the first of these was a game for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console and DS handheld system, as well as a PlayStation 3 port of the Wii version, based on the 2008–2010 clock format, with the Wii version offered on the show as a consolation prize to audience contestants during the 2010–2011 season. The second, for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360, was based on the &quot;shuffle format&quot; and was offered as a consolation prize during the next season (2011–2012).

Ludia also made a Facebook game based on &quot;Millionaire&quot; available to players in North America from 2011 to 2016. This game featured an altered version of the &quot;shuffle format&quot;, condensing the number of questions to twelve – eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other &quot;Millionaire&quot; fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no &quot;final answer&quot; rule; the contestant&#x27;s responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as &quot;Jump the Question&quot; lifelines in round one, and to use the &quot;Ask the Audience&quot; lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.

On 29 October 2020, Microids published a video game under the same name and released it on Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

===Scrapped animated spin-off===
In September 2001, Celador signed a deal with DIC Entertainment to produce a cartoon based on the show titled &quot;The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? – The Animated Series&quot;. The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center.

The series was planned to be shown off at MIPCOM that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.

===Disney Parks attraction===
A theme park attraction based on the show, known as &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It!&quot;, appeared at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (when it was known as &quot;Disney-MGM Studios&quot;) at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida and at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California. Both the Florida and California &quot;Play It!&quot; attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004, and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by &quot;Toy Story Midway Mania!&quot;

The format in the &quot;Play It!&quot; attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a &quot;Fastest Finger&quot; question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the &quot;Phone a Friend&quot; lifeline became &quot;Phone a Complete Stranger&quot; which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction&#x27;s theatre who would find a guest to help. After the contestant&#x27;s game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a &quot;Millionaire&quot; CD game, to a three-night Disney Cruise.
==Spin-off==

The Italian version worked in 2008 on a spin-off of the game show called &quot;50–50&quot; (Fifty Fifty). Such a spin-off aired in North Macedonia, Nepal, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Japan, Thailand, Turkey and Egypt.

===50–50===
50–50 was a television game show which offers large cash prizes for correctly answering a series of randomised multiple-choice questions of varying difficulty with two options. The format is a spin-off of the quiz show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and was created by Intellygents, 2waytraffic, Endemol and RTI (Reti Televisive Italiane) company of Mediaset, moreover, was exported and aired in many countries around the world.

====Gameplay====
Unlike the traditional &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, this game is played by a team of two players.

In round 1, the playing pair will answer ten questions. Each question is worth a different random amount, and all the money they win goes into their jackpot. If at any point they get an answer wrong, the value of the jackpot is halved. The team plays together but will answer each question separately.

Only one player in the couple (determined at random) sees the question and its two answers. They will have ten seconds to lock in their answer. After the first player selects an answer, the host turns to the second player and shows them the question and the answer that the first player chose. (They are not shown the answer that their partner turned down.) Player 2 must now decide whether to agree with Player 1&#x27;s answer, or to switch the team&#x27;s answer to the other answer, whatever it may be. If the question is ultimately answered correctly, the value of the question will be added to the bank. Otherwise, the current value of the bank is halved.

In round 2, the host poses five questions to one player of the team in succession. After playing them, the other player would have only seen one of the two choices. Now the second player will look at all five answers and determine how many questions the first player answered correctly. If the player guesses too few or too many, the winnings are reduced to zero.

In the final round, the host asks five questions to one of the two competitors, this will have 10 seconds to answer each question and her partner will on his electronic screen stand the answer. He or she will decide whether to confirm or choose the option that has not been seen. At the end of the questions the contestant who does not see both answers will have to make a prediction of the number of correct answers given. The total prize money can be won only if the forecast is 5 and proves correct, otherwise the part of the prize money that is won will be proportionately less. If the number of correct answers is guessed, the pair win the prize, otherwise they receive the consolation prize.

<doc id="38165" wikidata="Q855691" url="?curid=38165" title="Lingerie">
<text>Lingerie (, , ) is a category of primarily women&#x27;s clothing including undergarments (mainly brassieres), sleepwear, and lightweight robes. The choice of the word is often motivated by an intention to imply that the garments are alluring, fashionable, or both. In a 2015 US survey, 75% of women reported having worn &quot;sexy lingerie&quot; in their lifetime.

Lingerie is made of lightweight, stretchy, smooth, sheer or decorative fabrics such as silk, satin, Lycra, charmeuse, chiffon, or (especially and traditionally) lace. These fabrics can be made of various natural fibres like silk, cotton or of various synthetic fibres such as polyester or nylon.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;lingerie&quot; is a word taken directly from the French language, meaning undergarments, and used exclusively for more lightweight items of female undergarments. The French word in its original form derives from the French word , meaning &#x27;linen&#x27; or &#x27;clothes&#x27;. Informal usage suggests visually appealing or even erotic clothing. Although most lingerie is designed to be worn by women, some manufacturers now design lingerie for men.

== Origins ==

The concept of lingerie as a visually appealing undergarment was developed during the late nineteenth century. Lady Duff-Gordon of Lucile was a pioneer in developing lingerie that freed women from more restrictive corsets. Through the first half of the 20th century, women wore underwear for three primary reasons: to alter their outward shape (first with corsets and later with girdles or brassieres), for hygienic reasons and for modesty. Before the invention of crinoline, women&#x27;s underwear was often very large and bulky.

During the late 19th century, corsets became smaller, less bulky and more constricting and were gradually supplanted by the brassiere, first patented in the 20th century by Caresse Crosby. When the First World War broke out, women found themselves filling in men&#x27;s work roles, creating a demand for more practical undergarments. Manufacturers began to use lighter and more breathable fabrics. In 1935, brassières were updated with padded cups to flatter small breasts and three years later underwire bras were introduced that gave a protruding bustline. There was also a return to a small waist achieved with girdles. The 1940s woman was thin, but had curvaceous hips and breasts that were pointy and shapely. In the 1960s, the female silhouette was liberated along with social mores. The look was adolescent breasts, slim hips, and extreme thinness. André Courrèges was the first to make a fashion statement out of the youth culture when his 1965 collection presented androgynous figures and the image of a modern woman comfortable with her own body.

As the 20th century progressed, underwear became smaller and more form fitting. In the 1960s, lingerie manufacturers such as Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood begin to glamorise lingerie. The lingerie industry expanded in the 21st century with designs that doubled as outerwear. The French refer to this as &#x27;dessous-dessus,&#x27; meaning something akin to innerwear as outerwear.

== Market structure ==

The global lingerie market in 2003 was estimated at $29 billion, while in 2005, bras accounted for 56 per cent of the lingerie market and briefs represented 29 per cent. The United States&#x27;s largest lingerie retailer, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, operates almost exclusively in North America, but the European market is fragmented, with Triumph International and DB Apparel predominant. Also prominent are French lingerie houses, including Chantelle and Aubade.

In March 2020 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported a trend for male lingerie on the catwalk and predictions as to the likelihood of it successfully extending to the high street fashion stores.
==Legality==
The Iranian regime regularly bans vendors who procure and sell imported lingerie dresses.

== Typology ==
* Babydoll, a short nightgown, or negligee, intended as nightwear for women. A shorter style, it is often worn with panties. Babydolls are typically loose-fitting with an empire waist and thin straps.
* Basque, a tight, form-fitting bodice or coat.
* Bloomers, baggy underwear that extends to just below or above the knee. Bloomers were worn for several decades during the first part of the 20th century, but are not widely worn today.
* Bodystocking, a unitard. Bodystockings may be worn over the torso, or they may be worn over the thighs and abdomen.
* Bodysuit ,is a one-piece form-fitting or skin-tight garment that covers the torso and the crotch. The design of a basic bodysuit is similar to a one-piece swimsuit and a leotard, though the materials may vary.
* Bodice, covers the body from the neck to the waist. Bodices are often low cut in the front and high in the back, and are often connected with laces or hooks. Bodices may also be reinforced with steel or bone to provide greater breast support.

* Brassiere, more commonly referred to as a bra, a close-fitting garment that is worn to help lift and support a woman&#x27;s breasts
* Bustier, a form fitting garment used to push up the bust and to shape the waist.
* Camisole, sleeveless and covering the top part of the body. Camisoles are typically constructed of light materials and feature thin spaghetti straps.
* Chemise, a one-piece undergarment that is the same in shape as a straight-hanging sleeveless dress. It is similar to the babydoll, but it is fitted more closely around the hips.
* Corset, a bodice worn to mould and shape the torso. This effect is typically achieved through boning, either of bone or steel.
* Corselet, or merry widow, combined brassiere and girdle. The corselet is considered to be a type of foundation garment, and the modern corselet is most commonly known as a shaping slip.
* G-string, or thong, a type of panty, characterised by a narrow piece of cloth that passes between the buttocks and is attached to a band around the hips. A G-string or thong may be worn as a bikini bottom or as underwear.

* Garter/Garter belt/Suspender belt, used to keep stockings up.
* Girdle, a type of foundation garment. Historically, the girdle extended from the waist to the upper thigh, though modern styles more closely resemble a tight pair of athletic shorts.
* Hosiery, close-fitting, elastic garments that cover the feet and legs.
* Negligee, a dressing gown. It is usually floor length, though it can be knee length as well.
* Nightgown, or nightie, a loosely hanging item of nightwear, may vary from hip-length (babydoll) to floor-length (peignoir).

<text>Avignon (, , ; or , ; ) is the prefecture of the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of southeastern France. Located on the left bank of the river Rhône, the commune had a population of 93,671 as of the census results of 2017, with about 16,000 (estimate from Avignon&#x27;s municipal services) living in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval walls. It is France&#x27;s 35th-largest metropolitan area according to INSEE with 337,039 inhabitants (2020), and France&#x27;s 13th-largest urban unit with 459,533 inhabitants (2020). Its urban area was the fastest-growing in France from 1999 until 2010 with an increase of 76% of its population and an area increase of 136%. The Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Grand Avignon, a cooperation structure of 16 communes, had 197,102 inhabitants in 2022.

Between 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when during the French Revolution it became part of France. The city is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its city walls. This is why Avignon is also known as &quot;&#x27;La Cité des Papes&quot;″ (The City-State of Popes).

The historic centre, which includes the , the cathedral and the Pont d&#x27;Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 because of its architecture and importance during the 14th and 15th centuries. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d&#x27;Avignonone of the world&#x27;s largest festivals for performing artshave helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.

== Toponymy ==
The earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: &quot;Aueniṑn&quot; (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and &quot;Aouenníōn&quot; (Ptolemy II, x).

The Roman name &quot;Avennĭo Cavărum&quot; (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. &quot;Avignon of Cavares&quot;, accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.

The current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme &quot;ab-ên&quot; with the suffix &quot;-i-ōn(e)&quot;. This theme would be a hydronym—i.e. a name linked to the river (Rhône), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the &quot;Rocher des Doms&quot;).

The &quot;Auenion&quot; of the 1st century BC was Latinized to &quot;Avennĭo&quot; (or &quot;Avēnĭo&quot;), &quot;-ōnis&quot; in the 1st century and is written &quot;Avinhon&quot; in classic Occitan spelling or &quot;Avignoun&quot; in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called &quot;avinhonencs&quot; or &quot;avignounen&quot; in both standard Occitan and Provençal dialect.

== History ==
== Geography ==
Avignon is on the left bank of the Rhône river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about south-east of Paris, south of Lyon and north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rhône and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Châteaurenard, and Noves.

The city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), Nîmes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Morières-lès-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.

=== Geology and terrain ===
The region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current city walls, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called &quot;mollasse burdigalienne&quot;.

Enclosed by the city walls, the &quot;Rocher des Doms&quot; is a limestone elevation of &quot;Urgonian&quot; type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the &quot;Massif des Angles&quot;, &quot;Villeneuve-lès-Avignon&quot;, &quot;Alpilles&quot;...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Provençal basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.

The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill—a wooded hill in the east of the commune.

The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the &quot;Île de la Barthelasse&quot;, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.

In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.

=== Hydrography ===

The Rhone passes the western edge of the city, but is divided into two branches: the &quot;Petit Rhône&quot;, or &quot;dead arm&quot;, for the part that passes next to Avignon and the &quot;Grand Rhône&quot;, or &quot;live arm&quot;, for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-lès-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the Île de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the Île de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L&#x27;Île de Piot.

The banks of the Rhone and the Île de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication &quot;Floods in France since the 6th century until today – research and documentation&quot; by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943–1944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today—such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.

The Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rhône. It is a river that is considered &quot;capricious&quot; and once feared for its floods (it was once called the &quot;3rd scourge of Provence&quot; as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.

There are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.

==== Artificial diversions ====
There have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.

In the 10th century part of the waters from the &quot;Sorgue d&#x27;Entraigues&quot; were diverted and today pass under the walls to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the &quot;Sorgue&quot; or &quot;Sorguette&quot;. It is visible in the city in the &quot;Rue des teinturiers&quot; (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first defensive walls then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the &quot;Durançole&quot;. The &quot;Durançole&quot; fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city, these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage. 

The Hospital Canal (joining the Durançole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Vedène. They were divided into numerous &quot;fioles&quot; or &quot;filioles&quot; (in Provençal &quot;filhòlas&quot; or &quot;fiolo&quot;). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon, the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt. 

All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.

=== Seismicity ===
Under the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.

&quot;The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.&quot;

The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.

=== Climate ===
Avignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. The city experiences mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: &quot;Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa&quot; (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).

The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 42.8 °C on 28 June 2019 and the record lowest was −14.5 °C on 2 February 1956.

==== The mistral ====
The prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. &quot;Normal&quot; corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.

=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===
Avignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Morières-lès-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.

=== Area and population ===
The city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:

== Economy ==
Avignon is the seat of the &quot;Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse&quot; which manages the Avignon–Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.

Avignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.

The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).

A Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.

=== Areas of economic activity ===
There are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.

The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.

Then comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.

The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or &quot;Technopole Agroparc&quot;). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.

Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs—i.e. 100 more than Cristole.

=== Tourism ===
Four million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its Festival d&#x27;Avignon. In 2011 the most visited tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d&#x27;Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.
River tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the Île de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

=== Agriculture ===
The city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean Tomato, the World Council of the Tomato Industry, and the Inter-Rhône organisation.

=== Industry ===
Only EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and &quot;Onet Propreté&quot; with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.

=== Public sector (excluding government) ===
The Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.

=== Employment ===
In 2017 the unemployment rate was 26.0% while it was 20.7% in 2007. There are 38,731 people in the Avignon workforce: 102 (0.3%) agricultural workers, 2,194 (5.7%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 5,598 (14.5%) managers and intellectuals, 8,486 (21.9%) middle managers, 11,734 (30.3%) employees, and 9,247 (23.9%) workers.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Avignon is close to two motorways:
*the A7 autoroute (E714) is a north–south axis on which there are two exits: Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);
*the A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.

The main roads are:
* Route nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins
* The D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue
* The D62 which goes north-east to Vedène
* The D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-lès-Avignon
* The D901 which goes south-east to Morières-lès-Avignon
* Route nationale N570 which goes south to Rognonas

=== Railways ===
Avignon is served by two railway stations: the historic station built in 1860, the &quot;Gare d&#x27;Avignon-Centre&quot;, just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the &quot;Gare d&#x27;Avignon TGV&quot; in the &#x27;Courtine&#x27; district south of the city, on the LGV Méditerranée line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line—the &quot;Virgule&quot;. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.

=== Airports ===
The Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England. The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.

=== Water transport ===
The Rhône has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the city walls and the opposite bank (the île de la Barthelasse).

=== Public transport ===
Tecelys via the &quot;Orizo network&quot; is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. Tecelys operates bus services (including BRT named &quot;Chron&#x27;hop&quot;), as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first opened in October 2019.

== Cultural heritage ==
Avignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (177) that are registered as historical monuments.
In the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lycée Frédéric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la République, date from the Second Empire (1852–70) with Haussmann façades and amenities around Place de l&#x27;Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.


Listed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:

* Notre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334), within the cathedral, is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.
* (&quot;Papal Palace&quot;) (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is a monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.
* Minor churches of the town include three built in the Gothic architectural style:
** Church of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful façade and richly carved doors;
** Church of Saint-Didier (14th century); and
** Church of Saint-Agricol (14th century).
* Other religious buildings:
** Church of Saint-Symphorien (14th century, former Carmelite monastery church).
** Church of Montfavet (14th century).
** Chapel of the Oratory.
** Chapel of the White penitents (16th century).
** Chapel of the Grey penitents (18th century).
** Chapel of the Black penitents.
** Synagogue (19th century).
* Civic buildings are represented most notably by:
** The Hôtel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,
** The old &quot;Hôtel des Monnaies&quot;, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.
** Hospital Sainte-Marthe.
** Hotel of Saint-Priest (Hotel de Monery, 18th century).
** House of King René (15th century).
* The city walls, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.
* Bridges include:
** The &quot;Pont Saint-Bénézet&quot;, better known as the &quot;Pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot; and for the French song &quot;Sur le pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-Bénézet.
** The &quot;Pont Édouard Daladier&quot; and the &quot;Pont de Royaume&quot;, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, thus replacing the &quot;Pont Saint-Bénézet&quot;
** The &quot;Pont de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.
** Two railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris–Marseille line and the other the LGV Méditerranée line
* Calvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.
* The town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple—and is still an important tool—of the local cloth trade in the area.
* Musée du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many &quot;primitives&quot; from the collection of Giampietro Campana.
* The &quot;Hotel d&#x27;Europe&quot;, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.
* The &quot;Collection Lambert&quot;, houses contemporary art exhibitions
* The &quot;Musée Angladon&quot; exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum
* &quot;Musée Lapidaire&quot;, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.
* &quot;Musée Louis-Vouland&quot;
* &quot;Musée Requien&quot;
* &quot;Palais du Roure&quot;
* &quot;Les Halles&quot; is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.
* The &quot;Place Pie&quot; is a small square near Place de l&#x27;Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.
* Note: the name of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1907 painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (&quot;The Young Ladies of Avignon&quot;) is misleading; Picasso&#x27;s models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d&#x27;Avinyó (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.

The commune houses more than 500 historical objects, many of which are religious.

=== Avignon Festival ===

A theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Festival d&#x27;Avignon (Avignon Festival) comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making use of the town&#x27;s historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal &quot;Festival In&quot;, which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian &quot;Festival Off&quot;, which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.

Avignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.

=== International Congress Centre ===
The centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes&#x27; Palace.

=== &quot;Sur le Pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot; ===
Avignon is commemorated by the French song &#x27;Sur le Pont d&#x27;Avignon&#x27; (&#x27;On the bridge of Avignon&#x27;), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Opéra comique &quot;Le Sourd ou l&#x27;Auberge Pleine&quot;, which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.

The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-Bénézet over the Rhône, of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some , but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.

== Sport ==
Sporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.

AC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after the 2010–2011 season competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.

== Education ==
The schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Académie d&#x27;Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (&quot;Écoles maternelles&quot;) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (&quot;Écoles élémentaires&quot;) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.

=== University of Avignon ===

==== University before the Revolution ====
The medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university&#x27;s formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.

In 1413 Pope John XXIII founded the university&#x27;s department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).

The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university&#x27;s existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.

==== Modern university ====
A university annex of the &quot;Faculté des Sciences d&#x27;Aix-Marseille&quot; was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the &quot;Université d&#x27;Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse&quot; was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city walls. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the &quot;Hôpital Sainte-Marthe&quot;. The main building has an elegant façade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son François in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009–2010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.

<text>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV; ; ), also known by its anglicized name Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania, is a state in the north-east of Germany. Of the country&#x27;s sixteen states, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ranks 14th in population; it covers an area of , making it the sixth largest German state in area; and it is 16th in population density. Schwerin is the state capital and Rostock is the largest city. Other major cities include Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wismar, and Güstrow. It was named after the two regions of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania (German: Vinterpommern)

The state was established in 1945 after World War II through the merger of the historic regions of Mecklenburg and Prussian Western Pomerania by the Soviet military administration in Allied-occupied Germany. It became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms and its territory divided into the districts of Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was re-established in 1990 following German reunification and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.

On the state&#x27;s coastline on the Baltic Sea are many holiday resorts and much unspoilt nature, including the islands of Rügen, Usedom, and others, as well as the Mecklenburg Lake District, making the state one of Germany&#x27;s leading tourist destinations. Three of Germany&#x27;s fourteen national parks, as well as several hundred nature conservation areas, are in the state. The University of Rostock, founded in 1419, and the University of Greifswald, established in 1456, are among the oldest universities in Europe. In 2007, the 33rd G8 summit took place at the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm on the Mecklenburg Baltic coast during the chancellorship of Angela Merkel, who represented various constituencies of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the national legislature, the Bundestag.

==Name==
Due to its lengthy name, the state is often abbreviated as &quot;MV&quot; or (colloquially) shortened to &quot;MeckPomm&quot;. In English, it is usually called &quot;Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania&quot; or less frequently &quot;Mecklenburg–Cispomerania.&quot; Inhabitants are called either &quot;Mecklenburger&quot; or &quot;Pomeranians&quot;; the combined form is never used.

The place name &quot;Vorpommern&quot; derives from West Slavic languages. The prefix &quot;po-&quot; means &quot;along&quot; or &quot;at&quot;, and the base word &quot;more&quot; means &quot;sea&quot;, so that together &quot;po more&quot; means &quot;Land at the Sea&quot;. The German prefix &quot;vor-&quot; denotes a closer location; from the German point of view, this is the near part of Pomerania.

The full name in German is pronounced . Sometimes, &quot;Mecklenburg&quot; is pronounced , because the digraph marks a preceding short vowel in High German. However, Mecklenburg is within the historical Low German language area, and the appeared in its name during the period of transition to Standard, High German usage (Low German authors wrote the name &quot;Meklenborg&quot; or &quot;Męklenborg&quot;, depicting proper Low German pronunciation, which itself was a syncope of Middle Low German &quot;Mekelenborg&quot;). The introduction of the is explained as follows: Either the signals the stretched pronunciation of the preceding (&quot;Dehnungs-c&quot;), or it signals the pronunciation of the subsequent as an occlusive to prevent it from falsely being rendered as a fricative following a Low German trend. Another explanation is that the comes from a mannerism in High German officialese of writing unnecessary letters, a so-called &quot;Letternhäufelung&quot; (, as was done sometimes in English with words such as &quot;doubt&quot;).

==History==

In the aftermath of the Second World War and German reunification in 1990, the state was constituted from the historic region of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania, both of which had long and rich independent histories.

===Prehistory===
Human settlement in the area of modern Mecklenburg and Vorpommern began after the Ice Age, about 10,000 BC. About two thousand years ago, Germanic peoples were recorded in the area. Most of them left during the Migration Period, heading towards Spain, Italy, and France, leaving the area relatively deserted. In the sixth century Polabian Slavs populated the area. While Mecklenburg was settled by the Obotrites, Pomerania was settled by the Veleti (later &quot;Liuticians&quot;) and the Rani.

Along the coast, Vikings and Slavs established trade posts like Reric, Ralswiek and Menzlin. In the early 12th century, Hither Pomerania passed under Polish suzerainty under Bolesław III Wrymouth, who initiated Christianization, entrusting this task to Otto of Bamberg. In the late 12th century, Mecklenburg and Hither Pomerania were conquered by Henry the Lion and briefly incorporated into the Duchy of Saxony, joining the Holy Roman Empire in the 1180s. Parts of Mecklenburg and Pomerania were settled with Germans in the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; process, starting in the 12th century.

===Mecklenburg===

In the late 12th century, Henry the Lion, Duke of the Saxons, conquered the Obotrites, subjugated its Nikloting dynasty, and Christianized its people. In the course of time, German monks, nobility, peasants and traders arrived to settle here. After the 12th century, the territory remained stable and relatively independent of its neighbours; one of the few German territories for which this is true. Mecklenburg first became a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in 1348. Though later partitioned and re-partitioned within the same dynasty, Mecklenburg always shared a common history and identity. The states of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz became Grand Duchies in 1815, and in 1870 they voluntarily joined the new German Empire, while retaining their own internal autonomy. After the First World War and the abdication of the German Kaiser, the monarchies of the duchies were abolished and republican governments of both Mecklenburg states were established, until the Nazi government merged the two states into a unified , a virtually meaningless administrative decision under the centralised regime.

===Western Pomerania===


Vorpommern, literally Fore-Pomerania, is the smaller, western part of the former Prussian Province of Pomerania; the eastern part became part of Poland after the end of World War II.

Since the Middle Ages, the area was ruled by the Pomeranian dukes as part of the Duchy of Pomerania, at various times under Polish, Danish and Imperial suzerainty. Fore Pomerania was under Swedish rule after the Peace of Westphalia from 1648 until 1815 as Swedish Pomerania. Fore Pomerania became a province of Prussia in 1815 and remained so until 1945.

===Mecklenburg-Vorpommern===
====Wartime====
In May 1945, the armies of the Soviet Union and the Western allies met east of Schwerin. Following the Potsdam Agreement, the Western allies handed over Mecklenburg to the Soviets. Mecklenburg-West Pomerania was established on 9 July 1945, by order No. 5 of Red Army Marshal Georgy Zhukov, head of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD), as the &quot;Province of Mecklenburg and West Pomerania (zapadnoi Pomeranii)&quot;.
During the war, the make-up of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern&#x27;s population changed, due to wartime losses and the influx of evacuees (mainly from the Berlin and Hamburg metropolitan areas that were subject to air raids). After the war, people who fled and were expelled from the former eastern territories of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line settled in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (and elsewhere in Germany), increasing the population by 40%. Before the war, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania had a population of 1,278,700, of whom many perished during the war and others moved west in the course of the Red Army&#x27;s advance. In 1947, some 1,426,000 refugees from the former eastern parts of Germany were counted. Most of them settled in rural communities, but the urban population also increased, most notably in Schwerin from 65,000 (1939) to 99,518 (January 1947), in Wismar from 29,463 to 44,173, and in Greifswald from 29,488 to 43,897. Western Pomerania was additionally stripped of the area around the Pomeranian regional capital Stettin/Szczecin as well as the city itself, despite its location to the west of the river Oder.

====German Democratic Republic====

On 5 June 1946, a law enacted by the Soviets constituted a provisional German administration (&quot;Beratende Versammlung&quot;, ) under Soviet supervision on 29 June 1946. After elections on 20 October 1946, a &quot;Landtag&quot; replaced the &quot;Beratende Versammlung&quot; and created the constitution of 16 January 1947, for the &quot;Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&quot;. On 18 April 1947, the state&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Land Mecklenburg&quot;. Mecklenburg became a constituent state (&quot;Land&quot;) of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) upon its formation in 1949. In 1952, the East German government abandoned the term &quot;Land&quot; in this context and redesignated its administrative territorial divisions as &quot;districts&quot; (German: &quot;Bezirke&quot;). The territory of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern was divided into three districts that covered roughly the same area: &quot;Bezirk Rostock&quot;, &quot;Bezirk Schwerin&quot; and &quot;Bezirk Neubrandenburg&quot;. These were commonly known as the &quot;Nordbezirke&quot; (northern districts) under the highly centralised GDR government. The East German government developed the shipyards in the old Hanseatic ports (the largest being in Rostock and Stralsund), and also established the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant in Lubmin near Greifswald.

====Reunification====
At the time of German reunification in 1990, the eastern states were reconstituted along their postwar boundaries (with minor adjustments) as they had existed until 1952, and the historic name Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was restored. Since 1990, the state has undergone dramatic changes. What had been largely an industrial and agricultural economy is increasingly driven by the service, tourism, and high-tech sectors. The old towns, hundreds of castles and manors, resort buildings, windmills, churches, and various other cultural monuments of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have been renovated in recent years. Since 2013, net migration into the state has been positive again.

==Geography==


===Location and urban areas===

Sixth-largest in area and fourteenth in overall population among Germany&#x27;s sixteen Bundesländer (federal states), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is bounded to the north by the Baltic Sea, to the west by Schleswig-Holstein, to the southwest by Lower Saxony, to the south by Brandenburg, and to the east by the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&#x27;s state capital is Schwerin. The largest city is Rostock with approximately 205,000 people, followed by Schwerin. Other major cities include Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wismar and Güstrow.

===Districts===

Since 4 September 2011, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is divided into six &quot;Kreise&quot; (districts):

# Landkreis Rostock
# Ludwigslust-Parchim
# Mecklenburgische Seenplatte
# Nordwestmecklenburg
# Vorpommern-Greifswald
# Vorpommern-Rügen
Also counting two independent urban districts:
# Rostock (HRO)
# Schwerin (SN)

===Landscape===
The state&#x27;s Baltic Sea coast is about long and features several islands, most notably Germany&#x27;s two biggest islands Rügen and Usedom, but also a number of smaller islands such as Hiddensee and Poel. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&#x27;s varied coastline also has many peninsulas such as Fischland-Darß-Zingst and various lagoons (also known as &quot;Bodden&quot; or &quot;Haff&quot;).

A total of 283 nature reserves, 110 landscape reserves and three of Germany&#x27;s fourteen national parks are scattered all over the state.

====Lakes====

The southern part of the state is characterized by a multitude of lakes within the Mecklenburg Lakeland, the largest of which is Lake Müritz (also the largest German lake), followed by Lake Schwerin, Plauer See and Lake Kummerow. The &quot;land of a thousand lakes&quot; (German: &quot;Land der tausend Seen&quot;) is hallmarked by its unspoilt nature. Due to its clean air and idyllic setting, medical tourism has become a notable tourism sector in the region.

====National parks====
==Culture==
Over the centuries, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have developed and maintained strong regional cultures. It can generally be described as North German and has similar linguistic and historic characteristics to other north German states, such as Schleswig-Holstein. People in Vorpommern, as a result of that territory being a former province of Prussia, tend to look slightly more towards Berlin and Brandenburg than people in Mecklenburg would.

===Architecture===
The cities are characterised by a certain &quot;Hanseatic&quot; style also found in other parts of northern Germany (e.g. Lübeck) as well as in countries bordering the Baltic Sea like Estonia (e.g. Tallinn) or Latvia (e.g. Riga). A common feature of many towns in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern are red Brick Gothic churches and houses dating back to the Middle Ages. Also stepped and tailed gables are a typical feature of the Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar and Greifswald.

The old towns are usually built around one or several market places with a church or the town hall. Often towns were founded at the Baltic Sea, one of the many lakes or a river for logistical and trade motives.

Rural areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are often characterized by Brick Gothic village churches and agricultural heritage, like brick homesteads, thatched roof houses, windmills, manor houses and castles.

===Museums, art and theatres===

The largest publicly funded theatres in the state are the Mecklenburg State Theatre, the Rostock People&#x27;s Theatre, the Theatre of West Pomerania, with venues in Stralsund, Putbus and Greifswald, and the Mecklenburg State Theatre of Neustrelitz with venues in Neubrandenburg and Neustrelitz. All four theatres offer both drama and musical theatre as well as orchestral music.
Other important theatres are the Ernst Barlach Theatre of Güstrow, the Theatre of Parchim, the Anklam Theatre and the Wismar Theatre.
There are also many small theatres on the Baltic coast and in individual artist&#x27;s villages and resorts (e.g. the popular concert pavilions at the Baltic Sea). Since its growing importance for summer tourism, open-air theatres and festivals become more common again as well, such as the Störtebeker Festival on the island of Rügen, and the &quot;Vineta Festival&quot; on Usedom.

Since 1993, the Störtebeker Festival has taken place in Ralswiek on the island of Rügen. It is Germany&#x27;s most successful open-air theatre.

Notable museums include, for example, the Schwerin State Museum and the Pomeranian State Museum at Greifswald. The German Oceanographic Museum with its Ozeaneum in Stralsund is the most popular museum in northern Germany. Furthermore, the German Amber Museum in Ribnitz-Damgarten, Rostock&#x27;s Abbey of the Holy Cross and Rostock Art Gallery are of national importance. The oldest museum in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is Stralsund&#x27;s Cultural History Museum, the smallest is the Professor Wandschneider Sculpture Museum in Plau am See.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is home to many cultural events throughout the year. During summer, many open-air concerts and operas are open to visitors. The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival (&quot;Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&quot;) attracts a sizeable audience by performing classical concerts in parks, churches and castles.

Caspar David Friedrich, a famous romanticist painter born in Greifswald, immortalised parts of the state in several of his paintings.

===Language===

Today the vast majority of people speak Standard German; a few centuries ago most people spoke Low German (German: &quot;Plattdeutsch&quot; or &quot;Niederdeutsch&quot;), a language that is still kept alive within various communities and cultural events.

===Food and drinks===

Like most German regions, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have their own traditional dishes, often including fish, beef and pork. Rostock has its own type of bratwurst called &quot;Rostocker Bratwurst&quot;. A famous dish from Western Pomerania is Bismarck Herring. Rote Grütze is a popular dessert. The largest beer breweries are &quot;Mecklenburgische Brauerei Lübz&quot; (Lübzer Pils), &quot;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock&quot;, &quot;Darguner Brauerei&quot; and &quot;Störtebeker Braumanufaktur&quot; (Stralsund, multiple winner of the World Beer Cup). Besides, there are many smaller breweries and craft beer variations, such as the &quot;Mellenthin Castle Beer&quot; from Usedom Island.

===Religion===
As of 2020, the majority (82.4%) of the citizens of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are not religious or adhere to other religions. 14.2% are members of the Protestant Church in Germany and 3.4% of the Catholic Church.

Following the Reformation, led in Germany by Martin Luther, as well as a period of Swedish rule, the traditional faith in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is Protestantism, specifically Lutheranism. There are also a number of Catholics and people of other faiths.

In May 2012 the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg merged with North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church and Pomeranian Evangelical Church into the new Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.
Some parishes of the state belong to Evangelical Church of Berlin and Brandenburg.

There are also Jewish communities, in the state capital of Schwerin (including Wismar) and in the city of Rostock. Historically, there were also synagogues in smaller towns, of which some are still preserved (like Röbel, Krakow am See and Boizenburg). The state&#x27;s Jewish organisation is part of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.

===Immigration===
Largest groups of foreign residents by 31 December 2023:
===Vital statistics===
*Births from January to September 2016 = 10,224
*Births from January to September 2017 = 9,836
*Deaths from January to September 2016 = 15,251
*Deaths from January to September 2017 = 15,532
*Natural growth from January to September 2016 = -5,027
*Natural growth from January to September 2017 = -5,696

==Education==

===Universities and colleges===
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has the two oldest universities of the Baltic Sea region, also among the oldest of Germany and all of Europe:
*University of Greifswald (established 1456)
*University of Rostock (established 1419)

Also, there are further colleges / technological universities:
*Fachhochschule des Mittelstands (FHM) in Rostock and Schwerin (private)
*Rostock University of Music and Theatre
*Hochschule Wismar (&quot;University of Applied Sciences: Technology, Business and Design&quot;)
*Hochschule Stralsund (&quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot;)
*Hochschule Neubrandenburg (&quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot;)
*Fachhochschule für öffentliche Verwaltung, Rechtspflege und Polizei Güstrow (&quot;University of Administration, Judicature and Police in Güstrow&quot;)
*Hochschule der Bundesagentur für Arbeit with its Schwerin campus
*DesignSchule Schwerin with options to study design (private; game/fashion/media/web design)

===Schools===
The state&#x27;s school system is centralised. There are two main types of schools, &quot;Regionalschule&quot; (for the majority of pupils) and &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (for the top 30% of each year&#x27;s students, leading to the university entrance qualification &quot;Abitur&quot;). Besides, there are also independent schools, comprehensive schools and trade schools.

==Politics==

Article 20 of the State Constitution states that the Landtag is the &quot;site of political decision-making&quot;. The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Landtag is elected democratically by the citizens of the state and sits for a 5-year legislative period. The seat of the Landtag is located at Schwerin Palace in Schwerin. The essential functions of the Landtag are to elect the Minister-President of the state; to discuss and decide on laws which have been proposed by the government, by any four members of the Landtag, or a people&#x27;s initiative or petition for a referendum initiated directly by the people; and to control the state government.

===Minister-President===
The executive is led by a cabinet, in turn led by a Minister-President, who is the official head of state and government. The election to determine the Minister-President is held no later than four weeks after the newly elected Landtag is convened.

===Landtag===
The last election of the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern took place on 26 September 2021. The SPD won a landslide plurality of almost 40% of votes, a nine percentage point increase from 2016. The opposition Alternative for Germany (AfD) remained the second largest party but declined to under 17%. The CDU recorded its worst ever result in the state with 13.3%, while The Left also declined to 10%. Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) both won around 6% of votes and re-entered the Landtag after previously falling out in 2016 and 2011, respectively.

The Landtag has been led by Minister President Manuela Schwesig since 2017.
On 13 October 2021, Schwesig announced the SPD would enter coalition talks with The Left. She stated her motivations for reorienting the coalition as a desire for &quot;a new departure&quot;, and described The Left as a &quot;social, pragmatic party&quot; with decisive policy overlap with the SPD. She said that The Left had been a reliable partner to the government even while in opposition, and had assumed &quot;state-political responsibility&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 5 November 2021, the SPD and The Left agreed to a coalition government and plan to form a cabinet, which is to be approved by each party-congress by mid-November.

==Economy==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 44.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.3% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,400 euros or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the lowest of all German states.

===Labour market===
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is the least densely populated and least industrial German state, being the sixth largest in area, but only the 14th in population. Formerly, unemployment has been negatively affected by the breakdown of non-competitive former GDR industries after the German reunification in the 1990s. As of 2018 unemployment is the lowest in more than 15 years while the economy is growing and the number of jobs is increasing continually. Growing sectors are biotechnology, information technology, life sciences, maritime industry and tourist services.

In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, approximately 732,200 people were gainfully employed in 2008 with 657,100 of them were white and blue collar workers. About 4,200 new jobs were created in 2007. Employees worked an average of 1,455 hours a year. The number of self-employed did not change in 2008. Three out of every four of all workers are employed in the service sector. In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 7.1% and was the third highest rate in Germany.
===Tourism===
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is the top destination for intra-German tourism and is gaining importance for international tourism.
The main tourist regions are:
*Islands: Rugia and Usedom (Germany&#x27;s two largest islands), Poel and Hiddensee;

As a reminder of its rich history, nearly 2,000 castles, palaces and manor houses exist in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, many of which are used as venues for public events like concerts and festivals, such as Festspiele MV (a classical music festival).

Medical tourism based on the clean air and idyllic settings by the Baltic Sea has a growing importance to the regional tourism industry.

<doc id="38170" wikidata="Q255155" url="?curid=38170" title="Bi-curious">
<text>Bi-curious (sometimes bicurious) is a term for a person, usually someone who is a self-identified heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly heterosexual or mostly homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms &quot;heteroflexible&quot; and &quot;homoflexible&quot; are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the &quot;wish to experiment with sexuality&quot; implied by the bi-curious label. It is important when discussing this continuum to conclude that bisexuality is distinct from heterosexuality and homosexuality rather than simply an extension of said sexualities like the labels &quot;heteroflexibility&quot; and &quot;homoflexibility&quot; would imply, due to the prominent erasure and assimilation of bisexuality into other identity groups. To sum it up, the difference between bisexual and bicurious is that bisexual people know that they are sexually attracted to both genders based on personal experience. Bicurious people are still maneuvering their way through their sexuality.

Bi-curious is not to be confused with forms of sexual fluidity, defined as a &quot;capacity for situation-dependent flexibility in sexual responsiveness,&quot; as bi-curious implies the existence of one set sexuality for the individual who carries the label, even if it is currently unknown, rather than an acknowledgment that the individual&#x27;s sexual preference has changed and will continue to change that comes with sexual fluidity.

== Bi-curiosity and other non-monosexual identities ==
Standard theories of bi-sexuality make use of the term bisexual umbrella to encompass multiple other non-monosexual identities (sexual identities that allow for multiple gender identity possibilities in partners) that are possible outcomes of exploration for bi-curious people. However, similar on the surface, bisexuality and the subsequent elements of its umbrella are distinct, thus leading to the possibility that a currently bi-curious person may end up as neither bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual, but another non-monosexual identity altogether. This umbrella can be better broken into binary and non-binary sexual identities, with bisexuality being a &#x27;binary&#x27; sexual identity, meaning it is an attraction to men conventionally and women conventionally (a combination of the binary sexual attractions of homosexual and heterosexual). At the same time, pansexuality is a non-binary sexual identity because it is an attraction to an individual regardless of what gender identity they label themselves, including men, women, non-binary people, gender-fluid people, and more. The relevance to a bi-curious person is at what range does their exploration end; have they found that their sexual attraction ends with both men and women (binary sexual attraction), or do they find themselves attracted to individuals regardless of their gender identity (non-binary sexual attraction).

== Etymology ==
The term started becoming popular after 1984, according to Merriam-Webster, but &quot;The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&quot; and &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&#x27; Lexico&quot; claim that the term was coined in 1990. According to Dictionary.com, the term was first used between 1980 and 1985.

<doc id="38172" wikidata="Q7314" url="?curid=38172" title="Igor Stravinsky">
<text>Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky ( – 6 April 1971) was a Russian composer and conductor with French citizenship (from 1934) and American citizenship (from 1945). He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century and a pivotal figure in modernist music.

Born to a musical family in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Stravinsky grew up taking piano and music theory lessons. While studying law at the University of Saint Petersburg, he met Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and studied music under him until the latter&#x27;s death in 1908. Stravinsky met the impresario Sergei Diaghilev soon after, who commissioned the composer to write three ballets for the Ballets Russes&#x27;s Paris seasons: &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1910), &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911), and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913), the last of which caused a near-riot at the premiere due to its avant-garde nature and later changed the way composers understood rhythmic structure.

Stravinsky&#x27;s compositional career is often divided into three main periods: his Russian period (1913–1920), his neoclassical period (1920–1951), and his serial period (1954–1968). During his Russian period, Stravinsky was heavily influenced by Russian styles and folklore. Works such as &quot;Renard&quot; (1916) and (1923) drew upon Russian folk poetry, while compositions like (1918) integrated these folk elements with popular musical forms, including the tango, waltz, ragtime, and chorale. His neoclassical period exhibited themes and techniques from the classical period, like the use of the sonata form in his Octet (1923) and use of Greek mythological themes in works including (1927), &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; (1927), and &quot;Persephone&quot; (1935). In his serial period, Stravinsky turned towards compositional techniques from the Second Viennese School like Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique. &quot;In Memoriam Dylan Thomas&quot; (1954) was the first of his compositions to be fully based on the technique, and (1956) was his first to be based on a tone row. Stravinsky&#x27;s last major work was the &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot; (1966), which was performed at his funeral.

While many supporters were confused by Stravinsky&#x27;s constant stylistic changes, later writers recognized his versatile language as important in the development of modernist music. Stravinsky&#x27;s revolutionary ideas influenced composers as diverse as Aaron Copland, Philip Glass, Béla Bartók, and Pierre Boulez, who were all challenged to innovate music in areas beyond tonality, especially rhythm and musical form. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed Stravinsky as one of the 100 most influential people of the century. Stravinsky died of pulmonary edema on 6 April 1971 in New York City, having left six memoirs written with his friend and assistant Robert Craft, as well as an earlier autobiography and a series of lectures.

== Life ==

=== Early life in Russia, 1882–1901 ===

Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky was born in Oranienbaum, Russia—a town now called Lomonosov, about thirty miles (fifty kilometers) west of Saint Petersburg—on . His mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (née Kholodovskaya), was an amateur singer and pianist from an established family of landowners. His father, Fyodor Ignatyevich Stravinsky, was a famous bass at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, descended from a line of Polish landowners. The name &quot;Stravinsky&quot; is of Polish origin, deriving from the Strava river in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The family was originally called &quot;Soulima-Stravinsky&quot;, bearing the Soulima arms, but &quot;Soulima&quot; was dropped after Russia&#x27;s annexation during the partitions of Poland.

Oranienbaum, the composer&#x27;s birthplace, was where his family vacationed during summers; their primary residence was an apartment along the Kryukov Canal in central Saint Petersburg, near the Mariinsky Theatre. Stravinsky was baptized hours after birth and joined to the Russian Orthodox Church in St. Nicholas Cathedral. Constantly in fear of his short-tempered father and indifferent towards his mother, Igor lived there for the first 27 years of his life with three siblings: Roman and Yury, his older siblings who irritated him immensely, and Gury, his close younger brother with whom he said he found &quot;the love and understanding denied us by our parents&quot;. Igor was educated by the family&#x27;s governess until age eleven, when he began attending the Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium, a school he recalled hating because he had few friends.

From age nine, Stravinsky studied privately with a piano teacher. He later wrote that his parents saw no musical talent in him due to his lack of technical skills; the young pianist frequently improvised instead of practicing assigned pieces. Stravinsky&#x27;s excellent sight-reading skill prompted him to frequently read vocal scores from his father&#x27;s vast personal library. At around age ten, he began regularly attending performances at the Mariinsky Theatre, where he was introduced to Russian repertoire as well as Italian and French opera; by sixteen, he attended rehearsals at the theater five or six days a week. By age fourteen, Stravinsky had mastered the solo part of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1, and at age fifteen, he transcribed for solo piano a string quartet by Alexander Glazunov.

=== Higher education, 1901–1909 ===

==== Student compositions ====

Despite his musical passion and ability, Stravinsky&#x27;s parents expected him to study law at the University of Saint Petersburg, and he enrolled there in 1901. However, according to his own account, he was a bad student and attended few of the optional lectures. In exchange for agreeing to attend law school, his parents allowed for lessons in harmony and counterpoint. At university, Stravinsky befriended Vladimir Rimsky-Korsakov, son of the leading Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. During summer vacation of 1902, Stravinsky traveled with Vladimir Rimsky-Korsakov to Heidelberg – where the latter&#x27;s family was staying – bringing a portfolio of pieces to demonstrate to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. While the elder composer was not stunned, he was impressed enough to insist that Stravinsky continue lessons but advised against him entering the Saint Petersburg Conservatory due to its rigorous environment. Importantly, Rimsky-Korsakov agreed personally to advise Stravinsky on his compositions.

After Stravinsky&#x27;s father died in 1902 and the young composer became more independent, he became increasingly involved in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s circle of artists. His first major task from his new teacher was the four-movement Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor in the style of Glazunov and Tchaikovsky – he paused temporarily to write a cantata for Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration, which the elder composer described as &quot;not bad&quot;. Soon after finishing the sonata, the student began his large-scale Symphony in E-flat, the first draft of which he finished in 1905. That year, the dedicatee of the Piano Sonata, Nikolay Richter, performed it at a recital hosted by the Rimsky-Korsakovs, marking the first public premiere of a Stravinsky piece.

After the events of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 caused the university to close, Stravinsky was not able to take his final exams, resulting in his graduation with a half-diploma. As he began spending more time in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s circle of artists, the young composer became increasingly cramped in the stylistically conservative atmosphere: modern music was questioned, and concerts of contemporary music were looked down upon. The group occasionally attended chamber concerts oriented to modern music, and while Rimsky-Korsakov and his colleague Anatoly Lyadov hated attending, Stravinsky remembered the concerts as intriguing and intellectually stimulating, being the first place he was exposed to French composers like Franck, Dukas, Fauré, and Debussy. Nevertheless, Stravinsky remained loyal to Rimsky-Korsakov – the musicologist Eric Walter White suspected that the composer believed compliance with Rimsky-Korsakov was necessary to succeed in the Russian music world. Stravinsky later wrote that his teachers&#x27; musical conservatism was justified, and helped him build the foundation that would become the base of his style.

==== First marriage ====
In August 1905, Stravinsky announced his engagement to Yekaterina Nosenko, his first cousin whom he had met in 1890 during a family trip. He later recalled:From our first hour together we both seemed to realize that we would one day marry—or so we told each other later. Perhaps we were always more like brother and sister. I was a deeply lonely child and I wanted a sister of my own. Catherine, who was my first cousin, came into my life as a kind of long-wanted sister... We were from then until her death extremely close, and closer than lovers sometimes are, for mere lovers may be strangers though they live and love together all their lives... Catherine was my dearest friend and playmate ... until we grew into our marriage.The two had grown close during family trips, encouraging each other&#x27;s interest in painting and drawing, swimming together often, going on wild raspberry picks, helping build a tennis court, playing piano duet music, and later organizing group readings with their other cousins of books and political tracts from Fyodor Stravinsky&#x27;s personal library. In July 1901, Stravinsky expressed infatuation with Lyudmila Kuxina, Nosenko&#x27;s best friend, but after the self-described &quot;summer romance&quot; had ended, Nosenko and Stravinsky&#x27;s relationship began developing into a furtive romance. Between their intermittent family visits, Nosenko studied painting at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. The two married on 24 January 1906, at the Church of the Annunciation five miles (eight kilometers) north of Saint Petersburg – because marriage between first cousins was banned, they procured a priest who did not ask their identities, and the only guests present were Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s sons. The couple soon had two children: Théodore, born in 1907, and Ludmila, born the following year.

After finishing the many revisions of the Symphony in E-flat in 1907, Stravinsky wrote &quot;Faun and Shepherdess&quot;, a setting of three Pushkin poems for mezzo-soprano and orchestra. Rimsky-Korsakov organized the first public premiere of his student&#x27;s work with the Imperial Court Orchestra in April 1907, programming the Symphony in E-flat and &quot;Faun and Shepherdess&quot;. Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s death in June 1908 caused Stravinsky deep mourning, and he later recalled that &quot;Funeral Song&quot;, which he composed in memory of his teacher, was &quot;the best of my works before &quot;The Firebird&quot;&quot;.

=== International fame, 1909–1920 ===

==== Ballets for Diaghilev ====

In 1898, the impresario Sergei Diaghilev founded the Russian art magazine &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot;, but after it ended publication in 1904, he turned towards Paris for artistic opportunities rather than his native Russia. In 1907, Diaghilev presented a five-concert series of Russian music at the Paris Opera; the following year, he staged the Paris premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. Diaghilev attended the February 1909 premiere of two new Stravinsky works: &quot;Scherzo fantastique&quot; and &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot;, both lively orchestral movements featuring bright orchestration and unique harmonic techniques. The vivid color and tone of Stravinsky&#x27;s works intrigued Diaghilev, and the impresario subsequently commissioned Stravinsky to orchestrate music by Chopin for parts of the ballet &quot;.&quot; This ballet was presented by Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet company, the Ballets Russes, in April 1909, and while the company scored successes with Parisian audiences, Stravinsky was working on Act I of his first opera &quot;The Nightingale&quot;.

As the Ballets Russes faced financial issues, Diaghilev wanted a new ballet with distinctly Russian music and design, something that had recently become popular with French and other Western audiences (likely due to the group of Russian classical composers known as The Five, according to the musicologist Richard Taruskin); Diaghilev&#x27;s company settled on the subject of the mythical Firebird. Diaghilev asked multiple composers to write the ballet&#x27;s score, including Lyadov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, but after none committed to the project, the impresario turned to the 27-year-old Stravinsky, who gladly accepted the task. During the ballet&#x27;s production, Stravinsky became close with Diaghilev&#x27;s artistic circle, who were impressed by his enthusiasm to learn more about non-musical art forms. &quot;The Firebird&quot; premiered in Paris (as ) on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim, and made Stravinsky an overnight sensation. Many critics praised the composer&#x27;s alignment with Russian nationalist music. Stravinsky later recollected that after the premiere and subsequent performances, he met many figures in the Paris art scene; Debussy was brought on stage after the premiere and invited Stravinsky to dinner, beginning a lifelong friendship between the two composers.

The Stravinsky family moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, for the birth of their third child, Soulima, and it was there that Stravinsky began work on a &quot;&quot; for piano and orchestra depicting the tale of a puppet coming to life. After Diaghilev heard the early drafts, he convinced Stravinsky to turn it into a ballet for the 1911 season. The resulting work, &quot;Petrushka&quot; (under the French spelling &quot;Petrouchka&quot;), premiered in Paris on 13 June 1911 to equal popularity as &quot;The Firebird&quot;, and Stravinsky became established as one of the most advanced young theater composers of his time.

While composing &quot;The Firebird&quot;, Stravinsky conceived an idea for a work about what he called &quot;a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watched a young girl dance herself to death&quot;. He immediately shared the idea with Nicholas Roerich, a friend and painter of pagan subjects. When Stravinsky told Diaghilev about the idea, the impresario excitedly agreed to commission the work. After the premiere of &quot;Petrushka&quot;, Stravinsky settled at his family&#x27;s residence in Ustilug and fleshed out the details of the ballet with Roerich, later finishing the work in Clarens, Switzerland. The result was &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (), which depicted pagan rituals in Slavonic tribes and used many avant-garde techniques, including uneven rhythms and meters, superimposed harmonies, atonality, and extensive instrumentation. With radical choreography by the young Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet&#x27;s experimental nature caused a near-riot at its premiere at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913.

==== Illness and wartime collaborations ====

Soon after, Stravinsky was admitted to a hospital for typhoid fever and stayed in recovery for five weeks; numerous colleagues visited him, including Debussy, Manuel de Falla, Maurice Ravel, and Florent Schmitt. Upon returning to his family in Ustilug, he continued work on his opera &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, now with an official commission from the Moscow Free Theatre. In early 1914, his wife Yekaterina contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland, where the couple&#x27;s fourth child, Maria Milena, was born. Here Stravinsky finished &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, but after the Moscow Free Theatre closed before the premiere, Diaghilev agreed to stage the opera. The May 1914 premiere was moderately successful; critics&#x27; high expectations after the tumultuous &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; were not met, though fellow composers were impressed by the music&#x27;s emotion and free treatment of counterpoint and themes.

In early July 1914, while his family resided in Switzerland near his sick wife, the composer traveled to Russia to retrieve texts for his next work, a ballet-cantata depicting Russian wedding traditions titled . Soon after he returned, World War I began, and the Stravinskys lived in Switzerland until 1920, initially residing in Clarens and later Morges. During the first months of the war, the composer intensely researched Russian folk poetry and prepared librettos for numerous works to be composed in the coming years, including &#x27;, &quot;Renard&quot;, , and other song cycles. Stravinsky met numerous Swiss-French artists during his time in Morges, including the author Charles F. Ramuz, with whom he collaborated on the small-scale theater work &#x27;. The eleven-musician and two-dancer show was designed for easy travel, but after a premiere run funded by Werner Reinhart, all other performances were canceled due to the Spanish flu epidemic.

Stravinsky&#x27;s income from performance royalties was suddenly cut off when his Germany-based publisher suspended operations due to the war. To keep his family afloat, the composer sold numerous manuscripts and accepted commissions from wealthy impresarios; one such commission included &quot;Renard&quot;, a theater work completed in 1916 upon a request from Princesse Edmond de Polignac. Additionally, Stravinsky made a new concert suite from &quot;The Firebird&quot; and sold it to a London publisher in an attempt to regain copyright control over the ballet. Diaghilev continued to organize Ballets Russes shows across Europe, including two charity concerts for the Red Cross where Stravinsky made his conducting debut with &quot;The Firebird&quot;. When the Ballets Russes traveled to Rome in April 1917, Stravinsky met the artist Pablo Picasso, and the two adventured around Italy; a they saw in Naples inspired the ballet &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, which premiered in Paris in May 1920 with designs by Picasso.

=== France, 1920–1939 ===

==== Turn towards neoclassicism ====
After the war ended, Stravinsky decided that his residence in Switzerland was too far from Europe&#x27;s musical activity, and briefly moved his family to Carantec, France. In September 1920, they relocated to the home of Coco Chanel, an associate of Diaghilev&#x27;s, where Stravinsky composed his early neoclassical work the &quot;Symphonies of Wind Instruments.&quot; After his relationship with Chanel developed into an affair, Stravinsky relocated his family to the white émigré-hub Biarritz in May 1921, partly due to the presence of his other lover Vera de Bosset. At the time, de Bosset was married to the former Ballet Russes stage designer Serge Sudeikin, though de Bosset later divorced Sudeikin to marry Stravinsky. Though Yekaterina Stravinsky became aware of her husband&#x27;s infidelity, the Stravinskys never divorced, likely due to the composer&#x27;s refusal to separate.

In 1921, Stravinsky signed a contract with the player piano company Pleyel to create piano roll arrangements of his music. He received a studio at their factory on the Rue Rochechouart, where he reorchestrated &quot;&quot; for a small ensemble including player piano. The composer transcribed many of his major works for the mechanical pianos, and the Pleyel premises remained his Paris base until 1933, even after the player piano had been largely supplanted by electrical gramophone recording. Stravinsky signed another contract in 1924, this time with the Aeolian Company in London, producing rolls that included comments about the work by Stravinsky that were engraved into the rolls. He stopped working with player pianos in 1930 when the Aeolian Company&#x27;s London branch was dissolved.

The interest in Pushkin shared by Stravinsky and Diaghilev led to &quot;Mavra&quot;, a comic opera begun in 1921 that exhibited the composer&#x27;s rejection of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s style and his turn towards classic Russian operatists like Tchaikovsky, Glinka, and Dargomyzhsky. Yet, after the 1922 premiere, the work&#x27;s tame nature – compared to the innovative music Stravinsky had come to be known for – disappointed critics. In 1923, Stravinsky finished orchestrating &quot;, settling on a percussion ensemble including four pianos. The Ballets Russes staged the ballet-cantata that June, and although it initially received moderate reviews, the London production received a flurry of critical attacks, leading the writer H. G. Wells to publish an open letter in support of the work. During this period, Stravinsky expanded his involvement in conducting and piano performance. He conducted the premiere of his Octet in 1923 and served as the soloist for the premiere of his Piano Concerto in 1924. Following its debut, he embarked on a tour, performing the concerto in over 40 concerts.

==== Religious crisis and international touring ====

The Stravinsky family moved again in September 1924 to Nice, France. The composer&#x27;s schedule was divided between spending time with his family in Nice, performing in Paris, and touring other locations, often accompanied by de Bosset. At this time, Stravinsky was going through a spiritual crisis onset by meeting Father Nicolas, a priest near his new home. He had abandoned the Russian Orthodox Church during his teenage years, but after meeting Father Nicolas in 1926 and reconnecting with his faith, he began regularly attending services. From then until moving to the United States, Stravinsky diligently attended church, participated in charity work, and studied religious texts. The composer later wrote that he was contacted by God at a service at the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, leading him to write his first religious composition, the for a cappella choir.

In 1925, Stravinsky asked the French writer and artist Jean Cocteau to write the libretto for an operatic setting of Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; in Latin. The May 1927 premiere of his opera-oratorio &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; was staged as a concert performance since there was too little time and money to present it as a full opera, and Stravinsky attributed the work&#x27;s critical failure to its programming between two glittery ballets. Furthermore, the influence from Russian Orthodox vocal music and 18th-century composers like Handel was not well received in the press after the May 1927 premiere; neoclassicism was not popular with Parisian critics, and Stravinsky had to publicly assert that his music was not part of the movement. This reception from critics was not improved by Stravinsky&#x27;s next ballet, &quot;&quot;, which depicted the birth and apotheosis of Apollo using an 18th-century musical style. George Balanchine choreographed the premiere, beginning decades of collaborations between Stravinsky and the choreographer. Nevertheless, some critics found it to be a turning point in Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical music, describing it as a pure work that blended neoclassical ideas with modern methods of composition.

A new commission for a ballet from Ida Rubinstein in 1928 led Stravinsky again to Tchaikovsky. Basing the music on romantic ballets like &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and borrowing many themes from Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky wrote &quot;The Fairy&#x27;s Kiss&quot; with Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s tale &quot;The Ice-Maiden&quot; as the subject. The November 1928 premiere was not well-received, likely due to the disconnect between each of the ballet&#x27;s sections and the mediocre choreography, of which Stravinsky disapproved. Diaghilev&#x27;s fury with Stravinsky for accepting a ballet commission from someone else caused an intense feud between the two, one that lasted until the impresario&#x27;s death in August 1929. Most of that year was spent composing a new solo piano work, the Capriccio, and touring across Europe to conduct and perform piano; the Capriccio&#x27;s success after the December 1929 premiere caused a flurry of performance requests from many orchestras. A commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1930 for a symphonic work led Stravinsky back to Latin texts, this time from the book of Psalms. Between touring concerts, he composed the choral &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, a deeply religious work that premiered in December of that year.

==== Work with Dushkin ====

While touring in Germany, Stravinsky visited his publisher&#x27;s home and met the violinist Samuel Dushkin, who convinced him to compose the Violin Concerto with Dushkin&#x27;s help on the solo part. Impressed by Dushkin&#x27;s virtuosic ability and understanding of music, the composer wrote more music for violin and piano and rearranged some of his earlier music to be performed alongside the Concerto while on tour until 1933. That year, Stravinsky received another ballet commission from Ida Rubenstein for a setting of a poem by André Gide. The resulting melodrama only received three performances in 1934 due to its lukewarm reception, and Stravinsky&#x27;s disdain towards the work was evident in his later suggestion that the libretto be rewritten. In June of that year, Stravinsky became a naturalized French citizen, protecting all his future works under copyright in France and the United States. His family subsequently moved to an apartment on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, where he began writing a two-volume autobiography with the help of Walter Nouvel, published in 1935 and 1936 as .

After the short run of &quot;&quot;, Stravinsky embarked on a successful three-month tour of the United States with Dushkin; he visited South America for the first time the following year. The composer&#x27;s son Soulima was an excellent pianist, having performed the Capriccio in concert with his father conducting. Continuing a line of solo piano works, the elder Stravinsky composed the Concerto for Two Pianos to be performed by them both, and they toured the work through 1936. Around this time came three American-commissioned works: the ballet for Balanchine, the Brandenburg-Concerto-like work Dumbarton Oaks, and the lamenting Symphony in C for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Stravinsky&#x27;s last years in France from late 1938 to 1939 were marked by the deaths of his eldest daughter, his wife, and his mother, the former two from tuberculosis. In addition, the increasingly hostile criticism of his music in major publications and failed run for a seat at the Institut de France further dissociated him from France, and shortly after the beginning of World War II in September 1939 he moved to the United States. 

=== United States, 1939–1971 ===
==== Adjustment to the United States and commercial works ====

Upon arriving in the United States, Stravinsky resided with Edward W. Forbes, the director of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures series at Harvard University. The composer was contracted to deliver six lectures for the series, beginning in October 1939 and ending in April 1940. The lectures, written with assistance from Pyotr Suvchinsky and Alexis Roland-Manuel, were published in French under the title (&quot;Poetics of Music&quot;) in 1941, with an English translation following in 1947. Between lectures, Stravinsky finished the Symphony in C and toured across the country, meeting de Bosset upon her arrival in New York. Stravinsky and de Bosset finally married on 9 March 1940 in Bedford, Massachusetts. After the completion of his lecture series, the couple moved to Los Angeles, where they applied for American naturalization.

Money became scarce as the war stopped the composer from receiving European royalties, making him take up numerous conducting engagements and compose commercial works for the entertainment industry, including the for Paul Whiteman and the for a Broadway revue. Some discarded film music made it into larger works, as with the war-inspired Symphony in Three Movements, the middle movement of which used music from an unused score for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943). The couple&#x27;s poor English led to the formation of a predominantly European social circle and home life: the estate staff consisted of mostly Russians, and frequent guests included musicians Joseph Szigeti, Arthur Rubinstein, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. However, Stravinsky eventually joined popular Hollywood circles, attending parties with celebrities and becoming closely acquainted with European authors Aldous Huxley, W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and Dylan Thomas.

In 1945, Stravinsky received American citizenship and subsequently signed a contract with British publishing house Boosey &amp; Hawkes, who agreed to publish all his future works. Additionally, he revised many of his older works and had Boosey &amp; Hawkes publish the new editions to re-copyright his older works. Around the 1948 premiere of another Balanchine collaboration, the ballet &quot;Orpheus&quot;, the composer met the young conductor Robert Craft in New York; Craft had asked Stravinsky to explain the revision of the &quot;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&quot; for an upcoming concert. The two quickly became friends and Stravinsky invited Craft to Los Angeles; the young conductor soon became Stravinsky&#x27;s assistant, collaborator, and amanuensis until the composer&#x27;s death.

==== Turn towards serialism ====

As Stravinsky became more familiar with English, he developed the idea to write an English-language opera based on a series of paintings by 18th-century artist William Hogarth titled &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The composer joined Auden to write the libretto in November 1947; American writer Chester Kallman was later brought in to assist Auden. Stravinsky finished the opera of the same name in 1951, and despite its widespread performances and success, the composer was dismayed to find that his newer music did not captivate young composers. Craft had introduced Stravinsky to the serial music of the Second Viennese School shortly after &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; premiered, and the opera&#x27;s composer began studying and listening to the music of Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg.

During the 1950s, Stravinsky continued touring extensively across the world, occasionally returning to Los Angeles to compose. In 1953, he agreed to compose a new opera with a libretto by Dylan Thomas, but development on the project came to a sudden end following Thomas&#x27;s death in November of that year. Stravinsky completed &quot;In Memoriam Dylan Thomas&quot;, his first work fully based on the serial twelve-tone technique, the following year. The 1956 cantata &#x27; premiered at the International Festival of Contemporary Music in Venice, inspiring to commission the musical setting in 1957. With the Balanchine ballet &quot;Agon&quot;, Stravinsky fused neoclassical themes with the twelve-tone technique, and &#x27; showed his full shift towards use of tone rows. In 1959, Craft interviewed Stravinsky for an article titled &quot;Answers to 35 Questions&quot;, in which the composer sought to correct myths surrounding him and discuss his relationships with other artists. The article was later expanded into a book, and over the next four years, three more interview-style books were published.

Continued international tours brought Stravinsky to Washington, D.C. in January 1962, where he attended a dinner at the White House with then-President John F. Kennedy in honor of the composer&#x27;s 80th birthday. Although it was largely an anti-Soviet political stunt, Stravinsky remembered the event fondly, composing the &quot;Elegy for J.F.K.&quot; after the president&#x27;s assassination a year later. In September 1962, he returned to Russia for the first time since 1914, accepting an invitation from the Union of Soviet Composers to conduct six performances in Moscow and Leningrad. After the success of &quot;The Firebird&quot; and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in the 1910s, Stravinsky&#x27;s music was respected and frequently performed in the Soviet Union, influencing young Soviet composers at the time like Dmitri Shostakovich. However, after Stalin began consolidating power in the early 1930s, Stravinsky&#x27;s music nearly vanished and was formally banned in 1948. A new interest in his works was born during the Khrushchev Thaw, partly due to the composer&#x27;s 1962 visit. During his three-week visit he met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and several leading Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Aram Khachaturian. Stravinsky did not return to Los Angeles until December 1962 after eight months of almost continual traveling.

==== Final works and death ====

Stravinsky revisited biblical themes for many of his later works, notably in the 1961 chamber cantata &quot;A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer&quot;, the 1962 musical television production &quot;The Flood&quot;, the 1963 Hebrew cantata &quot;Abraham and Isaac&quot;, and the 1966 &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot;, the last of which was his final major composition. Between tours, the composer worked relentlessly to devise new tone rows, even working on toilet paper from airplane lavatories. The intense touring schedule began taking a toll on the elderly composer; January 1967 marked his last recording session, and his final concert came the following May. An obviously very frail Stravinsky made his final public conducting appearance on May 17, 1967 at Massey Hall in Toronto, when he led the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in a performance of his Pulcinella Suite.

After spending the autumn of 1967 in the hospital due to bleeding stomach ulcers and thrombosis, Stravinsky returned to domestic touring in 1968 (only appearing as an audience member) but stopped composing due to his gradual decline in physical health.

In his final years, the Stravinskys and Craft moved to New York to be closer to medical care, and the composer&#x27;s travel was limited to visiting family in Europe. Soon after being discharged from Lenox Hill Hospital after contracting pulmonary edema, Stravinsky moved with his wife to a new apartment on Fifth Avenue. The composer died there on 6 April 1971 at the age of 88. A funeral service was held three days later at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. After a service at Santi Giovanni e Paolo with a performance of the &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot; conducted by Craft, Stravinsky was buried on the cemetery island of San Michele in Venice, several yards from the tomb of Sergei Diaghilev.
== Music ==
Much of Stravinsky&#x27;s music is characterized by short, sharp articulations with minimal rubato or vibrato. His student works were primarily assignments from his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov and were mainly influenced by Russian composers. His first three ballets, &quot;The Firebird&quot;, &quot;Petrushka&quot;, and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, marked the beginning of his international fame and a departure from 19th-century styles. Stravinsky&#x27;s music is often divided into three periods of composition: his Russian period (1913–1920), where he was greatly influenced by Russian artists and folklore; his neoclassical period (1920–1951), where he turned towards techniques and themes from the classical period; and his serial period (1954–1968), where he used highly structured composition techniques pioneered by composers of the Second Viennese School.

=== Student works, 1898–1907 ===
Stravinsky&#x27;s time before meeting Diaghilev was spent learning from Rimsky-Korsakov and his collaborators. Only three works survive from before Stravinsky met Rimsky-Korsakov in August 1902: &quot;Tarantella&quot; (1898), Scherzo in G minor (1902), and &quot;The Storm Cloud&quot;, the first two being works for piano and the last for voice and piano. Stravinsky&#x27;s first assignment from Rimsky-Korsakov was the four-movement Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor, which was also his first work to be performed in public. Rimsky-Korsakov often gave Stravinsky the task of orchestrating various works to allow him to analyze the works&#x27; form and structure. Many of Stravinsky&#x27;s early works showed influence from French composers as well, notably in the minimal use of large doublings and different combinations of tone colors. A number of Stravinsky&#x27;s student compositions were performed at Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s gatherings at his home; these include a set of bagatelles, a &quot;chanson comique&quot;, and a cantata, showing the use of classical musical techniques that would later define Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical period. The musicologist Stephen Walsh described this time in Stravinsky&#x27;s musical career as &quot;aesthetically cramped&quot; due to the &quot;cynical conservatism&quot; of Rimsky-Korsakov and his music. Rimsky-Korsakov thought the Symphony in E-flat (1907) was swayed too much by Glazunov&#x27;s style, and disliked the modernist influence on &quot;Faun and Shepherdess&quot; (1907); however, critics found the works to not stand out from his teacher&#x27;s music.

=== First three ballets, 1910–1913 ===
Russian composers often used large orchestration to feature many different timbres, and Stravinsky harnessed this idea in his first three ballets, often surprising the musicians and performers due to the orchestra&#x27;s great force at certain moments. &quot;The Firebird&quot; used a harmonic structure that Stravinsky called &quot;leit-harmony&quot;, a portmanteau of leitmotif and harmony used by Rimsky-Korsakov in his opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;. The &quot;leit-harmony&quot; was used to juxtapose the protagonist, the Firebird, and the antagonist, Koschei the Deathless: the former was associated with whole-tone phrases and the latter with octatonic harmony. Stravinsky later wrote how he composed &quot;The Firebird&quot; in a state of &quot;revolt against Rimsky&quot;, and that he &quot;tried to surpass him with &quot;ponticello&quot;, &quot;col legno&quot;, &quot;flautando&quot;, &quot;glissando&quot;, and fluttertongue effects&quot;.

Stravinsky defined his musical character in his second ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot;. The Russian influence can be seen in the use of a number of Russian folk tunes in addition to two waltzes by Viennese composer Joseph Lanner and a French music hall tune. Stravinsky also used a folk tune from Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, showing the former&#x27;s continued reverence for his teacher.

Stravinsky&#x27;s third ballet, &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, caused a near-riot at the premiere due to its avant-garde nature. He had begun to experiment with polytonality in &quot;The Firebird&quot; and &quot;Petrushka&quot;, but for &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, he &quot;pushed [it] to its logical conclusion,&quot; as Eric Walter White described it. In addition, the complex meter in the music consists of phrases combining conflicting time signatures and odd accents, such as the &quot;jagged slashes&quot; in the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot;. Both polytonality and unusual rhythms can be heard in the chords that open the second episode, &quot;Augurs of Spring&quot;, consisting of an E-flat dominant 7 superimposed on an F-flat major triad written in an uneven rhythm, Stravinsky shifting the accents seemingly at random to create asymmetry. &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; is one of the most famous and influential works of the 20th century; the musicologist Donald Jay Grout described it as having &quot;the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before.&quot;

=== Russian period, 1913–1920 ===

The musicologist Jeremy Noble said that Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;intensive researches into Russian folk material&quot; took place during his time in Switzerland from 1914 to 1920. Béla Bartók considered Stravinsky&#x27;s Russian period to have begun in 1913 with &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; due to its use of Russian folk songs, themes, and techniques. The use of duple or triple meters was especially prevalent in Stravinsky&#x27;s Russian period music; while the pulse may have remained constant, the time signature would often change to constantly shift the accents.

While Stravinsky did not use as many folk melodies as he had in his first three ballets, he often used folk poetry. The ballet-cantata &#x27; was based on texts from a collection of Russian folk poetry by Pyotr Kireevsky, and his opera-ballet &quot;Renard&quot; was based on a folktale collected by Alexander Afanasyev. Many of Stravinsky&#x27;s Russian period works featured animal characters and themes, likely due to inspiration from nursery rhymes he read with his children. Stravinsky also used unique theatrical styles. &#x27; blended the staging of ballets with the small instrumentation of early cantatas, a unique production described on the score as &quot;Russian Choreographic Scenes&quot;. In &quot;Renard&quot;, the voices were placed in the orchestra, as they were meant to accompany the action on stage. &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du soldat&quot; was composed in 1918 with the Swiss novelist Charles F. Ramuz as a small musical theatre production for dancers, a narrator, and a septet. It mixed the Russian folktales in the narrative with common musical structures of the time, like the tango, waltz, rag, and chorale. Even as his style changed in later years, Stravinsky maintained a musical connection to his Russian roots.

=== Neoclassical period, 1920–1951 ===
The ballet &quot;Pulcinella&quot; was commissioned by Diaghilev in 1919 after he proposed the idea of a ballet based on music by 18th-century Italian composers like Giovanni Battista Pergolesi; by imposing a work based on the harmonic and rhythmic systems of late-Baroque era composers, Stravinsky marked the start of his turn towards 18th-century music. Although the musicologist Jeremy Noble considered Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical period to have begun in 1920 with his &quot;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&quot;, Bartók argued that the period &quot;really starts with his Octet for Wind Instruments, followed by his Concerto for Piano&quot;. During this period, Stravinsky used techniques and themes from the classical period of music.
Greek mythology was a common theme in Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical works. His first Greek mythology-based work was the ballet (1927), choosing the leader of the Muses and the god of art Apollo as the subjects. Stravinsky would use themes from Greek mythology in future works like &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; (1927), &quot;Persephone&quot; (1935), and &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1947). Richard Taruskin wrote that &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; was &quot;the product of Stravinsky&#x27;s neo-classical manner at its most extreme,&quot; and that musical techniques &quot;thought outdated&quot; were juxtaposed against contemporary ideas. In addition, Stravinsky turned towards older musical structures and modernized them. His Octet (1923) uses the sonata form, modernizing it by disregarding the standard ordering of themes and traditional tonal relationships for different sections. Baroque counterpoint was used throughout the choral &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; (1930). In the jazz-influenced &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot; (1945), Stravinsky fused big band orchestration with Baroque forms and harmonies.

Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical period ended in 1951 with the opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Taruskin described the opera as &quot;the hub and essence of &#x27;neo-classicism&#x27;&quot;. He pointed out how the opera contains numerous references to Greek mythology and other operas like Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, but still &quot;embod[ies] the distinctive structure of a fairy tale&quot;. Stravinsky was inspired by the operas of Mozart in composing the music, particularly , but other scholars also point out influence from Handel, Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert, Weber, Rossini, Donizetti, and Verdi. &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; has become an important work in opera repertoire, being &quot;[more performed] than any other opera written after the death of Puccini&quot;, according to Taruskin.

=== Serial period, 1954–1968 ===
In the 1950s, Stravinsky began using serial compositional techniques, such as the twelve-tone technique originally devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Noble wrote that this time was &quot;the most profound change in Stravinsky&#x27;s musical vocabulary&quot;, partly due to Stravinsky&#x27;s newfound interest in the music of the Second Viennese School after meeting Robert Craft. The composer&#x27;s treatment of the twelve-tone technique was unique: whereas Schoenberg&#x27;s technique was very strict, disallowing repetitions of a tone row until it was complete, Stravinsky repeated notes freely, even separating the row into cells and reordering the notes. In addition, his serial period&#x27;s orchestration style became dark and bass-heavy, with winds and piano frequently using their lowest registers.

Stravinsky first experimented with non-twelve-tone serial techniques in small-scale works such as the Cantata (1952), the Septet (1953) and &quot;Three Songs from Shakespeare&quot; (1953). The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was &quot;In Memoriam Dylan Thomas&quot; (1954). &quot;Agon&quot; (1954–1957) was the first of his works to include a twelve-tone series, whereas the second movement from &#x27; (1956) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a tone row. &quot;Agon&quot;&#x27;s unique tonal structure was significant to Stravinsky&#x27;s serial music; it begins diatonic, moves towards full 12-tone serialism in the middle, and returns to diatonicism in the end. Stravinsky returned to sacred themes in works such as &quot;,&quot; &#x27; (1958), &quot;A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Flood&quot; (1962). Stravinsky used a number of concepts from earlier works in his serial pieces; for example, the voice of God being two bass voices in homophony seen in &quot;The Flood&quot; was previously used in &quot;&quot;. Stravinsky&#x27;s final large-scale work, the &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot; (1966), made use of a complex four-part array of tone rows throughout, showing the evolution of Stravinsky&#x27;s serialist music. Noble described the &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot; as &quot;a distillation both of the liturgical text and of his own musical means of setting it, evolved and refined through a career of more than 60 years&quot;.

The influence of other composers on Stravinsky can be seen throughout this period. He was heavily influenced by Schoenberg, not only in his use of the twelve-tone technique, but also in the distinctly &quot;Schoenbergian&quot; instrumentation of the Septet and the similarities between Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; Stravinsky also used a number of themes found in works by Benjamin Britten, later commenting about the &quot;many titles and subjects [I have shared] with Mr. Britten already&quot;. In addition, he was very familiar with the works of Anton Webern, being one of the figures who inspired Stravinsky to consider serialism a possible form of composition.

== Artistic influences ==
Stravinsky worked with some of the most famous artists of his time, many of whom he met after achieving international success with &quot;The Firebird&quot;. Diaghilev was one of the composer&#x27;s most prominent artistic influences, having introduced him to composing for the stage and bringing him international fame with his first three ballets. Through the Ballets Russes and Diaghilev, Stravinsky worked with figures like Vaslav Nijinsky, Léonide Massine, Alexandre Benois, Michel Fokine, and Léon Bakst.
The composer&#x27;s interest in art propelled him to develop a strong relationship with Picasso, whom he met in 1917. In the years following, the two engaged in an artistic dialogue in which they exchanged small-scale works of art to each other as a sign of intimacy, which included the famous portrait of Stravinsky by Picasso, and a short sketch of clarinet music by Stravinsky. This exchange was essential to establish how the artists would approach their collaborative space in &quot;Ragtime&quot; and &quot;Pulcinella&quot;.

Stravinsky displayed a taste in literature that was wide and reflected his constant desire for new discoveries. The texts and literary sources for his work began with interest in Russian folklore. After moving to Switzerland in 1914, Stravinsky began gathering folk stories from numerous collections, which were later used in works like &#x27;, &quot;Renard&quot;, &#x27;, and various songs. Many of Stravinsky&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Firebird&quot;, &quot;Renard&quot;, and &quot;&quot; were inspired by Alexander Afanasyev&#x27;s famous collection &quot;Russian Folk Tales&quot;. Collections of folk music influenced Stravinsky&#x27;s music; numerous melodies from &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; were found in an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs.

An interest in the Latin liturgy began shortly after Stravinsky rejoined the church in 1926, beginning with the composition of his first religious work in 1926 &quot;&quot;, written in Old Church Slavonic. He later used three psalms from the Latin Vulgate in his &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; for orchestra and mixed choir. Many works in the composer&#x27;s neoclassical and serial periods used (or were based on) liturgical texts.

Stravinsky worked with many authors throughout his career. He first worked with the Swiss novelist Charles F. Ramuz on &#x27; in 1918, with whom he formed the idea and wrote the text. In 1933, Ida Rubinstein commissioned Stravinsky to set music to a poem by André Gide, later becoming the melodrama &#x27;. The Stravinsky-Gide collaboration was apparently tense: Gide disliked how the music did not follow the prosody of his poem and did not attend rehearsals, and Stravinsky ignored many of Gide&#x27;s ideas. Gide later left the project and did not attend the premiere run. The story of &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; was first conceived by Stravinsky and W. H. Auden, the latter of whom wrote the libretto with Chester Kallman. Stravinsky befriended many other authors as well, including T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, and Dylan Thomas, the last of whom Stravinsky began working with on an opera in 1953 but stopped due to Thomas&#x27;s death.

== Legacy ==
Stravinsky is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him as one of the 100 most influential people of the century. Stravinsky was not only recognized for his composing; he also achieved fame as a pianist and as a conductor. Philip Glass wrote in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;He conducted with an energy and vividness that completely conveyed his every musical intention. Here was Stravinsky, a musical revolutionary whose own evolution never stopped. There is not a composer who lived during his time or is alive today who was not touched, and sometimes transformed, by his work.&quot; Stravinsky was also renowned for his precise orchestration: the critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote that Stravinsky and the French composer Maurice Ravel were the &quot;[two men] in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a &#x27;cello or a &quot;pp&quot; tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another.&quot;

Stravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;. The rhythm in &quot;The Rite&quot; stretched across bars and lacked distinct beats, which opened the door for future composers to make rhythm more fluid within meters. However, many saw his subsequent neoclassical period as a return to the past while other composers tried advancing modern music. His subsequent turn towards serialism further alienated him from audiences, and academics saw this stylistic shift as not innovative enough, since they believed the death of Schoenberg also marked the end of twelve-tone music. Stephen Walsh related the changing nature of Stravinsky&#x27;s music to the composer&#x27;s nature: as an exile from his native Russia, Stravinsky adapted to his environment and absorbed the music of those around him. Martha Hyde stated that more recent analysis &quot;judg[ed] Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical style as the harbinger of musical postmodernism&quot;. After his death, Stravinsky&#x27;s importance in modernist music became evident: though many modern styles quickly fell out of fashion (like twelve-tone music), the music of Stravinsky stood out as a body of unique ingenuity, according to Walsh.

Stravinsky influenced many composers and musicians. His music continues to offer inspiration and a unique method to young composers. The rhythmic innovations in &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; brought rhythm to the forefront of modern music rather than tonality, setting a new standard in the modernist movement that future composers like Varèse and Ligeti were inspired to innovate upon. Stravinsky&#x27;s rhythm and vitality greatly influenced Aaron Copland and Pierre Boulez, and the combination of folklore and modernism found in many of Stravinsky&#x27;s works influenced Béla Bartók as well. Stravinsky&#x27;s less popular works were also widely influential: the disconnected form of the &quot;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&quot; can be seen similarly in later works by avant-garde masters like Messiaen, Tippett, Andriessen, and Xenakis. Stravinsky also influenced composers like Elliott Carter, Harrison Birtwistle, and John Tavener. Aside from Craft, his students include Earnest Andersson, Armando José Fernandes, Mordecai Seter, Robert Strassburg, and Warren Zevon.

== Recordings ==
Stravinsky&#x27;s need for money during the World Wars led him to sign many contracts with record companies to conduct his music. His early exposure to player piano technology guided his view that records were far inferior to live performance but acted as historical documentation of how his works should be performed. As a result, Stravinsky left a massive archive of recordings of his own music, seldom recording music by other composers. Although most of his recordings were made with studio musicians, he also worked with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the CBC Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Stravinsky received five Grammy Awards and a total of eleven nominations for his recordings, with three of his albums being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987.

During his lifetime, Stravinsky appeared on several telecasts and documentaries. The first, &quot;A Conversation with Igor Stravinsky&quot;, was released in 1957 by NBC and produced by Robert Graff, who later commissioned and produced &quot;The Flood&quot;. The interview-like format later influenced the various volumes Craft wrote with Stravinsky. The 1965 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Stravinsky&quot;, directed by Roman Kroitor and Wolf Koenig, followed Stravinsky conducting the CBC Symphony Orchestra in a recording of the &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, with anecdotal interviews interspersed throughout. The 1966 CBS documentary &quot;Portrait of Stravinsky&quot; took the composer back to the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (where &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; premiered) and to his old home in Clarens, Switzerland. Other documentaries captured the collaborative process between Balanchine and Stravinsky.

== Writings ==

Stravinsky published a number of books throughout his career. In his 1936 autobiography, &quot;Chronicle of My Life&quot;, which was written with the help of Walter Nouvel, Stravinsky included his well-known statement that &quot;music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all&quot;. With Alexis Roland-Manuel and Pierre Souvtchinsky, he wrote his 1939–40 Harvard University Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, which were delivered in French and first collected under the title in 1942 and then translated in 1947 as &quot;Poetics of Music&quot;. In 1959, several interviews between the composer and Craft were published as &quot;Conversations with Igor Stravinsky&quot;. Five more volumes of a similar format were published over the following decade.

Books and articles are listed in Appendix E of Eric Walter White&#x27;s &quot;Stravinsky: The Composer and His Works&quot;, references in Alicja Jarzębska&#x27;s &quot;Stravinsky: His Thoughts and Music&quot;, and Stephen Walsh&#x27;s profile of Stravinsky on &quot;Oxford Music Online&quot;.

<text>A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications.

The hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight in the world was performed in Paris, France, by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d&#x27;Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers. Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.
==History==
===Premodern and unmanned balloons===
A precursor of the hot air balloon was the sky lantern (). Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220–280 CE), used these airborne lanterns for military signaling. The Mongolian army studied Kongming lanterns from China and used them in the Battle of Legnica during the Mongol invasion of Poland in the 13th century. This is the first time ballooning was known in the western world.

In the 18th century the Portuguese Jesuit priest Bartolomeu de Gusmão in colonial Brazil envisioned an aerial apparatus named , which was the predecessor of the hot air balloon. The was intended to serve as air vessel in order to facilitate communication and as a strategical device. In 1709 John V of Portugal decided to fund Bartolomeu de Gusmão&#x27;s project following a petition made by the Jesuit priest, and an unmanned demonstration was performed at Casa da Índia in the presence of John V and the queen, Maria Anna of Austria, with the Italian cardinal Michelangelo Conti, two members of the Portuguese Royal Academy of History, one Portuguese diplomat and one chronicler serving as witnesses. This event would bring some European attention to this event and this project. A later article dated on October 20, 1786, by the London &quot;Daily Universal Register&quot; would state that the inventor was able to raise himself by the use of his prototype. Also in 1709, the Portuguese Jesuit wrote (&quot;Short Manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air&quot;); he also left designs for a manned air vessel.

In the 1970s, balloonist Julian Nott hypothesized that the Nazca Lines geoglyphs&#x27; creation two millennia ago could have been guided by Nazca leaders in a balloon, possibly the earliest hot air balloon flights in human history. To support this theory, in 1975 he designed and piloted the Nazca Prehistoric Balloon, claiming to have used only methods and materials available to the Pre-Inca Peruvians 1,000 years ago.

===First manned flight===

The French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier developed a hot-air balloon in Annonay, Ardèche, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier, who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of , the length of the tether. The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis François d&#x27;Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.
The first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon for observation.

===Modern balloons===


Modern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost and Jim Winker, beginning during the 1950s; their work resulted in his a first successful flight on October 22, 1960. The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation.

===Records===
Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching . He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed south in Panchale. The previous record of had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.

On January 15, 1991, the &quot;Virgin Pacific Flyer&quot; balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon, when Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew from Japan to Northern Canada. With a volume of 74,000 cubic meters (2.6 million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the &quot;Pacific Flyer&quot; recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at . The longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard (Auguste Piccard&#x27;s grandson) and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Château-d&#x27;Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02 a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. Steve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt, in 320 h 33 min. Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016 for a round-the world time of 268 h 20 min.

==Construction==
A hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting &quot;envelope&quot;), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the &quot;burner&quot;, which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high-pressure forklift cylinders.

===Envelope===
Modern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).
During the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.

Envelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.

At the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.

====Seams====
The most common technique for sewing panels together is called the &quot;French felled&quot;, &quot;French fell&quot;, or &quot;double lap&quot; seam. The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a &quot;flat lap&quot; seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a &quot;zigzag&quot;, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.

====Coatings====

The fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3, for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air. It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a &quot;rag bag&quot;: cold-inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.

====Sizes and capacity====
A range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called &quot;Hoppers&quot; or &quot;Cloudhoppers&quot;) have as little as of envelope volume; for a perfect sphere the radius would be around . At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to . The most-used size is about , allowing to carry 3 to 5 people.

====Vents====
The top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have &quot;turning vents&quot;, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.

The most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a &quot;parachute vent&quot;, invented by Tracy Barnes. The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of &quot;vent lines&quot; that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachute—thus the name.) These &quot;vent lines&quot; are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.

An older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a &quot;Velcro-style&quot; vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of &quot;vent lines&quot; that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by &quot;hook and loop&quot; fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second &quot;maneuvering vent&quot; built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the &quot;smart vent&quot;, which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the &quot;parachute&quot; type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the &quot;pop top&quot; and &quot;MultiVent&quot; systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.

====Shape====
Besides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional &quot;inverted tear drop&quot; shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as &quot;natural&quot;. Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.

===Basket===

Hot air balloon baskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty. Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.

Baskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability. These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.

===Burner===

The burner unit gasifies liquid propane, mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed. The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded, so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezoelectric spark.

Where more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time, depending on the desired heat output. Each burner has a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a &quot;whisper burner&quot; and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.

===Fuel tanks===
Propane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are . They may be intended for upright or horizontal use and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.

The pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen. Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold-weather flying. Warmed tanks are usually also wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.

===Instrumentation===
A balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate-of-climb (vertical-speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature. A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air-speed indicators would be useless) and direction.

===Combined mass===
The combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:
:: * Using a density of for dry air heated to .

==Theory of operation==
===Generating lift===
Increasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes&#x27; principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximal internal temperature is limited to approximately 120 °C (250 °F).

The melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximal operating temperature—about 230 °C (450 °F)—but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximal operating temperature of 120 °C (250 °F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope-fabric life.

The lift generated by of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:


The density of air at is about . The total lift for a balloon of heated to would be . This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all at the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.

For typical atmospheric conditions (), a hot air balloon heated to requires about 3.91 m3 of envelope volume to lift 1 kilogram (equivalently, 62.5 cu ft/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% per 1,000 m (1% per 1,000 ft) of altitude gained.

=== Types of Hot Air Balloons ===
There are several different types of hot air balloons, all with different means of taking and sustaining flight.

====Montgolfier====

Standard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope. This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.

==== Gas ====

Instead of using regular air it is also possible to use lighter than air gasses such as Helium or Hydrogen to lift the balloon, though this means it is technically not a hot air balloon, though they did influence the design of hybrid balloons.

====Hybrid====
The 1785 Rozière balloon, is the main type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier. It has a separate cell for a lighter-than-air gas (typically helium), as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the danger of introducing an open flame near the gas, for example when Rozier attempted to cross the English Channel with his prototype, the fire used to heat the air ignited the Hydrogen and killed both him and his copilot thirty minutes after takeoff. As such, all modern hybrid balloons now use helium as a lifting gas. These balloons are commonly used for high performance records for hot air balloons.

====Solar====

Solar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by an envelope. These envelopes are more specialized than for other hot air balloons, trying to maximize the amount of solar energy they collect. This can be accomplished by rotating the envelope during flight or by having the envelope colored black or another dark color. They were pioneered in the 1970s in Europe by Tracy Barnes, Dominic Michaelis, and in the US by Frederick Espoo and Paul Woessher.

====Thermal Airship====

A Thermal airship, or blimp, became a reality in the 1960s. Thermal airships were the first steerable air buoyant vehicles. They utilized tail fins and a rudder and contained strictly hot air rather than a mix with hydrogen or helium.

====Observation Balloon====
Observation balloons were deployed as early as the American Civil War and used as reconnaissance towers. The first military funded balloon in America was designed by Thaddeus Lowe on August 2, 1861, for the Union. His design utilized gas from municipal lines to inflate the balloon as he did not have access to a portable generator. Observation balloons during this time were all made using multicolored-silk, wicker baskets, and were vertically oriented and tear shaped. Hydrogen, or illumination gas became the most used inflation fuel by the 20th Century, as it was lighter than air. Observation balloon usage skyrocketed in Britain by the Royal Engineers at the end of the 19th Century, deploying to Sudan in 1885 and to South Africa during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902.

===Steering===
Due to the overall design of hot air balloons, controlled and precise steering of hot air balloons is not possible; it is possible for pilots to try to achieve basic directional control by changing altitude and catching different wind streams. Wind in the northern hemisphere tends to turn east due to coriolis effect as the altitude increases.

=== Landing ===
The most effective way of landing a hot air balloon is to reduce the energy in the envelope, either by turning down the flame in Montgolfier and Hybrid balloons, or more directly by opening a flap in the envelope that will release the air/gas inside.

==Safety equipment==
To help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.

===Basket===
To relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.

A fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.

A handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20–30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick-release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.

For commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.

Further safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.

===Occupants===
At a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity. Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons. This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels. Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable. Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.

===Ground crew===
The ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.

==Maintenance and repair==


As with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon&#x27;s maintenance log book.

===Maintenance===
To ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer&#x27;s field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.

The burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.

Balloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer&#x27;s maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.

===Repair===
In the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.

==Licensing==
Depending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.

===Balloons===
As with other aircraft in the US, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155 pounds or 70 kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.

===Pilots===
====In Australia====
In Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation
and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.

====In the UK====
In the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot&#x27;s Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor&#x27;s guests and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator&#x27;s certificate) though a copy of it is required. For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.

====In the United States====
In the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), carrying the rating of &quot;Lighter-than-air free balloon&quot;, and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: &quot;Limited to hot-air balloons with airborne heater&quot;. A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot-air balloons meet the criteria.

To carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.

==Manufacturers==
The largest manufacturer of hot air balloons is Cameron Balloons of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron) have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot-air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop-shaped balloons, but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon&#x27;s ability to stay aloft.

The second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.

One of the three largest companies in the world is Kubicek Balloons. From its factory in Brno, Czechia the company ships its products worldwide. Produces from 100 to 115 balloons per year. Kubicek company also focus on special shape balloons, FAA/EASA type certified and are delivered with a Standard Airworthiness Certificate.

In the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America&#x27;s largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacturer is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.

The major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic, and LLopis Balloons of France.

<text>The Avignon Papacy (; ) was the period from 1309 to 1376 during which seven successive popes resided in Avignon (at the time within the Kingdom of Arles, part of the Holy Roman Empire, now part of France) rather than in Rome (now the capital of Italy). The situation arose from the conflict between the papacy and the French crown, culminating in the death of Pope Boniface VIII after his arrest and maltreatment by Philip IV of France. Following the subsequent death of Pope Benedict XI, Philip pressured a deadlocked conclave to elect the Archbishop of Bordeaux as pope Clement V in 1305. Clement refused to move to Rome, and in 1309 he moved his court to the papal enclave at Avignon, where it remained for the next 67 years. This absence from Rome is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot; of the Papacy (cf. Italian , i.e. &quot;Avignonese captivity&quot;).

A total of seven popes reigned at Avignon, all French, and all under the influence of the French Crown. In 1376, Gregory XI abandoned Avignon and moved his court to Rome, arriving in January 1377. After Gregory&#x27;s death in 1378, deteriorating relations between his successor Urban VI and a faction of cardinals gave rise to the Western Schism. This started a second line of Avignon popes, subsequently regarded as illegitimate. The last Avignon antipope, Benedict XIII, lost most of his support in 1398, including that of France. After five years besieged by the French, he fled to Perpignan in 1403. The schism ended in 1417 at the Council of Constance.

==Avignon popes==

Among the popes who resided in Avignon, subsequent Catholic historiography grants legitimacy to these:
*Pope Clement V: 1305–1314 (curia moved to Avignon, 9 March 1309)
*Pope John XXII: 1316–1334
*Pope Benedict XII: 1334–1342
*Pope Clement VI: 1342–1352
*Pope Innocent VI: 1352–1362
*Pope Urban V: 1362–1370 (in Rome 1367–1370; returned to Avignon 1370)
*Pope Gregory XI: 1370–1378 (left Avignon to return to Rome on 13 September 1376)

The two Avignon-based antipopes were:
*Clement VII: 1378–1394
*Benedict XIII: 1394–1423 (expelled from Avignon in 1403)
Benedict XIII was succeeded by three antipopes, who had little or no public following, and were not resident at Avignon:
*Clement VIII: 1423–1429 (recognized in the Crown of Aragon; abdicated)
*Benedict XIV (Bernard Garnier): 1424–1429 or 1430
*Benedict XIV (Jean Carrier): 1430?–1437

The period from 1378 to 1417, when there were rival claimants to the title of pope, is referred to as the &quot;Western Schism&quot; or &quot;the great controversy of the antipopes&quot; by some Catholic scholars and &quot;the second great schism&quot; by many secular and Protestant historians. Parties within the Catholic Church were divided in their allegiance among the various claimants to the office of pope. The Council of Constance finally resolved the controversy in 1417 when the election of Pope Martin V was accepted by all.

Avignon and the small enclave to the east (&quot;Comtat Venaissin&quot;) remained part of the Papal States until 1791 when, under pressure from French Revolutionaries, they were absorbed by the short-lived revolutionary Kingdom of France (1791–92), which, in turn, was abolished in favor of the French First Republic the following year.

==Background==
===Temporal role of the Roman Church===

The papacy in the Late Middle Ages played a major temporal role in addition to its spiritual role. The conflict between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor was fundamentally a dispute over which of them was the leader of Christendom in secular matters. In the early 14th century, the papacy was well past the prime of its secular rule – its importance had peaked in the 12th and 13th centuries. The success of the early Crusades added greatly to the prestige of the Popes as secular leaders of Christendom, with monarchs like those of England, France, and even the Holy Roman Emperor merely acting as marshals for the popes and leading &quot;their&quot; armies. One exception was Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was twice excommunicated by the Pope during a Crusade. Frederick II ignored this and was moderately successful in the Holy Land.

King Philip IV of France wanted to use the finances of the Church to pay for his war with the English. Pope Boniface VIII protested, leading to a feud.

This state of affairs culminated in the unbridled declaration of papal supremacy, &quot;Unam sanctam&quot;, in November 1302. In that papal bull, Pope Boniface VIII decreed that &quot;it is necessary to salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff.&quot; This was directed primarily to King Philip IV of France who responded by saying, &quot;Let thy foolishness know that in temporal things we are subject to no man.&quot;

In 1303 AD, Pope Boniface VIII followed up with a bull that would excommunicate the king of France and put an interdict over all France. Before this was finalized, Italian allies of the King of France broke into the papal residence and beat Pope Boniface VIII. He died shortly thereafter. Nicholas Boccasini was elected as his successor and took the name Pope Benedict XI. He absolved King Philip IV and his subjects of their actions against Pope Boniface VIII, though the culprits who assaulted Boniface were excommunicated and ordered to appear before a pontifical tribunal. Benedict XI died within eight months of being elected to the papacy. After eleven months, Bertrand de Got, a Frenchman and a personal friend of King Philip IV, was elected as pope and took the name Pope Clement V.

Beginning with Clement V, elected 1305, all popes during the Avignon papacy were French. However, this makes French influence seem greater than it was. Southern France (Occitania) at that time had a culture quite independent from Northern France, where most of the advisers to the King of France were based. The Kingdom of Arles was not yet part of France at that time, formally a part of the Holy Roman Empire. The literature produced by the troubadours in the Languedoc is unique and strongly distinct from that of Royal circles in the north. Even in terms of religion, the South produced its own variety of Christianity, Catharism, which was ultimately declared heretical. The movement was fueled in no small part by the strong sense of independence in the South even though the region had been severely weakened during the Albigensian Crusade a hundred years before. By the time of the Avignon Papacy, the power of the French King in this region was uncontested, although still not legally binding.

A stronger impact was made by the move of the Roman Curia from Rome to Poitiers in France in 1305, and then to Avignon in 1309. Following the impasse during the previous conclave, and to escape from the infighting of the powerful Roman families that had produced earlier Popes, such as the Colonna and Orsini families, the Catholic Church looked for a safer place and found it in Avignon, which was surrounded by the lands of the papal fief of Comtat Venaissin. Formally it was part of Arles, but in reality it was under the influence of the French king.

During its time in Avignon, the papacy adopted many features of the Royal court: the life-style of its cardinals was more reminiscent of princes than clerics; more and more French cardinals, often relatives of the ruling pope, took key positions; and the proximity of French troops was a constant reminder of where secular power lay, with the memory of Pope Boniface VIII still fresh.

===Centralization of Church administration===
The temporal role of the Catholic Church increased the pressure upon the papal court to emulate the governmental practices and procedures of secular courts. The Catholic Church successfully reorganised and centralized its administration under Clement V and John XXII. The papacy now directly controlled the appointments of benefices, abandoning the customary election process that traditionally allotted this considerable income.

Many other forms of payment brought riches to the Holy See and its cardinals: tithes, a ten-percent tax on church property; annates, the income of the first year after filling a position such as a bishopric; special taxes for crusades that never took place; and many forms of dispensation, from the entering of benefices without basic qualifications like literacy for newly appointed priests to the request of a converted Jew to visit his unconverted parents. Popes such as John XXII, Benedict XII, and Clement VI reportedly spent fortunes on expensive wardrobes, and silver and gold plates were used at banquets.

Overall the public life of leading church members began to resemble the lives of princes rather than members of the clergy. This splendor and corruption at the head of the Church found its way to the lower ranks: when a bishop had to pay up to a year&#x27;s income for gaining a benefice, he sought ways of raising this money from his new office. This was taken to extremes by the pardoners who sold absolutions for all kinds of sins. While pardoners were hated but popularly regarded as helpful to redeem one&#x27;s soul, the friars who were commonly regarded as failing to follow the Church&#x27;s moral commandments by ignoring their vows of chastity and poverty and were despised. This sentiment strengthened movements calling for a return to absolute poverty, relinquishment of all personal and ecclesiastical belongings, and preaching as the Lord and his disciples had.

===A political Church===
For the Catholic Church, an institution embedded in the secular structure and its focus on property, this was a dangerous development, and beginning in the early 14th century most of these movements were declared heretical. These included the Fraticelli and Waldensian movements in Italy and the Hussites in Bohemia (inspired by John Wycliffe in England). Furthermore, the display of wealth by the upper ranks of the church, which contrasted with the common expectation of poverty and strict adherence to principles, was used by enemies of the papacy to raise charges against the popes; King Philip of France employed this strategy, as did Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In his conflict with the latter, Pope John XXII excommunicated two leading philosophers, Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham, who were outspoken critics of the papacy, and who had found refuge with Louis IV in Munich. In response, William charged the pope with seventy errors and seven heresies.

The proceedings against the Knights Templar in the Council of Vienne are representative of this time, reflecting the various powers and their relationships. In 1314 the collegium at Vienne convened to make a ruling concerning the Templars. The council, overall unconvinced about the guilt of the order as a whole, was unlikely to condemn the entire order based on the scarce evidence brought forward. Exerting massive pressure in order to gain part of the substantial funds of the Order, the King managed to get the ruling he wanted, and Pope Clement V ordered by decree the suppression of the order.

In the cathedral of Saint Maurice in Vienne, the King of France and his son, the King of Navarre, were sitting next to him when he issued the decree. Under pain of excommunication, no one was allowed to speak at that occasion except when asked by the Pope. The Templars who appeared in Vienne to defend their order were not allowed to present their case—the cardinals of the collegium originally ruled that they should be allowed to raise a defense, but the arrival of the King of France in Vienne put pressure on the collegium, and that decision was revoked.

==Papacy in the 14th century==

===Curia===
After the arrest of the Bishop of Pamiers by Philip IV of France in 1301, Pope Boniface VIII issued the bull &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;, retracting all privileges granted to the French king by previous popes, and a few weeks later &quot;Ausculta fili&quot; with charges against the king, summoning him before a council to Rome. In a bold assertion of papal sovereignty, Boniface declared that &quot;God has placed us over the Kings and Kingdoms.&quot;

In response, Philip wrote &quot;Your venerable conceitedness may know, that we are nobody&#x27;s vassal in temporal matters,&quot; and called for a meeting of the Estates General, a council of the lords of France, who had supported his position. The King of France issued charges of sodomy, simony, sorcery, and heresy against the pope and summoned him before the council. The pope&#x27;s response was the strongest affirmation to date of papal sovereignty. In &quot;Unam sanctam&quot; (18 November 1302), he decreed that &quot;it is necessary to salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff.&quot;

He was preparing a bull that would excommunicate the King of France and put the interdict over France when in September 1303, William Nogaret, the strongest critic of the papacy in the French inner circle, led a delegation to Rome, with intentionally loose orders by the king to bring the pope, if necessary by force, before a council to rule on the charges brought against him. Nogaret coordinated with the cardinals of the Colonna family, long-standing rivals against whom the pope had even preached a crusade earlier in his papacy. In 1303 French and Italian troops attacked the pope in Anagni, his home town, and arrested him. He was freed three days later by the population of Anagni. Boniface VIII, then 68 years of age, was deeply shattered by this attack on his own person and died a few weeks later.

===Cooperation===

In reaction to the intransigence of Popes like Boniface VIII, the French tightened their influence under the papacy, eventually reducing the Popes to puppets and stacking the Papal court with French clerics.

The death of Pope Boniface VIII deprived the papacy of its most able politician who could stand against the secular power of the king of France. After the conciliatory papacy of Benedict XI (1303–04), Pope Clement V (1305–1314) became the next pontiff. He was born in Gascony, in southern France, but was not directly connected to the French court. He owed his election to the French clerics. He decided against moving to Rome and established his court in Avignon. In this situation of dependency on powerful neighbours in France, three principles characterized the politics of Clement V: the suppression of heretic movements (such as the Cathars in southern France); the reorganization of the internal administration of the church; and the preservation of an untainted image of the church as the sole instrument of God&#x27;s will on earth.

The latter was directly challenged by Philip IV when he demanded a posthumous trial of his former adversary, the late Boniface VIII, for alleged heresy. Phillip exerted strong influence on the cardinals of the collegium, and compliance with his demand could mean a severe blow to the church&#x27;s authority. Much of Clement&#x27;s politics was designed to avoid such a blow, which he finally did (persuading Phillip to leave the trial to the Council of Vienne, where it lapsed). However, the price won concessions on various fronts; despite strong personal doubts, Clement supported Phillipe&#x27;s proceedings against the Templars, and he personally ruled to suppress the order.

One important issue during the papacy of Pope John XXII (born Jacques Duèze in Cahors, and previously archbishop in Avignon) was his conflict with Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who denied the sole authority of the Pope to crown the Emperor. Louis followed the example of Philippe IV, and summoned the nobles of Germany to back his position. Marsilius of Padua justified secular supremacy in the territory of the Holy Roman Empire. This conflict with the Emperor, often fought out in expensive wars, drove the papacy even more into the arms of the French king.

Pope Benedict XII (1334–1342), born Jacques Fournier in Pamiers, was previously active in the inquisition against the Cathar movement. In contrast to the rather bloody picture of the Inquisition in general, he was reported to be very careful about the souls of the examined, taking a lot of time in the proceedings. His interest in pacifying southern France was also motivation for mediating between the King of France and the King of England, before the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

===Submission===
Under Pope Clement VI (1342–1352) the French interests started dominating the papacy. Clement VI had been Archbishop of Rouen and adviser to Philippe IV before, so his links to the French court were much stronger than those of his predecessors. At some point he even financed French war efforts out of his own pockets. He reportedly loved luxurious wardrobe and under his rule the extravagant life style in Avignon reached new heights.

Clement VI was also pope during the Black Death, the epidemic that swept through Europe between 1347 and 1350 and is believed to have killed about one-third of Europe&#x27;s population. Also during his reign, in 1348, the Avignon papacy bought the city of Avignon from the Angevins.
Pope Innocent VI (1352–1362), born Etienne Aubert, was less partisan than Clement VI. He was keen on establishing peace between France and England, having worked to this end in papal delegations in 1345 and 1348. His gaunt appearance and austere manners commanded higher respect in the eyes of nobles at both sides of the conflict. However, he was also indecisive and impressionable, already an old man when being elected Pope. In this situation, the King of France managed to influence the papacy, although papal legates played key roles in various attempts to stop the conflict.

Most notably in 1353 the Bishop of Porto, Guy de Boulogne, tried to set up a conference. After initial successful talks the effort failed, largely due to the mistrust from the English side over Guy&#x27;s strong ties with the French court. In a letter Innocent VI himself wrote to the Duke of Lancaster: &quot;Although we were born in France and although for that and other reasons we hold the realm of France in special affection, yet in working for peace we have put aside our private prejudices and tried to serve the interests of everyone.&quot;

With Pope Urban V (1362–1370), the control by Charles V of France of the papacy became more direct. Urban V himself is described as the most austere of the Avignon popes after Benedict XII and probably the most spiritual of all. However, he was not a strategist and made substantial concessions to the French crown especially in finances, a crucial issue during the war with England. In 1369 Pope Urban V supported the marriage of Philip the Bold of the Duchy of Burgundy and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, rather than giving dispensation to one of Edward III of England&#x27;s sons to marry Margaret. This clearly showed the partisanship of the papacy; correspondingly, the respect for the church dropped.

===War of the Eight Saints===
The most influential decision in the reign of Pope Gregory XI (1370–1378) was the return to Rome, beginning on 13 September 1376 and ending with his arrival on 17 January 1377. Although the Pope was French born and still under strong influence by the French King, the increasing conflict between factions friendly and hostile to the Pope posed a threat to the papal lands and to the allegiance of Rome itself. When the papacy established an embargo against grain exports during a food scarcity 1374 and 1375, Florence organized several cities into a league against the papacy: Milan, Bologna, Perugia, Pisa, Lucca and Genoa.

The papal legate, Robert of Geneva, a relative of the House of Savoy, pursued a particularly ruthless policy against the league to re-establish control over these cities. He convinced Pope Gregory to hire Breton mercenaries. To quell an uprising of the inhabitants of Cesena he hired John Hawkwood and had the majority of the people massacred (between 2,500 and 3,500 people were reported dead). Following such events opposition against the papacy strengthened.

Florence came in open conflict with the Pope, a conflict called &quot;the war of the eight saints&quot; in reference to the eight Florentine councilors who were chosen to orchestrate the conflict. The entire city of Florence was excommunicated and as reply the forwarding of clerical taxes was stopped. Trade was seriously hampered and both sides had to find a solution. In his decision about returning to Rome, the Pope was also under the influence of Catherine of Siena, later canonized, who preached for a return to Rome.

===Schism===

This resolution was short-lived when, having returned the papal court to Rome, Pope Gregory XI died. A conclave met and elected an Italian pope, Urban VI. Pope Urban alienated the French cardinals, who held a second conclave electing one of their own, Robert of Geneva, who took the name Clement VII, to succeed Gregory XI, thus beginning a second line of Avignon popes. Clement VII and his successors are not regarded as legitimate, and are referred to as antipopes by the Catholic Church. This situation, known as the Western Schism, persisted from 1378 until the ecumenical Council of Constance (1414–1418) settled the question of papal succession and declared the French conclave of 1378 to be invalid. A new Pope, Pope Martin V, was elected in 1417; other claimants to succeed to Avignon line (though not resident at Avignon) continued until c. 1437.

==Legacy==
The period has been called the &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot; of the popes. When and where this term originated is uncertain although it may have sprung from Petrarch, who in a letter to a friend (1340–1353) written during his stay at Avignon, described Avignon of that time as the &quot;Babylon of the west&quot;, referring to the worldly practices of the church hierarchy. The nickname is polemical, in referring to the claim by critics that the prosperity of the church at that time was accompanied by a profound compromise of the papacy&#x27;s spiritual integrity, especially in the alleged subordination of the powers of the Church to the ambitions of the French kings. As noted, the &quot;captivity&quot; of the popes at Avignon lasted about the same amount of time as the exile of the Jews in Babylon, making the analogy convenient and rhetorically potent. The Avignon papacy has been and is often today depicted as being totally dependent on the French kings, and sometimes as even being treacherous to its spiritual role and its heritage in Rome.

Almost a century and a half later, Protestant reformer Martin Luther wrote his treatise &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot; (1520), but he claimed it had nothing to do with the Western Schism or papacy in Avignon.

==Effects on the papacy==
The relationship between the papacy and France changed drastically over the course of the 14th century. Starting with open conflict between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV of France, it turned to cooperation from 1305 to 1342, and finally to a papacy under strong influence by the French throne up to 1378. Such partisanship of the papacy was one of the reasons for the dropping esteem for the institution, which in turn was one of the reasons for the schism from 1378 to 1417.

In the period of the Schism, the power struggle in the papacy became a battlefield of the major powers, with France supporting the antipopes in Avignon and England supporting the popes in Rome. At the end of the century, still in the state of schism, the papacy had lost most of its direct political power, and the nation states of France and England were established as two of the main powers in Europe.

<text>Twyla Tharp (; born July 1, 1941) is an American dancer, choreographer, and author who lives and works in New York City. In 1965 she formed the company Twyla Tharp Dance, which merged with American Ballet Theatre in 1988. She regrouped the company in 1991. Her work often uses classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music.

From 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works. In 1973 Tharp choreographed &quot;Deuce Coupe&quot; to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. &quot;Deuce Coupe&quot; is considered the first &quot;crossover ballet&quot;, a mix of ballet and modern dance. Later she choreographed &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.

On May 24, 2018, Tharp was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree by Harvard University.

==Early life and education==
Tharp was born in 1941 on a farm in Portland, Indiana, the daughter of William Tharp and Lecile (Confer) Tharp. She was named for Twila Thornburg, the &quot;Pig Princess&quot; of the 89th Annual Muncie Fair.

As a child, Tharp spent a few months each year living with her Quaker grandparents on their farm in Indiana. She would attend Quaker services three times a week.

Tharp&#x27;s mother insisted she take lessons in dance, various musical instruments, shorthand, German and French. In 1950, Tharp&#x27;s family—younger sister Twanette, twin brothers Stanley and Stanford, and her parents—moved to Rialto, California. William and Lecile operated Tharp Motors and Tharp Autos in Rialto. They opened a drive-in theater, where Tharp worked. The drive-in was on the corner of Acacia and Foothill, Rialto&#x27;s major east–west artery and the path of Route 66. She attended Pacific High School in San Bernardino, studied at the Vera Lynn School of Dance, and studied ballet with Beatrice Collenette. A &quot;devoted bookworm&quot;, Tharp has said her schedule left little time for a social life. She attended Pomona College, but transferred to Barnard College after being caught making out with her boyfriend and threatened with expulsion. She graduated from Barnard with a degree in art history in 1963. In New York City, she studied with Richard Thomas, Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. In 1963, Tharp joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company.

==Career==
===Dances and ballets===
In 1965, Tharp choreographed her first dance, &quot;Tank Dive&quot;, and formed her own company, Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often utilizes classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. From 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works.

In 1973, Tharp choreographed &quot;Deuce Coupe&quot; to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. &quot;Deuce Coupe&quot; is considered the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.

In 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre, since which time ABT has premiered 16 of Tharp&#x27;s works. In 2010 it had 20 of her works in its repertory. Tharp has since choreographed dances for Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Boston Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Miami City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Hubbard Street Dance and Martha Graham Dance Company. She also created the dance roadshow &quot;Cutting Up&quot; (1992) with Baryshnikov, which went on to tour and appeared in 28 cities over two months.

In 2000, Twyla Tharp Dance regrouped with entirely new dancers. This company also performed around the world, and with it Tharp developed the material that became &quot;Movin&#x27; Out,&quot; an award-winning Broadway musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel and starring many of the dancers in the company.

In 2012, Tharp created the full-length ballet &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot;, based on George MacDonald&#x27;s story &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot;. It is her first ballet to include children, and was co-commissioned by Atlanta Ballet and Royal Winnipeg Ballet and performed by both companies.

Tharp was the first Artist in Residency (A.I.R.) at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. During this time she created and premiered &quot;Waiting At The Station&quot;, a work with music by R&amp;B artist Allen Toussaint and sets and costumes by longtime collaborator Santo Loquasto.

A number of prominent fashion designers have designed costumes for Tharp, including Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, and Norma Kamali.

===Broadway===
In 1980, Tharp&#x27;s work first appeared on Broadway with Twyla Tharp Dance performing &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, followed in 1981 by &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot;, her collaboration with David Byrne at the Winter Garden. &quot;Wheel&quot; was broadcast on PBS and its soundtrack released on LP. Her dance piece &quot;Fait Accompli&quot; was set to music by David Van Tieghem as released on the These Things Happen LP (1984).

In 1985, her staging of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; played at the Gershwin for 367 performances.

Tharp premiered her dance musical &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel, in Chicago in 2001. The show opened on Broadway in 2002. &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. A national tour opened in January 2004. It received 10 Tony nominations and Tharp won Best Choreographer.

Tharp opened a new show, &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, to the music of Bob Dylan in 2005 at The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. &quot;The Times They are A-Changin&quot;&#x27; set the records for the highest-grossing show and highest ticket sales as of the date of closing (March 2006). It was also the first show to receive a second extension before the first preview. After its run in California, the New York show ran for 35 previews and 28 performances.

In 2009, Tharp worked with the songs of Frank Sinatra to mount &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, which ran at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta and was the best-selling four-week run as of the date of closing in 2009. Renamed &quot;Come Fly Away&quot;, the show opened on Broadway in 2010 at the Marquis Theatre and ran for 26 previews and 188 performances. &quot;Come Fly Away,&quot; was retooled and opened under the title &quot;Sinatra: Dance with Me&quot; at The Wynn Las Vegas in 2011. &quot;Come Fly Away&quot; National Tour opened in Atlanta in August 2011.

===Film and television===
Tharp collaborated with film directors Miloš Forman on &quot;Hair&quot; (1978), &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1980) and &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1983); Taylor Hackford on &quot;White Nights&quot; (1985); and James Brooks on &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; (1994).

Her television credits include choreographing &quot;Sue&#x27;s Leg&quot; (1976) for the inaugural episode of the PBS program &quot;Dance in America&quot;; co-producing and directing &quot;Making Television Dance&quot; (1977), which won the Chicago International Film Festival Award; and directing &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot; (1983) for BBC Television. Tharp co-directed the award-winning television special &quot;Baryshnikov by Tharp&quot; in 1984.

===Author===
Tharp has written four books: an early autobiography, &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; (1992; Bantam Books); &quot;The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life&quot; (2003, Simon &amp; Schuster), translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Thai and Japanese; &quot;The Collaborative Habit&quot; (2009, Simon &amp; Schuster), translated into Thai, Chinese and Korean; and &quot;Keep It Moving&quot; (2019). She has said that &quot;The Creative Habit&quot; is about cybernetics, especially in the several Greek-themed creative exercises, such as the Coin Drop; the Coin Drop, as an exercise in extracting ordered meaning from chaos, is derived from the astrological muse Urania, in that random coins falling onto a flat surface can be used to develop pattern analysis skills. The astrological theme is an etymological underpinning of cybernetics&#x27; tradition of &quot;guiding a boat&quot; by sighting stellar references according to ancient Greek navigation.

<text>The Balthasar Behem Codex, also known as &quot;Codex Picturatus&quot;, is a collection of the charters, privileges and statutes of the burghers of the city of Kraków. Compiled in 1505, the codex was named for the chancellor at the time, Balthasar Behem. The book&#x27;s text is in German, Latin and Polish. It is now held at the library of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków.

The bylaws of the guilds are featured in twenty-seven illustrations in the codex and depict both biblical subjects and the daily activities of the Kraków burgher guild members, for example that of bakers, titled in Latin: &quot;Pistores&quot;, with a subtitle in German: &quot;Das ist der briff und geseccze der becker von Krakow.&quot; (&quot;This is the letter and law of the bakers in Cracow&quot;, example in color), and the text calligraphed in Latin.

This kind of illustration - showing the practice of trades - was a tradition with an iconographical history going back to late Roman astronomical texts showing the &quot;Labours of the Months&quot;, pairing a characteristic activity of rural life with the astrological sign for that month. Historians of culture and art have shown that these illustrations sometimes reflect their iconographical traditions rather than actually depicting contemporary life with accuracy .

<doc id="38180" wikidata="Q11460" url="?curid=38180" title="Clothing">
<text>Clothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on the body. Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations. Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head, and underwear covers the private parts.

Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. It may be used to prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats. Clothing is used for protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare. Fashioned with pockets, belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands.

Clothing has significant social factors as well. Wearing clothes is a variable social norm. It may connote modesty. Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing. In many parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breast, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure. Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs. Clothing also may be used to communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism.

Some forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor&#x27;s white coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect). More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified as protective accessories. At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form-fitting body covers, and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to amount to more of a tool than a garment. This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption and flexible electronic substrates.

Clothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants, other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market — where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise). A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble.

==Origin and history==


===Early use===

Estimates of when humans began wearing clothes vary from 40,000 to as many as 3 million years ago, but recent studies suggest humans were wearing clothing at least 100,000 years ago. Recent studies by Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking—anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology—have attempted to constrain the most recent date of the introduction of clothing with an indirect method relying on lice. The rationale for this method of dating stems from the fact that the human body louse cannot live outside of clothing, dying after only a few hours without shelter. This strongly implies that the date of the body louse&#x27;s speciation from its parent, &quot;Pediculus humanus&quot;, can have taken place no earlier than the earliest human adoption of clothing. This date, at which the body louse (&quot;P. humanus corporis&quot;) diverged from both its parent species and its sibling subspecies, the head louse (&quot;P. humanus capitis&quot;), can be determined by the number of mutations each has developed during the intervening time. Such mutations occur at a known rate and the date of last-common-ancestor for two species can therefore be estimated from their frequency. These studies have produced dates for speciation ranging from 40,000 to 170,000 years before present, with the most likely estimates being roughly 107,000 years ago.

Kittler, Kayser and Stoneking suggest that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; away from the warm climate of Africa, which is thought to have begun between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. A second group of researchers, also relying on the genetic clock, estimate that clothing originated between 30,000 and 114,000 years ago.

Dating with direct archeological evidence produces dates consistent with those of lice. In September 2021, scientists reported evidence of clothes being made 120,000 years ago based on findings in deposits in Morocco.

The development of clothing is deeply connected to human evolution, with early garments likely consisting of animal skins and natural fibers adapted for protection and social signaling. According to anthropologists and archaeologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that was draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, as clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared with stone, bone, shell, and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in 1988, and in 2016 a needle at least 50,000 years old from Denisova Cave in Siberia made by Denisovans. Dyed flax fibers that date back to 34,000 BC and could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in Georgia.

===Making clothing===

Several distinct human cultures, including those residing in the Arctic Circle, have historically crafted their garments exclusively from treated and adorned animal furs and skins. In contrast, numerous other societies have complemented or substituted leather and skins with textiles woven, knitted, or twined from a diverse array of animal and plant fibers, such as wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and ramie.
Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The textile industry was the first to be mechanized – with the powered loom – during the Industrial Revolution.

Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit – for example, the dhoti for men and the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt, and the Javanese sarong. The clothes may be tied up (dhoti and sari) or implement pins or belts to hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various sizes can wear the garment.

Another approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a sewing machine. Clothing can be cut from a sewing pattern and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer&#x27;s measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or dress form is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as gussets. Traditional European patterns for shirts and chemises take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork pockets, hats, vests, and skirts.

Modern European fashion treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; domestic sewers may turn them into quilts.

In the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, photographs, paintings, mosaics, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current fashion designers, as well as costumiers for plays, films, television, and historical reenactment.

== Clothing as comfort ==

Comfort is related to various perceptions, physiological, social, and psychological needs, and after food, it is clothing that satisfies these comfort needs. Clothing provides aesthetic, tactile, thermal, moisture, and pressure comfort.
;Aesthetic comfort: Visual perception is influenced by color, fabric construction, style, garment fit, fashion compatibility, and finish of clothing material. Aesthetic comfort is necessary for psychological and social comfort.
;Thermoregulation and thermophysiological comfort: Thermophysiological comfort is the capacity of the clothing material that makes the balance of moisture and heat between the body and the environment. It is a property of textile materials that creates ease by maintaining moisture and thermal levels in a human&#x27;s resting and active states. The selection of textile material significantly affects the comfort of the wearer. Different textile fibers have unique properties that make them suitable for use in various environments. Natural fibers are breathable and absorb moisture, and synthetic fibers are hydrophobic; they repel moisture and do not allow air to pass. Different environments demand a diverse selection of clothing materials. Hence, the appropriate choice is important. The major determinants that influence thermophysiological comfort are permeable construction, heat, and moisture transfer rate.
;Thermal comfort: One primary criterion for our physiological needs is thermal comfort. The heat dissipation effectiveness of clothing gives the wearer a neither very hot nor very cold feel. The optimum temperature for thermal comfort of the skin surface is between , i.e., a neutral temperature. Thermophysiology reacts whenever the temperature falls below or exceeds the neutral point on either side; it is discomforting below 28 and above 30 degrees. Clothing maintains a thermal balance; it keeps the skin dry and cool. It helps to keep the body from overheating while avoiding heat from the environment.
;Moisture comfort: Moisture comfort is the prevention of a damp sensation. According to Hollies&#x27; research, it feels uncomfortable when more than &quot;50% to 65% of the body is wet.&quot;
;Tactile comfort: Tactile comfort is a resistance to the discomfort related to the friction created by clothing against the body. It is related to the smoothness, roughness, softness, and stiffness of the fabric used in clothing. The degree of tactile discomfort may vary between individuals, which is possible due to various factors including allergies, tickling, prickling, skin abrasion, coolness, and the fabric&#x27;s weight, structure, and thickness. There are specific surface finishes (mechanical and chemical) that can enhance tactile comfort. Fleece sweatshirts and velvet clothing, for example. Soft, clingy, stiff, heavy, light, hard, sticky, scratchy, prickly are all terms used to describe tactile sensations.
;Pressure comfort: The comfort of the human body&#x27;s pressure receptors&#x27; (present in the skin) sensory response towards clothing. Fabric with lycra feels more comfortable because of this response and superior pressure comfort. The sensation response is influenced by the material&#x27;s structure: snugging, looseness, heavy, light, soft, or stiff structuring.

==Functions==
The most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. It serves to prevent wind damage and provides protection from sunburn. In the cold, it offers thermal insulation. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing generally are worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones. Boots, hats, jackets, ponchos, and coats designed to protect from rain and snow are specialized clothing items.

Clothing has been made from a wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and furs to woven fabrics, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn normally are considered accessories rather than clothing (such as Handbags), items worn on a single part of the body and easily removed (scarves), worn purely for adornment (jewelry), or items that do not serve a protective function. For instance, corrective eyeglasses, Arctic goggles, and sunglasses would not be considered an accessory because of their protective functions.

Clothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the naked human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small, or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as insects, toxic chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances.

Humans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as space suits, armor, diving suits, swimsuits, bee-keeper gear, motorcycle leathers, high-visibility clothing, and other pieces of protective clothing. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value, and clothes designed for function often have corporate fashion in their design.

The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure appropriate clothing due to poverty or affordability, or lack of inclination, sometimes is said to be worn, ragged, or shabby.

Clothing performs a range of social and cultural functions, such as individual, occupational, gender differentiation, and social status. In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty, religion, gender, and social status. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.

==Scholarship==
===Function of clothing===

Serious books on clothing and its functions appear from the nineteenth century as European colonial powers interacted with new environments such as tropical ones in Asia. Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing in the first half of the twentieth century, with publications such as J.C. Flügel&#x27;s &quot;Psychology of Clothes&quot; in 1930, and Newburgh&#x27;s seminal &quot;Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing&quot; in 1949. By 1968, the field of Environmental Physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little. There has since been considerable research, and the knowledge base has grown significantly, but the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed, Newburgh&#x27;s book continues to be cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.

===History of clothing===

Clothing reveals much about human history. According to Professor Kiki Smith of Smith College, garments preserved in collections are resources for study similar to books and paintings. Scholars around the world have studied a wide range of clothing topics, including the history of specific items of clothing, clothing styles in different cultural groups, and the business of clothing and fashion. The textile curator Linda Baumgarten writes that &quot;clothing provides a remarkable picture of the daily lives, beliefs, expectations, and hopes of those who lived in the past.

Clothing presents a number of challenges to historians. Clothing made of textiles or skins is subject to decay, and the erosion of physical integrity may be seen as a loss of cultural information. Costume collections often focus on important pieces of clothing considered unique or otherwise significant, limiting the opportunities scholars have to study everyday clothing.

==Cultural aspects==
Clothing has long served as a marker of social status, gender, and cultural identity, reflecting broader societal structures and values.

===Gender differentiation===

In most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.

In contemporary Western societies, skirts, dresses, and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women&#x27;s clothing, while neckties usually are seen as men&#x27;s clothing. Trousers were once seen as exclusively men&#x27;s clothing, but nowadays are worn by both genders. Men&#x27;s clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles is available for women. Typically, men are allowed to bare their chests in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual. Contemporary men may sometimes choose to wear men&#x27;s skirts such as togas or kilts in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. In previous times, such garments often were worn as normal daily clothing by men.

In some cultures, sumptuary laws regulate what men and women are required to wear. Islam requires women to wear certain forms of attire, usually hijab. What items required varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear under these laws or traditions range from the head-scarf to the burqa.

Some contemporary clothing styles designed to be worn by either gender, such as T-shirts, have started out as menswear, but some articles, such as the fedora, originally were a style for women.

===Social status===

During the early modern period, individuals utilized their attire as a significant method of conveying and asserting their social status. Individuals employed the utilization of high-quality fabrics and trendy designs as a means of communicating their wealth and social standing, as well as an indication of their knowledge and understanding of current fashion trends to the general public. As a result, clothing played a significant role in making the social hierarchy perceptible to all members of society.

In some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or status. In ancient Rome, for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with Tyrian purple. In traditional Hawaiian society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear feather cloaks and palaoa, or carved whale teeth. In China, before establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow. History provides many examples of elaborate sumptuary laws that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, peer pressure influences clothing choice.

===Religion===
Some religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may be worn every day as a marker for special religious status. Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.

In some religions such as Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism the cleanliness of religious dresses is of paramount importance and considered to indicate purity. Jewish ritual requires rending (tearing) of one&#x27;s upper garment as a sign of mourning. The Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: &quot;...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them&quot; (chapter 2:187). Christian clergy members wear religious vestments during liturgical services and may wear specific non-liturgical clothing at other times.

Clothing appears in numerous contexts in the Bible. The most prominent passages are: the story of Adam and Eve who made coverings for themselves out of fig leaves, Joseph&#x27;s coat of many colors, and the clothing of Judah and Tamar, Mordecai and Esther. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.

==Contemporary clothing==
=== Western dress code ===
The Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years. The mechanization of the textile industry made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices. Styles have changed, and the availability of synthetic fabrics has changed the definition of what is &quot;stylish&quot;. In the latter half of the twentieth century, blue jeans became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire. Activewear has also become a large and growing market.
In the Western dress code, jeans are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found that include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.

The licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers such as Pierre Cardin, Yves Saint Laurent, and Guy Laroche in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include Marc Jacobs and Gucci, named for Marc Jacobs Guccio Gucci respectively.

=== Spread of western styles ===
By the early years of the twenty-first century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European colonialism. The process of cultural dissemination has been perpetuated over the centuries, spreading Western culture and styles, most recently as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world. Fast fashion clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Also, donated used clothing from Western countries is delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.

=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===
People may wear ethnic or national dress on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional hanboks on special occasions, such as weddings and cultural holidays. Also, items of Western dress may be worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used T-shirt with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or tupenu.

===Sport and activity===
For practical, comfort or safety reasons, most sports and physical activities are practised wearing special clothing. Common sportswear garments include shorts, T-shirts, tennis shirts, leotards, tracksuits, and trainers. Specialized garments include wet suits (for swimming, diving, or surfing), salopettes (for skiing), and leotards (for gymnastics). Also, spandex materials often are used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, track and field, dance, gymnastics, and swimming.
=== Fashion ===

Paris set the 1900–1940 fashion trends for Europe and North America. In the 1920s the goal was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, every day. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Day wear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleated, hank hemmed, or tiered. Jewelry was not conspicuous. Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.

In the early twenty-first century a diverse range of styles exists in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive haute couture, to traditional garb, to thrift store grunge. Fashion shows are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.

==Political issues==

===Working conditions in the garments industry===


Although mechanization transformed most aspects of human clothing industry, by the mid-twentieth century, garment workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. Often, mass-produced clothing is made in what are considered by some to be sweatshops, typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured under similar conditions.

Coalitions of NGOs, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, American Apparel, Veja, Quiksilver, eVocal, and Edun), and campaign groups such as the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) and the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights as well as textile and clothing trade unions have sought to improve these conditions by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the plight of the workers.

Outsourcing production to low wage countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka became possible when the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a protectionist measure. Although many countries recognize treaties such as the International Labour Organization, which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.

The production of textiles has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.

===Fur===

The use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. Currently, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection, in developed countries it is associated with expensive, designer clothing. Once uncontroversial, recently it has been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. PETA and other animal and animal liberation groups have called attention to fur farming and other practices they consider cruel.

Real fur in fashion is contentious, with Copenhagen (2022) and London (2018) fashion weeks banning real fur in its runway shows following protests and government attention to the issue. Fashion houses such as Gucci and Chanel have banned the use of fur in its garments. Versace and Furla also stopped using fur in their collections in early 2018. In 2020, the outdoor brand Canada Goose announced it would discontinue the use of new coyote fur on parka trims following protests.

Governing bodies have issued legislation banning the sale of new real fur garments. In 2021, Israel was the first government to ban the sale of real fur garments, with the exception of those worn as part of a religious faith. In 2019, the state of California banned fur trapping, with a total ban on the sale of all new fur garments except those made of sheep, cow, and rabbit fur going into effect on January 1, 2023.

==Life cycle==

===Clothing maintenance===
Clothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and it exudes sweat, urine, and feces that may soil clothing. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. If not cleaned and refurbished, clothing becomes worn and loses its aesthetics and functionality (as when buttons fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and zippers fail).

Often, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials such as these inevitably age.

Most clothing consists of cloth, however, and most cloth can be laundered and mended (patching, darning, but compare felt).

=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===

Humans have developed many specialized methods for laundering clothing, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic washing machines and dry cleaning (dissolving dirt in solvents other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning, and ironing are all traditional methods of sterilizing fabrics for hygiene purposes.

Many kinds of clothing are designed to be ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, dress shirts and suits). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is permanent press, having been treated with a coating (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing. Excess lint or debris may end up on the clothing in between launderings. In such cases, a lint remover may be useful.

Once clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, usually they are hung on clothes hangers or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases, or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance, when they are put on sale in stores.

Certain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the black carpet beetle and clothing moths. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as lavender or mothballs. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may deter insect pest damage to clothing materials as well.

===Non-iron===

A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde, which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants. In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after six months of routine washing, 7 of 27 shirts still had levels in excess of 75 ppm (the safe limit for direct skin exposure).

===Mending===
When the raw material – cloth – was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous tailor or seamstress could mend rips with thread raveled from hems and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace zippers and buttons and sew up ripped hems, however. Other mending techniques include darning and invisible mending or upcycling through visible mending inspired in Japanese Sashiko.

===Recycling===

It is estimated that 80 billion to 150 billion garments are produced annually. Used, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for quilts, rags, rugs, bandages, and many other household uses. Neutral colored or undyed cellulose fibers can be recycled into paper. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a clothing bin). It is also sold to consignment shops, dress agencies, flea markets, and in online auctions. Also, used clothing often is collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries. Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion, with the U.S. as the leading exporter at $575 million.

Synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals, are not renewable or biodegradable.

Excess inventory of clothing is sometimes destroyed to preserve brand value.

==Global trade==

EU member states imported €166 billion of clothes in 2018; 51% came from outside the EU (€84 billion). EU member states exported €116 billion of clothes in 2018, including 77% to other EU member states.

According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) report, the value of global clothing exports in 2022 reached US$790.1 billion, up 10.6% from 2021. China is the world&#x27;s largest clothing exporter, with a value of US$178.4 billion, accounting for 22.6% of the global market share. Next are Bangladesh (US$40.8 billion), Vietnam (US$39.8 billion), India (US$36.1 billion), and Turkey (US$29.7 billion).

In Vietnam, clothing exports continue to be one of the leading export sectors, contributing significantly to the export turnover and economic growth of the country. According to the General Department of Customs of Vietnam, the value of Vietnam&#x27;s clothing exports in 2022 reached US$39.8 billion, up 14.2% from 2021. Of which, clothing exports to the United States reached US$18.8 billion, accounting for 47.3% of the market share; exports to the EU reached US$9.8 billion, accounting for 24.6% of the market share.

<text>The United States Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) Teams, commonly known as Navy SEALs, are the United States Navy&#x27;s primary special operations force and a component of the United States Naval Special Warfare Command. Among the SEALs&#x27; main functions are conducting small-unit special operation missions in maritime, jungle, urban, arctic, mountainous, and desert environments. SEALs are typically ordered to capture or kill high-level targets, or to gather intelligence behind enemy lines. SEAL team personnel are hand-selected, highly trained, and possess a high degree of proficiency in unconventional warfare (UW), direct action (DA), and special reconnaissance (SR), among other tasks like sabotage, demolition, intelligence gathering, and hydrographic reconnaissance, training, and advising friendly militaries or other forces. All active SEALs are members of the U.S. Navy.

==History==
===Origins===
Although not formally founded until 1962, the modern-day U.S. Navy SEALs trace their roots to World War II. The United States Military recognized the need for the covert reconnaissance of landing beaches and coastal defenses. As a result, the joint Army, Marine Corps, and Navy Amphibious Scout and Raider School was established in 1942 at Fort Pierce, Florida. The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, from the Observer Group, a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit.

=== Scouts and Raiders ===
Recognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Little Creek, Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (Joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders&#x27; mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach. The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy Chief Petty Officers and sailors came from the boat pool at U. S. Naval Amphibious Training Base, Solomons, Maryland, and Army Raider personnel came from the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. Operation Torch was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa.

The first group included Phil H. Bucklew, the &quot;Father of Naval Special Warfare,&quot; after whom the Naval Special Warfare Center building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during Operation Torch on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, Normandy, and southern France.

The second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named Special Service Unit No. 1, was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and combined operations force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at Finschhafen in Papua New Guinea. Later operations were at Gasmata, Arawe, Cape Gloucester, and the east and south coasts of New Britain, all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed 7th Amphibious Scouts, received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles, and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.

The third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO). To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral Ernest J. King ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for &quot;Amphibious Raider&quot; at the Scout and Raider school at Fort Pierce, Florida. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a &quot;guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes, and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.&quot; While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at Camp Knox in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper Yangtze River in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as coolies, conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from Shanghai to Kitchioh Wan, near Hong Kong.

=== Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs) ===
In September 1942, 17 Navy salvage personnel arrived at ATB Little Creek, Virginia for a week-long course in demolitions, explosive cable cutting, and commando raiding techniques. On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during Operation Torch in North Africa. This enabled to traverse the water and insert U.S. Rangers who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.

In early May 1943, a two-phase &quot;Naval Demolition Project&quot; was directed by the Chief of Naval Operations &quot;to meet a present and urgent requirement&quot;. The first phase began at ATB Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the Seabee&#x27;s NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily. At that time Lieutenant Commander Draper L. Kauffman, &quot;The Father of Naval Combat Demolition,&quot; was selected to set up a school for Naval Demolitions and direct the entire Project. The first six classes graduated from &quot;Area E&quot; at NTC Camp Peary. LCDR Kauffman&#x27;s needs quickly out-grew &quot;Area E&quot; and on 6 June 1943, he established NCDU training at Fort Pierce. Most of Kauffman&#x27;s volunteers came from the navy&#x27;s Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) and enlisted Seabees. Training commenced with a grueling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates. Eventually given the name &quot;Hell Week&quot; by NCDU recruits, this rigorous course was integrated into UDT training and remains a part of modern-day Navy Seal training today.

By April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for Operation Overlord, the amphibious landing at Normandy. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at Omaha Beach managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at Utah Beach met less intense enemy fire. They cleared of beach in two hours, another by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944, four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings Operation Dragoon in southern France. It was the last amphibious operation in the European Theater of Operations. Once the European invasions were complete, Rear Admiral Kelly Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) operating in the Pacific Theater.

Thirty NCDUs had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy. NCDUs 1–10 were staged on Florida Island in the Solomon Islands (archipelago) during January 1944. NCDU 1 went briefly to the Aleutians in 1943. NCDUs 4 and 5 were the first to see combat by helping the 4th Marines at Green Island and Emirau Island. A few were temporarily attached to UDTs. Later NCDUs 1–10 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able. Six NCDUs: 2,3, 19, 20, 21 and 24 served with the Seventh Amphibious Force and were the only remaining NCDUs at the end of the war. The Naval Special Warfare Command building is named for LTJG Frank Kaine CEC commander of NCDU 2.

=== Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) ===
The first units designated as Underwater Demolition Teams were formed in the Pacific Theater. Rear Admiral Kelly Turner, the Navy&#x27;s top amphibious expert, ordered the formation of Underwater Demolition Teams in response to the failed invasion at Tarawa and the Marines&#x27; inability to clear the surrounding coral reefs with Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVTS). Turner recognized that amphibious operations required intelligence of underwater obstacles. The personnel for these teams were mostly local Seabees or others that had started out in the NCDUs. UDT training was at the Waipio Amphibious Operating Base, under V Amphibious Corps operational and administrative control. Most of the instructors and trainees were graduates of the Fort Pierce NCDU or Scouts and Raiders schools, Seabees, Marines, and Army soldiers.

When Teams 1 and 2 were initially formed, they were &quot;provisional&quot; with 180 men in total. The first underwater demolition team commanders were CDR E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and CDR John T. Koehler UDT 2. The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats—similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein Fort Pierce protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC. ENS Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Acheson wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat. They stripped down and spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out they were taken directly to Admiral Turner&#x27;s flagship to report, still in their trunks. Admiral Turner concluded that daylight reconnaissance by individual swimmers was the way to get accurate information on coral and underwater obstacles for upcoming landings. This is what he reported to Admiral Nimitz. The success of those UDT 1 Seabees not following Fort Pierce protocol rewrote the UDT mission model and training regimen. Those Seabees also created the image of UDTs as the &quot;naked warriors&quot;. At Engebi CDR Brewster was wounded and all of the men with ENS Luehrs wore swim trunks under their greens.

After the operations in the Marshall Islands, Admiral Turner restructured the two provisional UDT units and created 7 permanent units with an allotted size of 96 men per team. In the name of operational efficiency, the UDTs were also made an-all Navy outfit, and any Army and Marine corp engineers were returned to their units. Moving forward, the UDTs would employ the reconnaissance method made successful in Kwajalein – daytime use of swimsuits and goggles instead of the Scouts and Raiders method of nighttime rubber boats. In order to implement these changes and grow the UDTs, Koehler was made the commanding officer of the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base on Maui. Admiral Turner also brought on LCDR Draper Kauffman as a combat officer.

Seabees made up the vast majority of the men in teams 1–9, 13, and 15. Seabees were roughly 20% of UDT 11. The officers were mostly CEC.
At war&#x27;s end 34 teams had been formed with teams 1–21 having actually been deployed. The Seabees provided over half of the men in the teams that saw service.

The UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, swimfins, diving masks and Ka-bars. The men trained by the OSS had brought their swimfins with them when they joined the UDTs. They were adopted by the other teams as quickly as Supply could get them.

These &quot;Naked Warriors&quot;, as they came to be called post-war, saw action in every major Pacific amphibious landing including: Eniwetok, Saipan, Kwajalein, Tinian, Guam, Angaur, Ulithi, Peleliu, Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Zambales, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Labuan, and Brunei Bay. By fall of 1944, the UDT&#x27;s were considered an indispensable US military special operations unit, and Navy planners in the Central Pacific relied heavily on the UDT&#x27;s reconnaissance reports and demolition activities to clear the way for landings.

The last UDT operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at Balikpapan, Borneo. The rapid demobilization at the conclusion of the war reduced the number of active duty UDTs to two on each coast with a complement of seven officers and 45 enlisted men each. However, the UDTs were the only special troops that avoided complete disbandment after the war, unlike the OSS Maritime Unit, the VAC Recon Battalion, and several Marine recon missions.

Because they were so integral to the success of missions in the Pacific during the war, the U.S. Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post-war. During WWII the Navy did not have a rating for the UDTs nor did they have an insignia. Those men with the CB rating on their uniforms considered themselves Seabees that were doing underwater demolition (Fig. 11). They did not call themselves &quot;UDTs&quot; or &quot;Frogmen&quot; but rather &quot;Demolitioneers&quot; which had carried over from the NCDUs and Lt Cdr Kauffman&#x27;s recruiting efforts from the Seabee dynamiting and demolition school. The next largest group of UDT volunteers came from the joint Army-Navy Scouts and Raiders school that was also in Fort Pierce and the Navy&#x27;s bomb disposal school in the Seabee-dominated teams.

For the Marianas operations of Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, Eniwetok, and Guam, Admiral Turner recommended sixty Silver Stars and over three hundred Bronze Stars with Vs for the Seabees and other service members of UDTs 1–7 That was unprecedented in U.S. Naval/Marine Corps history. For UDTs 5 and 7 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Tinian). For UDTs 3 and 4 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Guam). Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly felt the commanders of teams 3 and 4 (LT Crist and LT W.G. Carberry) should have received Navy Crosses. As the first to often make amphibious landings, the UDTs began making signs to welcome the Marines, indicating they had been there first, to foster the continued friendly rivalry. In keeping with UDT tradition, UDT 21 created a sign to greet the Marines landing in Japan. For Operation Beleaguer UDT 9 was deployed with the III Amphibious Corps to Northern China. In 1965 the UDT 12 put up another beach sign to greet the Marines at Da Nang.

Operation Crossroads UDT 3 was designated TU 1.1.3 for the operation. On 27 April 1946, seven officers and 51 enlisted embarked at CBC Port Hueneme, for transit to Bikini. Their assignment was to retrieve water samples from ground zero of the Baker blast.

===Korean War===

The Korean War began on 25 June 1950, when the North Korean army invaded South Korea. Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; the UDTs fought intensely, employing demolition expertise gained from World War II and using it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets, and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the Republic of Korea Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla), which continues today.

Through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal, the UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war, the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions included transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.

As part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT LT Ted Fielding, &quot;We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.&quot; (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain.)

On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S.minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an &quot;aqualung&quot; when he dived on . For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans&#x27; fishing capability.

=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===
President John F. Kennedy, aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for unconventional warfare and special operations as a measure against guerrilla warfare. In a speech to Congress on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the United States Army Special Forces. While his announcement of the government&#x27;s plan to put a man on the moon drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100 million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been underway since the Korean War.

The Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, recommended the establishment of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy&#x27;s Underwater Demolition Teams, who had already gained extensive experience in commando warfare in Korea; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy&#x27;s amphibious force.

The first two teams were formed in January 1962 and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, in San Diego, California and Team Two at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments. Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as hand-to-hand combat, high-altitude parachuting, demolitions, and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the Cuyamaca Mountains. After SBI training class, they would enter a platoon and conduct platoon training.

According to founding SEAL team member Roy Boehm, the SEALs&#x27; first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in a prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion, Boehm and another SEAL had smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.

The Pacific Command recognized Vietnam as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started hydrographic surveys and along with other branches of the US Military, the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to South Vietnam as advisors for the purpose of training Army of the Republic of Vietnam commandos in the same methods they were trained themselves.

The Central Intelligence Agency began using SEALs in covert operations in early 1963. The SEALs were later involved in the CIA sponsored Phoenix Program where it targeted Vietcong (VC) infrastructure and personnel for capture and assassination.

The SEALs were initially deployed in and around Da Nang, training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the Rung Sat Special Zone where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the Mekong Delta to fulfill riverine operations, fighting on the inland waterways.
Combat with the VC was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The VC referred to them as &quot;the men with green faces,&quot; due to the camouflage face paint the SEALs wore during combat missions.

In February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in South Vietnam to conduct direct action missions. Operating from Nhà Bè Base, near the Rung Sat Special Zone, this detachment signalled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis. SEALs also served as advisors for Provincial Reconnaissance Units and the Lein Doc Nguio Nhia, the Vietnamese SEALs.
SEALs continued to make forays into North Vietnam and Laos and covertly into Cambodia, controlled by the Studies and Observations Group. The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with ARVN Commandos. In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units.

By 1970, President Richard Nixon initiated a plan of Vietnamization, which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left South Vietnam on 7 December 1971, and the last SEAL advisor left South Vietnam in March 1973. The SEALs were among the most highly decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one Medal of Honor, two Navy Crosses, 42 Silver stars, 402 Bronze Stars, two Legions of Merit, 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses. SEAL Team One was awarded three Presidential Unit Citations and one Navy Unit Commendation; SEAL Team Two received two Presidential Unit Citations. By the end of the war, 48 SEALs had been killed in Vietnam, but estimates of their kill count are as high as 2,000. The Navy SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, displays a list of the 48 SEALs who lost their lives in combat during the Vietnam War.

===Reorganization===
In 1974–1975, UDT-13 was redesignated; some personnel established Underwater Construction Teams, and while others joined special boat detachments. On 1 May 1983, UDT–11 was redesignated as SEAL Team Five, UDT–21 was redesignated as SEAL Team Four, UDT–12 became SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One (SDVT–1), and UDT–22 was redesignated as SDVT-2. SEAL Team Three, was established 1 October 1983 in Coronado, California. United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) was established in April 1987 and its Naval component, United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), also known as NSWC, was established at the same time.

===Grenada===

Both SEAL Team Four and SEAL Team Six, the predecessor to DEVGRU, participated in the US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs&#x27; two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada&#x27;s Governor-General, Sir Paul Scoon, and the capture of Grenada&#x27;s only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C-130 Hercules aircraft with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor&#x27;s mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs&#x27; only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion&#x27;s land line telephone to call in AC-130 gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.

The team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by BTR-60 armored personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search, the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.

===Iran–Iraq War===
During the closing stages of the Iran–Iraq War the United States Navy began conducting operations in the Persian Gulf to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed Operation Prime Chance. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD technicians were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the Army&#x27;s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the takedown of the &quot;Iran Ajr&quot;. Evidence gathered on the &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck . This chain of events led to Operation Praying Mantis, the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.

During Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.

===Panama===
The United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to Panama&#x27;s invasion, codenamed Operation Just Cause. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of Manuel Noriega&#x27;s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as Operation Nifty Package), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.

The strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V rebreathers and attached C-4 explosives to and destroyed Noriega&#x27;s personal gunboat the &quot;Presidente Porras&quot;.

Task Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega&#x27;s plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the Army Rangers. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega&#x27;s plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead, including Chief Petty Officer Donald McFaul, and thirteen wounded.

===Persian Gulf War===


In August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. They infiltrated Kuwait the capital city within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive. The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their Desert Patrol Vehicles when it was recaptured.

===Somalia Intervention===
On 6 December 1992, as part of Operation Restore Hope, U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of Mogadishu airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country. They suffered only one casualty, who was injured by an IED.

In August 1993 a four-person DEVGRU SEAL sniper team was deployed to Mogadishu to work alongside Delta Force as part of Task Force Ranger in the search for Somali warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid. They took part in several operations in support of the CIA and Army culminating in the 3 October &#x27;Battle of Mogadishu&#x27; where they were part of the ground convoy raiding the Olympic Hotel. All four SEALs would be later awarded the Silver Star in recognition of their bravery while Navy SEAL Howard E. Wasdin would be awarded a Purple Heart after continuing to fight despite being wounded three times during the battle.

===War in Afghanistan===

====Invasion====

In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Navy SEALs quickly dispatched to Camp Doha, and those already aboard U.S. Naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters began conducting VBSS operations against ships suspected of having ties to or even carrying al Qaeda operatives. SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of Masirah for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs&#x27; immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct special reconnaissance (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the Army Rangers also staging on Masirah, the SEALs entered Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become Camp Rhino, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, Rear Admiral Albert Calland.
As part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General Tommy Franks at CENTCOM, SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a black SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of JSOC. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was to capture or kill senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force team (Task Force Red), ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). Task Force K-Bar was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, 3rd SFG; the task force was led by SEAL Captain Robert Harward.

The task force&#x27;s principal task was to conduct SR and SSE missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly KSK, JTF2 and New Zealand Special Air Service were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism)—intelligence integration and fusion activity composed of personnel from all of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan-participating units—SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from DEVGRU and supported by ISA&#x27;s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance—sending small two or three-man teams into al-Qaeda &#x27;Backyard&#x27; along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or ATVs.

SEALs were present at the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British SBS. Chief Petty Officer Stephen Bass was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the battle.

Before the US Marines landed at Camp Rhino in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from SEAL Team 8 conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting AH-1W attack helicopters, but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties. The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two United States Air Force Combat Control Teams made a nighttime HALO jump to assist the SEALs in guiding in Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit who seized control of the area and established a forward operating base.

====Post-invasion====

In January 2002, following the Battle of Tora Bora, another series of caves was discovered in Zhawar Kili, just south of Tora Bora; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and JTF2 reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn&#x27;t encounter any al-Qaeda fighters. Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of Army Special Forces, United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams, and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of Kandahar and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months, Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.

In February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the CIA passed on intelligence from a Predator drone operating in the Paktia province that Taliban Mullah Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy. SEALs and Danish Jægerkorpset commandos boarded Air Force Pave Low helicopters and seized Khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later. The SEALs continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the Marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground.

In March 2002, SEALs from DEVGRU, SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 participated extensively in Operation Anaconda. During what would become known as the Battle of Takur Ghar, whilst inserting from an MH-47E Chinook, PO1 Neil Roberts from DEVGRU, was thrown from his helicopter when it took fire from entrenched al Qaeda fighters. Roberts was subsequently killed after engaging and fighting dozens of enemies for almost an hour. Several SEALs were wounded in a rescue attempt and their Air Force Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant John Chapman, was killed. Attempts to rescue the stranded SEAL also led to the deaths of several US Army Rangers and an Air Force Pararescueman acting as a Quick Reaction Force.
Later in 2002, CJSOFT became a single integrated command under the broader CJTF-180 that commanded all US forces assigned to OEF-A, it was built around an Army Special Forces Group (composed of soldiers from National Guard units) and SEAL teams. A small JSOC element (formerly Task Force Sword/11) not under direct CTJF command—embedded within CJSOFT, it consisted of a joint SEAL and Ranger element that rotated command, and was not under direct ISAF command, although it operated in support of NATO operations.

In June 2005, Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after his four-man reconnaissance counterinsurgency team was almost wiped out during Operation Red Wings. After the four-man team lost Danny Dietz, he put himself in open view to call in the QRF. He soon after died from injuries sustained. Matthew Axelson also died on this operation. The QRF never reached the scene; it was struck by an RPG killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Army Night Stalkers. Marcus Luttrell was the only survivor from this operation.

In early 2010, Brigadier General Scott Miller took command of CJSOTF-Afghanistan and assigned virtually all SOF in the theatre to a new counterinsurgency role that would become known as the ALP/VSO Program (Afghan Local Police/Village Stability Operations), the SOF in Afghanistan were organized into battalion level SOTF (Special Operations Task Forces) each with a geographic area of responsibility-the SEALs were given southeast Afghanistan. To increase security of their assigned VSO village, a SEAL Platoon in Chora District, Uruzgan Province built a wall constructed of of HESCO barriers to divert insurgent movements away, this proved successful and eventually the Afghan villagers took ownership of it. SEALs and other SOTF still conducted Direct Action missions, but now partnered with Afghan forces.

On 6 August 2011, seventeen U.S. Navy SEALs were killed when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down by an RPG fired by Taliban militants. The SEALs were en route to support U.S. Army Rangers who were taking fire while attempting to capture a senior Taliban leader in the Tangi Valley. Fifteen of the SEALs belonged to the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Two others were SEALs assigned to a West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit. A total of 30 Americans and eight Afghans were killed in the crash, making it the single largest loss of U.S. lives in the Global War on Terrorism.

On 16 August 2012, SEALs in Uruzgan Province conducted a joint operation into the Shah Wali Kot Valley where they suffered the loss of a Black Hawk helicopter when it was struck by an insurgent RPG, the crash killed 11 servicemen (seven US and four Afghan).

In December 2012, SEALs from DEVGRU rescued a US doctor who had been kidnapped a few days earlier. However, during the operation the unit suffered a fatality, Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas D. Checque. Senior Chief Edward Byers, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during this mission.

In May 2013, Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, commander of Navy Special Warfare stated that the unit would cut in half the number of SEAL platoons in Afghanistan by the end of 2013. Pybus also added that the unit is already &quot;undergoing a transition back to its maritime roots&quot; by placing more emphasis on sea-based missions after being involved in mostly landlocked missions since 2001.

===Iraq War===
====Invasion====

For the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a squadron from DEVGRU operated as part of Task Force 20. Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish GROM, Royal Marines from 40 and 42 Commando under the command of 3 Commando Brigade and attached US Psy Ops and civil affairs teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of Umm Qasr, Iraq&#x27;s only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the Al-Faw Peninsula; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and 20th Special Operations Squadron.

Several days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from Mark V Special Operations Craft in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the hydrographic reconnaissance of the Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals. After swimming under the terminals and securing their Mark 8 mod 1s, the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats. On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 Navy EOD a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.

The shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were seized by 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was &#x27;softened up&#x27; by JDAM bombs dropped from B-52s on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate AC-130 Spectres fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and A-10As engaged a nearby SAM installation and a responding Iraqi mechanized unit. The SEALs secured the facility itself whilst the Royal Marines cleared Iraqi bunkers, killing several Iraqi soldiers.

Other Naval Task Group operations included elements of three SEAL platoons in GMV trucks and DPVs seizing the al Zubayr MMS, whilst I MEF attacked the Rumaylah Oil Fields north of al-Faw. SEALs and Special Boat teams helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, which was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.

Coalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force MH-53J Pave Lows; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counterattack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective, and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM soldier who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for five days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.

During the Battle of Basra, SEALs along with the Brigade Reconnaissance Force and 539 Assault Squadron RM attempted a waterborne approach to Basra via the Shatt al-Arab waterway but were intercepted by Iranian Revolutionary Guard patrol craft and did not want to engage them so they withdrew. On 6 April 2003, after relocating further up the waterway they successfully infiltrated via the waterway, using SEAL UAVs they called in &quot;show-of-force&quot; and an airstrike by a USMC Harrier on Iraqi troops, the SEALs then headed to &quot;Chemical Ali&#x27;s&quot; house with SSE teams to find traces of chemical weapons. SEALs carried out missions around Nasiriyah, carrying out reconnaissance on surrounding villages and engaging enemy strong points bypassed by the US Marine advance. Charlie Platoon, SEAL Team 3, later operated ahead of the Marine advance carrying out similar missions. SEAL and GROM units continued to cooperate throughout the rest of the invasion phase, with raids and anti-sniper missions in Baghdad.

====Post-invasion Iraq====
Following the invasion, SEAL platoons rotated through Iraq, conducting overwatch for US and Iraqi patrols and directly mentoring local Iraqi forces; they also conducted surveillance and sniping missions into known trouble spots. In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking Haifa Street, they were inserted by Bradley IFVs from a unit of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties, and the SEALs were extracted.

In the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and Second Battle of Fallujah, insurgents in Fallujah knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, berms, strategically placed car bombs and IEDs. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infrared chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the 5th SFG, Marine Force Recon and Det One and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to 7 November D-DAY when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.

From 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in Al Anbar Governorate, AQI terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to Ramadi. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at Al Asad Airbase and sent elements to Ramadi and Habbaniyah, the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although FID was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a junior officer, three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to Dick Couch, the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests. The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimized for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.

As the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local Sheikhs and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda&#x27;s efforts to install a Sharia-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI&#x27;s downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the Second Battle of Ramadi SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer Michael A. Monsoor died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs&#x27; militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the Anbar Awakening) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.

In Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.

In September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi (nicknamed the &quot;Butcher of Fallujah&quot;), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the 2004 Fallujah ambush. Al-Isawai made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing courts-martial against three SEALs (all of whom were acquitted). Iraqi authorities later tried and executed al-Isawi by hanging at some point before November 2013.

SEALs remained employed throughout the Iraqi Campaign as Task Units or Task Elements until its close in 2011.

===Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines===
OEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct long-term partnered operations with both Philippine Army special operations and intelligence units, as well as police units, to counter the threat posed by the ASG and JI terrorist groups. Much of this work has been assigned to 1st SFG; SEALs and USAF Special Operations who have also had a long-term presence in the Philippines. There are few confirmed operational details about the SEALs and Green Berets conducting partnered operations, although elements are partnered with Philippine Army and SOF; there have been mentions of Green Berets and SEALs wounded. On 21 June 2002, SEALs in RIBs supported the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group in the operation that killed Abu Sabaya, a senior leader in the ASG. A US Predator UAV marked the HVT with an infrared laser as he tried to escape in a smugglers boat; the MH-47Es from the 160th SOAR used search lights mounted on their helicopters to pinpoint the target&#x27;s boat while operators from the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group opened fire on the boat killing the terrorist leader and capturing four other terrorists with him.

===Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa===
As part of OEF-HOA, Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 are deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, under the command of SOCCE-HOA (Special Operations Command and Control Element-Horn of Africa) which commands all SOCOM units assigned to training or operational missions in the region. Special operations carried out in Somalia are conducted under the codename: Operation Octave Dune, as part of the overall effort in Somalia, which is known as Operation Octave Shield.

Before Djibouti became the epicentre for counter terrorism operations in Africa, unilateral operations were launched from temporary forward locations in friendly nations such as Kenya, or from US Navy ships. The earliest known operation in Somalia was known as Operation Cobalt Blue: In 2003, SEALs using SEAL Delivery Vehicles swam ashore along the Somali coastline and emplaced covert surveillance cameras. Known as cardinals, the cameras were designed to watch likely target locations for wanted terrorists as al-Qaeda and its affiliates began to regroup in the country, however the cameras only took one image a day and captured very little.

CJSOTF-HOA (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Horn of Africa) developed a rescue plan called Operation Mystic Talon, in case any CIA SAD or ISA operators were captured in the region, the plan required a SEAL platoon with Air Force Special Operations assets that, if necessary, would fight their way into Somalia, recover the hostage and fight their way out, should a mission need to be launched before a dedicated JSOC task force could be deployed to the region.

====&quot;Maersk Alabama&quot; hijacking====

On 12 April 2009, in response to a hostage taking incident off the coast of Somalia by Somalian pirates, three Navy SEALs from DEVGRU simultaneously engaged and killed the three pirates who were closely holding the hostage, Captain Richard Phillips, of the freighter ship . The pirates and their hostage were being towed in a lifeboat approximately 100 yards behind when each of the pirates were killed by a different DEVGRU sniper with a single shot to the head.

===Death of Osama bin Laden===

In the early morning of 2 May 2011 local time, a team of Navy SEALs of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), previously called &quot;SEAL Team 6&quot;, along with a Belgian Malinois Military Working Dog (named &quot;Cairo&quot;), supported by Special Activities Division officers on the ground, killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan about from Islamabad in a CIA operation. President Barack Obama later confirmed the death of bin Laden, but did not directly mention the involvement of DEVGRU, saying only that a &quot;small team&quot; of Americans undertook the operation to bring down bin Laden. The unprecedented media coverage raised the public profile of the SEAL community, particularly the counter-terrorism specialists commonly known as SEAL Team 6. The Walt Disney Company tried unsuccessfully to trademark the name &quot;SEAL Team 6&quot; the day after the raid. The official name of the military operation was Operation Neptune Spear. The model of the compound used in the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; documentary was donated by CBS to the Navy SEAL Museum.

=== &quot;Morning Glory&quot; oil tanker ===
On 16 March 2014, thirty U.S. Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 2 took control of , a tanker full of oil loaded from a rebel-held port in Libya. The raid by Navy SEALs took place in international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the raid was a success, preventing a Libyan splinter militia group selling nationalized Libyan oil on the black market.

===Operation Inherent Resolve===

As part of Operation Inherent Resolve&#x27;s Iraq Campaign, there are at least 100 SEALs as part of a Special Operations advise and assist mission to Peshmerga and Iraqi Security Forces in combating ISIS. The Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq is called Task Force Trident. On 3 May 2016, Petty Officer 1st Class Charles Keating IV was killed by ISIS small arms fire near the town of Tel Skuf during an ISIS assault on a Peshmerga position. He was a member of a 20-man Quick Reaction Force (QRF) sent to rescue a dozen U.S. advisors at the position and temporarily assist the Peshmerga. Keating IV was awarded the Navy Cross, posthumously, for his actions.

==Personnel==
=== Selection and training ===


Before getting accepted into Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, a prospective candidate must pass a certain number of both mental and physical requirements. These tests include: Pre-enlistment medical screening, ASVAB, AFQT, C-SORT, and PST. Then, the candidate must get a SEAL contract by passing the SEAL Physical Screening Test: 500-yard swim in 12:30, 50 push-ups in 2 minutes, 50 sit-ups in 2 minutes, 10 consecutive pull-ups in 2 minutes, and a 1.5-mile run in 10:30. Candidates receiving a passing score may then be admitted into training to become Navy SEALs. SEAL training is extremely rigorous. The attrition rate fluctuates, but averages at about 80 percent. The average candidate spends more than a year in a series of formal training courses before being awarded the Special Warfare Operator Naval Rating and the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) or, in the case of commissioned naval officers, the designation Naval Special Warfare (SEAL) Officer.

Navy SEAL training pipeline:
* 8-week Naval Recruit Training
* 8-week Naval Special Warfare Prep School (Pre-BUD/S)
* 3-week BUD/S Orientation
* 24-week Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S)
* 3-week Army airborne School
* 26-week SEAL Qualification Training (SQT)

Upon graduation from SQT, trainees receive the U.S. Navy SEAL Trident, designating them as Navy SEALs. They are subsequently assigned to a SEAL Team or SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Team and begin 18 months of predeployment training before they are considered deployable. This training consists of:
* 6-month Professional Development – Individual Specialty Training (ProDev)
* 6-month Unit Level Training (ULT). ULT is unit training conducted by each Groups Training Detachment. Core unit training blocks are Air Operations, Land Warfare, Maritime, Urban and Special Reconnaissance.
* 6-month Squadron Integration Training (SIT)

Those enlisted SEALs with a medical rating will first attend the Special Operations Combat Medic Course for 6 months in Fort Bragg, North Carolina before joining a team in order to become a SEAL/Special Operator Corpsman. Those pursuing officer positions first attend the Junior Officer Training Course (JOTC) to learn about operations planning and how to perform team briefings. In total it can take over two-and-a-half years to completely train a Navy SEAL for his first deployment.

===Women===
Until December 2015, female sailors were barred from becoming Navy SEALs by naval regulation; however, this prohibition no longer exists. As early as August 2015, it was reported that the &quot;Navy is planning to open its elite SEAL teams to women who can pass the grueling training regimen.&quot; In that same month, Admiral Jon Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, said that &quot;he and the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Brian Losey, believe that if women can pass the legendary six-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, they should be allowed to serve.&quot; On 3 December 2015, it was announced that there are now &quot;no exceptions&quot; to all military roles in the U.S., and women can become U.S. Navy SEALs.

Since the Navy opened up special warfare jobs to female sailors in 2016, 18 women have attempted to pass Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) and SEAL training.

&quot;The Washington Examiner&quot; reported on 10 August 2017: &quot;A woman aiming to become the first female Navy SEAL officer quit about a week into the initial training&quot;.

In 2019, the Navy announced that an unnamed female officer was the first to successfully complete the SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection program (SOAS). She was one of a group of five female candidates to enter the program. She opted not to start BUD/S afterwards, instead choosing another assignment in the Navy.

===Issues===
In December 2016, the SEALs halted all training and ordered a safety stand-down because of substance abuse within its ranks. As part of the safety stand-down, all SEALs were required to submit to urinalysis. In August 2019, a review of the culture of Special Operations Command was ordered following cases of misconduct involving the SEALS, which included substance abuse by members of SEAL Team 10 and allegations of sexual assault and intoxication by a SEAL platoon in Iraq.

In 2021, SEAL team members appeared on CBS concealing their identities out of concern for retribution. They alerted the public to a culture of lawlessness, misconduct, and war crimes within their ranks.

===Relationship with CIA===
The CIA&#x27;s highly secretive and elite Special Operations Group (SOG) recruits operators from SEAL Teams, with joint operations going back to the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. This cooperation still exists today, as evidenced by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Navy SEAL teams and structures==
The total number of personnel, including SEALs and SWCCs assigned to Naval Special Warfare Command is approximately 8,195 out of a total 8,985 military staff, and 10,166 including civilian support staff, as of 2015.

===SEAL Teams===
The original SEAL Teams were separated between West Coast (Team One) and East Coast (Team Two) SEALs. Likewise current SEAL Teams are organized into two groups: Naval Special Warfare Group One (West Coast) and Naval Special Warfare Group Two (East Coast), both of which come under the command of Naval Special Warfare Command at NAB Coronado, California. , there are eight confirmed Navy SEAL Teams. The current SEAL Team deployments include Teams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. The most recent active-duty teams are SEAL Team 7 and SEAL Team 10, which were formed in March and April 2002, respectively. However, two reservist support teams were reorganized into SEAL teams in 2008.

The Teams deploy as Naval Special Warfare Squadrons or Special Operations Task Forces and can deploy anywhere in the world. Squadrons will normally be deployed and fall under a Joint Task Force (JTF) or a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) as a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF).

Each SEAL Team (or &quot;squadron&quot;) is commanded by a Navy commander (O-5), and has eight operational SEAL platoons and a headquarters element. Operationally, the &quot;Team&quot; is divided into two to four 40-man &quot;task units&quot; (or &quot;troops&quot;). Each task unit consists of a headquarters element consisting of a task unit commander, typically a lieutenant commander (O-4), a task unit senior enlisted (E-8), a targeting/operations officer (O-2/3) and a targeting/operations leading/chief petty officer (E-6/7). Under the HQ element are two to four SEAL platoons of 16 men (two officers and 14 enlisted SEALs, and sometimes assigned non-NSW support personnel); a company-sized combat service support (CSS) and/or combat support (CS) consisting of staff N-codes (the Army and Marine Corps use S-codes); N1 Administrative support, N2 Intelligence, N3 Operations, N4 Logistics, N5 Plans and Targeting, N6 Communications, N7 Training, and N8 Air/Medical.

Each 16-man platoon can be task organized for operational purposes into two eight-man squads, four four-man fire teams, or eight two-man sniper/reconnaissance teams. The size of each SEAL &quot;Team&quot;, or &quot;squadron&quot;, with two to four task units (containing a total of eight platoons) and support staff is approximately 300 personnel. The typical SEAL platoon has an OIC (officer in charge), usually a lieutenant (O-3), a platoon chief (E-7/E-8), and two squads commanded by a LTJG (O-2) and a squad leader (E-6). The remaining members of the squad are operators (E-4 to E-6) with their specialty skills in ordnance, communications, diving, and medical. The core leadership in the troop and platoon are the commander/OIC and the senior enlisted NCO (Senior Chief/chief).

Platoon core skills consist of: Sniper, Breacher, Communicator, Maritime/Engineering, Close Air Support, Corpsman, Point-man/Navigator, Primary Driver/Navigator (Rural/Urban/Protective Security), Heavy Weapons Operator, Sensitive Site Exploitation, Air Operations Master, Lead Climber, Lead Diver/Navigator, Interrogator, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical Surveillance, and Advanced Special Operations.

Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, a naval base in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is home to SEAL Teams 2, 4, 8, 10, and 18. Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, a naval base in Coronado, California, is home to SEAL Teams 1, 3, 5, 7, and 17. There are also two SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) units, SDVT-1 and SDVT-2, located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and Little Creek, Virginia, respectively. SDV Teams are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability. An SDV platoon consists of 12–15 SEALs.


===Special warfare ratings===

The Special Warfare Operator rating (SO) and Special Warfare Boat Operator rating (SB), were established in 2006. Special Warfare Operators (SEALs) and Special Warfare Boat Operators (SWCCs) are no longer required to maintain the original rating they qualified in upon joining the Navy.

The following ratings are specific to Navy SEALs:
==United States Navy Parachute Team &quot;Leap Frogs&quot;==
The primary mission of the Navy Parachute Team (NPT) is to support Naval Special Warfare recruiting by gaining access and exposure to appropriate candidates through aerial parachuting demonstrations. The U.S. Navy Parachute Team is a fifteen-man team composed of U.S. Navy SEALs. Each member comes to the team for a three-year tour from one of the two Naval Special Warfare Groups located on the east and west coasts. On completion of the tour, members return to operational units. The parachute team began in 1969 when Navy SEALs and Frogmen volunteered to perform at weekend air shows. The Team initially consisted of five jumpers: LCDR Olson, PHC Gagliardi, SK2 &quot;Herky&quot; Hertenstein, PR1 Al Schmiz and PH2 &quot;Chip&quot; Maury. Schmiz and Maury were members of the original &quot;Chuting Stars.&quot; When LCDR Olson was transferred to California, PHC Gene &quot;Gag&quot; Gagliardi (D 546) of UDT Eleven introduced him to the local jumping elite with the San Diego Skydivers, one of the nation&#x27;s first sports parachuting clubs. He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a &quot;not to interfere&quot; basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the &quot;Leap Frogs&quot; name.

The team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based &quot;Chuting Stars&quot; were disbanded in the 1980s with the &quot;Leap Frogs&quot; taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.

A typical Leap Frogs&#x27; performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.

==Influence on foreign units==

From its predecessors, the Underwater Demolition Teams, to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units. In 1955, the Underwater Demolition Teams provided funding and training for the Republic of Korea Naval Special Warfare Flotilla, who are also known as UDT/SEALs. This was followed in 1956 by providing funding, training and formation of the Philippine Navy Underwater Operations Team (UOT), patterned on the training and implementation of the US Navy SEALs and the UDTs. In 1966, United States Navy SEALs established Pakistan&#x27;s Special Service Group based on a mutual security understanding and the training provided under the IMET program until the 1970s. U.S. Navy SEALs provided initial training to the Indian Marine Special Force, which later became known as the MARCOS.

Due to their reputation as being one of America&#x27;s premier special operations forces, SEALs (particularly operators from DEVGRU) will often do exchanges with allied SOFs.

==National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum and memorial==

The National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, in Fort Pierce, Florida, was founded in 1985 and was recognized as a National Museum by an act of Congress. The museum is dedicated to preserving the history of the Navy SEALs and their predecessors. The SEAL Museum stands on the training site of the first Navy frogmen. There through World War II, thousands of service members were trained as members of Naval Combat Demolition Units and Underwater Demolition Teams. The Museum houses rare historical artifacts from the founding of the UDT to present day, including weapons, vehicles, equipment, and most recently added, the lifeboat aboard which Somali pirates held Captain Richard Phillips hostage.

===Navy SEAL Memorial===

According to the Navy SEAL Museum, 298 UDT and SEALs were killed in action and died during training accidents as of March 2018:
* World War II and the Korean War (1941–1953):
** 96 personnel
* Vietnam and the Cold War (1954–1989):
** 104 personnel
* Desert Storm and the war on terror (1990 – March 2018):
** 98 personnel

<doc id="38193" wikidata="Q182116" url="?curid=38193" title="Fetishism">
<text>A fetish is an object believed to have supernatural powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the attribution of inherent non-material value, or powers, to an object. Talismans and amulets are related. Fetishes are often used in spiritual or religious context.

==Historiography==
The word &quot;fetish&quot; derives from the French , which comes from the Portuguese (&quot;spell&quot;), which in turn derives from the Latin (&quot;artificial&quot;) and (&quot;to make&quot;). The term &quot;fetish&quot; has evolved from an idiom used to describe a type of object created in the interaction between European travelers and Native West Africans in the early modern period to an analytical term that played a central role in the perception and study of non-Western art in general and African art in particular.

William Pietz, who, in 1994, conducted an extensive ethno-historical study of the fetish, argues that the term originated in the coast of West Africa during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, &quot;fetish&quot;, an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, to which the term above applies.

According to Pietz, the post-colonial concept of &quot;fetish&quot; emerged from the encounter between Europeans and Africans in a very specific historical context and in response to African material culture.

He begins his thesis with an introduction to the complex history of the word:

My argument, then, is that the fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the ideology of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two radically different types of noncapitalist society, as they encountered each other in an ongoing cross-cultural situation. This process is indicated in the history of the word itself as it developed from the late medieval Portuguese , to the sixteenth-century pidgin &quot;Fetisso&quot; on the African coast, to various northern European versions of the word via the 1602 text of the Dutchman Pieter de Marees... The fetish, then, not only originated from, but remains specific to, the problem of the social value of material objects as revealed in situations formed by the encounter of radically heterogeneous social systems, and a study of the history of the idea of the fetish may be guided by identifying those themes that persist throughout the various discourses and disciplines that have appropriated the term.

Stallybrass concludes that &quot;Pietz shows that the fetish as a concept was elaborated to demonize the supposedly arbitrary attachment of West Africans to material objects. The European subject was constituted in opposition to a demonized fetishism, through the disavowal of the object.&quot;

==History==
Initially, the Portuguese developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious practices by West African natives. The contemporary Portuguese may refer to more neutral terms such as &quot;charm&quot;, &quot;enchantment&quot;, or &quot;abracadabra&quot;, or more potentially offensive terms such as &quot;juju&quot;, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, &quot;witchery&quot;, &quot;conjuration&quot; or &quot;bewitchment&quot;. The medieval Lollards issued polemics that anticipated fetishism.

The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when Charles de Brosses used it in comparing West African religion to the magical aspects of ancient Egyptian religion. Later, Auguste Comte employed the concept in his theory of the evolution of religion, wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by polytheism and monotheism. However, ethnography and anthropology would classify some artifacts of polytheistic and monotheistic religions as fetishes. 

The eighteenth-century intellectuals who articulated the theory of fetishism encountered this notion in descriptions of &quot;Guinea&quot; contained in such popular voyage collections as Ramusio&#x27;s &quot;Viaggio e Navigazioni&quot; (1550), de Bry&#x27;s &quot;India Orientalis&quot; (1597), Purchas&#x27;s &quot;Hakluytus Posthumus&quot; (1625), Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; (1732), Astley&#x27;s &quot;A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; (1746), and Prevost&#x27;s &quot;Histoire generale des voyages&quot; (1748).

The theory of fetishism was articulated at the end of the eighteenth century by G. W. F. Hegel in &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&quot;. According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with &quot;imaginary powers&quot;.

==Practice==

The use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional West African religious beliefs, as well as from Vodun, which in turn derives from those beliefs.

Fetishes were commonly used in some Native American religions and practices. For example, the bear represented the shaman, the buffalo was the provider, the mountain lion was the warrior, and the wolf was the pathfinder, the cause of the war.

== &quot;Japan&quot; ==

 (1873–1965), a Shinto priest and scholar of comparative religion, applied the term &quot;fetish&quot; to the historical study of traditional Japanese religion. He cited jewelry, swords, mirrors, and scarves as examples of fetishism in Shinto. In rural areas of Japan, he said he could find many traces of animism, totemism, fetishism, and phallicism. He also maintained that the were fetishes and the Imperial Regalia of Japan retained the same traits, and pointed out the similarities with the &quot;Pusaka&quot; heirlooms of the natives of the East Indies and the sacred &quot;Tjurunga&quot; of the Central Australians. He noted that the divine sword , which was believed to provide supernatural protection (&#x27;blessings&#x27;), was deified and enshrined (at what is now the Atsuta Shrine). Akaruhime no Kami, the female deity of , was said to have originally been a red ball before transforming into a beautiful woman. The jewel around Izanagi-no-Mikoto&#x27;s neck was deified and called .

The Anglo-Irish diplomat and scholar William George Aston (1841–1911) also maintained that could be seen as an example of fetishism. Originally an offering, the enshrined sword became a ( &#x27;spirit representative&#x27;, &#x27;spirit-token&#x27;), more commonly known as the ( &#x27;god-body&#x27;; a sacred object containing the or &#x27;spirit&#x27;). Aston observed that people tended to think of the (&#x27;spirit&#x27;) of a deity first as the seat of his or her real presence, and secondly as the deity itself. In practice, the distinction between and was fluid, and even came to be identified as the god&#x27;s body. For example, the cooking furnace () itself was worshiped as a deity. Given the vagueness of such distinctions – further accentuated by the restricted usage of images (e.g., in painting or sculpture) – there was a tendency to ascribe special virtues to certain physical objects in place of the deity.

In modern times, the American linguist Roy Andrew Miller (1924–2014) observed that the pamphlet of the nationalistic proclamation (1937) and the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890) were also often worshipped as &quot;fetishes&quot;, and were respectfully placed and kept in household altars ().

== &quot;Philippines&quot; ==
In the pre-colonial Philippine context, Anito fetishes were central to the animistic beliefs of the early Filipinos. These objects, often human-made, served as physical representations of spiritual entities or ancestral spirits. Their role in rituals, worship, and daily life illustrates the rich spiritual tradition of the early Austronesian peoples who inhabited the Philippine archipelago. Anito fetishes refer to objects imbued with spiritual significance, often crafted to house or represent spirits collectively known as Anito. These were usually Ancestor Spirits also called Anito The souls of deceased relatives who provided guidance, protection, or blessings to their descendants. Anito fetishes were typically carved from wood, stone, or bone, and they served as both a focus of worship and a conduit for spiritual energy. Anito fetishes were placed in shrines or sacred areas where offerings such as food, drinks, or animal sacrifices were made. These offerings were meant to appease or gain favours from the ancestor spirits and spirits of the dead and deities and celestial beings called Diwata. The term Anito is deeply rooted in Austronesian linguistic heritage, with similar terms found across related culture Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: qanitu (spirit of the dead) Proto-Austronesian: qaNiCu (ancestor spirit) Indonesian and Malaysian: Hantu or Antu (spirit or ghost) Polynesian: Atua or Aitu (ancestral ghost  or spirit) Anito—widely understood today by Filipinos in the Philippines in contemporary as referring to ancestor spirits or spirits of the dead, evil spirits and the wooden idols and fetish that represent them.Anito In Philippine mythology, refers to ancestor spirits, spirits of the dead, evil spirits and the wooden idols that represent or house them. In contrast, within the context of folk religion

==&quot;Minkisi&quot;==
Made and used by the BaKongo of western DRC, a &quot;nkisi&quot; (plural ) is a sculptural object that provides a local habitation for a spiritual personality. Though some have always been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less &quot;naturalistic&quot; or &quot;realistic&quot; before the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century; Kongo figures are more naturalistic in the coastal areas than inland. As Christians tend to think of spirits as objects of worship, idols become the objects of idolatry when worship was addressed to false gods. In this way, European Christian colonialists regarded as idols on the basis of religious bias.

The foreign Christians often called &quot;fetishes&quot; and sometimes &quot;idols&quot; because they are sometimes rendered in human form or semi-human form. Modern anthropology has generally referred to these objects either as &quot;power objects&quot; or as &quot;charms&quot;.

In addressing the question of whether a is a fetish, William McGaffey writes that the Kongo ritual system as a whole,

bears a relationship similar to that which Marx supposed that &quot;political economy&quot; bore to capitalism as its &quot;religion&quot;, but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally &quot;animate&quot; character of the ritual system&#x27;s symbolic apparatus, including , divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. &quot;Fetishism&quot; is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.

Therefore, McGaffey concludes, to call a a fetish is to translate &quot;certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-enlightenment Europe.&quot;

<text>John the Blind or John of Luxembourg (; ; ; 10 August 1296 – 26 August 1346), was the Count of Luxembourg from 1313 and King of Bohemia from 1310 and titular King of Poland. He is well known for having died while fighting in the Battle of Crécy at age 50, after having been blind for a decade. In his home country of Luxembourg, he is considered a national hero. Comparatively, in the Czech Republic (anciently the Kingdom of Bohemia), Jan Lucemburský is often recognized for his role as the father of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, one of the more significant Kings of Bohemia and one of the leading Holy Roman Emperors.

==Early life==
John was the eldest son of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret of Brabant, who was the daughter of John I, Duke of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders. Born in Luxembourg and raised in Paris, John was French by education but deeply involved in the politics of Germany.
In 1310, his father arranged the marriage of 14-year-old John to Elizabeth of Bohemia. The wedding took place in Speyer, after which the newlyweds made their way to Prague accompanied by a group led by the experienced diplomat and expert on Czech issues, Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz. Because the emperor had imperial Czech regiments accompany and protect the couple from Nuremberg to Prague, John was thus forced to invade Bohemia on behalf of his wife Elizabeth. The Czech forces were able to gain control of Prague and depose the reigning king, Henry of Gorizia, King of Bohemia, on 3 December 1310. The deposed King Henry fled with his wife Anne of Bohemia (the sister of John&#x27;s wife) to his duchy (the Duchy of Carinthia). The coronation of John and Elizabeth to the Bohemian throne took place on 7 February 1311, making them King and Queen of Bohemia. The castle at Prague was uninhabitable, so John made residence in one of the houses on the Old Town Square, and with the help of his advisors, he stabilized affairs in the Czech state. He thereby became one of the seven prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire and – in succession of his brother-in-law Wenceslaus III of Bohemia – claimant to the Polish and Hungarian throne. His attempts to follow his father as King of the Romans failed with the election of Louis IV of Bavaria in 1314. Nevertheless, John later would support Louis IV in his rivalry with Frederick the Fair, King of Germany, culminating in the 1322 Battle of Mühldorf in which, in return, he received the Czech region of Egerland as a reward.

== Problems with nobility ==
Like his predecessor Henry, he was disliked by much of the Czech nobility. John was considered an &quot;alien king&quot; and gave up the administration of Bohemia after a while and embarked on a life of travel. He parted ways with his wife and left the Czech country to be ruled by the barons while spending time in Luxembourg and the French court.

John&#x27;s travels took him to Silesia, Poland, Lithuania, Tyrol, Northern Italy and Papal Avignon. A rival of King Władysław I the Elbow-high to the Polish crown, John supported the Teutonic Knights in the Polish–Teutonic War from 1326 to 1332. He also made several Silesian dukes swear an oath of allegiance to him. In 1335 in Congress of Visegrád, Władysław&#x27;s successor King Casimir III the Great of Poland paid a significant amount of money in exchange for John&#x27;s giving up his claim to the Polish throne.
John&#x27;s first steps as king were re-establishing authority and securing peace within the country. In 1311, he reached an agreement with the Bohemian and Moravian aristocracy, referred to as the &quot;inaugural diplomas&quot;, with which John restricted the relations of both the ruler and aristocracy. The aristocracy was, however, allowed to hold the right to elect the king, to decide the matter of extraordinary taxation, the right to their property, and the right to choose freely whether or not to offer military support to the king in foreign wars. However, the aristocracy was encouraged to raise armies when peace within the country was threatened. On the other hand, the king&#x27;s right to appoint a foreign official to office was abolished. John structured these agreements to provide a basis for consolidating the ruler&#x27;s power within the Bohemian kingdom. The agreements weren&#x27;t as successful as John intended. The aristocracy did not intend to surrender its property and the influence it gained after Wenceslas II died.

The growing tensions within the aristocracy and the lack of communication due to John&#x27;s consistent absence in Bohemia led to a competition between two factions of the Czech nobility. One party, led by Jindřich of Lipá, gained the trust of John. The other party, led by Vilém Zajíc of Valdek (Latin: &quot;Wilhelmus Lepus de Waldek&quot;; German: Wilhelm Hase von Waldeck), convinced the Queen that Lord Lipá intended to overthrow John. Consequently, in 1315, John had Jindřich imprisoned.

By 1318, John had reconciled with the nobility and recognised their rights, further establishing dualism of the Estates and a government division between the king and the nobles.

== International politics ==
Foreign politics, rather than Czech, appealed to John, as he was gifted at it. With the help of his father, Henry, John was able to pressure the Habsburgs into reaching an agreement over Moravia. He was also able to pressure the House of Wettin, princes of Saxony, to give over the territory lying to the northern border of the Czech state. John also decided to improve relations with the Silesian principalities close to Bohemia and Moravia in economic and political standings. 

The international spectrum was further broadened for John when his father named him Imperial Vicar, his deputy for the governance of the Empire. This allowed John to reach further, and he contributed to the imperial coronation along with helping with the conclusion of the Italian territorial wars. In 1313, Henry died suddenly, ending this collaboration between him and John. However, through Henry&#x27;s death, a spot for the imperial crown opened up, making John a possible candidate, the other two candidates being Fredrick of Habsburg and Louis of Bavaria.

In attempts not to support Fredrick, John voted for Louis at the diet of electors. In return for his support, Louis, as the new emperor, promised the support in territorial claims of the Czech state in Silesia and Meissen as well as the region of Cheb and the Upper Palatinate. Later, in 1319, after the Brandenburg House of Ascania died out, John regained control over the Bautzen region and then the Görlitz region in 1329.

In 1322/23, King John became unsettled by Louis&#x27;s growing power and allied with France and Austria against him. The dispute would escalate with his son Charles claiming the Imperial crown in opposition to Louis.

== Death ==
John lost his eyesight at age 39 or 40 from ophthalmia in 1336, while crusading in Lithuania. A treatment by the famous physician Guy de Chauliac had no positive effects. At the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1337, he allied with King Philip VI of France and was even appointed governor of Languedoc from 30 November 1338 to November 1340. At the Battle of Crécy in 1346 John controlled Phillip&#x27;s advanced guard along with managing the large contingents of Charles II of Alençon and Louis I, Count of Flanders. John was killed at age 50 while fighting against the English during the battle. The medieval chronicler Jean Froissart left the following account of John&#x27;s last actions:

According to the &quot;Cronica ecclesiae Pragensis Benesii Krabice de Weitmile&quot;, when told by his aides that the battle against the English at Crécy was lost and he better should flee to save his own life, John the Blind replied: &quot;&quot;Absit, ut rex Boemie fugeret, sed illuc me ducite, ubi maior strepitus certaminis vigeret, Dominus sit nobiscum, nil timeamus, tantum filium meum diligenter custodite.&quot; (&quot;Far be it that the King of Bohemia should run away. Instead, take me to the place where the noise of the battle is the loudest. The Lord will be with us. Nothing to fear. Just take good care of my son.&quot;)

John was succeeded as King of Bohemia by his eldest son, Charles. In Luxembourg, he was succeeded by Wenceslaus, his son by his second wife.

== Burial ==

The body of John the Blind was moved to Kloster Altmünster (&quot;Old-Minster Abbey&quot;) in Luxembourg. When the abbey was destroyed in 1543, the corpse was moved to Kloster Neumünster (&quot;New-Minster Abbey&quot;) in Luxembourg. During the confusion of the French Revolution, the mortal remains were salvaged by the Boch industrialist family (founders of Villeroy &amp; Boch, ennobled in 1892) and hidden in an attic room in Mettlach on the Saar River. The legend is that the abbey monks asked Pierre-Joseph Boch for this favour.

His son Jean-François Boch met with the future King Frederick William IV of Prussia on his voyage through the Rhineland in 1833, offering the remains as a gift. As Frederick William counted John the Blind among his ancestors, he ordered Karl Friedrich Schinkel to construct a funeral chapel. The chapel was built in 1834 and 1835 near Kastel-Staadt on a rock above the town. In 1838, on the anniversary of his death, John the Blind was laid in a black marble sarcophagus in a public ceremony.

In 1945, the Luxembourg government took the chance to obtain possession of the bones. In a cloak and dagger operation, the remains were moved to the crypt of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg. The inscription on the tomb reads: &quot;&quot;

==Family and children==

John was married twice:

First, to Elisabeth of Bohemia, the daughter of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. In this marriage he had the following children:
# Margaret of Luxembourg, Duchess of Bavaria (8 July 1313 – 11 July 1341, Prague), married in Straubing 12 August 1328 to Henry XIV, Duke of Bavaria
# Bonne of Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy (21 May 1315 – 11 September 1349, Maubuisson, born &quot;Judith&quot;), married in Melun 6 August 1332 to John, Duke of Normandy, who later became King John II of France after her death.
# Charles IV of Luxembourg (14 May 1316 – 29 November 1378), who succeeded him as King of Bohemia and later became Holy Roman Emperor
# Ottokar (&quot;Otto&quot;) (22 November 1318 – 20 April 1320), Prince of Bohemia
# John Henry of Luxembourg (Jan Jindřich) (12 February 1322, Mělník – 12 November 1375), Margrave of Moravia
# Anna of Luxembourg, Duchess of Austria (1323 – 3 September 1338), twin of Elizabeth, married 16 February 1335 to Otto, Duke of Austria
# Elizabeth (1323–1324)

Second (December 1334), to Beatrice of Bourbon, daughter of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon. This marriage produced one son:

# Wenceslaus I of Luxembourg (25 February 1337 – 7 December 1383), Duke of Luxembourg and later Brabant through his marriage to the heiress Joanna, Duchess of Brabant.

His illegitimate son Nicolaus was Patriarch of Aquileia from 1350 to 1358.

<text>Pioneer 10 (originally designated Pioneer F) is a NASA space probe launched in 1972 that completed the first mission to the planet Jupiter. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; became the first of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System. This space exploration project was conducted by the NASA Ames Research Center in California. The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc.

&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was assembled around a hexagonal bus with a diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna, and the spacecraft was spin stabilized around the axis of the antenna. Its electric power was supplied by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.

It was launched on March 3, 1972, at 01:49:00 UTC (March 2 local time), by an Atlas-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt. Photography of Jupiter began on November 6, 1973, at a range of , and about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 3, 1973, at a range of . During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the solar wind, cosmic rays, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and heliosphere.

Radio communications were lost with &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter. At the time, the probe was from Earth.

==Mission background==
===History===
In the 1960s, American aerospace engineer Gary Flandro of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory conceived of a mission, known as the Planetary Grand Tour, that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two Voyager probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the outer Solar System. An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist James A. Van Allen, worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets. NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of &quot;Galactic Jupiter Probes&quot; that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.

Approved by NASA in February 1969, the twin spacecraft were designated &quot;Pioneer F&quot; and &quot;Pioneer G&quot; before launch; later, they were named &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; respectively. They formed part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States uncrewed space missions launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment. Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.

More than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions. The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and polarimetry of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the zodiacal light. Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.

NASA Ames Research Center, rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program. The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the &quot;Pioneer 6&quot; through &quot;9&quot; missions. Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled &quot;Jupiter Odyssey&quot;. It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg&#x27;s YouTube channel.

In February 1970, Ames awarded a combined US$380 million contract to TRW Inc. for building both of the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O&#x27;Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft. Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours. An engineer from TRW quipped, &quot;This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.&quot;

To meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the Deep Space Network for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.

===Spacecraft design===
The &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; bus measures deep and with six long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus houses propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from meteoroids. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized mylar and kapton blankets, provides passive thermal control. Heat was generated by the dissipation of 70 to 120 watts (W) from the electrical components inside the compartment. The heat range was maintained within the operating limits of the equipment by means of louvers located below the mounting platform. The spacecraft had a launch mass of about .

At launch, the spacecraft carried of liquid hydrazine monopropellant in a diameter spherical tank. Orientation of the spacecraft is maintained with six 4.5 N, hydrazine thrusters mounted in three pairs. Pair one maintained a constant spin-rate of 4.8 rpm, pair two controlled the forward thrust, and pair three controlled the attitude. The attitude pair were used in conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit. Orientation information was also provided by a star sensor able to reference Canopus, and two Sun sensors.

====Power and communications====
&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; uses four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155 W at launch, and decayed to 140 W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100 W to power all systems. The generators are powered by the radioisotope fuel plutonium-238, which is housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.

The pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission. The plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the thermocouple junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65 W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.

The space probe includes a redundant system of transceivers, one attached to the narrow-beam, high-gain antenna, the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna is in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that is parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth. Each transceiver is an 8 W one and transmits data across the S-band using 2110 MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292 MHz for the downlink to Earth with the Deep Space Network tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted is passed through a convolutional encoder so that most communication errors could be corrected by the receiving equipment on Earth. The data transmission rate at launch was 256 bit/s, with the rate degrading by about 1.27 millibit/s for each day during the mission.

Much of the computation for the mission is performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144 bytes of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit is used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.

====Scientific instruments====
==Mission profile==

===Launch and trajectory===
&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was launched on March 3, 1972, at 01:49:00 UTC (8:49 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 2) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 36A in Florida, aboard an Atlas-Centaur. The third stage of the expendable vehicle consisted of a solid fuel Star-37E stage (TE-M-364-4) developed specifically for the Pioneer missions. This stage provided about of thrust and spun up the spacecraft. The spacecraft had an initial spin rate of 30 rpm. Twenty minutes following the launch, the vehicle&#x27;s three booms were extended, which slowed the rotation rate to 4.8 rpm. This rate was maintained throughout the voyage. The launch vehicle accelerated the probe for a net interval of 17 minutes, reaching a velocity of .

After the high-gain antenna was contacted, several of the instruments were activated for testing while the spacecraft was moving through the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts. Ninety minutes after launch, the spacecraft reached interplanetary space. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; passed by the Moon in 11 hours, and became the fastest human-made object at that time. Two days after launch, the scientific instruments were turned on, beginning with the cosmic ray telescope. After ten days, all of the instruments were active.

During the first seven months of the journey, the spacecraft made three course corrections. The on-board instruments underwent checkouts, with the photometers examining Jupiter and the Zodiacal light, and experiment packages being used to measure cosmic rays, magnetic fields and the solar wind. The only anomaly during this interval was the failure of the Canopus sensor, which instead required the spacecraft to maintain its orientation using the two Sun sensors.

While passing through interplanetary medium, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; became the first mission to detect interplanetary atoms of helium. It also observed high-energy ions of aluminum and sodium in the solar wind. The spacecraft recorded important heliophysics data in early August 1972 by registering a solar shock wave when it was at a distance of . On July 15, 1972, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was the first spacecraft to enter the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The project planners expected a safe passage through the belt, and the closest the trajectory would take the spacecraft to any of the known asteroids was . One of the nearest approaches was to the asteroid 307 Nike on December 2, 1972.

The on-board experiments demonstrated a deficiency of particles below a micrometer (μm) in the belt, as compared to the vicinity of the Earth. The density of dust particles between 10 and 100 μm did not vary significantly during the trip from the Earth to the outer edge of the belt. Only for particles with a diameter of 100 μm to 1.0 mm did the density show an increase, by a factor of three in the region of the belt. No fragments larger than a millimeter were observed in the belt, indicating these are likely rare; certainly much less common than anticipated. As the spacecraft did not collide with any particles of substantial size, it passed safely through the belt, emerging on the other side about February 15, 1973.

===Encounter with Jupiter===
On November 6, 1973, the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; spacecraft was at a distance of from Jupiter. Testing of the imaging system began, and the data were successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon Sinope was crossed on November 8. The bow shock of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the solar wind from to . The magnetopause was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed, and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.

Red and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument&#x27;s field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an Emmy award for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing. During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.

The trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the ion radiation was concentrated. Peak flux for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth. Pioneer 10 passed through the inner radiation belts within 20 &quot;R&quot;J, receiving an integrated dose of 200,000 rads from electrons and 56,000 rads from protons (in comparison, a whole body dose of 500 rads is fatal to humans). The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than Pioneer&#x27;s designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probe would not survive. Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of Io and a few close-ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet. Nonetheless, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; did succeed in obtaining images of the moons Ganymede and Europa. The image of Ganymede showed low albedo features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.

The trajectory of &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the refractive effect of the moon&#x27;s atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the ionosphere of the moon was about above the surface of the day side, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside to 9,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about , with a width and height of . A smaller, cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.

It was not until after &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter which included a slingshot effect to send the spacecraft out of the Solar System. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was the first spacecraft to attempt such a maneuver, a model for future missions. Such an extended mission was not in the initial proposal, but was planned for prior to launch.

At the closest approach, the velocity of the spacecraft reached , and it came within of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter. Close-up images of the Great Red Spot and the terminator were obtained. Communication with the spacecraft then ceased as it passed behind the planet. The radio occultation data allowed the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere to be measured, showing a temperature inversion between the altitudes with 10 and 100 mbar pressures. Temperatures at the 10-mbar level ranged from , while temperatures at the 100 mbar level were . The spacecraft generated an infrared map of the planet, which confirmed the idea that the planet radiated more heat than it received from the Sun.

Crescent images of the planet were then returned as &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; moved away from the planet. As the spacecraft headed outward, it again passed the bow shock of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere. As this front is constantly shifting in space because of dynamic interaction with the solar wind, the vehicle crossed the bow shock a total of 17 times before it escaped completely.

===Deep space===
&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; crossed the orbit of Saturn in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus in 1979. On June 13, 1983, the craft crossed the orbit of Neptune, and so became the first human-made object to leave the proximity of the major planets of the Solar System. The mission came to an official end on March 31, 1997, when it had reached a distance of from the Sun, though the spacecraft was still able to transmit coherent data after this date.

After March 31, 1997, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;″s weak signal continued to be tracked by the Deep Space Network to aid the training of flight controllers in the process of acquiring deep-space radio signals. There was an Advanced Concepts study applying chaos theory to extract coherent data from the fading signal.

The last successful reception of telemetry was received from &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect and provided no usable data. The final, very weak signal from &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was received on January 23, 2003, when it was from Earth. Further attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful. A final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;. NASA decided that the RTG units had probably fallen below the power threshold needed to operate the transmitter. Hence, no further attempts at contact were made.

=== Timeline ===

==Current status and future==

On July 18, 2023, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; overtook &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, making &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; the third farthest spacecraft from the Sun after &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. As of June 2024, the probe is estimated to be from Earth and from the Sun. Sunlight takes 18.9 hours to reach &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude −16.0. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; is currently travelling in the direction of the constellation Taurus.

If left undisturbed, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and its sister craft &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; will join the two Voyager spacecraft and the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft in leaving the Solar System to wander the interstellar medium. The &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; trajectory is expected to take it in the general direction of the star Aldebaran, currently located at a distance of about 68 light years. If Aldebaran had zero relative velocity, it would require more than two million years for the spacecraft to reach it. Well before that, in about 90,000 years, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; will pass about from the late K-type star HIP 117795. This is the closest stellar flyby in the next few million years of all the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, and &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, which are leaving the Solar System.

A backup unit, &quot;Pioneer H&quot;, is currently on display in the &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; gallery at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the Voyager program.

Because it was strongly advocated by Carl Sagan, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in case either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent life-forms from another planetary system. The plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft. The plaque is attached to the antenna support struts where it would be shielded from interstellar dust.

==&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; in popular media==
In the film &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, a Klingon Bird-of-Prey destroys &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; as target practice.

In the serialized speculative fiction multimedia narrative &quot;17776&quot;, one of the main characters is a sentient &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;.

<doc id="38203" wikidata="Q12171" url="?curid=38203" title="Menstruation">
<text>Menstruation (also known as a period, among other colloquial terms) is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.

The first period, a point in time known as menarche, usually begins between the ages of 11 and 13. Menstruation starting as young as 8 years would still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women. In adults, the range is between 21 and 35 days with the average being 28 days. Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. Periods stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. Lochia occurs after childbirth. Menstruation, and with it the possibility of pregnancy, ceases after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age.

Up to 80% of women do not experience problems sufficient to disrupt daily functioning either during menstruation or in the days leading up to menstruation. Symptoms in advance of menstruation that do interfere with normal life are called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Some 20 to 30% of women experience PMS, with 3 to 8% experiencing severe symptoms. These include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. Other symptoms some women experience include painful periods (estimates are between 50 and 90%) and heavy bleeding during menstruation and abnormal bleeding at any time during the menstrual cycle. A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not re-occurred in 90 days.

== Characteristics ==
===Length and duration===
The first menstrual period occurs after the onset of pubertal growth, and is called menarche. The average age of menarche is 12 to 15 years. However, it may occur as early as eight. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The average age of menarche has changed little in the United States since the 1950s.

Menstruation is the most visible phase of the menstrual cycle and its beginning is used as the marker between cycles. The first day of menstrual bleeding is the date used for the last menstrual period (LMP). The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 35 days in adults. The average length is 28 days; one study estimated it at 29.3 days. The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39 years. The variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44 years.

Perimenopause is when a woman&#x27;s fertility declines, and menstruation occurs less regularly in the years leading up to the final menstrual period, when a woman stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of menopause is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 years in Western countries. Menopause before age 45 is considered &quot;premature&quot; in industrialized countries. Illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.

===Bleeding===

The average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is with considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct name for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.

About half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.

Many women and girls notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there was a miscarriage or a stillbirth, examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed. Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An enzyme called plasmin – contained in the endometrium – tends to inhibit the blood from clotting.

The amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women. In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating. Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.

== Side effects==
===Menstrual health overview===
===Moods and premenstrual syndrome (PMS)===

===Cramps===
In most women, various physical changes are brought about by fluctuations in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. This includes muscle contractions of the uterus (menstrual cramping) that can precede or accompany menstruation. Many women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation. Among adult women, that pain is severe enough to affect daily activity in only 2%–28%. Severe symptoms that disrupt daily activities and functioning may be diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These symptoms can be severe enough to affect a person&#x27;s performance at work, school, and in everyday activities in a small percentage of women.

When severe pelvic pain and bleeding suddenly occur or worsen during a cycle, this could be due to ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. This is checked by using a pregnancy test, ideally as soon as unusual pain begins, because ectopic pregnancies can be life‑threatening.

The most common treatment for menstrual cramps are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can be used to reduce moderate to severe pain, and all appear similar. About 1 in 5 women do not respond to NSAIDs and require alternative therapy, such as simple analgesics or heat pads. Other medications for pain management include aspirin or paracetamol and combined oral contraceptives. Although combined oral contraceptives may be used, there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intrauterine progestogens.

One review found tentative evidence that acupuncture may be useful, at least in the short term. Another review found insufficient evidence to determine an effect.

=== Interactions with other conditions ===
Known interactions between the menstrual cycle and certain health conditions include:

* Some women with neurological conditions experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels may trigger migraines, especially when the woman who has migraines is also taking the birth control pill.
* Many women with epilepsy have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called &quot;catamenial epilepsy&quot;. Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established.
* Research indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the pre-ovulatory stage, than post-ovulatory stage.

=== Sexual activity ===

Sexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle. Before and during ovulation, high levels of estrogen and androgens result in women having a relatively increased interest in sexual activity, and relatively lower interest directly prior to and during menstruation. Unlike other mammals, women may show interest in sexual activity across all days of the menstrual cycle, regardless of fertility.

There is no reliable scientific evidence that would advise against sexual intercourse during menstruation based on medical grounds.

=== Fertility aspects ===
Peak fertility (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) occurs during just a few days of the cycle: usually two days before and two days after the ovulation date. This corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week in a 28-day cycle. This fertile window varies from woman to woman, just as the ovulation date often varies from cycle to cycle for the same woman. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.

== Menstrual disorders ==

Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called &quot;oligoovulation&quot;. The absence of ovulation is called &quot;anovulation&quot;. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called &quot;estrogen breakthrough bleeding&quot;. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called &quot;hypomenorrhea&quot;. Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are &quot;polymenorrhea&quot;; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as &quot;metrorrhagia&quot;. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed &quot;menorrhagia&quot;. Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is &quot;menometrorrhagia&quot;. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is &quot;oligomenorrhea&quot;. Amenorrhea refers to more than three to six months without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman&#x27;s reproductive years. The term for painful periods is &quot;dysmenorrhea&quot;.

There is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation. There are several ways that someone&#x27;s menstrual cycle can differ from the norm:
Extreme psychological stress can also result in periods stopping. More severe symptoms of anxiety or depression may be signs of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) which is a depressive disorder.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically occurs in premenopausal women who do not ovulate normally (i.e. are anovulatory). All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.

Women who had undergone female genital mutilation (particularly type III- infibulation) a practice common in parts of Africa, may experience menstrual problems, such as slow and painful menstruation, that is caused by the near-complete sealing off of the vagina.

=== Dysmenorrhea ===
== Menstrual hygiene management ==

Menstrual products (also called &quot;feminine hygiene&quot; products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available – some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products. Menstruating women manage menstruation primarily by wearing menstrual products such as tampons, napkins or menstrual cups to catch the menstrual blood.

The main disposable products (commercially manufactured) include:
*Sanitary napkins (also called sanitary towels or pads) – Rectangular pieces of material worn attached to the underwear to absorb menstrual flow, often with an adhesive backing to hold the pad in place. Disposable pads may contain wood pulp or gel products, usually with a plastic lining and bleached.
*Tampons – Disposable cylinders of treated rayon/cotton blends or all-cotton fleece, usually bleached, that are inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual flow.

The main reusable products include:
*Menstrual cups – A firm, flexible bell-shaped device worn inside the vagina to collect menstrual flow. 
*Reusable cloth pads – Pads that are made of cotton (often organic), terrycloth, or flannel, and may be handsewn (from material or reused old clothes and towels) or storebought.
*Padded panties or period-proof underwear – Reusable cloth (usually cotton) underwear with extra absorbent layers sewn in to absorb flow. 
Due to poverty, some women cannot afford commercial feminine hygiene products. Instead, they use materials found in the environment or other improvised materials. &quot;Period poverty&quot; is a global issue affecting women and girls who do not have access to safe, hygienic sanitary products. In addition, solid waste disposal systems in developing countries are often lacking, which means women have no proper place to dispose used products, such as pads. Inappropriate disposal of used materials also creates pressures on sanitation systems as menstrual hygiene products can create blockages of toilets, pipes and sewers. In the UK research has shown that for women allotment growers, access to sanitation for menstrual hygiene management is limited.

==Menstrual suppression==
===Due to hormonal contraception===
Menstruation can be delayed by the use of progesterone or progestins. For this purpose, oral administration of progesterone or progestin during cycle day 20 has been found to effectively delay menstruation for at least 20 days, with menstruation starting after 2–3 days have passed since discontinuing the regimen.

Hormonal contraception affects the frequency, duration, severity, volume, and regularity of menstruation and menstrual symptoms. The most common form of hormonal contraception is the combined birth control pill, which contains both estrogen and progestogen. Although the primary function of the pill is to prevent pregnancy, it may be used to improve some menstrual symptoms and syndromes which affect menstruation, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, adenomyosis, amenorrhea, menstrual cramps, menstrual migraines, menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), menstruation-related or fibroid-related anemia and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) by creating regularity in menstrual cycles and reducing overall menstrual flow.

Using the combined birth control pill, it is also possible for a woman to delay or eliminate menstrual periods, a practice called menstrual suppression. Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term, while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible. This can be done either by skipping the placebo pills, or using an extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill, which were first marketed in the U.S. in the early 2000s. This continuous administration of active pills without the placebo can lead to the achievement of amenorrhea in 80% of users within 1 year of use.

=== Due to breastfeeding ===

Breastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.

==Society and culture==

=== Etymology and terminology ===
The word &quot;menstruation&quot; is etymologically related to &quot;moon&quot;. The terms &quot;menstruation&quot; and &quot;menses&quot; are derived from the Latin , which in turn relates to the ancient Greek and to the roots of the English words &quot;month&quot; and &quot;moon&quot;.

Some organizations have begun to use the term &quot;menstruator&quot; instead of &quot;menstruating women&quot;, a term that has been in use since at least 2010. &quot;Menstruator&quot; is used by activists and scholars in order to &quot;express solidarity with women who do not menstruate, transgender men who do, and intersexual and genderqueer individuals&quot;. The term can be contentious between different schools of feminist thought; however, the majority of feminist scholars consider the term to correctly reflect the reality that people of different genders menstruate. The term &quot;people who menstruate&quot; is also used.

=== Traditions, taboos and education ===

Many religions have menstruation-related traditions, for example: Islam prohibits sexual contact with women during menstruation in the 2nd chapter of the Quran. Some scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain wudhu, and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur&#x27;an. In Judaism, a woman during menstruation is called Niddah and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow. In Zoroastrianism, if a woman’s menses did not stop after nine days, it was considered the work of the daēvas.

Menstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education at school in Western countries, although girls may prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty. Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty. The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people&#x27;s understanding of the process. In many Western countries where menstruation is a taboo subject, girls tend to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating and struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation. Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Schools can be an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place. Programs led by peers or third-party agencies are another option. Low-income girls are less likely to receive proper sex education on puberty, leading to a decreased understanding of why menstruation occurs and the associated physiological changes that take place. This has been shown to cause the development of a negative attitude towards menstruation.

==== Seclusion during menstruation ====


In some cultures, women were isolated during menstruation due to menstrual taboos. This is because they are seen as unclean, dangerous, or bringing bad luck to those who encounter them. These practices are common in parts of South Asia including India. A 1983 report found women refraining from household chore during this period in India. Chhaupadi is a social practice that occurs in the western part of Nepal for Hindu women, which prohibits a woman from participating in everyday activities during menstruation. Women are considered impure during this time and are kept out of the house and have to live in a shed. Although chhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, the tradition is slow to change. Women and girls in cultures which practice such seclusion are often confined to menstruation huts, which are places of isolation used by cultures with strong menstrual taboos. The practice has recently come under fire due to related fatalities. Nepal criminalized the practice in 2017 after deaths were reported after the elongated isolation periods, but &quot;the practice of isolating menstruating women and girls continues.&quot; Not all cultures villainize menstruation, the Beng people of West Africa consider menstrual blood as sacred and recognize its significance in reproduction.

=== Beliefs around synchrony ===

==== Effects of the moon ====

Even though the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no relation between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle, nor did data analyzed by period-tracking app Clue, submitted by 1.5million women, of 7.5million menstrual cycles; however, the lunar cycle and the average menstrual cycle were found to be basically equal in length.

==== Cohabitation ====
Beginning in 1971, some research suggested that menstrual cycles of cohabiting women became synchronized (menstrual synchrony). Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.

=== Work ===
Some countries, mainly in Asia, have menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid leave of absence from their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men, and that it furthers gender stereotypes and the medicalization of menstruation.

== Other mammals ==
Most female mammals have an estrous cycle, but not all have a menstrual cycle that results in menstruation. Menstruation in mammals occurs in some close evolutionary relatives such as chimpanzees.

<text>Jobst of Moravia ( or &quot;Jošt Lucemburský&quot;; or &quot;Jodokus von Mähren&quot;; – 18 January 1411), a member of the House of Luxembourg, was Margrave of Moravia from 1375, Duke of Luxembourg and Elector of Brandenburg from 1388 as well as elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) from 1410 until his death. Jobst was an ambitious and versatile ruler, who in the early 15th century dominated the ongoing struggles within the Luxembourg dynasty and around the German throne.

== Life ==

Jobst was presumably born in 1354 in the Moravian residence of Brno, the eldest legitimate son of Margrave John Henry, younger brother of Emperor Charles IV. Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and his half-brother Sigismund were both Jobst&#x27;s cousins.

Designated heir upon his father&#x27;s death in 1375, he ruled the Margraviate of Moravia, and would often quarrel with his younger brother Prokop and the Bishops of Olomouc. In 1388, Jobst received the Duchy of Luxembourg, given in pawn by his cousin King Wenceslaus, son of the late Emperor Charles IV. The same year, Jobst also became Prince-elector of Brandenburg, pawned by Sigismund, who focused on his rule over the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1394, Jobst joined the League of Lords, a rebellion of Bohemian nobles around Boček II of Poděbrady against Wenceslaus. He had Wenceslaus arrested at Prague Castle and later taken into custody by the Austrian Starhemberg dynasty at Wildberg. Peace was made at the instigation of Wenceslaus&#x27; brothers Sigismund and John of Görlitz; however, once released, the king had Jobst expelled from Prague. Sigismund and Jobst signed a mutual inheritance treaty in 1401, but later again fell out with each other.

After the death of King Rupert of Germany in 1410, Jobst was elected successor by four of the seven prince-electors on 1 October, opposing his cousin Sigismund who had already been elected by three electors on 10 September. The deciding vote came from his cousin Wenceslaus in his capacity as King of Bohemia. Though Jobst had the greater support among the electors, he died on 18 January 1411, possibly having been poisoned, which cleared the way for Sigismund&#x27;s election as King of the Romans and his later coronation as Holy Roman Emperor.

== Marriage and issue ==
Jobst married twice, without issue:
* Elisabeth of Opole (1360–1374), daughter of Duke Władysław Opolczyk, in 1372.
* Agnes of Opole (d. 1409), daughter of Duke Bolesław (Bolko) II of Opole and sister of Duke Władysław, in 1374.

== Titles ==
* King of the Romans
* Margrave of Moravia, Lusatia and Brandenburg
* Elector of Brandenburg
* Duke of Luxembourg
* Vicarius of Italy
* Vicarius of the Holy Roman Empire

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized Jobst appears in the 2018 video game &quot;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&quot;. In the game, he is shown with Divish of Talmberg, Hans Capon, Hanush of Leipa, John II of Liechtenstein, and Radzig Kobyla planning on how to defeat Sigismund and free Wenceslaus from captivity. Jobst made a further appearance in &quot;Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&quot;.

<text>Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which typically serve the purpose of protection against adversities of the environment such as wear from rough ground; stability on slippery ground; and temperature.
*Shoes and similar garments ease locomotion and prevent injuries. Such footwear can also be used for fashion and adornment, as well as to indicate the status or rank of the person within a social structure. 
*Socks and other hosiery are typically worn additionally between the feet and other footwear for further comfort and relief.
Cultures have different customs regarding footwear. These include not using any in some situations, usually bearing a symbolic meaning. This can however also be imposed on specific individuals to place them at a practical disadvantage against shod people, if they are excluded from having footwear available or are prohibited from using any. This usually takes place in situations of captivity, such as imprisonment or slavery, where the groups are among other things distinctly divided by whether or not footwear is being worn.

In some cultures, people remove their shoes before entering a home. Bare feet are also seen as a sign of humility and respect, and adherents of many religions worship or mourn while barefoot. Some religious communities explicitly require people to remove shoes before they enter holy buildings, such as temples.

In several cultures people remove their shoes as a sign of respect towards someone of higher standing. Similarly, deliberately forcing other people to go barefoot while being shod oneself has been used to clearly showcase and convey one&#x27;s superiority within a setting of power disparity.

Practitioners of the craft of shoemaking are called shoemakers, cobblers, or cordwainers.

==History==
Footwear has been used by humans since prehistoric times, with paleoclimatology suggesting that they would have been needed in some areas of human settlement by at least 50,000years ago during the Last Glacial Period. Osteologists have found evidence of the effect of footwear on human remains by around 40,000years ago. The oldest shoes so far recovered were found by a team under Luther Cressman in Fort Rock Cave, Oregon, US, in 1938. They had been preserved under the Mazama Ash deposited during the volcanic eruption that formed Crater Lake. In 1999, they were dated to around 10,500 

Egyptian butchers sometimes wore platform sandals with thicker soles than usual to raise their feet out of the gore. Wealthier Egyptians also sometimes wore platforms. The Greeks distinguished a great variety of footwear, particularly different styles of sandals. The heeled cothurnus was part of the standard costume for tragedians, and the effeminate soccus for comedians. Going barefoot, however, was frequently lauded: Spartan boys undergoing military training, Socrates, and Olympic athletes all went without shoes most of the time. Similarly, ancient China considered footwear an important aspect of civilizationparticularly embroidered slippersbut often depicted Taoist immortals and gods like Xuanwu barefoot. The Book of Exodus records Moses reverentially removing his shoes at Mount Sinai and the priests likewise went barefoot at the Temple of Solomon before Babylonian customs prevailed and entering houses of worship in footwear became common in Judaism and Christianity.

The Etruscans experienced several footwear trends, including the prominently pointed shoe or boot now known as the calceus repandus. The Romans saw clothing and footwear as unmistakable signs of power and status in society. Patricians typically wore dyed and ornamented shoes of tanned leather with their togas or armor, while plebeians wore rawhide or hobnail boots and slaves were usually required to be barefoot. These class distinctions in footwear seem to have lessened during the imperial period, however, as the emperors appropriated more and more symbols of high status for themselves. The Romans were the earliest people currently known to have shaped their right and left shoes distinctly during creation, rather than pulling them tight and allowing them to wear into shape. The Catholic patron saints of shoemakingCrispin and Crispinianwere martyred during the Diocletianic Persecution.

In medieval Europe, leather shoes and boots became more common. At first most were simply pieces of leather sewn together and then held tight around the foot with a toggle or drawstring. This developed into the turnshoe, where the sole and upper were sewn together and then turned inside-out to hide and protect the seam and improve water resistance. From the reign of Charlemagne, Byzantine fashions began to influence the west and the pontificalia of the popes and other bishops began to feature greater luxury, including embroidered silk and velvet slippers. By the High Middle Ages, fashion trends periodically prompted sumptuary taxes or regulations and church condemnation for vanity. The 12th-century pigache and 14th- and 15th-century poulaine had elongated toes, often stuffed to maintain their shape. Around the same time, several mendicant orders began practicing discalceation as an aspect of their vows of humility and poverty, going entirely barefoot at all times or only wearing sandals in any weather. From the 1480s, the poulaine was replaced by the duckbill, which had a flat front but soon became impractically wide. The stiff hose of the era usually required fairly soft footwear, which in turn was easier to damage in the dirt and muck of the street and outdoors. This led many people to use wooden-soled calopedes, pattens, or galoshes, overshoes that served as a platform while walking. Particularly in Venice, these platforms were combined with the shoe to make chopines, sometimes so awkwardly high that the wearer required servants to help support them. (Turkish sources, meanwhile, credit the chopines directly to the nalins worn in Ottoman baths and whose height was considered to be a marker of status.)

By the early modern period, the development of better socks and less stiff hose allowed European footwear to become firmer and more durable. Welting was developed, using a narrow band of leather between the uppers and sole to improve appearance and comfort, increase water resistance, and simplify repair, particularly resoling worn shoes. Beginning with the 1533 marriage of the 14-year-old Florentine Catherine de Medici to Prince Henry of France, both male and female royalty and nobles began wearing high heels, giving rise to the expression &quot;well heeled&quot;. This was done sometimes for display or appearance and sometimes as an aid to riding in stirrups. For the most part, male footwear was more ornate and expensive because women&#x27;s feet were usually covered by the large dresses of the era. Shoe fetishism was first publicized in the work of Nicolas-Edme Rétif in prerevolutionary France. 17th-century Cavalier boots developed into upper-class fashion and into sailing boots prized by fishermen and pirates before being replaced as military gear by the 18th-century Hessian and 19th-century Wellington boot. In Ming and Qing China, foot binding led to the development of lotus shoes for Han women and then flowerpot shoes for the Manchu women who wanted to emulate the characteristic walk of women with bound feet without undergoing the process themselves. In Africa, North America, and Spanish and Portuguese South America, slave codes often mandated slaves should be barefoot at all times without exception. Following its independence, the American South was an exception. Its demand for masses of low-quality shoes for its slaves was met by workshops around Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, a dependence that later hobbled the Confederate Army during the Civil War and was responsible in legend for the decisive Battle of Gettysburg. 

Amid the Industrial Revolution, John Adam Dagyr&#x27;s introduction of assembly line production and tight quality control to the &quot;ten-footer&quot; workshops in Lynn, Massachusetts, US, around 1760 is sometimes credited as the first shoe factory. However, although mechanized textile mills greatly reduced the price of proper socks, each step of the shoemaking process still needed to be done by hand in a slowly optimized putting-out system. The first mechanized systemsdeveloped by Marc Isambard Brunel in 1810 to supply boots to the British Army amid the Napoleonic Warsfailed commercially as soon as the wars were over because the demobilized soldiers reduced the price of manual labor. John Brooks Nichols&#x27;s 1850 adaptation of Howe and Singer&#x27;s sewing machines to handle binding uppers to soles and the Surinamese immigrant Jan Ernst Matzeliger&#x27;s 1880 invention of an automatic lasting machine finally allowed true industrialization, taking the productivity of individual workers from 20 or 50 pairs a day to as many as 700, halving prices, and briefly making Lynn the center of world shoe production. As late as 1865, most men in the industry identified in the census and city directory as general purpose &quot;cordwainers&quot; or &quot;shoemakers&quot;; by 1890, they were almost universally described as &quot;shoe workers&quot; ormore oftenby the specific name of their work within the industry: &quot;edgesetter&quot;, &quot;heel trimmer&quot;, &quot;McKay machine operator&quot;. Many were replaced by cheaper immigrants; the Czech Tomáš Baťa joined these workers at Lynn in 1904 and then returned to his own factory in Zlín, Moravia, mechanizing and rationalizing its production while guiding the factory town that developed into a garden city.

By the early 20th century, vulcanization had led to the development of plimsolls, deck shoes, rubber boots, galoshes, and waders. The prevalence of trench foot in World War I focused attention on the importance of providing of adequate footwear in following conflicts, although this was not always possible. Millions of Chinese soldiers in both the NRA and PLA were obliged to use straw and rope shoes to allow easy replacement on long marches during both World War II and the following civil war, contributing to disease and desertion, particularly among the Nationalists. Following the world wars, the increasing importance of professional sports greatly popularized a variety of athletic shoes, particularly sneakers. Major brands such as Converse, Adidas, and Nike used celebrity endorsements from Chuck Taylor, Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, and others to promote their products. Fashion houses periodically prompted new trends in women&#x27;s and high-end fashion. In particular, while working for Christian Dior, Roger Vivier popularized the stiletto heel in 1954. (Men&#x27;s dress shoes have tended to retain 19th-century British looks such as the Oxford shoe and loafers.) Various subcultures have employed distinctive footwear as part of their identity, including winklepickers, Doc Martens, and skate shoes.

The international trade in footwear was at first chiefly restricted to American exports to Europe and Europe&#x27;s exports to its various colonial empires. Assisted by the Marshall Plan after World War II, Italy became the major shoe exporting country in the 1950s. It was joined in the 1960s by Japan, which offshored its production to Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong as its own labor became too expensive. In their turn, the Hong Kong manufacturers began moving production to Guangdong in mainland China almost immediately after the establishment of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Opening Up Policy in the early 1980s. Competitors were soon forced to follow suit, including removal of Taiwanese and Korean production to Fujian and to Wenzhou in southern Zhejiang. Similarly, amid Perestroika and the Fall of Communism, Italy dismantled its domestic industry, outsourcing its work to Eastern Europe, which proved less dependable than the Chinese and further eroded their market share. Beginning around the year 2000, China has constantly produced more than half of the world&#x27;s shoes. As of 2021, footwear is the 30th most traded category internationally; but, while China produces well over 60% of exported footwear, it currently earns less than 36% of the value of the total trade owing to the continuing importance of American, German, and other brands in the North American and European markets.

==Materials==
Modern footwear is usually made of leather or plastic, and rubber. In fact, leather was one of the original materials used for the first versions of a shoe. The soles can be made of rubber or plastic, sometimes with the addition of a sheet of metal on the inside. Roman sandals had sheets of metal on their soles so that they would not bend out of shape.

In more recent times, footwear suppliers such as Nike have begun to source environmentally friendly materials.

==Footwear industry==

In Europe, recent decades have seen a decline in the footwear industry. While about 27,000 firms were in business in 2005, only 21,700 remained in 2009. Not only have these firms decreased in number, but direct employment has also reduced within the sector.

In the U.S., the annual footwear industry revenue was $48 billion in 2012. In 2015, there were about 29,000 shoe stores in the U.S. and the shoe industry employed about 189,000 people. Due to rising imports, these numbers are also declining. The only way of staying afloat in the shoe market is to establish a presence in niche markets.

==Safety of footwear products==

To ensure high quality and safety of footwear, manufacturers have to make sure all products comply to existing and relevant standards. By producing footwear in accordance with national and international regulations, potential risks can be minimized and the interest of both textile manufacturers and consumers can be protected.
The following standards/regulations apply to footwear products:
* CPSIA
* GB Standards such as
** GB20400－2006 Leather and fur-limit of harmful matter
** QB/T1002-2005 Leather shoes
** GB/T 15107 Athletic footwear
* EN Standards for Footwear
* ASTM Standards
* ISO standards
* AAFA Restricted Substance List
* BIS (ISI) : IS 15298-I: 2011 test methods, IS 15298 –II for safety footwear, IS 15298-III Protective footwear, IS 15298-IV Occupational Footwear

== Impressions ==
Footwear can create two types of impressions: two-dimensional and three-dimensional impressions. When footwear places material onto a solid surface, it creates a two-dimensional impression. These types of impressions can be made with a variety of substances, like dirt and sand. When footwear removes material from a soft surface, it creates a three-dimensional impression. These types of impressions can be made in a variety of soft substances, like snow and dirt. Two-dimensional impressions also differ from three-dimensional impressions because the latter demonstrate length, width, and depth whereas two-dimensional impressions only demonstrate the first two aspects.

<text>The Codex Manesse (also  or Pariser Handschrift) is a (manuscript containing songs), the single most comprehensive source of Middle High German &quot;Minnesang&quot; poetry, written and illustrated between when the main part was completed, and with the addenda.

The codex was produced in Zürich (Switzerland), for the Manesse family.

The manuscript is &quot;the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries&quot;; its 137 miniatures are a series of &quot;portraits&quot; depicting each poet.

It is currently housed in the Heidelberg University Library.

In 2023, Codex Manesse was admitted to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World.

==Contents==
The Codex Manesse is an anthology of the works of a total of about 135 minnesingers of the mid 12th to early 14th century.
For each poet, a portrait is shown, followed by the text of their works.
The entries are ordered approximately by the social status of the poets, starting with the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, Kings Conradin and Wenceslaus II, down through dukes, counts and knights, to the commoners.

Most of the poems are &quot;Minnesang&quot;, but there are also other genres, including fables and Spruchdichtung (didactic poems).

The oldest poets represented in the manuscript had been dead for more than a century at the time of its compilations, while others were contemporaries, the latest even late additions of poems written during the early 14th century.

In the portraits, some of the nobles are shown in full armour in their heraldic colors and devices (therefore with their faces hidden), often shown as taking part in a joust, or sometimes in single combat with sword and shield, and sometimes in actual battle.

Some images are motivated by the biography of the person depicted, but some designs just draw their motif from the poet&#x27;s name (thus, Dietmar is shown riding a mule, since his name can be interpreted as meaning &quot;people&#x27;s horse&quot;), while others draw on imagery from their lyrics (Walther von der Vogelweide is shown in a thoughtful pose which exactly matches the description of himself in one of his most famous songs).

==Manuscript history==
The compilation of the codex was patronized by the Manesse family of Zürich, presumably by Rüdiger II Manesse (born before 1252, died after 1304). The house of Manesse declined in the late 14th century, selling their castle in 1393. The fate of the codex during the 15th century is unknown, but by the 1590s it had passed into possession of baron Johann Philipp of Hohensax (two of whose forebears are portrayed in the codex, on foll. 48v and 59v). In 1604, Melchior Goldast published excerpts of its didactic texts.

After 1657 it was in the French royal library, from which it passed to the Bibliothèque Nationale, where the manuscript was studied by Jacob Grimm in 1815. In 1888, after long bargaining, it was sold to the Bibliotheca Palatina of Heidelberg, following a public subscription headed by William I and Otto von Bismarck.

The first critical editions of the &quot;Codex Manesse&quot; appeared in the early nineteenth century. The codex is frequently referred to by Minnesang scholars and in editions simply by the abbreviation &quot;C&quot;, introduced by Karl Lachmann, who used &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for the two main earlier Minnesang codices (the &quot;Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift&quot; and the &quot;Weingartner Liederhandschrift&quot; respectively).

Two leaves of a 15th-century copy of the manuscript, called the &quot;Troßsche Fragment&quot; (&quot;Tross Fragment&quot;), which were held in the Berlin State Library but went missing in 1945, are now in the Jagiellonian Library in Kraków (Berol. mgq 1146).

==Modern reception==
The possibility that the compiler was the &quot;Minnesinger&quot; Johannes Hadlaub provided the subject of a poetic novella, &quot;Hadlaub&quot; (in the &quot;Züricher Novellen&quot;, 1878), by Gottfried Keller.

<text>Numismatics is the study or collection of currency, including coins, tokens, paper money, medals, and related objects.

Specialists, known as numismatists, are often characterized as students or collectors of coins, but the discipline also includes the broader study of money and other means of payment used to resolve debts and exchange goods.

The earliest forms of money used by people are categorised by collectors as &quot;odd and curious&quot;, but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating currency (e.g., cigarettes or instant noodles in prison). As an example, the Kyrgyz people used horses as the principal currency unit, and gave small change in lambskins; the lambskins may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horses are not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as cowry shells, precious metals, cocoa beans, large stones, and gems.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1829, the word &quot;numismatics&quot; comes from the adjective &quot;numismatic&quot;, meaning . It was borrowed in 1792 from French , itself a derivation from Late Latin , genitive of , a variant of meaning . is a latinisation of the Greek () which means , which derives from () , in turn from () , ultimately from () .

==History of money==

Throughout its history, money itself has been made to be a scarce good. Many materials have been used to form money, from naturally scarce precious metals and cowry shells through cigarettes to entirely artificial money, called fiat money, such as banknotes. Many complementary currencies use time as a unit of measure, using mutual credit accounting that keeps the balance of money intact.

Modern money (along with most ancient money) is essentially a token – an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of contemporary physical money. However, goods such as gold or silver retain many of the essential properties of money, such as price fluctuation and limited supply, although these goods are not controlled by one single authority.

==History==
Coin collecting may have possibly existed in ancient times. Augustus gave &quot;coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money&quot; as Saturnalia gifts.

Petrarch, who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vine diggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first Renaissance collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to Emperor Charles IV in 1355.

The first book on coins was &quot;De Asse et Partibus&quot; (1514) by Guillaume Budé. During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope Boniface VIII, Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire, Louis XIV of France, Ferdinand I, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and Henry IV of France to name a few. Numismatics is called the &quot;Hobby of Kings&quot;, due to its most esteemed founders.

Professional societies organised in the 19th century. The Royal Numismatic Society was founded in 1836 and immediately began publishing the journal that became the &quot;Numismatic Chronicle&quot;. The American Numismatic Society was founded in 1858 and began publishing the &quot;American Journal of Numismatics&quot; in 1866.

In 1931 the British Academy launched the Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum publishing collections of Ancient Greek coinage. The first volume of Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles was published in 1958.

In the 20th century, coins gained recognition as archaeological objects, and scholars such as Guido Bruck of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna realized their value in providing a temporal context and the difficulty that curators faced when identifying worn coins using classical literature. After World War II in Germany, a project, &quot;Fundmünzen der Antike&quot; (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.

In the United States, the US Mint established a coin cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. William E. Du Bois&#x27; &quot;Pledges of History...&quot; (1846) describes the cabinet.

C. Wyllys Betts&#x27; &quot;American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals&quot; (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.

Helen Wang&#x27;s &quot;A short history of Chinese numismatics in European languages&quot; (2012–2013) gives an outline history of Western countries&#x27; understanding of Chinese numismatics. Lyce Jankowski&#x27;s &quot;Les amis des monnaies&quot; is an in-depth study of Chinese numismatics in China in the 19th century.

===Modern===

Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid-17th century onward, the period of machine-struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians, and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics frequently lies in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties, mint-made errors, the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures, and even the sociopolitical context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.

===Subfields===

Exonumia (UK English: Paranumismatica) is the study of coin-like objects such as token coins and medals, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counter-stamped coins, wooden nickels, credit cards, and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been legal tender), and many coin collectors are also exonumists.

Notaphily is the study of paper money or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting paper money for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the &quot;Serienscheine&quot; (Series notes) Notgeld. The turning point occurred in the 1970s when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the United States, Germany, and France began publishing their respective national catalogs of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.
Scripophily is the study and collection of companies&#x27; shares and bonds certificates. It is an area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of engraving. Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as stock in a successor company.

<text>Hosiery, (, ) also referred to as legwear, describes garments worn directly on the feet and legs. The term originated as the collective term for products of which a maker or seller is termed a hosier; and those products are also known generically as hose. The term is also used for all types of knitted fabric, and its thickness and weight is defined by denier or opacity. Lower denier measurements of 5 to 15 describe a hose which may be sheer in appearance, whereas styles of 40 and above are dense, with little to no light able to come through on 100 denier items.

== Etymology ==
The word hosiery is a morphological derivation of the Anglo Saxon word &quot;hosa&quot;, which meant a woven garment for the lower body and legs.

==Overview==
The first references to hosiery can be found in the works of Hesiod, where Romans are said to have used leather or cloth in forms of strips to cover their lower body parts. Even the Egyptians are speculated to have used hosiery, as socks have been found in certain tombs.
Most hosiery garments are made by knitting methods. Modern hosiery is usually tight-fitting by virtue of stretchy fabrics and meshes. Older forms include binding to achieve a tight fit. Due to its close fit, most hosiery can be worn as an undergarment, but it is more commonly worn as a combined under/outer garment.

Hosiery garments are the product of hosiery fabric produced from hosiery yarn. Like the yarn used for making woven fabric, hosiery yarn comes from a separate spinning (yarn making) process, and is used with circular knitting machines to form fabric. One or more hosiery yarn is used to make knitted or hosiery fabric, and garments produced out of this are generally referred to as hosiery garments.
