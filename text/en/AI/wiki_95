<text>Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of sediments, ie. mineral or organic particles, at Earth&#x27;s surface, followed by cementation. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock are called sediment, and may be composed of geological detritus (minerals) or biological detritus (organic matter). The geological detritus originated from weathering and erosion of existing rocks, or from the solidification of molten lava blobs erupted by volcanoes. The geological detritus is transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice or mass movement, which are called agents of denudation. Biological detritus was formed by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, as well as their fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water bodies (marine snow). Sedimentation may also occur when dissolved minerals precipitate from water solution.

The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth&#x27;s crust is extensive (73% of the Earth&#x27;s current land surface), but sedimentary rock is estimated to be only 8% of the volume of the crust. Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding. Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in large structures called sedimentary basins. Sedimentary rocks have also been found on Mars.

The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals or other structures. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources including coal, fossil fuels, drinking water and ores.

The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for an understanding of the Earth&#x27;s history, including palaeogeography, paleoclimatology and the history of life. The scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology. Sedimentology is part of both geology and physical geography and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the Earth sciences, such as pedology, geomorphology, geochemistry and structural geology.

==Classification based on origin==

Sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into four groups based on the processes responsible for their formation: clastic sedimentary rocks, biochemical (biogenic) sedimentary rocks, chemical sedimentary rocks, and a fourth category for &quot;other&quot; sedimentary rocks formed by impacts, volcanism, and other minor processes.

===Clastic sedimentary rocks===

Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of rock fragments (&quot;clasts&quot;) that have been cemented together. The clasts are commonly individual grains of quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, or mica. However, any type of mineral may be present. Clasts may also be &quot;lithic fragments&quot; composed of more than one mineral.

Clastic sedimentary rocks are subdivided according to the dominant particle size. Most geologists use the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale and divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: gravel (&gt;2 mm diameter), sand (1/16 to 2 mm diameter), and mud (&lt;1/16 mm diameter). Mud is further divided into silt (1/16 to 1/256 mm diameter) and clay (&lt;1/256 mm diameter). The classification of clastic sedimentary rocks parallels this scheme; conglomerates and breccias are made mostly of gravel, sandstones are made mostly of sand, and mudrocks are made mostly of mud. This tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of rudites, arenites, and lutites, respectively, in older literature.

The subdivision of these three broad categories is based on differences in clast shape (conglomerates and breccias), composition (sandstones), or grain size or texture (mudrocks).

====Conglomerates and breccias====

Breccias are dominantly composed of angular gravel in a groundmass (matrix), while conglomerates are dominantly composed rounded gravel.

====Sandstones====


Sandstone classification schemes vary widely, but most geologists have adopted the Dott scheme, which uses the relative abundance of quartz, feldspar, and lithic framework grains and the abundance of a muddy matrix between the larger grains.

:&quot;Composition of framework grains&quot;
:The relative abundance of sand-sized framework grains determines the first word in a sandstone name. Naming depends on the dominance of the three most abundant components quartz, feldspar, or the lithic fragments that originated from other rocks. All other minerals are considered accessories and not used in the naming of the rock, regardless of abundance.

::* Quartz sandstones have &gt;90% quartz grains
::* Feldspathic sandstones have &lt;90% quartz grains and more feldspar grains than lithic grains
::* Lithic sandstones have &lt;90% quartz grains and more lithic grains than feldspar grains

:&quot;Abundance of muddy matrix material between sand grains&quot;
::When sand-sized particles are deposited, the space between the grains either remains open or is filled with mud (silt and/or clay sized particle).
::* &quot;Clean&quot; sandstones with open pore space (that may later be filled with matrix material) are called arenites.
::* Muddy sandstones with abundant (&gt;10%) muddy matrix are called wackes.

Six sandstone names are possible using the descriptors for grain composition (quartz-, feldspathic-, and lithic-) and the amount of matrix (wacke or arenite). For example, a quartz arenite would be composed of mostly (&gt;90%) quartz grains and have little or no clayey matrix between the grains, a lithic wacke would have abundant lithic grains and abundant muddy matrix, etc.

Although the Dott classification scheme is widely used by sedimentologists, common names like greywacke, arkose, and quartz sandstone are still widely used by non-specialists and in popular literature.

====Mudrocks====

Mudrocks are sedimentary rocks composed of at least 50% silt- and clay-sized particles. These relatively fine-grained particles are commonly transported by turbulent flow in water or air, and deposited as the flow calms and the particles settle out of suspension.

Most authors presently use the term &quot;mudrock&quot; to refer to all rocks composed dominantly of mud. Mudrocks can be divided into siltstones, composed dominantly of silt-sized particles; mudstones with subequal mixture of silt- and clay-sized particles; and claystones, composed mostly of clay-sized particles. Most authors use &quot;shale&quot; as a term for a fissile mudrock (regardless of grain size) although some older literature uses the term &quot;shale&quot; as a synonym for mudrock.

===Biochemical sedimentary rocks===

Biochemical sedimentary rocks are created when organisms use materials dissolved in air or water to build their tissue. Examples include:
* Most types of limestone are formed from the calcareous skeletons of organisms such as corals, mollusks, and foraminifera.
* Coal, formed from vegetation that has removed carbon from the atmosphere and combined it with other elements to build their tissue, this vegetation gets compressed by overlying sediments and undergoes chemical transformation.
* Deposits of chert formed from the accumulation of siliceous skeletons of microscopic organisms such as radiolaria and diatoms.

===Chemical sedimentary rocks===
Chemical sedimentary rock forms when mineral constituents in solution become supersaturated and inorganically precipitate. Common chemical sedimentary rocks include oolitic limestone and rocks composed of evaporite minerals, such as halite (rock salt), sylvite, baryte and gypsum.

===Other sedimentary rocks===
This fourth miscellaneous category includes volcanic tuff and volcanic breccias formed by deposition and later cementation of lava fragments erupted by volcanoes, and impact breccias formed after impact events.

==Classification based on composition==
Alternatively, sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into compositional groups based on their mineralogy:
* Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, are dominantly composed of silicate minerals. The sediment that makes up these rocks was transported as bed load, suspended load, or by sediment gravity flows. Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are subdivided into conglomerates and breccias, sandstone, and mudrocks.
* Carbonate sedimentary rocks are composed of calcite (rhombohedral ), aragonite (orthorhombic ), dolomite (), and other carbonate minerals based on the ion. Common examples include limestone and the rock dolomite.
* Evaporite sedimentary rocks are composed of minerals formed from the evaporation of water. The most common evaporite minerals are carbonates (calcite and others based on ), chlorides (halite and others built on ), and sulfates (gypsum and others built on ). Evaporite rocks commonly include abundant halite (rock salt), gypsum, and anhydrite.
* Organic-rich sedimentary rocks have significant amounts of organic material, generally in excess of 3% total organic carbon. Common examples include coal, oil shale as well as source rocks for oil and natural gas.
* Siliceous sedimentary rocks are almost entirely composed of silica (), typically as chert, opal, chalcedony or other microcrystalline forms.
* Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are composed of &gt;15% iron; the most common forms are banded iron formations and ironstones.
* Phosphatic sedimentary rocks are composed of phosphate minerals and contain more than 6.5% phosphorus; examples include deposits of phosphate nodules, bone beds, and phosphatic mudrocks.

== Deposition and transformation ==

=== Sediment transport and deposition ===
Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment is deposited out of air, ice, wind, gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in suspension. This sediment is often formed when weathering and erosion break down a rock into loose material in a source area. The material is then transported from the source area to the deposition area. The type of sediment transported depends on the geology of the hinterland (the source area of the sediment). However, some sedimentary rocks, such as evaporites, are composed of material that form at the place of deposition. The nature of a sedimentary rock, therefore, not only depends on the sediment supply, but also on the sedimentary depositional environment in which it formed.

=== Transformation (Diagenesis) ===

As sediments accumulate in a depositional environment, older sediments are buried by younger sediments, and they undergo diagenesis. Diagenesis includes all the chemical, physical, and biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition. This includes compaction and lithification of the sediments. Early stages of diagenesis, described as &quot;eogenesis&quot;, take place at shallow depths (a few tens of meters) and is characterized by bioturbation and mineralogical changes in the sediments, with only slight compaction. The red hematite that gives red bed sandstones their color is likely formed during eogenesis. Some biochemical processes, like the activity of bacteria, can affect minerals in a rock and are therefore seen as part of diagenesis. Another example of sedimentary diagenesis is the dolomitzation of rocks such as limestone.

Deeper burial is accompanied by &quot;mesogenesis&quot;, during which most of the compaction and lithification takes place. Compaction takes place as the sediments come under increasing overburden (lithostatic) pressure from overlying sediments. Sediment grains move into more compact arrangements, grains of ductile minerals (such as mica) are deformed, and pore space is reduced. Sediments are typically saturated with groundwater or seawater when originally deposited, and as pore space is reduced, much of these connate fluids are expelled. In addition to this physical compaction, chemical compaction may take place via pressure solution. Points of contact between grains are under the greatest strain, and the strained mineral is more soluble than the rest of the grain. As a result, the contact points are dissolved away, allowing the grains to come into closer contact. The increased pressure and temperature stimulate further chemical reactions, such as the reactions by which organic material becomes lignite or coal.

Lithification follows closely on compaction, as increased temperatures at depth hasten the precipitation of cement that binds the grains together. Pressure solution contributes to this process of cementation, as the mineral dissolved from strained contact points is redeposited in the unstrained pore spaces. This further reduces porosity and makes the rock more compact and competent.

Unroofing of buried sedimentary rock is accompanied by &quot;telogenesis&quot;, the third and final stage of diagenesis. As erosion reduces the depth of burial, renewed exposure to meteoric water produces additional changes to the sedimentary rock, such as leaching of some of the cement to produce secondary porosity.

At sufficiently high temperature and pressure, the realm of diagenesis makes way for metamorphism, the process that forms metamorphic rock.

==Properties==
=== Color ===
The color of a sedimentary rock is often mostly determined by iron, an element with two major oxides: iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Iron(II) oxide (FeO) only forms under low oxygen (anoxic) circumstances and gives the rock a grey or greenish colour. Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) in a richer oxygen environment is often found in the form of the mineral hematite and gives the rock a reddish to brownish colour. In arid continental climates rocks are in direct contact with the atmosphere, and oxidation is an important process, giving the rock a red or orange colour. Thick sequences of red sedimentary rocks formed in arid climates are called red beds. However, a red colour does not necessarily mean the rock formed in a continental environment or arid climate.

The presence of organic material can colour a rock black or grey. Organic material is formed from dead organisms, mostly plants. Normally, such material eventually decays by oxidation or bacterial activity. Under anoxic circumstances, however, organic material cannot decay and leaves a dark sediment, rich in organic material. This can, for example, occur at the bottom of deep seas and lakes. There is little water mixing in such environments; as a result, oxygen from surface water is not brought down, and the deposited sediment is normally a fine dark clay. Dark rocks, rich in organic material, are therefore often shales.

=== Texture ===
The size, form and orientation of clasts (the original pieces of rock) in a sediment is called its texture. The texture is a small-scale property of a rock, but determines many of its large-scale properties, such as the density, porosity or permeability.

The 3D orientation of the clasts is called the fabric of the rock. The size and form of clasts can be used to determine the velocity and direction of current in the sedimentary environment that moved the clasts from their origin; fine, calcareous mud only settles in quiet water while gravel and larger clasts are moved only by rapidly moving water. The grain size of a rock is usually expressed with the Wentworth scale, though alternative scales are sometimes used. The grain size can be expressed as a diameter or a volume, and is always an average value, since a rock is composed of clasts with different sizes. The statistical distribution of grain sizes is different for different rock types and is described in a property called the sorting of the rock. When all clasts are more or less of the same size, the rock is called &#x27;well-sorted&#x27;, and when there is a large spread in grain size, the rock is called &#x27;poorly sorted&#x27;.
The form of the clasts can reflect the origin of the rock. For example, coquina, a rock composed of clasts of broken shells, can only form in energetic water. The form of a clast can be described by using four parameters:
* &quot;Surface texture&quot; describes the amount of small-scale relief of the surface of a grain that is too small to influence the general shape. For example, &quot;frosted grains&quot;, which are covered with small-scale fractures, are characteristic of eolian sandstones.
* &quot;Rounding&quot; describes the general smoothness of the shape of a grain.
* &quot;Sphericity&quot; describes the degree to which the grain approaches a sphere.
* &quot;Grain form&quot; describes the three-dimensional shape of the grain.

Chemical sedimentary rocks have a non-clastic texture, consisting entirely of crystals. To describe such a texture, only the average size of the crystals and the fabric are necessary.

=== Mineralogy ===

Most sedimentary rocks contain either quartz (siliciclastic rocks) or calcite (carbonate rocks). In contrast to igneous and metamorphic rocks, a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals. However, the origin of the minerals in a sedimentary rock is often more complex than in an igneous rock. Minerals in a sedimentary rock may have been present in the original sediments or may formed by precipitation during diagenesis. In the second case, a mineral precipitate may have grown over an older generation of cement. A complex diagenetic history can be established by optical mineralogy, using a petrographic microscope.

Carbonate rocks predominantly consist of carbonate minerals such as calcite, aragonite or dolomite. Both the cement and the clasts (including fossils and ooids) of a carbonate sedimentary rock usually consist of carbonate minerals. The mineralogy of a clastic rock is determined by the material supplied by the source area, the manner of its transport to the place of deposition and the stability of that particular mineral.

The resistance of rock-forming minerals to weathering is expressed by the Goldich dissolution series. In this series, quartz is the most stable, followed by feldspar, micas, and finally other less stable minerals that are only present when little weathering has occurred. The amount of weathering depends mainly on the distance to the source area, the local climate and the time it took for the sediment to be transported to the point where it is deposited. In most sedimentary rocks, mica, feldspar and less stable minerals have been weathered to clay minerals like kaolinite, illite or smectite.

=== Fossils ===

Among the three major types of rock, fossils are most commonly found in sedimentary rock. Unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks form at temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remnants. Often these fossils may only be visible under magnification.

Dead organisms in nature are usually quickly removed by scavengers, bacteria, rotting and erosion, but under exceptional circumstances, these natural processes are unable to take place, leading to fossilisation. The chance of fossilisation is higher when the sedimentation rate is high (so that a carcass is quickly buried), in anoxic environments (where little bacterial activity occurs) or when the organism had a particularly hard skeleton. Larger, well-preserved fossils are relatively rare.
Fossils can be both the direct remains or imprints of organisms and their skeletons. Most commonly preserved are the harder parts of organisms such as bones, shells, and the woody tissue of plants. Soft tissue has a much smaller chance of being fossilized, and the preservation of soft tissue of animals older than 40 million years is very rare. Imprints of organisms made while they were still alive are called trace fossils, examples of which are burrows, footprints, etc.

As a part of a sedimentary rock, fossils undergo the same diagenetic processes as does the host rock. For example, a shell consisting of calcite can dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In the same way, precipitating minerals can fill cavities formerly occupied by blood vessels, vascular tissue or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called permineralization. The most common minerals involved in permineralization are various forms of amorphous silica (chalcedony, flint, chert), carbonates (especially calcite), and pyrite.

At high pressure and temperature, the organic material of a dead organism undergoes chemical reactions in which volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide are expulsed. The fossil, in the end, consists of a thin layer of pure carbon or its mineralized form, graphite. This form of fossilisation is called carbonisation. It is particularly important for plant fossils. The same process is responsible for the formation of fossil fuels like lignite or coal.

===Primary sedimentary structures===


Structures in sedimentary rocks can be divided into &quot;primary&quot; structures (formed during deposition) and &quot;secondary&quot; structures (formed after deposition). Unlike textures, structures are always large-scale features that can easily be studied in the field. Sedimentary structures can indicate something about the sedimentary environment or can serve to tell which side originally faced up where tectonics have tilted or overturned sedimentary layers.

Sedimentary rocks are laid down in layers called beds or strata. A bed is defined as a layer of rock that has a uniform lithology and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure a lamina forms in a rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding is characteristic of deposition by a flowing medium (wind or water).

The opposite of cross-bedding is parallel lamination, where all sedimentary layering is parallel. Differences in laminations are generally caused by cyclic changes in the sediment supply, caused, for example, by seasonal changes in rainfall, temperature or biochemical activity. Laminae that represent seasonal changes (similar to tree rings) are called varves. Any sedimentary rock composed of millimeter or finer scale layers can be named with the general term &quot;laminite&quot;. When sedimentary rocks have no lamination at all, their structural character is called massive bedding.

Graded bedding is a structure where beds with a smaller grain size occur on top of beds with larger grains. This structure forms when fast flowing water stops flowing. Larger, heavier clasts in suspension settle first, then smaller clasts. Although graded bedding can form in many different environments, it is a characteristic of turbidity currents.

The surface of a particular bed, called the bedform, can also be indicative of a particular sedimentary environment. Examples of bed forms include dunes and ripple marks. Sole markings, such as tool marks and flute casts, are grooves eroded on a surface that are preserved by renewed sedimentation. These are often elongated structures and can be used to establish the direction of the flow during deposition.

Ripple marks also form in flowing water. There can be symmetric or asymmetric. Asymmetric ripples form in environments where the current is in one direction, such as rivers. The longer flank of such ripples is on the upstream side of the current. Symmetric wave ripples occur in environments where currents reverse directions, such as tidal flats.

Mudcracks are a bed form caused by the dehydration of sediment that occasionally comes above the water surface. Such structures are commonly found at tidal flats or point bars along rivers.

===Secondary sedimentary structures===
Secondary sedimentary structures are those which formed after deposition. Such structures form by chemical, physical and biological processes within the sediment. They can be indicators of circumstances after deposition. Some can be used as way up criteria.

Organic materials in a sediment can leave more traces than just fossils. Preserved tracks and burrows are examples of trace fossils (also called ichnofossils). Such traces are relatively rare. Most trace fossils are burrows of molluscs or arthropods. This burrowing is called bioturbation by sedimentologists. It can be a valuable indicator of the biological and ecological environment that existed after the sediment was deposited. On the other hand, the burrowing activity of organisms can destroy other (primary) structures in the sediment, making a reconstruction more difficult.

Secondary structures can also form by diagenesis or the formation of a soil (pedogenesis) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite. Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of concretions. Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots. In carbonate rocks such as limestone or chalk, chert or flint concretions are common, while terrestrial sandstones sometimes contain iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay containing angular cavities or cracks are called septarian concretions.

After deposition, physical processes can deform the sediment, producing a third class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary layers, such as between sand and clay, can result in flame structures or load casts, formed by inverted diapirism. While the clastic bed is still fluid, diapirism can cause a denser upper layer to sink into a lower layer. Sometimes, density contrasts occur or are enhanced when one of the lithologies dehydrates. Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the pore fluid pressure in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies of sedimentary rock called sedimentary dykes. The same process can form mud volcanoes on the surface where they broke through upper layers.

Sedimentary dykes can also be formed in a cold climate where the soil is permanently frozen during a large part of the year. Frost weathering can form cracks in the soil that fill with rubble from above. Such structures can be used as climate indicators as well as way up structures.

Density contrasts can also cause small-scale faulting, even while sedimentation progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting). Such faulting can also occur when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as at the front side of a delta or the continental slope. Instabilities in such sediments can result in the deposited material to slump, producing fissures and folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary folds and faults, which can be difficult to distinguish from folds and faults formed by tectonic forces acting on lithified rocks.

==Depositional environments==

The setting in which a sedimentary rock forms is called the depositional environment. Every environment has a characteristic combination of geologic processes, and circumstances. The type of sediment that is deposited is not only dependent on the sediment that is transported to a place (provenance), but also on the environment itself.

A marine environment means that the rock was formed in a sea or ocean. Often, a distinction is made between deep and shallow marine environments. Deep marine usually refers to environments more than 200 m below the water surface (including the abyssal plain). Shallow marine environments exist adjacent to coastlines and can extend to the boundaries of the continental shelf. The water movements in such environments have a generally higher energy than that in deep environments, as wave activity diminishes with depth. This means that coarser sediment particles can be transported and the deposited sediment can be coarser than in deeper environments. When the sediment is transported from the continent, an alternation of sand, clay and silt is deposited. When the continent is far away, the amount of such sediment deposited may be small, and biochemical processes dominate the type of rock that forms. Especially in warm climates, shallow marine environments far offshore mainly see deposition of carbonate rocks. The shallow, warm water is an ideal habitat for many small organisms that build carbonate skeletons. When these organisms die, their skeletons sink to the bottom, forming a thick layer of calcareous mud that may lithify into limestone. Warm shallow marine environments also are ideal environments for coral reefs, where the sediment consists mainly of the calcareous skeletons of larger organisms.

In deep marine environments, the water current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine particles can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing on the ocean floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4 km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves; as a result, no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and are still deposited. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When the bottom of the sea has a small inclination, for example, at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quiet deep marine environment and can cause the near-instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.

The coast is an environment dominated by wave action. At a beach, dominantly denser sediment such as sand or gravel, often mingled with shell fragments, is deposited, while the silt and clay sized material is kept in mechanical suspension. Tidal flats and shoals are places that sometimes dry because of the tide. They are often cross-cut by gullies, where the current is strong and the grain size of the deposited sediment is larger. Where rivers enter the body of water, either on a sea or lake coast, deltas can form. These are large accumulations of sediment transported from the continent to places in front of the mouth of the river. Deltas are dominantly composed of clastic (rather than chemical) sediment.

A continental sedimentary environment is an environment in the interior of a continent. Examples of continental environments are lagoons, lakes, swamps, floodplains and alluvial fans. In the quiet water of swamps, lakes and lagoons, fine sediment is deposited, mingled with organic material from dead plants and animals. In rivers, the energy of the water is much greater and can transport heavier clastic material. Besides transport by water, sediment can be transported by wind or glaciers. Sediment transported by wind is called aeolian and is almost always very well sorted, while sediment transported by a glacier is called glacial till and is characterized by very poor sorting.

Aeolian deposits can be quite striking. The depositional environment of the Touchet Formation, located in the Northwestern United States, had intervening periods of aridity which resulted in a series of rhythmite layers. Erosional cracks were later infilled with layers of soil material, especially from aeolian processes. The infilled sections formed vertical inclusions in the horizontally deposited layers, and thus provided evidence of the sequence of events during deposition of the forty-one layers of the formation.

=== Sedimentary facies ===
The kind of rock formed in a particular depositional environment is called its sedimentary facies. Sedimentary environments usually exist alongside each other in certain natural successions. A beach, where sand and gravel is deposited, is usually bounded by a deeper marine environment a little offshore, where finer sediments are deposited at the same time. Behind the beach, there can be dunes (where the dominant deposition is well sorted sand) or a lagoon (where fine clay and organic material is deposited). Every sedimentary environment has its own characteristic deposits. When sedimentary strata accumulate through time, the environment can shift, forming a change in facies in the subsurface at one location. On the other hand, when a rock layer with a certain age is followed laterally, the lithology (the type of rock) and facies eventually change.

Facies can be distinguished in a number of ways: the most common are by the lithology (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by fossil content. Coral, for example, only lives in warm and shallow marine environments and fossils of coral are thus typical for shallow marine facies. Facies determined by lithology are called lithofacies; facies determined by fossils are biofacies.

Sedimentary environments can shift their geographical positions through time. Coastlines can shift in the direction of the sea when the sea level drops (regression), when the surface rises (transgression) due to tectonic forces in the Earth&#x27;s crust or when a river forms a large delta. In the subsurface, such geographic shifts of sedimentary environments of the past are recorded in shifts in sedimentary facies. This means that sedimentary facies can change either parallel or perpendicular to an imaginary layer of rock with a fixed age, a phenomenon described by Walther&#x27;s Law.

The situation in which coastlines move in the direction of the continent is called transgression. In the case of transgression, deeper marine facies are deposited over shallower facies, a succession called onlap. Regression is the situation in which a coastline moves in the direction of the sea. With regression, shallower facies are deposited on top of deeper facies, a situation called offlap.

The facies of all rocks of a certain age can be plotted on a map to give an overview of the palaeogeography. A sequence of maps for different ages can give an insight in the development of the regional geography.

====Gallery of sedimentary facies====
== Sedimentary basins ==

Places where large-scale sedimentation takes place are called sedimentary basins. The amount of sediment that can be deposited in a basin depends on the depth of the basin, the so-called &quot;accommodation space&quot;. The depth, shape and size of a basin depend on tectonics, movements within the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere. Where the lithosphere moves upward (tectonic uplift), land eventually rises above sea level and the area becomes a source for new sediment as erosion removes material. Where the lithosphere moves downward (tectonic subsidence), a basin forms and sediments are deposited.

A type of basin formed by the moving apart of two pieces of a continent is called a rift basin. Rift basins are elongated, narrow and deep basins. Due to divergent movement, the lithosphere is stretched and thinned, so that the hot asthenosphere rises and heats the overlying rift basin. Apart from continental sediments, rift basins normally also have part of their infill consisting of volcanic deposits. When the basin grows due to continued stretching of the lithosphere, the rift grows and the sea can enter, forming marine deposits.

When a piece of lithosphere that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions along passive continental margins, but sag basins can also be found in the interior of continents. In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious circle. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basin can thus exceed 10 km.

A third type of basin exists along convergent plate boundaries – places where one tectonic plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin in front of the overriding plate – an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental collision, the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.

At the same time, the growing weight of the mountain belt can cause isostatic subsidence in the area of the overriding plate on the other side to the mountain belt. The basin type resulting from this subsidence is called a back-arc basin and is usually filled by shallow marine deposits and molasse.

=== Influence of astronomical cycles ===
In many cases facies changes and other lithological features in sequences of sedimentary rock have a cyclic nature. This cyclic nature was caused by cyclic changes in sediment supply and the sedimentary environment. Most of these cyclic changes are caused by astronomic cycles. Short astronomic cycles can be the difference between the tides or the spring tide every two weeks. On a larger time-scale, cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by Milankovitch cycles: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis and orbit around the Sun. There are a number of Milankovitch cycles known, lasting between 10,000 and 200,000 years.

Relatively small changes in the orientation of the Earth&#x27;s axis or length of the seasons can be a major influence on the Earth&#x27;s climate. An example are the ice ages of the past 2.6 million years (the Quaternary period), which are assumed to have been caused by astronomic cycles. Climate change can influence the global sea level (and thus the amount of accommodation space in sedimentary basins) and sediment supply from a certain region. Eventually, small changes in astronomic parameters can cause large changes in sedimentary environment and sedimentation.

==Sedimentation rates==
The rate at which sediment is deposited differs depending on the location. A channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in one day, while on the deep ocean floor each year only a few millimetres of sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal sedimentation and sedimentation caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like mass movements, rock slides or flooding. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of a large amount of sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though the environment is usually a quiet place. Other sedimentary environments are dominated by normal, ongoing sedimentation.

In many cases, sedimentation occurs slowly. In a desert, for example, the wind deposits siliciclastic material (sand or silt) in some spots, or catastrophic flooding of a wadi may cause sudden deposits of large quantities of detrital material, but in most places eolian erosion dominates. The amount of sedimentary rock that forms is not only dependent on the amount of supplied material, but also on how well the material consolidates. Erosion removes most deposited sediment shortly after deposition.

==Stratigraphy==

Sedimentary rock are laid down in layers called beds or strata, each layer is horizontally laid down over the older ones and new layers are above older layers as stated in the principle of superposition. There are usually some gaps in the sequence called unconformities which represent periods where no new sediments were laid down, or when earlier sedimentary layers were raised above sea level and eroded away.

Unconformities can be classified based on the orientation of the strata on either sides of the unconformity:
*Angular unconformity when the earlier layers are tilted and eroded while the later layers are horizontally laid.
*Nonconformity if the early layers have no bedding in contrast to the later layers, ie. they are igneous or metamorphic rocks.
*Disconformity if both the early beds and the later beds are parallel to each other.

Sedimentary rocks contain important information about the history of the Earth. They contain fossils, the preserved remains of ancient plants and animals. Coal is considered a type of sedimentary rock. The composition of sediments provides us with clues as to the original rock. Differences between successive layers indicate changes to the environment over time. Sedimentary rocks can contain fossils because, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, they form at temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remains.

== Provenance ==


Provenance is the reconstruction of the origin of sediments. All rock exposed at Earth&#x27;s surface is subjected to physical or chemical weathering and broken down into finer grained sediment. All three types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) can be the source of sedimentary detritus. The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and interpret the history of sediment from the initial parent rocks at a source area to final detritus at a burial place.

<text>A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: &quot;Senatus&quot;), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: &quot;senex&quot; meaning &quot;the elder&quot; or &quot;old man&quot;) and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. However the Roman Senate was not the ancestor or predecessor of modern parliamentarism in any sense, because the Roman senate was not a de jure legislative body.

Many countries have an assembly named a &quot;senate&quot;, composed of &quot;senators&quot; who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of &quot;sober second thought&quot; to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected. Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.

==Overview==

The modern word &quot;senate&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;senātus&quot; (senate), which comes from &quot;senex&quot;, &#x27;elder man&#x27;. A member or legislator of a senate is called senator. The Latin word &quot;senator&quot; was adopted into English with no change in spelling. Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of social organization, in which advisory or decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men. For the same reason, the word &quot;senate&quot; is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate. This form of adaptation was used to show the power of those in body and for the decision-making process to be thorough, which could take a long period of time. The original senate was the Roman Senate, which lasted until at least CE 603, although various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome. In the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Senate continued until the Fourth Crusade, circa 1202–1204. The female form senatrix also existed. 

Modern democratic states with bicameral parliamentary systems are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel lower house, known variously as the &quot;House of Representatives&quot;, &quot;House of Commons&quot;, &quot;Chamber of Deputies&quot;, &quot;National Assembly&quot;, &quot;Legislative Assembly&quot;, or &quot;House of Assembly&quot;, by electoral rules. This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, one house employing a proportional voting system and the other being elected on a majoritarian or plurality basis, and an electoral basis or &quot;collegium&quot;. Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house. In some federal states senates also exist at the subnational level. In the United States, most states and territories have senates, with the exception of Nebraska, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (whose legislatures are unicameral bodies called the &quot;Legislature&quot; but whose members refer to themselves as &quot;senators&quot;) and the District of Columbia (whose unicameral legislature is called the Council). There is also the US Senate at the federal level. Similarly in Argentina, in addition to the Senate at federal level, eight of the country&#x27;s provinces, Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe, have bicameral legislatures with a Senate. Córdoba and Tucumán changed to unicameral systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.

In Australia and Canada, only the upper house of the federal parliament is known as the Senate. All Australian states other than Queensland have an upper house known as a Legislative council. Several Canadian provinces also once had a Legislative Council, but these have all been abolished, the last being Quebec&#x27;s Legislative council in 1968.

In Germany, the last senate of a state parliament, the Bavarian Senate, was abolished in 2000.

Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments. For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the Senate of the Philippines, the term of a senator being six years. In contrast, members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.

==Alternative meanings==

The terms &quot;senate&quot; and &quot;senator&quot;, however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:
*The Senate of Finland was, until 1918, the executive branch and the supreme court.
*The Senate of Latvia (lv) fulfilled a similar judicial function during the interbellum (1918–1940).
*In German politics:
**In the &quot;Bundesländer&quot; (Federated States) of Germany which form a City State (in German: &quot;Stadtstaat&quot;), i.e. Berlin (Senate of Berlin), Bremen (Senate of Bremen) and Hamburg (Senate of Hamburg), the senates (&quot;Senat&quot; in German) are the executive branch, with senators (&quot;Senator&quot;) being the holders of ministerial portfolios.
**In a number of cities which were former members of the &quot;Hanse&quot; (a medieval confederacy of port cities mainly at the shores of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea), such as Greifswald, Lübeck, Rostock, Stralsund, or Wismar, the city government is also called a Senate. However, in Bavaria, the Senate was a second legislative chamber until its abolition in 1999.
*In German jurisprudence:
**The term Senat (senate) in higher courts of appeal refers to the &quot;bench&quot; in its broader metonymy meaning, describing members of the judiciary collectively (usually five judges), often occupied with a particular subject-matter jurisdiction. However, the judges are not called &quot;senators&quot;. The German term &quot;Strafsenat&quot; (literally &quot;Penal Senate&quot;) in a German court translates to &quot;Bench of penal-law jurisdiction&quot; and &quot;Zivilsenat&quot; (literally &quot;Civil Senate&quot;) to &quot;Bench of private-law jurisdiction&quot;. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany consists of two senates of eight judges each. In its case the division is mostly of an organizational nature, as a matter of dividing the work load; both senates handle the same kind of constitutional cases. At some points in the past, one senate was considered more conservative and the other more liberal, but that is not the case as of 2011.
*In Scotland, judges of the High Court of Justiciary are called Senators of the College of Justice.
*In some, mostly federal countries with a unicameral legislature, some of the legislators are elected differently from the others and are called senators. In federal countries, such senators represent the territories, while the other members represent the people at large (this device is used to allow a federal representation without having to establish a bicameral legislature); this is the case with St. Kitts and Nevis, Comoros and Micronesia. In other, non-federal countries, the use of the term &quot;senator&quot; marks some other difference between such members and the rest of the legislators (such as the method of selection); this is the case with Dominica&#x27;s House of Assembly and the Saint Vincent House of Assembly. Until 2022, this was also the case in the States of Jersey.
*In Wales, there is a translation of the word Senatus into the Welsh language (equivalent to &#x27;Senate&#x27; in English) as the word &quot;Senedd&quot;. The word was used first to refer specifically to what is now referred to as the Senedd building, but the name later became a metonym for the devolved unicameral legislature it hosts, the &quot;National Assembly for Wales&quot;, which in May 2020 adopted the name &quot;Senedd Cymru&quot; or &quot;the Welsh Parliament&quot; with the term &quot;Senedd&quot; becoming the common short name for the institution in both languages of Welsh and English. There is no direct translation of the word &quot;Parliament&quot; in Welsh, with Senedd (being a cognate of Senate) meaning both &quot;Senate&quot; and &quot;Parliament&quot;. 
*An academic senate is the governing body of some universities.
*In Greece during the early stages of the Greek War of Independence, various local legislative and executive bodies were established by the Greek rebels. Two of them were styled &quot;senate&quot;: the Peloponnesian Senate and the Senate of Western Continental Greece.

<doc id="44418" wikidata="Q1752346" url="?curid=44418" title="Deliberative assembly">
<text>A deliberative assembly is a meeting of members who use parliamentary procedure. 

==Etymology==
In a speech to the electorate at Bristol in 1774, Edmund Burke described the British Parliament as a &quot;deliberative assembly&quot;, and the expression became the basic term for a body of persons meeting to discuss and determine common action. Merriam-Webster&#x27;s definition excludes legislatures.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; by Henry Martyn Robert describes the following characteristics of a deliberative assembly:
* A group of people meets to discuss and make decisions on behalf of the entire membership.
* They meet in a single room or area, or under equivalent conditions of simultaneous oral communication.
* Each member is free to act according to their judgement.
* Each member has an equal vote.
* The members at the meeting act for the entire group, even if there are members absent.
* A member&#x27;s dissent on a particular issue constitutes neither a withdrawal from the group, nor a termination of membership.

==Types==
&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; identifies several types of deliberative assemblies.

===Mass meeting===
A large &quot;meeting&quot;, which is an unorganized group meeting open to all individuals in a sector of the population who are interested in deliberating about a subject proposed by the meeting&#x27;s sponsors. Examples include meetings to discuss common political concerns or community interests, or meetings to form a new society.

===Local assembly of an organized society===
A &quot;local assembly of an organized society&quot;, which is a membership meeting of a local chapter or branch of a membership organization. Examples include local chapter meetings of organizations like the Sierra Club.

===Convention===
A &quot;convention&quot;, which is a meeting of delegates who represent constituent units of a population. Conventions are not permanently established bodies, and delegates are normally elected for only one term. A convention may be held by an organized society, where each local assembly is represented by a delegate.

===Legislative body===
A &quot;legislative body&quot;, which is a legally established public lawmaking body. It consists of representatives chosen by the electorate. Examples include national legislatures such as parliaments, and local government councils such as state legislatures, regional assemblies and city councils.

===Board===
A &quot;board&quot;, which is an administrative, managerial, or quasi-judicial body. A board derives its power from an outside authority that defines the scope of its operations. Examples include an organized society&#x27;s or company&#x27;s board of directors and government agency boards like a board of education.

==Rights of members==
A member of a deliberative assembly has the right to attend meetings and make and second motions, speak in the debate, and vote. Organizations may have different classes of members (such as regular members, active members, associate members, and honorary members), but the rights of each class of membership must be defined (such as whether a &quot;member&quot; in a class has the right to vote). There may also be ex officio members or persons who are members under some other office or position they hold. Ex officio members have the same rights as other members.

<text>Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, often simply referred to as Robert&#x27;s Rules, is a manual of parliamentary procedure by U.S. Army officer Henry Martyn Robert (1837-1923). &quot;The object of Rules of Order is to assist an assembly to accomplish the work for which it was designed [...] Where there is no law [...] there is the least of real liberty.&quot; The term &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is also used more generically to refer to any of the more recent editions, by various editors and authors, based on any of Robert&#x27;s original editions, and the term is used more generically in the United States to refer to parliamentary procedure. It was written primarily to help guide voluntary associations in their operations of governance.

Robert&#x27;s manual was first published in 1876 as an adaptation of the rules and practice of the United States Congress to suit the needs of non-legislative societies. &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules&quot; is the most widely used manual of parliamentary procedure in the United States. It governs the meetings of a diverse range of organizations—including church groups, county commissions, homeowners&#x27; associations, nonprofit associations, professional societies, school boards, trade unions, and college fraternities and sororities—that have adopted it as their parliamentary authority. Robert published four editions of the manual before his death in 1923, the last being the thoroughly revised and expanded Fourth Edition published as Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Revised in May 1915.

== History ==

A U.S. Army officer, Henry Martyn Robert (1837–1923), saw a need for a standard of parliamentary procedure while living in San Francisco. He found San Francisco in the mid-to-late 19th century to be a chaotic place where meetings of any kind tended to be tumultuous, with little consistency of procedure and with people of many nationalities and traditions thrown together.

The first edition of the book, whose full title was &quot;&quot;, was published in February 1876 by the then-Major Robert, with the short title &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; placed on its cover.

The procedures prescribed by the book were loosely modeled after those used in the United States House of Representatives, with such adaptations as Robert saw fit for use in ordinary societies. Although he was in the military, the rules in his book were not based on military rules. The author&#x27;s interest in parliamentary procedure began in 1863 when he was chosen to preside over a church meeting and, although he accepted the task, he felt that he did not have the necessary knowledge of proper procedure.

In his later work as an active member of several organizations, Robert discovered that members from different areas of the country had very different views regarding what the proper parliamentary rules were, and these conflicting views hampered the organizations in their work. He eventually became convinced of the need for a new manual on the subject, one which would enable many organizations to adopt the same set of rules.

Henry M. Robert himself published four editions of the manual before his death in 1923, the last being the thoroughly revised and expanded Fourth Edition published as &quot;&quot; in May 1915. By this time Robert had long been retired from the Army with the rank of brigadier general. The revisions were based on the feedback from hundreds of letters that Robert had received through the years. In addition, to explain the rules in &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Revised&quot; (abbreviated ROR), Robert published an introductory book for beginners titled &quot;Parliamentary Practice: An Introduction to Parliamentary Law&quot; in 1921 and a full book of explanations titled &quot;Parliamentary Law&quot; in 1923.
== Special rules ==
In those cases in which the bylaws or other governing documents of an organization refer to &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, certain rules in the book may be subordinate to other specified rules, including any conflicting provisions in applicable law, the corporate charter, the constitution or bylaws, and special rules of order.

Even if an organization has adopted &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, it can still adopt its own rules which supersede any rules in this book. The only limitations might come from the rules in a parent organization or from national, state, or local law. An example of a rule that organizations sometimes adopt is one that allows the use of proxy voting. Such a rule is not allowed unless the organization specifically provides for it in its bylaws.

== Concise editions ==
Since the copyrights for several of the original editions (1915 or earlier) have expired, numerous other books and manuals have been published incorporating &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; as part of their titles, with some of them based on those earlier editions (see List of books with Robert&#x27;s Rules in the title). Some examples are
*&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; (1989) by Darwin Patnode, PhD, past President of the American Institute of Parliamentarians. Simplified and updated based on the original 1876 edition, Thomas Nelson, 
*&quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot;
*&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules in Plain English, Second Edition&quot; (2005) by Doris P. Zimmerman, HarperCollins, 
*&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules Simplified&quot; (2006), by Arthur T. Lewis and Henry M. Robert, Dover Publications, 
*&quot;In Brief&quot;

Henry M. Robert III, grandson of the original author and Trustee for the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association, had acknowledged that &quot;there has been controversy among parliamentarians concerning the length of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules&quot; in its various editions and the complexity of the rules it describes.&quot; As a result, a supplemental book was developed.

In 2005, a shorter reference guide, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief&quot; (abbreviated RONRIB), was published by the same authorship team and publisher as the Tenth Edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR) and was made to be in accord with that edition of RONR. A third edition of this shorter guide was published in 2020 to conform with the current Twelfth Edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot;.

The &quot;In Brief&quot; book is the only concise guide for &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; authorized by the Roberts Rules Association, and is intended as an introductory book for those unfamiliar with parliamentary procedure. The authors say, &quot;In only thirty minutes, the average reader can learn the bare essentials, and with about ninety minutes&#x27; reading can cover all the basics.&quot; It is meant to be an introductory supplement to the current edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; and is not suitable for adoption as a parliamentary authority in itself.

== Comprehensive editions ==

Through a family trust, and later through the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association (which is made up of descendants of Henry M. Robert), several subsequent editions of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; have been published, including another major revision of the work. The Seventh Edition, published in February 1970 on the 94th anniversary of the publication of the First Edition, was the first under the title &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR). The subsequent editions were based on additional feedback from users, including feedback received by electronic means in recent years. These later editions included material from Robert&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Practice&quot; and &quot;Parliamentary Law&quot;.

The current edition of the series became effective on September 1, 2020, under the title &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot;, Twelfth Edition. This edition states that it:

The authorship team of the current Twelfth Edition consists of a grandson of General Robert, an attorney, a lobbyist and legislative analyst, a mathematics professor, and a copy editor, all of them being experienced parliamentarians.

More than six million copies have been printed (which is a total of all editions).

The following table lists the official versions of the body of work known as &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; developed by Henry M. Robert and maintained by his successors.

===Purpose===
Generally, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is a guide for conducting meetings and making decisions as a group. The purpose of the book is &quot;to enable assemblies of any size, with due regard for every member&#x27;s opinion, to arrive at the general will on the maximum number of questions of varying complexity in a minimum amount of time and under all kinds of internal climate ranging from total harmony to hardened or impassioned division of opinion&quot;.

The book is designed for use in ordinary societies rather than legislative assemblies, and it is the most commonly adopted parliamentary authority among societies in the United States. It is also recognized as &quot;the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world&quot;.

The book states that it is &quot;a codification of the present-day general parliamentary law&quot;. &quot;General parliamentary law&quot; refers to the common rules and customs for conducting business in organizations and assemblies. It does not refer to statutory legal requirements nor to common-law precedent derived from court judgments. In other words, the book is about procedures for meetings and not about what is &quot;legal&quot; (i.e. it is not a law book).

As a reference, it is designed to answer, as nearly as possible, any question of parliamentary procedure that may arise. The Twelfth Edition contains 633 pages of text, and all of its original content was included because it &quot;has at some time come up as a question of procedure somewhere&quot;. The completeness of the book was made so that organizations would not have to write extensive rules for themselves. In addition, members of different organizations could refer to the same book of rules.

Henry M. Robert III responded to the simplification by saying the following:

=== Contents of current (12th) edition ===
The contents of the current (12th) edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), published in 2020, include details on the types of groups that use the book, the ways that decisions could be made, and the various situations in which decisions are made.

==== Basics ====
The Introduction in the book provides a history of parliamentary procedure and includes the background and history of Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order. Rules in the book are based on the rights of the majority, of the minority (especially a strong minority that is greater than one third), of individual members, of absentees, and of all these together. Some fundamental principles upon which the book is based include: one question at a time; one person, one vote; and a vote being limited to members present.

A group that uses the book is called a deliberative assembly. The types of deliberative assemblies are a mass meeting, a local assembly of an organized society (local club or local branch), a convention, a legislative body, and a board. An organization may have rules which could include a corporate charter, a constitution or bylaws, rules of order (special rules of order and parliamentary authority), standing rules, and customs. To conduct business, groups have meetings or sessions that may be separated by more than or be within a quarterly time interval. The types of meetings are a regular meeting, a special meeting, an adjourned meeting, an annual meeting, an executive session, a public session, and electronic meetings.

A member of a deliberative assembly has the right to attend meetings, make motions, speak in debate, and vote. The process of making a decision is done through a motion, which is a proposal to do something. The formal steps in handling a motion are the making of a motion, having a second, stating the motion, having debate on the motion, putting the motion to a vote, and announcing the results of the vote. Action could be taken informally without going through these steps by using unanimous consent. When making a choice, the basic principle of decision is majority vote. In situations when more than majority vote is required, the requirement could include a two-thirds vote, previous notice, or a vote of a majority of the entire membership.

==== Motions ====
The book provides details about main motions including the motion to ratify. In addition, the book lists other motions and provides details (including explanations, forms, and examples) on these motions which include:
* Subsidiary motions – postpone indefinitely, amend, commit or refer, postpone to a certain time, limit or extend limits of debate, previous question, and lay on the table
* Privileged motions – call for the orders of the day, raise a question of privilege, recess, adjourn, and fix the time to which to adjourn
* Incidental motions – point of order, appeal, suspend the rules, objection to the consideration of a question, division of a question, consideration by paragraph or seriatim, motions relating to methods of voting and the polls, motions relating to nominations, request to be excused from a duty, and requests and inquiries (parliamentary inquiry, request for information, request for permission (or leave) to withdraw or modify a motion, request to read papers, and request for any other privilege)
* Motions that bring a question again before an assembly – take from the table, rescind/amend something previously adopted, discharge a committee, and reconsider

Details for each motion include its purpose, when it could be made, if it is debatable, if it is amendable, the vote required for adoption, and if it could be reconsidered. The &quot;order of precedence&quot;, or rank, of the motions is also described in detail.

==== Various topics ====
The second half of the book covers various topics in detail. Brief summaries of these topics are as follows:

Depending on the situation, motions could be renewed, or made again. On the other hand, members should not use legitimate motions for dilatory and improper purposes to waste time.

A quorum, or minimum number of members, is required to be present at a meeting in order to validly conduct business. The business that is to come up in a meeting could be listed in an order of business or an agenda.

Each member could get a chance to speak through assignment of the floor and debate. Debate may be limited in the number of speeches and time and should be respectful to others at all times. Voting takes place to decide the course of action and it could be done in a multitude of ways, such as voice vote, standing vote, and ballot vote.

Officers in an organization could be elected through the process of nominations and elections. Each organization decides for itself which officers to have, but the minimum officers in a deliberative assembly are a presiding officer (usually &quot;president&quot; or &quot;chairman&quot;) and a secretary. The secretary keeps the minutes, or the official records of the proceedings, for each meeting. As part of their duties, the officers may have reports to give, such as a financial report given by the treasurer. In addition, an organization may have a board to handle business on behalf of the organization. Officers and boards only have such authority and powers that are given to them in the governing documents of the organization. There may also be committees that are formed to assist the organization. The boards and committees may have reports to give as well.

People may gather in mass meetings for a specific purpose or cause. One such purpose of the mass meetings could be for the intent of organizing a permanent society.

Each organization has its basic rules contained in its bylaws. The bylaws could describe the name of the organization and its purpose, the requirements to be a member or an officer, how meetings are scheduled, if there are boards or committees (or both), its parliamentary authority, and how to amend the bylaws.

Representatives from constituent groups may gather as delegates in conventions to conduct business on behalf of the organization. Conventions may consist of several meetings and may last for several days or more on an annual basis or other such infrequent interval.

If members do not act according to the organization&#x27;s rules, they could be subject to disciplinary procedures. Such action could range from censure to the extreme of expulsion from the organization. Officers could be disciplined by removal from office.

==== Charts, tables, and lists ====
The tinted pages (pages marked by a gray band along the outer edge) in the rear of the book contain the following charts, tables, and lists: (1) &quot;Chart for Determining When Each Subsidiary or Privileged Motion Is In Order&quot;, (2) &quot;Table of Rules Relating to Motions&quot;, (3) &quot;Sample Forms Used in Making Motions&quot;, (4) and (5) &quot;Motions and Parliamentary Steps&quot;, (6) &quot;Motions Which Require a Two-Thirds Vote&quot;, (7) &quot;Motions Whose Reconsideration Is Prohibited Or Limited&quot;, and (8) &quot;Table of Rules for Counting Election Ballots&quot;.

=== Additional information related to current edition ===
In addition to containing a summary of basic points from the current (12th) edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), the following contents are unique to the current (3rd) edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief&quot; (RONRIB): an example of an agenda, additional sample dialogues, frequently asked questions, an example of a call of a meeting, an example of a memorandum listing the order of business, and the following tables: (A) &quot;Handling Motions as chair&quot;, (B) &quot;When Chair Stands and Sits&quot;, (C) &quot;Conducting a Meeting as chair&quot;, (D) &quot;Table of Rules Relating to Motions&quot;, and (E) &quot;Words to Use as a Member&quot;.

The Robert&#x27;s Rules Association has also made the Eleventh Edition available in CD-ROM format (designed for installation on Windows PCs) through American Legal Publishing. The CD contains the current editions of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; and &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief&quot; as well as a &quot;Timekeeper&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;Teller&#x27;s Report&quot;, &quot;Sample Rules for Electronic Meetings&quot;, various forms, and resources for &quot;Ballot Voting and Understanding Secondary Amendments&quot;.

For the first time, an e-book version of the current Twelfth Edition was released by the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association. Any copy of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; that is downloaded online is likely an older edition (1915 or earlier) that is available in the public domain.

Translations of any edition of Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order into other languages have not been published by the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association. Any translated copy of Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order done by a third party may not accurately reflect the correct meaning in the target language.

=== Changes between editions ===
The following table lists some of the changes that were made between the editions of Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order. The numbered pages may not correspond to the total number of pages in the edition due to additional material in the preface, introduction, and other miscellaneous pages that were not included in the numbering system.
Generally, a fuller list and more details of the changes are found in the preface of each edition. A detailed list of changes for the current (12th) edition is provided on the website maintained by the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association. All the changes were a result of questions and comments received from users.

=== Rule explanations ===
Starting in the period between the Tenth Edition and the Eleventh Edition, the authors released official interpretations of rules in the book onto the website maintained by the Robert&#x27;s Rules Association. The interpretations from that period were later incorporated into the Eleventh Edition.

In addition, the authors addressed common misunderstandings of the rules coming from frequently asked questions. Some of the misunderstandings involve: when the president can vote, whether ex-officio members can vote, the definition of majority, how abstentions affect the vote, a &quot;friendly amendment&quot;, &quot;calling the question&quot;, &quot;tabling&quot; a motion, getting items on the agenda, and the contents of minutes. While these misunderstandings are of the rules in the current edition of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot;, the organization may be governed by other rules which supersede these &quot;default&quot; rules.

The official interpretations and addressed common misunderstandings were a result of questions posted in the Question &amp; Answer Forum at The Robert&#x27;s Rules Association website. This forum is actively moderated by members of the authorship team.

== Law-making bodies ==
Generally, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is designed for ordinary societies. However, law-making bodies at the local level (such as a city council or a county commission) function similarly to boards of societies. The book has found application to such bodies. Such bodies are also subject to open meeting laws (Sunshine laws) and other applicable laws, all of which supersede any conflicting provisions in the book.

On the other hand, legislative bodies at the state or national level have their own well-defined set of rules (such as &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual of Legislative Procedure&quot;). However, a survey found that four state legislative chambers in the United States still use &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;.

==Corporations==

&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is based on each member of a group having equal weight as expressed by vote. This book has found application in the corporate world, such as in shareholder meetings and in board of director meetings. However, the rules have to be modified to account for when some individuals within the group have more power than others.

== Parliamentarians ==
A parliamentarian is an expert on parliamentary procedure. To be effective consultants for the organizations they work for, parliamentarians are expected to be knowledgeable on &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;.

The National Association of Parliamentarians (NAP) is the largest non-profit association of parliamentarians in the world. This organization bases its opinions and instruction upon &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (12th ed.). Membership in this organization requires passing an exam which is based on the first half of the concise guide, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief&quot; (3rd ed.).

The American Institute of Parliamentarians is another non-profit association of parliamentarians. This organization stresses proficiency and familiarity with a variety of parliamentary authorities, although it states on its website that &quot;&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is the most frequently used parliamentary authority&quot;. The website also states that it &quot;is the premier manual on parliamentary authority&quot; and &quot;a &#x27;must-have&#x27; text for every parliamentarian&quot;.

== Youth organizations ==
Youth organizations, such as Business Professionals of America (BPA), Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda (FBLA-PBL), HOSA-Future Health Professionals, the National FFA Organization, SkillsUSA, and the Technology Student Association (TSA), sponsor parliamentary procedure competitions (such as Parli Pro) as part of their programs for their student members. These competitions are based on &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot;. The National Association of Parliamentarians have partnered with some of these organizations.

&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; are used in Congressional Debate (also referred to as Student Congress), an event put on by the National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA).

&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is also used during American Legion and American Legion Auxiliary Boys/Girls State programs and in Model United Nations conferences. While the chair of each committee in an MUN conference may sometimes deviate from the written rules for educational purposes, the format of the rules in the specific committees is mostly based on &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;. Another program in which &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; may be used is Model Congress, although the rules in these programs may more closely resemble those in the legislative assemblies that the programs simulate.

&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; are also used during National Association of College and University Residence Halls (NACURH) Residence Hall Association meetings, regional conferences, and national conferences.

== Alternative rules for organizations ==
=== Other parliamentary authorities ===
Parliamentarians have estimated that about 85 to 95 percent of organizations in the United States use &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;. The remaining percentage of organizations use other books on meeting procedures. Notable examples of such books on parliamentary authority include &quot;Demeter&#x27;s Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure&quot;, and &quot;Riddick&#x27;s Rules of Procedure&quot;. These books along with &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; share the general idea of rule of the majority with respect for the minority. A difference may be a &quot;simplification&quot; of the rules. Less popular choices include Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Rules for Meetings&quot; and &quot;Democratic Rules of Order&quot;.

=== Consensus decision-making ===
In modern parliamentary procedure, the usual practice is having a proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a vote on it, with majority vote deciding the issue if there are any disagreements. An alternative to this process is consensus decision-making. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when there is no longer any disagreement.

As a response to this alternative, the authors of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; stated their belief in using debate and majority vote as part of the process in making decisions for the group.

<text>A legislature (, ) is a deliberative assembly with the legal authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country, nation or city on behalf of the people therein. They are often contrasted with the executive and judicial powers of government. Legislatures can exist at different levels of government–national, state/provincial/regional, local, even supranational (such as the European Parliament). Countries differ as to what extent they grant deliberative assemblies at the subnational law-making power, as opposed to purely administrative responsibilities.

Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the budget involved.

The members of a legislature are called legislators. In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper house.

== Terminology ==

The name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.

Common names include:

* Assembly (from Old French , cf. assemble)
* Congress (from Latin , &quot;having gone together&quot;)
* Council (from Latin , &quot;calling out with, uniting&quot;)
* Diet (from Ancient Greek , &quot;lifestyle, discussion, decision&quot;)
* Estates or States (from Old French , &quot;condition, state, the state&quot;)
* Parliament (from Old French , &quot;talking&quot;) 

By names:
* Chamber of Deputies
* Chamber of Representatives
* House of Assembly
* House of Chiefs
* House of Representatives
* Legislative assembly
* Legislative council
* National Assembly
* Senate

By languages:
* Cortes (from Spanish , &quot;courts&quot;)
* Duma (from Russian , &quot;thought&quot;)
* Knesset (from Hebrew , &quot;meeting&quot;)
* Majlis (from Arabic , &quot;sitting room&quot;)
* Oireachtas (From Irish &quot;airecht/oireacht&quot;, &quot;deliberative assembly of freemen&quot;)
* Rada (from Polish , &quot;&#x27;advice, decision&quot;)
* Reichstag (from German , &quot;assembly of the empire&quot;)
** Landtag (from German , &quot;assembly of the country&quot;)
* Sansad (from Sanskrit , &quot;assembly&quot;) 
* Sejm (from Polish , &quot;take with, assembly&quot;)
* Soviet (from Russian , &quot;council&quot;)
* Thing (from Proto-Germanic &quot;*þingą&quot;, &quot;meeting, matter discussed at a meeting&quot;)
** Husting (from Old Norse , &quot;house meeting&quot;)
* Veche (from Old East Slavic , &quot;council, agreement&quot;)

Though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.

== History ==
Among the earliest recognised formal legislatures was the Athenian &quot;Ecclesia.&quot; In the Middle Ages, European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures. These were often named the Estates. The oldest surviving legislature is the Icelandic Althing, founded in 930 CE.

== Functions ==
Democratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.

=== Representation ===
There exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:

* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;
* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;
* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legislature matches the demographics of the wider society;
* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;
* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.

=== Deliberation ===
One of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society. This activity can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, such as the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the floor of the legislature frequently sees lively debate. In contrast, in committee-based legislatures like the United States Congress, deliberation takes place in closed committees.

=== Legislation ===
While legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In Westminster-style legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in continental Europe and those in presidential systems of the Americas have more independence in drafting and amending bills.

=== Authorizing expenditure ===
The origins of the power of the purse which legislatures typically have in passing or denying government budgets goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the monarchs would have to consult before raising taxes. For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.

=== Oversight ===
There are several ways in which the legislature can hold the executive branch (the administration or government) accountable. This can be done through hearings, questioning, interpellations, votes of confidence, the formation of committees. Parliaments are usually ensured with upholding the rule of law, verifying that public funds are used accountably and efficiently as well as make government processes transparent and actions so that they can be debated by the public and its representatives.

Agora notes that parliamentary systems or political parties in which political leaders can influence or decide which members receive top jobs can lead to passivity amongst members of the party and less challenging of leadership. Agora notes that this phenomenon is acute if the election of a member is dependent on the support of political leadership.

=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===
In contrast to democratic systems, legislatures under authoritarianism are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:

* Providing legitimacy;
* Incorporating opponents into the system;
* Providing some representation of outside interests;
* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;
* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.

== Internal organization ==
Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a quorum.

Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the .

The members of a legislature usually represent different political parties; the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs.

==Relation to other branches of government==
Legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield, compared to other political players such as judiciaries, militaries, and executives. In 2009, political scientists M. Steven Fish and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary powers index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German Bundestag, the Italian Parliament, and the Mongolian State Great Khural tied for most powerful, while Myanmar&#x27;s House of Representatives and Somalia&#x27;s Transitional Federal Assembly (since replaced by the Federal Parliament of Somalia) tied for least powerful.

Some political systems follows the principle of legislative supremacy, which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written constitution. Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.

In parliamentary and semi-presidential systems of government, the executive is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a vote of no confidence. On the other hand, according to the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive. Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the impeachment of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.

Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies.

==Members==

Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as legislators, who vote on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of &quot;seats&quot; it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 &quot;seats&quot; has 100 members. By extension, an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a &quot;seat&quot;, as, for example, in the phrases &quot;safe seat&quot; and &quot;marginal seat&quot;.

After election, the members may be protected by parliamentary immunity or parliamentary privilege, either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.

==Chambers==
A legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies, called by various names including &quot;legislative chambers&quot;, &quot;debate chambers&quot;, and &quot;houses&quot;, which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral, one divided into two chambers is bicameral, and one divided into three chambers is tricameral.

In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the upper house, while the other is considered the lower house. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly parliamentary systems, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly federal presidential systems, the upper house has equal or even greater power. 
In federations, the upper house typically represents the federation&#x27;s component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the European Union. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governmentsas in the European Union and in Germany and, before 1913, in the United Statesor be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in Australia and the United States since 1913.
Tricameral legislatures are rare; the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in South Africa. Tetracameral legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia. The only legislature with a number of chambers bigger than four was the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia; initially established as a Pentacameral body in 1963, it was turned into a hexacameral body in 1967.

==Size==

Legislatures vary widely in their size. Among national legislatures, China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress is the largest with 2,980 members, while Vatican City&#x27;s Pontifical Commission is the smallest with 7. Neither legislature is democratically elected: The Pontifical Commission members are appointed by the Pope and the National People&#x27;s Congress is indirectly elected within the context of a one-party state.

Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents. Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country&#x27;s lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly.

<text>Adjara ( &quot;Ach’ara&quot; ) or Achara, officially known as the Autonomous Republic of Adjara ( &quot;Ach’aris Avt’onomiuri Resp’ublik’a&quot; ), is a political-administrative region of Georgia. It is in the country&#x27;s southwestern corner, on the coast of the Black Sea, near the foot of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, north of Turkey. It is an important tourist destination and includes Georgia&#x27;s second most populous city of Batumi as its capital. About 350,000 people live on its .

Adjara is home to the Adjarians, a regional subgroup of Georgians. The name can be spelled in a number of ways: &quot;Ajara&quot;, &quot;Ajaria&quot;, &quot;Adjaria&quot;, &quot;Adzharia&quot;, &quot;Atchara&quot; and &quot;Achara&quot;. Under the Soviet Union, Adjara was part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as the Adjarian ASSR. The autonomous status of Adjara is guaranteed under article 6 of the Treaty of Kars.

== History ==

Adjara was a part of Georgian polities, Colchis and Caucasian Iberia, since ancient times. Colonized by Greeks in the 5th century BC, the region fell under Rome in the 2nd century BC. It became part of the kingdom of Lazica before being incorporated into the Kingdom of Abkhazia in the 8th century AD, the latter led unification of Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.

Andrew the Apostle, who is believed to be a missionary of the Mother of God to Georgia and founder of the Georgian Orthodox Church, entered Georgia from Adjara region and first preached Christianity there.

Adjaria was occupied by several empires: the First Persian Empire (500 BC), Seljuks (11th century), Mongols (13th century), and Timurids (14th century).

=== Ottoman period ===
The Ottomans conquered the area in 1614. Although, the Ottoman millet system allowed its subjects extensive self-governance and religious freedom, many Adjarians gradually chose to convert to Islam during the 200 years of Ottoman presence. The nobility converted first. Adjarians were fully Islamized by the end of the eighteenth century.

=== Russian Empire ===
The Ottomans were forced to cede Adjara to the expanding Russian Empire in 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin. The Berlin Treaty allowed Adjarians to leave for Turkey, keeping a provision of Section 6, article 21 of the Treaty of San Stefano. Many Adjarians emigrated to Turkey. While the Russian authorities supported the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s missionary efforts, they also tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas and supporting the local Muslim clergy. As a result, many Adjarians emigrants, called Muhacir, came back to Adjara. Within Russian imperial administrative division, Adjara was called Batumi okrug, comprising Kutaisi Governorate.
=== Soviet rule ===
In 1918, Georgia regained its independence as a democratic republic and Adjara became part of it. However, in April 1918, the Ottoman Empire invaded Georgia and captured Batumi. On 4 June 1918, the Treaty of Batum was signed, under which Georgia was forced to cede Adjara to the Ottoman Empire. However, due to the Ottoman defeat in the First World War and the Treaty of Mudros, the Ottomans soon withdrew the territory. After the temporary occupation by the British (with the entrance of the British warship ) troops in 1918–1920, Adjara became part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1920. The British administration ceded the region to the Democratic Republic of Georgia on 20 July 1920. It was granted autonomy under the Georgian constitution adopted in February 1921 when the Red Army invaded Georgia. Turkey reinvaded Adjara in March 1921, although Georgians defeated Turks in the Battle of Batumi and Ankara&#x27;s government ceded the territory to Georgia under Article VI of Treaty of Kars on the condition that autonomy be provided for the Muslim population, while Turkish commodities were guaranteed free transit through the port of Batumi. The Soviets established in 1921 the Adjarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in accord with this clause, thus Adjara remained part of Georgia. The autonomous republic was the only autonomous unit in the USSR based solely on religion. However, Stalin&#x27;s definition of what constituted a nation was based on language. Without their own language, Adjars did not develop a strong sense of national identity, separate from Georgian. Moreover, the Soviet atheist ideology dampened religious practice. In the 1920s, the Ajars rebelled against the Soviet anti-Islamic activities, as well as against the collectivization reforms. The armed uprising began in the mountainous regions of Adjara in April 1929. Soviet troops were deployed in response and swiftly quelled the revolt.
===Independent Georgia===
After Georgian independence, Aslan Abashidze became the chairman of Adjaria&#x27;s parliament, the Adjarian Supreme Soviet. Abashidze was initially appointed by the first Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia in 1991. However, he later took advantage of the civil war in the country and turned Adjara into the personal fiefdom, although it remained relatively prosperous enclave in an otherwise rather chaotic country. During the 1991–1992 Georgian coup d&#x27;état which ousted Gamsakhurdia from power, Abashidze declared a state of emergency in Adjara, closing its borders and shutting down the Adjarian Supreme Soviet. In response to pressure from the Adjarian opposition led by Republican Party of Georgia, Georgia&#x27;s new leader Eduard Shevardnadze met Aslan Abashidze in Batumi and persuaded him to resume the Supreme Soviet sessions in May 1992. However, the opposition failed to oust Abashidze. While Shevardnadze could easily sway certain members of the Adjarian Supreme Soviet against Abashidze, he did not do so. Being brought to power through the coup launched by the militia leaders Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Kitovani, Shevardnadze saw Abashidze as a useful counterweight against these warlords.

Further exploiting the instability, at this time brought by the War in Abkhazia, Abashidze moved to further consolidate his power. During the summer of 1992, Abashidze appointed a seven-member Presidium of the Adjarian Supreme Soviet, made up of his supporters, and ruled by decree through this body. The Supreme Soviet, on the other hand, practically ceased to convene. Abashidze unilaterally took power without formal agreement and started to withhold tax revenue and capture Adjara&#x27;s considerable wealth. However, he managed to prevent various paramilitary groups from entering Adjara&#x27;s territory, and preserved peace through authoritarianism, which brought him considerable popularity.

After the end of Georgia&#x27;s civil war, Abashidze reached agreement with the Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze to stay in power. Shevardnadze, who had yet to cement his power in Georgia, ignored Abashidze&#x27;s authoritarian rule and even appreciated that it brought stability to the region. The central government in Tbilisi had very little say in what went on in Adjara. Elections in Adjara were not free and fair, Abashidze controlled the media and captured customs revenue for his personal enrichment. Abashidze instituted the border control with the rest of Georgia and created armed paramilitaries. However, he asserted that Adjara wasn&#x27;t separatist. His regime survived on receiving funds from the customs control in Sarpi at Georgia–Turkey border, contraband of cigarettes and allegedly also weapons and narcotics, an oil refinery in Batumi and selling of ships stationed in Adjara without Georgian government&#x27;s approval. Even though Shevardnadze often complained about Abashidze&#x27;s aggressive autonomous strategy, they had good relationships and supported each other when they needed public support. Initially Abashidze&#x27;s Democratic Union for Revival and Shevardnadze&#x27;s Union of Citizens of Georgia worked together in Georgian Parliament and Adjarian Supreme Council following new elections in 1995-1996. However, a series of disputes with UCG in 1997 concerning limits of Abashidze&#x27;s power in Adjara and defections of his party deputies to UCG led Abashidze to view the UCG and especially its &#x27;reformists&#x27; faction with suspicions and he withdrew into opposition, establishing a powerful anti-CUG bloc which took part in the 1999 Georgian parliamentary election and garnered around 25 per cent of the vote.

In 2000, by withdrawing his candidacy from the presidential elections in Georgia, Abashidze managed to get Shevardnadze to change Georgian constitution to increase Adjara&#x27;s status. From 1997 to 2001, Abashidze passed several amendments to Adjara&#x27;s constitution to strengthen his power. He established the post of a directly elected Head of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara with powers to control any movement of military on Adjara&#x27;s territory, and was elected on this position in November 2001 while being the only candidate.

The situation changed following the Rose Revolution of 2003 when Shevardnadze was deposed in favor of the reformist opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili. Adjaran leader Aslan Abashidze, being in strong opposition to the Rose Revolution, declared a state of emergency immediately after Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s ousting on 23 November 2003. He intensified a crackdown on opposition, with dozens being injured as a result of clashes between protesters and police in the southern Adjaran village of Gonio in January 2004. Soon after his inauguration as president in January 2004, Saakashvili took aim at Abashidze with strong anticorruption reforms. In the wake of Abashidze&#x27;s visit to Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on 20 January backing Abashidze&#x27;s policy and condemning his opposition as &quot;extremist forces&quot;. In spring 2004, a major crisis in Adjara erupted as the central government sought to reimpose its authority on the region. It led to several encounters between Abashidze&#x27;s paramilitaries and the Georgian army. However, Saakashvili&#x27;s ultimate and mass protests in Batumi against Abashidze&#x27;s autocratic rule forced the Adjaran leader to resign in May 2004. Facing charges of embezzlement and murder, Abashidze destroyed the bridges between Adjara and the rest of Georgia to delay the advance of Georgian troops in Batumi and then fled to Moscow. Even Abashidze&#x27;s former ally, Haji Mahmud Kamashidze, sided with Saakashvili. Saakashvili wanted Adjara to keep a significant autonomy. A new law was therefore introduced to redefine the terms of Adjara&#x27;s autonomy. Levan Varshalomidze succeeded Abashidze as the chairman of the government.

In July 2007, the seat of the Georgian Constitutional Court was moved from Tbilisi to Batumi. In November 2007 Russia ended its two-century military presence in the region by withdrawing from the 12th Military Base (the former 145th Motor Rifle Division) in Batumi.

Turkey still has noticeable economic and religious influence in Adjara, making some Georgians wary of the Turkish presence. However, in recent years, Turkish influence has again been supplanted by the Russians, who have returned to the region in large numbers, also causing anxiety among some locals.

== Law and government ==


The status of the Adjaran Autonomous Republic is defined by Georgia&#x27;s law on Adjara and the region&#x27;s new constitution, adopted following the ousting of Aslan Abashidze. The local legislative body is the Supreme Council. The head of the region&#x27;s government—the Council of Ministers of Adjara—is nominated by the President of Georgia who also has powers to dissolve the assembly and government and to overrule local authorities on issues where the constitution of Georgia is contravened. Tornike Rizhvadze is the current head of the Adjaran government.

On 24 October 1997, Adjara became a full member of the Assembly of European Regions (AER).

=== Administrative divisions ===
Adjara is subdivided into six administrative units: 

== Geography and climate ==
Adjara is on the southeastern coast of the Black Sea and extends into the wooded foothills and mountains of the Lesser Caucasus. It has borders with the region of Guria to the north, Samtskhe-Javakheti to the east and Turkey to the south. Most of Adjara&#x27;s territory either consists of hills or mountains. The highest mountains rise more than above sea level. Around 60% of Adjara is covered by forests. Many parts of the Meskheti Range (the west-facing slopes) are covered by temperate rain forests.

Adjara is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

===Climate===

Adjara is well known for its humid climate (especially along the coastal regions) and prolonged rainy weather, although there is plentiful sunshine during the spring and summer months. Adjara receives the highest amounts of precipitation both in Georgia and in the Caucasus. It is also one of the wettest temperate regions in the northern hemisphere. No region along Adjara&#x27;s coast receives less than of precipitation per year. The west-facing (windward) slopes of the Meskheti Range receive upwards of of precipitation per year. The coastal lowlands receive most of the precipitation in the form of rain (due to the area&#x27;s subtropical climate). September and October are usually the wettest months. Batumi&#x27;s average monthly rainfall for the month of September is . The interior parts of Adjara are considerably drier than the coastal mountains and lowlands. Winter usually brings significant snowfall to the higher regions of Adjara, where snowfall often reaches several meters. Average summer temperatures are between in the lowland areas and between in the highlands. The highest areas of Adjara have lower temperatures. Average winter temperatures are between along the coast while the interior areas and mountains average around . Some of the highest mountains of Adjara have average winter temperatures of .

== Economy ==

Adjara has good land for growing tea, citrus fruits and tobacco. Mountainous and forested, the region has a subtropical climate, and there are many health resorts. Tobacco, tea, citrus fruits, and avocados are leading crops; livestock raising is also important. Industries include tea packing, tobacco processing, fruit and fish canning, oil refining, and shipbuilding.

The regional capital, Batumi, is an important gateway for the shipment of goods heading into Georgia, Azerbaijan and landlocked Armenia. The port of Batumi is used for the shipment of oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Its oil refinery handles Caspian oil from Azerbaijan which arrives by pipeline to Supsa port and is transported from there to Batumi by rail. The Adjaran capital is a center for shipbuilding and manufacturing.

Adjara is the main center of Georgia&#x27;s coastal tourism industry, having displaced the northwestern province of Abkhazia since that region&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; secession from Georgia in 1993. 

== Demographics ==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Adjara is 333,953.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The Adjarians (Ajars) are an ethnographic group of the Georgian people who speak a group of local dialects known collectively as Adjarian. The written language is Georgian. Adjarians have been known as &quot;Muslim Georgians&quot;. They were officially referred as such until the 1926 Soviet census which listed them as &quot;Ajars&quot; and counted 71,000 of them. Later, they were simply classified under a broader category of Georgians as no official Soviet census asked about religion. In independent Georgia, censuses do not include an &quot;Adjarian&quot; category, nor do they distinguish between ethnic Georgian Muslims and other Muslims, such as Azerbaijanis.

Ethnic minorities include Laz, Russians, Armenians, Pontic Greeks, and Abkhaz.

=== Religion ===

After Adjara was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin, those Adjarians who were Muslim were allowed to leave for Turkey. While the Russian authorities supported the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s missionary efforts, they also tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas and supporting the local Muslim clergy. As a result, many Adjarians emigrants, called Muhacir, came back to Adjara.

Although Adjara&#x27;s political and religious autonomy was guaranteed by the 1921 Treaty of Kars, the Soviet atheist ideology dampened religious practice in the region.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-establishment of Georgia&#x27;s independence first led to an Islamic revival. However, later Christianity has experienced a strong growth in Adjara, especially among the young, which saw the conversion to Christianity as returning to the religion of ancestors prior to the Ottoman conquest. Nevertheless, there still remain Sunni Muslim communities in Adjara, mainly in the Khulo district. The Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs is active in Adjara. According to Ghia Nodia, many Adjarians are Muslims but they consider themselves ethnic Georgians. According to the 2014 census, 54.5% of Adjara&#x27;s population is Orthodox Christian, while 39.8% is Muslim, the rest includes atheists, adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church and others. In the main city, Batumi, out of 152,839 inhabitants, 68.7% is Eastern Orthodox Christian, and they primarily adhere to the national Georgian Orthodox Church. Muslims make up 25.3% of population, while there are also Catholic, Armenian Apostolic, Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and Jewish communities. In the second largest Kobuleti Municipality, 65.1% of the population in Orthodox Christian, while 28.8% is Muslim. Muslims make up majorities mostly in the mountainous districts, they make up 94.6% of the population in Khulo Municipality, 74.4% in Shuakhevi Municipality, 62.1% in Keda Municipality and 56.3% Khelvachauri Municipality.
== Traditional public festivals ==
===Selimoba===
Selimoba is held in the village of Bako, Khulo Municipality on 3 June and commemorates the life of Selim Khimshiashvili. A concert with the participation of local amateur groups of a folk handicraft products exhibition is held during the festival. It is supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Adjara.

===Shuamtoba===
Shuamtoba (&quot;inter-mountain festival&quot;) is a traditional festival, which is held on the summer mountain pastures of two municipalities (Khulo and Shuakhevi), during the first weekend of every August. Horse racing, a folk handicraft exhibition and a concert involving folk ensembles are held as well.

===Machakhloba===
Machakhloba is a Machakhela gorge festivity, held in the second half of September. It is a traditional holiday celebrated in Machakhela gorge, Khelvachauri Municipality. The festival begins at the Machakhela rifle monument (at the point of convergence of the rivers Machakhelistskali and Chorokhi), continues in the village Machakhlispiri and ends in the village Zeda Chkhutuneti.

<text>Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock to new types of rock in a process called metamorphism. The original rock (protolith) is subjected to temperatures greater than and, often, elevated pressure of or more, causing profound physical or chemical changes. During this process, the rock remains mostly in the solid state, but gradually recrystallizes to a new texture or mineral composition. The protolith may be an igneous, sedimentary, or existing metamorphic rock.

Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth&#x27;s crust and form 12% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. They are classified by their protolith, their chemical and mineral makeup, and their texture. They may be formed simply by being deeply buried beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface, where they are subject to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above. They can also form from tectonic processes such as continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction, and distortion. Metamorphic rock can be formed locally when rock is heated by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth&#x27;s interior. The study of metamorphic rocks (now exposed at the Earth&#x27;s surface following erosion and uplift) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, slate, marble, schist, and quartzite. Slate and quartzite tiles are used in building construction. Marble is also prized for building construction and as a medium for sculpture. On the other hand, schist bedrock can pose a challenge for civil engineering because of its pronounced planes of weakness.

== Origin ==

Metamorphic rocks form one of the three great divisions of rock types. They are distinguished from igneous rocks, which form from molten magma, and sedimentary rocks, which form from sediments eroded from existing rock or precipitated chemically from bodies of water.

Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rock is transformed physically or chemically at elevated temperature, without actually melting to any great degree. The importance of heating in the formation of metamorphic rock was first noted by the pioneering Scottish naturalist, James Hutton, who is often described as the father of modern geology. Hutton wrote in 1795 that some rock beds of the Scottish Highlands had originally been sedimentary rock but had been transformed by great heat.

Hutton also speculated that pressure was important in metamorphism. This hypothesis was tested by his friend, James Hall, who sealed chalk into a makeshift pressure vessel constructed from a cannon barrel and heated it in an iron foundry furnace. Hall found that this produced a material strongly resembling marble, rather than the usual quicklime produced by heating of chalk in the open air. French geologists subsequently added metasomatism, the circulation of fluids through buried rock, to the list of processes that help bring about metamorphism. However, metamorphism can take place without metasomatism (&quot;isochemical metamorphism&quot;) or at depths of just a few hundred meters where pressures are relatively low (for example, in &quot;contact metamorphism&quot;).

=== Mineralogical changes ===

Metasomatism can change the bulk composition of a rock. Hot fluids circulating through pore space in the rock can dissolve existing minerals and precipitate new minerals. Dissolved substances are transported out of the rock by the fluids while new substances are brought in by fresh fluids. This can obviously change the mineral makeup of the rock.

However, changes in the mineral composition can take place even when the bulk composition of the rock does not change. This is possible because all minerals are stable only within certain limits of temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. For example, at atmospheric pressure, the mineral kyanite transforms to andalusite at a temperature of about . Andalusite, in turn, transforms to sillimanite when the temperature reaches about . All three have the identical composition, . Likewise, forsterite is stable over a broad range of pressure and temperature in marble, but is converted to pyroxene at elevated pressure and temperature in more silicate-rich rock containing plagioclase, with which the forsterite reacts chemically.

Many complex high-temperature reactions may take place between minerals without them melting, and each mineral assemblage produced indicates the temperatures and pressures at the time of metamorphism. These reactions are possible because of rapid diffusion of atoms at elevated temperature. Pore fluid between mineral grains can be an important medium through which atoms are exchanged.

===Textural changes===
The change in the particle size of the rock during the process of metamorphism is called recrystallization. For instance, the small calcite crystals in the sedimentary rock limestone and chalk change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock marble. In metamorphosed sandstone, recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite, also known as metaquartzite, in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked. Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization. High temperatures allow the atoms and ions in solid crystals to migrate, thus reorganizing the crystals, while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their point of contact.

==Description==

Metamorphic rocks are characterized by their distinctive mineral composition and texture.

=== Metamorphic minerals ===
Because every mineral is stable only within certain limits, the presence of certain minerals in metamorphic rocks indicates the approximate temperatures and pressures at which the rock underwent metamorphism. These minerals are known as index minerals. Examples include sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and some garnet.

Other minerals, such as olivines, pyroxenes, hornblende, micas, feldspars, and quartz, may be found in metamorphic rocks but are not necessarily the result of the process of metamorphism. These minerals can also form during the crystallization of igneous rocks. They are stable at high temperatures and pressures and may remain chemically unchanged during the metamorphic process.

===Texture===

Metamorphic rocks are typically more coarsely crystalline than the protolith from which they formed. Atoms in the interior of a crystal are surrounded by a stable arrangement of neighboring atoms. This is partially missing at the surface of the crystal, producing a &quot;surface energy&quot; that makes the surface thermodynamically unstable. Recrystallization to coarser crystals reduces the surface area and so minimizes the surface energy.

Although grain coarsening is a common result of metamorphism, rock that is intensely deformed may eliminate strain energy by recrystallizing as a fine-grained rock called &quot;mylonite&quot;. Certain kinds of rock, such as those rich in quartz, carbonate minerals, or olivine, are particularly prone to form mylonites, while feldspar and garnet are resistant to mylonitization.

=== Foliation ===
Many kinds of metamorphic rocks show a distinctive layering called &quot;foliation&quot; (derived from the Latin word &quot;folia&quot;, meaning &quot;leaves&quot;). Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during recrystallization. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite, to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage. Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale, and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates.

The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone, the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite, which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss, which is coarse to very coarse-grained.

Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.

=== Classification ===

Metamorphic rocks are one of the three great divisions of all rock types, and so there is a great variety of metamorphic rock types. In general, if the protolith of a metamorphic rock can be determined, the rock is described by adding the prefix &quot;meta-&quot; to the protolith rock name. For example, if the protolith is known to be basalt, the rock will be described as a metabasalt. Likewise, a metamorphic rock whose protolith is known to be a conglomerate will be described as a metaconglomerate. For a metamorphic rock to be classified in this manner, the protolith should be identifiable from the characteristics of the metamorphic rock itself, and not inferred from other information.

Under the British Geological Survey&#x27;s classification system, if all that can be determined about the protolith is its general type, such as sedimentary or volcanic, the classification is based on the mineral mode (the volume percentages of different minerals in the rock). Metasedimentary rocks are divided into carbonate-rich rock (metacarbonates or calcsilicate-rocks) or carbonate-poor rocks, and the latter are further classified by the relative abundance of mica in their composition. This ranges from low-mica psammite through semipelite to high-mica pelite. Psammites composed mostly of quartz are classified as quartzite. Metaigneous rocks are classified similarly to igneous rocks, by silica content, from meta-ultramafic-rock (which is very low in silica) to metafelsic-rock (with a high silica content).

Where the mineral mode cannot be determined, as is often the case when rock is first examined in the field, then classification must be based on texture. The textural types are:
* Schists, which are medium-grained strongly foliated rocks. These show the most well-developed schistosity, defined as the extent to which platy minerals are present and are aligned in a single direction, so that the rock easily splits into plates less than a centimeter (0.4 inches) thick.
* Gneisses, which are more coarse grained and show thicker foliation than schists, with layers over 5mm thick. These show less well-developed schistosity.
* Granofels, which show no obvious foliation or schistosity.
A hornfels is a granofels that is known to result from contact metamorphism. A slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that easily splits into thin plates but shows no obvious compositional layering. The term is used only when very little else is known about the rock that would allow a more definite classification. Textural classifications may be prefixed to indicate a sedimentary protolith (&quot;para-&quot;, such as paraschist) or igneous protolith (&quot;ortho-&quot;, such as orthogneiss). When nothing is known about the protolith, the textural name is used without a prefix. For example, a schist is a rock with schistose texture whose protolith is uncertain.

Special classifications exist for metamorphic rocks with a volcaniclastic protolith or formed along a fault or through hydrothermal circulation. A few special names are used for rocks of unknown protolith but known modal composition, such as marble, eclogite, or amphibolite. Special names may also be applied more generally to rocks dominated by a single mineral, or with a distinctive composition or mode or origin. Special names still in wide use include amphibolite, greenschist, phyllite, marble, serpentinite, eclogite, migmatite, skarn, granulite, mylonite, and slate.

The basic classification can be supplemented by terms describing mineral content or texture. For example, a metabasalt showing weak schistosity might be described as a gneissic metabasalt, and a pelite containing abundant staurolite might be described as a staurolite pelite.

====Metamorphic facies====
A metamorphic facies is a set of distinctive assemblages of minerals that are found in metamorphic rock that formed under a specific combination of pressure and temperature. The particular assemblage is somewhat dependent on the composition of that protolith, so that (for example) the amphibolite facies of a marble will not be identical with the amphibolite facies of a pelite. However, the facies are defined such that metamorphic rock with as broad a range of compositions as is practical can be assigned to a particular facies. The present definition of metamorphic facies is largely based on the work of the Finnish geologist, Pentti Eskola, with refinements based on subsequent experimental work. Eskola drew upon the zonal schemes, based on index minerals, that were pioneered by the British geologist, George Barrow.

The metamorphic facies is not usually considered when classifying metamorphic rock based on protolith, mineral mode, or texture. However, a few metamorphic facies produce rock of such distinctive character that the facies name is used for the rock when more precise classification is not possible. The chief examples are amphibolite and eclogite. The British Geological Survey strongly discourages the use of &quot;granulite&quot; as a classification for rock metamorphosed to the granulite facies. Instead, such rock will often be classified as a granofels. However, this approach is not universally accepted.
== Occurrence ==

Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth&#x27;s crust and form 12% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. The lower continental crust is mostly metamafic-rock and pelite which have reached the granulite facies. The middle continental crust is dominated by metamorphic rock that has reached the amphibolite facies. Within the upper crust, which is the only part of the Earth&#x27;s crust geologists can directly sample, metamorphic rock forms only from processes that can occur at shallow depth. These are &quot;contact (thermal) metamorphism&quot;, &quot;dynamic (cataclastic) metamorphism&quot;, &quot;hydrothermal metamorphism&quot;, and &quot;impact metamorphism&quot;. These processes are relatively local in occurrence and usually reach only the low-pressure facies, such as the hornfels and sanidinite facies. Most metamorphic rock is formed by &quot;regional metamorphism&quot; in the middle and lower crust, where the rock reaches the higher-pressure metamorphic facies. This rock is found at the surface only where extensive uplift and erosion has exhumed rock that was formerly much deeper in the crust.

===Orogenic belts===

Metamorphic rock is extensively exposed in orogenic belts produced by the collision of tectonic plates at convergent boundaries. Here formerly deeply buried rock has been brought to the surface by uplift and erosion. The metamorphic rock exposed in orogenic belts may have been metamorphosed simply by being at great depths below the Earth&#x27;s surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure caused by the immense weight of the rock layers above. This kind of regional metamorphism is known as &quot;burial metamorphism&quot;. This tends to produce low-grade metamorphic rock. Much more common is metamorphic rock formed during the collision process itself. The collision of plates causes high temperatures, pressures and deformation in the rocks along these belts. Metamorphic rock formed in these settings tends to shown well-developed schistosity.

Metamorphic rock of orogenic belts shows a variety of metamorphic facies. Where subduction is taking place, the basalt of the subducting slab is metamorphosed to high-pressure metamorphic facies. It initially undergoes low-grade metamorphism to metabasalt of the zeolite and prehnite-pumpellyite facies, but as the basalt subducts to greater depths, it is metamorphosed to the blueschist facies and then the eclogite facies. Metamorphism to the eclogite facies releases a great deal of water vapor from the rock, which drives volcanism in the overlying volcanic arc. Eclogite is also significantly denser than blueschist, which drives further subduction of the slab deep into the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Metabasalt and blueschist may be preserved in blueschist metamorphic belts formed by collisions between continents. They may also be preserved by obduction onto the overriding plate as part of ophiolites. Eclogites are occasionally found at sites of continental collision, where the subducted rock is rapidly brought back to the surface, before it can be converted to the granulite facies in the hot upper mantle. Many samples of eclogite are xenoliths brought to the surface by volcanic activity.

Many orogenic belts contain higher-temperature, lower-pressure metamorphic belts. These may form through heating of the rock by ascending magmas of volcanic arcs, but on a regional scale. Deformation and crustal thickening in an orogenic belt may also produce these kinds of metamorphic rocks. These rocks reach the greenschist, amphibolite, or granulite facies and are the most common of metamorphic rocks produced by regional metamorphosis. The association of an outer high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic zone with an inner zone of low-pressure, high-temperature metamorphic rocks is called a &quot;paired metamorphic belt&quot;. The main islands of Japan show three distinct paired metamorphic belts, corresponding to different episodes of subduction.

===Metamorphic core complexes===

Metamorphic rock is also exposed in metamorphic core complexes, which form in region of crustal extension. They are characterized by low-angle faulting that exposes domes of middle or lower crust metamorphic rock. These were first recognized and studied in the Basin and Range Province of southwestern North America, but are also found in southern Aegean Sea, in the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Islands, and in other areas of extension.

===Granite-greenstone belts===
Continental shields are regions of exposed ancient rock that make up the stable cores of continents. The rock exposed in the oldest regions of shields, which is of Archean age (over 2500 million years old), mostly belong to granite-greenstone belts. The greenstone belts contain metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock that has undergone a relatively mild grade of metamorphism, at temperatures of and pressures of . They can be divided into a lower group of metabasalts, including rare metakomatiites; a middle group of meta-intermediate-rock and meta-felsic-rock; and an upper group of metasedimentary rock.

The greenstone belts are surrounded by high-grade gneiss terrains showing highly deformed low-pressure, high-temperature (over ) metamorphism to the amphibolite or granulite facies. These form most of the exposed rock in Archean cratons.

The granite-greenstone belts are intruded by a distinctive group of granitic rocks called the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite or TTG suite. These are the most voluminous rocks in the craton and may represent an important early phase in the formation of continental crust.

=== Mid-ocean ridges ===
Mid-ocean ridges are where new oceanic crust is formed as tectonic plates move apart. Hydrothermal metamorphism is extensive here. This is characterized by metasomatism by hot fluids circulating through the rock. This produces metamorphic rock of the greenschist facies. The metamorphic rock, serpentinite, is particularly characteristic of these settings, and represents chemical transformation of olivine and pyroxene in ultramafic rock to serpentine group minerals.

=== Contact aureoles ===
Contact metamorphism takes place when magma is injected into the surrounding solid rock (country rock). The changes that occur are greatest wherever the magma comes into contact with the rock because the temperatures are highest at this boundary and decrease with distance from it. Around the igneous rock that forms from the cooling magma is a metamorphosed zone called a &quot;contact aureole&quot;. Aureoles may show all degrees of metamorphism from the contact area to unmetamorphosed (unchanged) country rock some distance away. The formation of important ore minerals may occur by the process of metasomatism at or near the contact zone. Contact aureoles around large plutons may be as much as several kilometers wide.

The term &quot;hornfels&quot; is often used by geologists to signify those fine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. The contact aureole typically shows little deformation, and so hornfels is usually devoid of schistosity and forms a tough, equigranular rock. If the rock was originally banded or foliated (as, for example, a laminated sandstone or a foliated calc-schist) this character may not be obliterated, and a banded hornfels is the product. Contact metamorphism close to the surface produces distinctive low-pressure metamorphic minerals, such as spinel, andalusite, vesuvianite, or wollastonite.

Similar changes may be induced in shales by the burning of coal seams. This produces a rock type named &quot;clinker&quot;.

There is also a tendency for metasomatism between the igneous magma and sedimentary country rock, whereby the chemicals in each are exchanged or introduced into the other. In that case, hybrid rocks called skarn arise.

===Other occurrences===
Dynamic (cataclastic) metamorphism takes place locally along faults. Here intense shearing of the rock typically forms mylonites.

Impact metamorphism is unlike other forms of metamorphism in that it takes place during impact events by extraterrestrial bodies. It produces rare ultrahigh pressure metamorphic minerals, such as coesite and stishovite. Coesite is rarely found in eclogite brought to the surface in kimberlite pipes, but the presence of stishovite is unique to impact structures.

==Uses==
Slate tiles are used in construction, particularly as roof shingle.

Quartzite is sufficiently hard and dense that it is difficult to quarry. However, some quartzite is used as dimension stone, often as slabs for flooring, walls, or stairsteps. About 6% of crushed stone, used mostly for road aggregate, is quartzite.

Marble is also prized for building construction and as a medium for sculpture.

==Hazards==
Schistose bedrock can pose a challenge for civil engineering because of its pronounced planes of weakness. A hazard may exist even in undisturbed terrain. On August 17, 1959, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake destabilized a mountain slope near Hebgen Lake, Montana, composed of schist. This caused a massive landslide that killed 26 people camping in the area.

Metamorphosed ultramafic rock contains serpentine group minerals, which includes varieties of asbestos that pose a hazard to human health.

<text>The National Security Act of 1947 (Pub.L. 80-253, 61 Stat. 495, enacted July 26, 1947) was a law enacting major restructuring of the United States government&#x27;s military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first secretary of defense.

The act merged the Department of the Army (renamed from the Department of War), the Department of the Navy, and the newly established Department of the Air Force (DAF) into the National Military Establishment (NME). The act also created the position of the secretary of defense as the head of the NME. It established the United States Air Force under the DAF, which worked to separate the Army Air Forces into its own service. It also protected the Marine Corps as an independent service under the Department of the Navy. Aside from the unification of the three military departments, the act established the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency, the latter of which is headed by the Director of Central Intelligence. 

The legislation was a result of efforts by Harry S. Truman beginning in 1944. President Truman proposed the legislation to Congress on February 26, 1947. The bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 28, 1947, and in the Senate on March 3, 1947. Senator Chan Gurney was the bill&#x27;s sponsor. Senator Gurney, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, led committee hearings for the bill from mid-March to early May. The bill passed in the Senate on July 9, 1947, and in the House on July 19, 1947. The Senate agreed to a related House resolution (80 H.Con.Res. 70) on July 16, 1947. The bill received bipartisan support and was passed in both chambers by voice vote. The National Security Act of 1947 was signed into law by President Truman on July 26, 1947, while aboard his VC-54C presidential aircraft &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;.

== Background ==
From 1921 to 1945, Congress considered approximately 50 bills to reorganize the armed forces. Mostly due to opposition by both the Department of the Navy and the War Department, all but one failed to reach the floor of the House, and even this one was defeated by a vote of 153 to 135 in 1932. However, by the end of World War 2, several factors forced leaders to more seriously consider restructuring the military to improve unity.

=== Pearl Harbor ===
By 1945, the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor had already been investigated several times, for example by the Roberts Commission, and would continue to be investigated through almost the end of the century. One of the findings that emerged was the probable role of intelligence failures linked to interservice bickering between Pearl Harbor&#x27;s Army and Navy commanders, General Walter Short and Admiral Husband Kimmel. Though not a court martial, the Roberts Commission explicitly accused the two of dereliction of duty for not conferring to coordinate in light of the warnings.

=== Joint Operations in World War 2 ===
During World War 2, interservice cooperation remained voluntary, requiring complex interchanges of liaisons for planning and operations. Additionally, the Army and Navy often competed for resources, for example industrial production and new recruits. Enabling operations under these conditions had required the creation of numerous joint agencies and interdepartmental committees.

World War 2 had also given the US military two case studies of joint operations between Europe and the Pacific. In the Pacific, the Army and Navy had experienced constant friction from command and logistics problems. In Europe, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), created based on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, had smoothed over these coordination problems and became President Roosevelt&#x27;s principal military advisors.

The JCS became a key source of advocacy for creating a single unified military department after the war. Following studies by the JCS Joint Strategic Survey Committee on ways to resolve joint roles and missions problems, George Marshall published a memo in support of postwar unification on November 2, 1942. Marshall&#x27;s memo called for the following:

* Reorganizing the Navy and War Departments into a single department led by a civilian secretary
* Creating an independent air force under the new department
* Creating an independent supply service under the new department
* Placing each of the four services under a civilian secretary and a military chief of staff
* Creating a &quot;United States General Staff&quot; made up of the four service chiefs plus a chief of staff to the President.

=== The Rise of Air Power ===
During both World Wars, but particularly World War 2, aviation had become increasingly important. The aircraft carrier had overtaken the battleship as the Navy&#x27;s premier surface combatant. Army airmen had called for an independent air service since 1919, and the Army&#x27;s Air Corps had already been expanded into what bordered on a separate service. Finally, the advent of nuclear weapons delivered by bombers led some leaders, such as Curtis LeMay, to believe air power would inevitably become more decisive than ground warfare or sea power. The time seemed right to create an independent air force, but it would require congressional action.

=== Shrinking budgets ===
Immediately following the war, confronting the Soviets was a lower priority than ending wartime austerity, balancing the federal budget, and returning to peace. This situation would not change until the Soviet Union developed nuclear weapons in 1949, followed by the Korean War in 1950.

In this environment, forces were rapidly demobilized, and budgets were slashed. In Fiscal Year 1946, the military&#x27;s total budget ceiling was approximately $42 billion. In Fiscal Year 1947, it was $14 billion. On V-J Day, the US military consisted of the Army&#x27;s 91 Army divisions, 9 Marine Corps divisions, 1,166 combat ships in the Navy, and 213 combat groups in the Army Air Forces. By the end of demobilization on June 30, 1947, the Army had 10 divisions, the Marine Corps had 2 divisions, the Navy had 343 combat ships, and the Army Air Forces had 63 groups of which only 11 were fully operational.

As forces were reduced and budgets were cut, unification seemed like a promising way to save money by reducing duplication, and this would become a theme to which its proponents would repeatedly return. It also created a sense of urgency to quickly institutionalize lessons learned from World War 2. However, the shrinking budgets also created a zero-sum game environment which encouraged interservice bickering by pitting Army and Navy advocates against each other.

=== Executive Power ===
Before World War II, congressional committees oversaw the Cabinet-level War Department and Navy Department, and while each department was separate from the other, both were able to obtain aircraft. During this time, the President had a level of authority over the departments. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the First War Powers Act, which authorized the sitting president &quot;to make such redistribution of functions among executive agencies as he may deem necessary&quot; provided that it is &quot;only in matters relating to the conduct of the present war&quot; and that these authorities will expire &quot;six months after the termination of the war.&quot; 

During World War II, then-chief of staff of the Army George Marshall brought the idea of unification of the armed services to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but &quot;he was routinely rebuffed on the grounds that a substantive discussion of this option while the country was at war might undermine the war effort.&quot; On August 26, 1944, future president Harry S. Truman, who was a senator at the time, wrote that &quot;under such a set-up [of unification] another Pearl Harbor will not have to be feared&quot; in his article &quot;Our Armed Forces Must Be United&quot;. Military problems apparent during World War II that turned attention to the need for unification were a lack of preparedness, a lack of attention to &quot;logistics in war,&quot; and a &quot;lack of coordination among the services.&quot; 

In the years following the war, President Truman had been pushing for the unification of the armed services until the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, having research conducted on the topic since 1944 and having expressed his desire for Congress to act on the issue as early as April 6, 1946. He stated in a letter to Congress on June 15, 1946, that he &quot;consider[s] it vital that we have a unified force for our national defense.&quot; President Truman had worked closely with the Army and the Navy to establish a consensus, but the departments struggled to come to an agreement until 1947.

== Drafting Legislation ==
However, even if everyone could admit that a military reorganization was necessary, they could not agree on how it should be done. The process of obtaining even tentative consensus would take nearly four years.

=== The Woodrum Committee ===
On March 28, 1944, the House passed a resolution introduced by Rep. James W. Wadsworth (R-NY) to create a Select Committee On Postwar Military Policy, and this began the debate. The committee chair was Rep. Clifton A. Woodrum (D-VA), and the committee itself was made up of seven members of the Naval Affairs Committee, seven members of the Military Affairs Committee, and nine other members.

Though the War Department considered asking for the hearings to be postponed to prevent an interservice fight that could hurt wartime unity, they decided not to when Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox told Secretary of War Henry Stimson that he also favored unification.

The hearings began on April 24, 1944. On the second day, Lieutenant General Joseph McNarney presented the War Department&#x27;s plan for unification, which was essentially Marshall&#x27;s plan as laid out in his memo.

On May 11th, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Alexander Vandegrift, addressed the committee.

The hearings ended on May 19, 1944. Due to the increasingly apparent disagreements between the two departments, committee members and military leaders agreed that a fight between them would be bad for the war effort. In June, the committee reported the time was not right for legislation, but encouraged the two departments to continue to study unification.

=== The Richardson Committee ===
While the Woodrum Committee met, the JCS continued to study the problem by convening their own committee of two Army officers and two Navy officers. It was led by former Pacific Fleet commander Admiral James O. Richardson. The Richardson committee interviewed eighty commanders both at war and in Washington, almost all of flag rank, to get their thoughts on postwar reorganization.

On April 18, 1945, the Richardson Committee presented their findings and recommendations. They found that most Army officers and about half the Navy officers favored unification to a single service, but disagreed on the details. The committee&#x27;s recommendations went even farther than McNarney&#x27;s, calling not only for one civilian secretary overseeing the military and none overseeing the individual services, but also calling for a single uniformed &quot;Commander of all Forces.&quot;

=== The Eberstadt Report ===
On June 19, 1945, the Department of the Navy began its own investigation. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal requested an objective investigation of the postwar reorganization by his friend Ferdinand Eberstadt, the former chairman of the Army-Navy Munitions Board and former vice chair of the War Production Board. By late September, Eberstadt had finished his report, and Forrestal forwarded it to the chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, David Walsh. The 200 page report&#x27;s key recommendations included the following:

* Making the Joint Chiefs of Staff permanent.
* Creating an independent air force, but also letting the Army and Navy retain air forces.
* Reorganizing the military into three departments: War, Navy, and Air. Each would be led by a cabinet-rank secretary.
* Changing the administrative structures of the departments to mirror each other as much as possible.
* Creating a National Security Council.
* Creating a National Security Resources Board.
* Creating a Joint Munitions Board.
* Creating a Central Intelligence Agency.
* Creating a Joint Military Education and Training Board.
* Creating a civilian scientific research and development agency, and creating assistant secretaries for research and development in each of the services.
* Reviewing the many other joint boards and committees from World War 2 to determine which should be continued, combined, or dissolved.
* Maintaining close working relations with Congress.
* Appointing a commission to conduct analysis of the overall national security situation before making further changes.

=== 1945 Senate Military Affairs Hearings ===
On January 3, 1945, the first day of the 79th Congress, Rep. Jennings Randolph (D-WV) submitted unification bill H.R. 550 to the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department. Two days later, Sen. Lister Hill (D-AL) introduced a similar bill, S. 84, in the Senate.

From October 7th to December 17, 1945, the Senate Military Affairs Committee conducted hearings to consider unification bills. These included not only S. 84, but also S. 1482, introduced in the middle of the hearings by Sens. Edwin C. Johnson (D-CO) and Harley M. Kilgore (D-WV). However, the hearings mostly became a venue for the two departments, increasingly at odds, to give their official positions on different unification plans.

==== The War Department&#x27;s Collins Plan ====
On October 30th, General J. Lawton Collins presented the War Department&#x27;s plan. It combined features of recommendations made by the Richardson committee (other than Richardson&#x27;s dissent) and Marshall&#x27;s original plan from November 1942. Its key recommendations included the following:

* Reorganizing the military services into a single department led by a civilian cabinet-rank secretary with at least one undersecretary, and assistant secretaries appointed as needed.
* Replacing the Joint Chiefs of Staff with a new chiefs of staff organization called the &quot;US Chiefs of Staff&quot; made up of the department secretary and service chiefs.
* Creating a single uniformed &quot;Commander of the Armed Forces&quot; who would also act as Chief of Staff to the President.
* Creating an independent air force

==== The Department of the Navy&#x27;s Hensel Plan ====
On November 29th, Assistant Secretary of the Navy H. Struve Hensel presented the Department of the Navy&#x27;s plan. It was the recommendations of the Eberstadt Report, but left the question of an independent air force up to Congress.

==== Debate ====
Proponents of the Department of the Navy&#x27;s plan came across as obstructionists due to the previous Woodrum Committee hearings having framed the debate entirely in terms of the War Department plan.

Proponents of the War Department&#x27;s plan repeatedly emphasized the cost savings it would provide.

==== Truman Intervenes ====
On December 19th, Truman let Congress know his own thoughts on unification. They mirrored the War Department plan in all respects.

The hearings concluded as Congress went into its Christmas recess with the two departments and their congressional allies at an impasse.

=== Navy and Marine Corps Resistance ===
Over the course of the 1945 hearings, Navy and Marine Corps resistance to the War Department plan began to coalesce.

==== SCOROR ====
In October, on the advice of Admiral Radford, Forrestal created the Secretary&#x27;s Committee on Research on Reorganization (SCOROR) to track unification developments and help manage the Navy&#x27;s response. The same month, Forrestal asked Sen. David Walsh, the chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, to hold hearings of his own so that the Navy would have a chance to properly present their counterargument to the War Department Proposal.

==== First Marine Corps Board ====
At the same time, the Commandant directed the head of Marine Corps Schools, Merrill Twining, to create a Marine Corps Board to do the same for the Marine Corps.

=== The Thomas Plan ===
In January 1946, Senator Elbert D. Thomas formed a subcommittee within the Senate Military Affairs Committee to draft unification legislation. The subcommittee included Vice Admiral Arthur Radford and Major General Lauris Norstad as advisors from the Department of the Navy and the War Department. On April 9th, the subcommittee introduced the bill, S. 2044. Its key points were the following:

*Replacing the Navy and War Departments with a single &quot;Department of Common Defense&quot; led by a civilian secretary with one undersecretary and four assistant secretaries.
*Creating an independent air force under the new department.
*Creating a &quot;Joint Staff of the Armed Forces&quot; made up of the three service chiefs plus a chief of staff to submit recommendations and non-concurrences once a year to the president through the secretary of defense.
*Creating a &quot;Council of Common Defense&quot; based on Eberstadt&#x27;s concept for a National Security Council.
*Creating a National Security Resources Board.
*Creating a Central Intelligence Agency.

==== JCS 1478 ====
On March 15th and 16th, Army Air Corps Commanding General Carl Spaatz and Army Chief of Staff Dwight Eisenhower wrote two papers regarding unification JCS 1478/10 and 1478/11, that dealt with Army objectives for postwar unification. Marked &quot;TOP SECRET&quot;, the two papers were blunt in their statement of their intent to marginalize the Marine Corps. The Eisenhower-Spaatz proposal&#x27;s key points were the following:

*Limit Marine Corps units to the size of regiments and below, and cap the total size of the Marine Corps at 50,000-60,000.
*Bar the Marine Corps from wartime expansion, eliminating the need for the Marine Corps Reserve.
*Limit Marine Corps missions to guarding naval ships and shore establishments.
*Limit Marines to participating &quot;only in minor shore combat operations in which the Navy alone is interested.&quot;
*Bar the Marine Corps from engaging in operations that required combined arms since this would duplicate the functions of the Army and Air Force.

The papers were forwarded to the chief of naval operations, Admiral Chester Nimitz, for his thoughts. There the papers came to the attention of Merritt Edson, the Marine Corps liaison to the chief of naval operations. Edson alerted the commandant of the Marine Corps and the members of the Marine Corps Board, most of whom, particularly Merrill Twining, believed that the only purpose of the papers&#x27; high classification was to conceal the Army&#x27;s goals from Congress.

Nimitz replied on March 30th, and included responses by the Commandant and by the head of Naval Aviation, both of whom were strongly against the proposals.

==== Lobbying and Gag Order ====
Following the bill&#x27;s introduction, the Department of the Navy openly opposed it.

In a press conference on April 11th, Truman said he had not authorized Navy officers to speak against unification, only to offer their honest opinions. He demanded that members of both the War Department and Department of the Navy &quot;get in line&quot; behind the official White House policy. When questioned about Army lobbying tactics, Truman claimed ignorance, but stated he was opposed to all congressional lobbying by the two departments.

On April 30th, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee began hearings to consider S. 2044.

==== The Bended Knee Speech ====
On May 6th, Commandant of the Marine Corps Alexander Vandegrift testified. His testimony noted that on multiple occasions there had been efforts to marginalize and disband the Marine Corps, all of which had been ended by congressional oversight. He noted Marine Corps successes such as the prediction of the course of the Pacific War by Pete Ellis, and a history of extreme frugality that did not characterize other services. Finally, he denounced the War Department plan as a transparent attempt to quietly marginalize and disband the Marine Corps by removing its congressional protection.

==== Defeat ====
On May 7th, Clark Clifford, Truman&#x27;s lead for unification legislation, told General Norstad and Assistant Secretary of War Stuart Symington that the Thomas Bill could not pass in its current form, and that the Naval Affairs Committee hearings were causing it to lose more support every day. He also admitted he had been swayed by some of the Navy&#x27;s objections, especially regarding the role of the chief of staff. Clifford recommended that Truman meet with the secretaries of War and the Navy and their advisors to clarify points of agreement and disagreement and find a way forward.

On May 13th, Truman held the meeting, and demanded that Patterson and Forrestal find a way to break the impasse by the end of the month due to the urgency of passing unification legislation. He also said that he had accepted the Navy&#x27;s arguments against the chief of staff. Finally, he told his chief of staff, Admiral William Leahy, to silence criticism of unification by naval officers.

May 31st Patterson and Forrestal reported to him that of the twelve points in S. 2044 they agreed on eight and disagreed on four. The points of agreement were as follows:

*That there should not be a single military Chief of Staff
*The creation of a permanent Joint Chiefs of Staff
*The creation of a Council of Common Defense
*The creation of a Central Intelligence Agency
*The creation of a National Security Resources Board
*The creation of an agency for joint military education and training
*The creation of an agency for joint research
*The creation of an agency for procurement and supply.

The remaining points of disagreement were the following:

*Whether or not to reorganize into a single Department of Defense
*Whether or not to establish a separate Air Force
*The status of Army and Navy aviation
*The status of the Marine Corps

The period of rival Military Affairs Committee and Naval Affairs Committee hearings came to an end for good on August 2nd, when Truman signed the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. It combined the Military Affairs and Naval Affairs Committees into Armed Services Committees in the House and Senate, and would go into effect for the 80th United States Congress.

Additionally, in August, Thomas suggested to Truman that he use an executive order to execute some unification changes, for example by creating a Council of Common Defense led by Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. Thomas believed that forcing the military to operate under unification for several months might convince all involved, particularly Congress, that unification legislation was feasible.

=== The Patterson-Forrestal Compromise ===
On November 7, 1946, Forrestal called a meeting at his home with Army and Navy representatives to attempt to find a way forward. the attendees included the two departments&#x27; primary negotiators Norstad and Radford, the Assistant Secretary of War for Air Stuart Symington, and Forrestal&#x27;s friend Admiral Forrest Sherman. The main outcome of the meeting was the replacement of Admiral Radford as the Navy&#x27;s primary negotiator with Forrestal&#x27;s friend Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman. According to Marine Corps Brigadier General Gerald Thomas, this was due to Patterson&#x27;s suggestion since the Army found Radford difficult to work with.

On January 16, 1947, Norstad, Sherman, and Symington forwarded a letter to the White House with an outline of a joint Army-Navy agreement.

==== Second Marine Corps Board ====
Vandegrift and the other Marines involved with unification believed they had been betrayed. Admiral Radford had been a close ally of the Marine Corps, and Admiral Sherman was not. There had been no Marine Corps input into the Patterson-Forrestal Compromise, and many Marines, Vandegrift included, believed Sherman had cut a deal with Norstad to preserve Navy aviation in exchange for abandoning demands for statutory protections of the Marine Corps.

The same month the Patterson-Forrestal Compromise went to the White House, Vandegrift appointed a second Marine Corps board to &quot;Conduct Research and Prepare Material in Connection with Pending Legislation&quot; led by Merritt Edson and Gerald C. Thomas. Other members formally appointed to the board in writing included Col Merrill Twining, Col Edward Dyer, LtCol Victor Krulak, LtCol Samuel Shaw, LtCol DeWolf Schatzel, LtCol James C. Murray, LtCol James Hittle, LtCol Edward Hurst, LtCol Robert Heinl, and Maj Jonas Platt.

== Legislative history ==
When Congress convened, it had preemptively restructured in favor of unification. Due to the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, in the 80th Congress the Military and Naval Affairs Committees had been combined into unified Armed Services Committees in both the House and Senate.

On February 26, 1947, President Harry S. Truman sent a bill proposal to Congress detailing the creation of a &quot;National Defense Establishment&quot;. Representative Clare E. Hoffman (R-MI) introduced the bill as H.R. 2319 to the House of Representatives on February 28, 1947; it was then referred to the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments.

Senator Chan Gurney (R-SD) introduced the bill to the Senate as S. 758 on March 3, 1947. Due to conflict over which committee the bill was to be referred to, as well as the focus the Senate had on the legislative budget at the time, the bill was not able to be introduced in the Senate sooner.

=== Congressional hearings ===
On March 18, 1947, then-Chairman Senator Gurney held congressional hearings in the Senate Committee on Armed Services on the bill that would become the National Security Act of 1947. The hearings were held in three parts: Part 1 hearings were held on March 18, March 20, March 25, March 26, and April 1–3, 1947; Part 2 hearings were held on April 8, April 9, April 15, April 18, April 22, April 24, and April 25, 1947; and Part 3 hearings were held on April 30, May 2, May 6, May 7, and May 9, 1947.

The witnesses at the hearings largely spoke in support of the bill, either overall or with adjustments. Major witnesses of the bill who spoke in support were United States Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Under Secretary of War Kenneth C. Royall, Representative Walter G. Andrews (R-NY), Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (R-MA), two colonels from the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, Director of Central Intelligence Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Director of the Bureau of the Budget James E. Webb, and president of General Electric Co. Charles E. Wilson. Assistant Secretary of the Navy W. John Kenney spoke in support but expressed concerns about appropriations, while United States Army Surgeon General Norman T. Kirk expressed concern about the role of medical services. Former senator Thomas C. Hart (R-CT) opposed the bill and proposed changes to the areas concerning the Navy and the Marine Corps. The president of the Marine Reserve Officers Association, Melvin J. Maas, stated that 95% of the Association opposes the bill and requests adjustments as it comes to the Marine Corps&#x27; role. The president of the Reserve Officers of the Naval Services (RONS), John P. Bracken, stated that the organization opposed the bill due to the lack of input they were allowed to give. Representatives from the National Guard Association opposed the bill as it stood and said that the role of the National Guard needed to be improved.

On April 24th, Edson requested to retire in order to be permitted to present his personal views against the bill, but the Commandant denied his request.

On May 6th, the second Marine Corps Board was dissolved.

The next day, at the invitation of a member of the committee, Merritt Edson testified in opposition to the bill. He was the only active duty military officer to do so.

On June 7th, Edson submitted a second request to retire, and this one was accepted. On June 17th, Edson testified before the committee again.

=== Executive Order 9877 ===
Following the congressional hearings, on June 6th Truman published Executive Order 9877, which explicitly prescribed the functions of each of the military services.

=== Debates ===
On July 7, 1947, the National Security Act of 1947 was debated for the first time in the Senate, two days after the Senate Committee on Armed Services reported the bill to the Senate. On July 9, 1947, the Senate continued debates and, with an amendment to the title, passed the bill by a voice vote.

On July 15, 1947, having already been passed in the Senate, the National Security Act of 1947 was debated in the House of Representatives. The House introduced Resolution 80 H.Con.Res. 70 on the same day. The Senate agreed to the Resolution on July 16, 1947. The House debated and passed the National Security Act of 1947, along with 80 H.R. 4214, on July 19, 1947. The conference report 80 H. rp. 1051 was agreed to in the Senate on July 24, 1947, and was agreed to in the House on July 25, 1947. The recorded votes on the bill itself &quot;drew strong bipartisan support.&quot;

==== Senate ====
During the July 7, 1947, and July 9, 1947, debates in the Senate, members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services spoke the most, with major proponents being Senators Lodge (R-MA), Saltonstall (R-MA), Baldwin (R-CT), Morse (R-OR), Tydings (D-MD), Maybank (D-SC), and Hill (D-AL). Arguments in support of the bill included Senator Gurney&#x27;s reasoning that there were &quot;personnel problems in the Army and Navy, including the Air Forces&quot; and that &quot;the unification bill is a sincere and earnest attempt to put into effect by legislation a security organization which is adequate, effective, modern – and yet economical.&quot;

Senator Robertson (R-WY) was a staunch opponent of the bill, arguing that the bill would cost the country too much considering it would not be able to make the armed services any more efficient, and that the secretary of defense would have too much power.

Senator Robertson offered three amendments during debates, all of which were defeated by voice vote. Senator McCarthy (R-WI) offered an amendment that stipulated that the &quot;existing status of Marine Corps and Naval Aviation not to be altered or diminished; their existing functions not to be transferred to other services&quot;; the Senate debated this amendment the most until it was defeated by a 52–19 roll call vote. The only amendment that passed (by voice vote) in the Senate was offered by Senator Taft (R-OH) in which the National Security Council was to only be focused on national security matters.

==== House of Representatives ====
During the July 15, 1947, and July 19, 1947, debates in the House of Representatives, major proponents of the National Security Act of 1947 included Representatives Wadsworth (R-NY), McCormack (D-MA), and Manasco (D-AL), who were all on the Expenditures Committee as high-ranking members, and the House Armed Services Committee Chairman Walter G. Andrews (R-NY).

Opponents of the bill in the House included Representatives Cole (R-NY), Sheppard (D-CA), Rogers (R-MA), and Taber (R-NY). Representatives Cole, Sheppard, and Rogers argued that the Navy did not have enough protections under the bill, while Representative Taber argued against the budgetary aspect.

Minor amendments were passed during debates in the House. Some of Representative Cole&#x27;s amendments protecting the Navy and limiting the secretary of defense&#x27;s powers were passed by voice vote (though others he offered were defeated). Representatives Judd (R-MN) and Brown (R-OH) were able to pass amendments by voice votes that required the director of Central Intelligence to be appointed by the president from civilian life and confirmed by the Senate, and Representative Judd passed an amendment allowing the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Atomic Energy Commission to conduct secret operations without the inspection of the director of Central Intelligence. Amendments offered by Representatives MacKinnon (R-MN), Case (R-NJ), Mitchell (R-IN), Clason (R-MA), and Owens (R-IL) were defeated.

=== Enactment ===
The National Security Act of 1947 was signed into law by President Truman on July 26, 1947. The bill signing took place aboard Truman&#x27;s VC-54C presidential aircraft &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;, the first aircraft used for the role of Air Force One. The president was traveling to be at the bedside of his dying mother and delayed his departure until the bill was signed.

The majority of the provisions of the act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first secretary of defense. His power was initially limited and it was difficult for him to exercise the authority to make his office effective. This was later changed in the amendment to the act in 1949, creating what was to be the Department of Defense.

=== Provisions ===
The legislation&#x27;s definition of covert action was vague, limiting oversight over the CIA&#x27;s activities. It was only in the 1990s that Congress attempted to regulate covert action by prohibiting certain forms of it and enacting substantive and procedural rules for covert action.

==== Title I – Coordination for National Security ====
Title I worked to establish the National Security Council, an advisory council to the president for matters relating to national security in the realm of &quot;domestic, foreign, and military policies&quot; with the intent of allowing for the military departments to communicate with more efficiency. It also established the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the National Security Council, led by the Director of Central Intelligence. The role of the director of Central Intelligence, and the CIA as a whole, is as an advisory unit to the National Security Council and as a coordinator of intelligence. Finally, Title I worked to establish the National Security Resources Board, an advisory board to the President on matters relating to &quot;the coordination of military, industrial, and civilian mobilization.&quot;

==== Title II – The National Military Establishment ====
Outlined the establishment of the National Military Establishment (NME), which consists of the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and is led by the secretary of defense.

Designated the Department of War to be renamed the Department of the Army, led by the secretary of the Army. 

Established the Department of the Navy and outlined it to consist of the United States Marine Corps, the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard. The role of the United States Marine Corps was further outlined.

Established the DAF, led by the secretary of the Air Force, and allowed the secretary of defense to designate any and all functions that they deem fit to be under the DAF. 

Created the United States Air Force as an agency of aviation offense and defense under the DAF, led by a Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, who in turn is directed by the secretary of the Air Force. The chief of staff, United States Air Force, was designated as having equal authority as the Chief of Staff, United States Army, and the Chief of Naval Operations.

Established the War Council as an advisory council to the secretary of defense within the NME. The War Council consists of the secretary of defense, the secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, the chief of naval operations, and the chiefs of staff of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.

Title II established the Joint Chiefs of Staff within the NME as consisting &quot;of the Chief of Staff, United States Army; the Chief of Naval Operations; the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force; and the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief, if there be one&quot; with the role of being &quot;the principal military advisers to the President and the Secretary of Defense.&quot; It also created a Joint Staff under the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Created a Munitions Board within the NBE, which replaced the Joint Army and Navy Munitions Board, led by a chairman and consisted of under secretaries or assistant secretaries from the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force.

Established a Research and Development Board within the NME, which replaces the Joint Research and Development Board, and that consists of a chairman with two representatives from each military department. The Research and Development Board acts as an advisory unit on matters relating to and the conducting of military research.

==== Title III – Miscellaneous ====
Designated compensation for each of the positions created under the act, designate relative classification statuses, and specify the transfer of funds and resources. 

Defined &quot;function&quot; as including &quot;functions, powers, and duties&quot;, and defines &quot;budget program&quot; as &quot;recommendations as to the apportionment, to the allocation and to the review of allotments of appropriated funds&quot;.

Specified separability and established the timeline of when provisions of the act would be in effect.

Amended the July 18, 1947, Presidential Succession Act to remove &quot;Secretary of the Navy&quot; and to replace &quot;Secretary of War&quot; with &quot;Secretary of Defense&quot;.

== Results ==
The act produced mixed results, and both sides of the unification fight would see their positions partly vindicated and partly tested over the next few years.

=== Cost savings ===
The promised cost savings were fleeting and arguable. Even before the act was passed, the military&#x27;s total budget ceiling had been cut by two thirds. The first year after the act, Truman cut the budget again by several billion dollars, however the defense budget had returned to its previous level by the next year. If the act saved money, it was obscured by an immediate return to high defense budgets following the Soviet development of nuclear weapons and the beginning of the Korean War.

=== Elimination of duplication ===
The Act was partially successful in eliminating duplication. One example was the combination of the Air Force&#x27;s Air Transport Command and the Navy&#x27;s Naval Air Transport Service into the Military Air Transport Service on June 1, 1948.

=== Joint operations ===
Among the services, the problems of joint operations remained bad. Rather than leading to streamlined joint operations, the Act preceded a heightened period of interservice rivalries and service parochialism. It included fights between the Army and Air Force over close air support, fights between the Air Force and Navy over development of carriers vs. development of strategic bombing capabilities, and additional attempts to marginalize the Marine Corps by both the Army and Navy. Following joint operations problems in the Iranian hostage rescue in 1980 and United States invasion of Grenada in 1983, Congress would pass a second vast reorganization in the Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act in 1986.

=== Secretary of defense ===
As the first secretary of defense over the National Military Establishment, Forrestal had to live with the watered-down secretary of defense powers he had fought for as the secretary of the Navy. He found it left him unable to control the military services. Forrestal spent the remainder of his tenure as secretary of defense working to have the act amended.

=== President ===
Truman had succeeded in establishing a permanent and more centralized Department of Defense. However, Department of the Navy arguments regarding the dangers of placing excessive power in the hands of uniformed members of the armed forces would haunt Truman in the form of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur pursued the Republican nomination for president even while still in uniform, and Truman would ultimately relieve MacArthur for insubordination during the Korean War in 1951. The relief of the highly popular general preceded a drop in Truman&#x27;s approval rating to 22%. Though Truman ultimately decided not to run in the 1952 presidential election, had he run it would have been against Eisenhower, another highly popular Army general, who retired from active service only to accept the Republican nomination.

=== Army ===
The new Air Force focused on strategic bombing and air superiority to the exclusion of almost all else, which left the Army dissatisfied with the attention paid to transportation and close air support of troops on the ground. Helicopters emerged as an Army alternative to absent support from the Air Force. By the end of 1952, the secretary of the Army and secretary of the Air Force had signed the Pace-Finletter memorandum of understanding that removed all weight limits on helicopters the Army could operate and allowed use of fixed-wing aircraft up to 5,000 lb. Army-owned helicopters proliferated during the Vietnam War. Finally, in 1983, with the establishment of the United States Army Aviation Branch to more effectively oversee the Army&#x27;s numerous helicopters, the Army had effectively recreated the Army Air Forces.

=== Navy ===
The Department of the Navy had kept its aircraft and the Marine Corps had essentially saved itself, but the Navy almost immediately regretted unification. Following 1949 amendments that made the secretary of defense more than a powerless advisor, second secretary of defense Louis Johnson, an Army veteran, cancelled the aircraft carrier USS &quot;United States&quot; without consulting Congress. In an incident remembered as the Revolt of the Admirals, the secretary of the Navy resigned in protest, and naval officers began a lobbying war against a rival procurement program for the B-36 bomber.

=== Marine Corps ===
Within the Marine Corps, the fight to amend the Act was memorialized as one of the Marine Corps&#x27; finest hours, primarily by former members of the Marine Corps Board.

In September 1962, Robert Heinl wrote an account of the unification battle for Proceedings, and the Pentagon blocked its publication. Five days later, a Senate subcommittee began hearings regarding the Pentagon muzzling freedom of expression, and Strom Thurmond used the censorship of Heinl&#x27;s article as evidence. When the Pentagon allowed the article&#x27;s publication in October, it focused the media&#x27;s attention on many of the negative statements about the Marine Corps made by Truman, Eisenhower, and others.

In 1984, Victor Krulak published an account of it in the book First to Fight, which has remained on the Commandant&#x27;s Professional Reading List since it was first published.

== Amendments ==
On August 10, 1949, the act was amended. The amendments&#x27; key changes included the following:

* The National Military Establishment was converted into a Cabinet-level department and renamed the Department of Defense.
* The three military departments were placed under the authority of the secretary of defense.
* The secretaries of the three military departments lost their statutory access to the president, but gained statutory access to Congress.
* The secretaries of the three military departments lost their statutory membership in the National Security Council.
* The chief of staff to the commander in chief was replaced with a full-time chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff senior in rank to all other military officers.
* The War Council was renamed the Armed Forces Policy Council.

<doc id="44428" wikidata="Q4963539" url="?curid=44428" title="Chondrus crispus">
<text>Chondrus crispus—commonly called Irish moss or carrageenan moss (Irish &quot;carraigín&quot;, &quot;little rock&quot;)—is a species of red algae which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America. In its fresh condition it is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which constitutes 55% of its dry weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10% dry weight protein and about 15% dry weight mineral matter, and is rich in iodine and sulfur. When softened in water it has a sea-like odour. Because of the abundant cell wall polysaccharides, it will form a jelly when boiled, containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of water.

== Description ==
&quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; is a relatively small sea alga, reaching up to a little more than in length. It grows from a discoid holdfast and branches four or five times in a dichotomous, fan-like manner. The morphology is highly variable, especially the broadness of the thalli. The branches are 2–15 mm broad and firm in texture, and the color ranges from bright green towards the surface of the water, to deep red at greater depths. The gametophytes (see below) often show a blue iridescence at the tip of the fronds and fertile sporophytes show a spotty pattern. &quot;Mastocarpus stellatus&quot; (Stackhouse) Guiry is a similar species which can be readily distinguished by its strongly channelled and often somewhat twisted thalli.

Irish moss undergoes an alternation of generation lifecycle common in many species of algae. The two distinct stages are the sexual haploid gametophyte stage and the asexual diploid sporophyte stage. In addition, a third stage – the carposporophyte – is formed on the female gametophyte after fertilization. The male and female gametophytes produce gametes which fuse to form a diploid carposporophyte, which forms carpospores, which develops into the sporophyte. The sporophyte then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid tetraspores (which can be male or female) that develop into gametophytes. The three stages (male, female, and sporophyte) are difficult to distinguish when they are not fertile; however, the gametophytes often show a blue iridescence.

==Distribution==
&quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; is commonly found along the shores of Ireland and the coast of Europe including Iceland, the Faroe Islands, western Baltic Sea to southern Spain. It is found on the Atlantic coasts of Canada and recorded from California in the United States to Japan. However, any distribution outside the Northern Atlantic needs to be verified.
There are also other species of the same genus in the Pacific Ocean, for example, &quot;C. ocellatus&quot; Holmes, &quot;C. nipponicus&quot; Yendo, &quot;C. yendoi&quot; Yamada &quot;et&quot; Mikami, &quot;C. pinnulatus&quot; (Harvey) Okamura and &quot;C. armatus&quot; (Harvey) Yamada &quot;et&quot; Mikami.

==Ecology==
&quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; is found growing on rock from the middle intertidal zone into the subtidal zone, all the way to the ocean floor. It is able to survive with minimal sunlight.

&quot;C. crispus&quot; is susceptible to infection from the oomycete &quot;Pythium porphyrae&quot;.
==Uses==
&quot;C. crispus&quot; is an industrial source of carrageenan commonly used as a thickener and stabilizer in milk products, such as ice cream and processed foods. In Europe, it is indicated as E407 or E407a. It may also be used as a thickener in calico printing and paper marbling, and for fining beer. Irish moss is frequently used with &quot;Mastocarpus stellatus&quot; (&quot;Gigartina mamillosa&quot;), &quot;Chondracanthus acicularis &quot; (&quot;G. acicularis&quot;), and other seaweeds, which are all commonly found growing together. Carrageenan may be extracted from tropical seaweeds of the genera &quot;Kappaphycus&quot; and &quot;Eucheuma&quot;.

==Scientific interest==

&quot;C. crispus&quot;, compared to most other seaweeds, is well-investigated scientifically. It has been used as a model species to study photosynthesis, carrageenan biosynthesis, and stress responses. The nuclear genome was sequenced in 2013. The genome size is 105 Mbp and is coding for 9,606 genes. It is characterised by relatively few genes with very few introns. The genes are clustered together, with normally short distances between genes and then large distances between groups of genes.

<doc id="44430" wikidata="Q948008" url="?curid=44430" title="Glacis">
<text>A glacis (, ) in military engineering is an artificial slope as part of a medieval castle or in early modern fortresses. They may be constructed of earth as a temporary structure or of stone in more permanent structure. More generally, a glacis is any slope, natural or artificial, which fulfils the above requirements. The etymology of this French word suggests a slope made dangerous with ice, hence the relationship with &quot;glacier&quot;.

A &quot;glacis plate&quot; is the sloped front-most section of the hull of a tank or other armoured fighting vehicle.

==Ancient fortifications==
A glacis could also appear in ancient fortresses, such as the one the ancient Egyptians built at Semna in Nubia. Here it was used by them to prevent enemy siege engines from weakening defensive walls.

Hillforts in Britain started to incorporate glacis around 350 BC. Those at Maiden Castle, Dorset were high.

==Medieval fortifications==

Glacises, also called taluses, were incorporated into medieval fortifications to strengthen the walls against undermining, to hamper escalades and so that missiles dropped from the battlements would ricochet off the glacis into attacking forces.

Towards the end of the medieval period some castles were modified to make them defensible against cannons. Glacis consisting of earthen slopes faced with stones were placed in front of the curtain walls and bastions (towers) to absorb the impact of cannon shots or to deflect them. Towers were lowered to the same height as the curtain walls and converted into gun platforms.

==Early modern European fortifications==

Early modern European fortresses were so constructed as to keep any potential assailant under the fire of the defenders until the last possible moment. On natural, level ground, troops attacking any high work have a degree of shelter from its fire when close up to it; the glacis consists of a slope with a low grade inclined towards the top of the wall. This gave defenders a direct line of sight into the assaulting force, allowing them to efficiently sweep the field with fire from the parapet. Additionally, but secondarily, the bank of earth would shield the walls from being hit directly by cannon fire.

Though defenders on high ground already have a direct line of sight, a glacis allows the field of fire to be swept more efficiently by minimizing changes to the angle of their guns while firing. Furthermore, the glacis prevents attacking cannon from having a clear shot at the walls of a fortress, as usually these cannot be seen until the glacis is crossed and the ditch, bounded on either side by the smooth, masoned scarp and counterscarp, is reached.

==Armored vehicles==

The term &quot;glacis plate&quot; describes the sloped front-most section of the hull of a tank or other armored fighting vehicle, often composed of upper and lower halves. In a head-on-head armored engagement, the glacis plate is the largest and most obvious target available to an enemy gunner.

Sloped armour has two advantages: many projectiles will deflect rather than penetrate; those that attempt to will have to travel on a longer diagonal route through any given thickness of armor than if it were perpendicular to their trajectory.

Anti-tank mines that employ a tilt-rod fuze are also designed to detonate directly underneath the glacis plate. As a result, it is generally the thickest, most robust armored section of a tank, followed by the turret face and gun mantlet.

<doc id="44431" wikidata="Q178469" url="?curid=44431" title="Biafra">
<text>Biafara anglicized as Biafra ( ), officially the Republic of Biafra, was a partially recognised state in West Africa that declared independence from Nigeria and existed from 1967 to 1970. Its territory consisted of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, predominantly inhabited by the Igbo ethnic group. Biafra was established on 30 May 1967 by Igbo military officer and Eastern Region governor Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu under his presidency, following a series of ethnic tensions and military coups after Nigerian independence in 1960 that culminated in the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom.

The Nigerian military attempted to reclaim the territory of Biafra, resulting in the start of the Nigerian Civil War. Biafra was officially recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Tanzania, and Zambia while receiving &quot;de facto&quot; recognition and covert military support from France, Portugal, Israel, South Africa and Rhodesia. After nearly three years of war, during which around two million Biafran civilians died, president Ojukwu fled into exile in Ivory Coast as the Nigerian military approached the capital of Biafra. Philip Effiong became the second president of Biafra, and he oversaw the surrender of Biafran forces to Nigeria.

Igbo nationalism became a strong political and social force after the civil war. It has grown more militant since the 1990s, calling for the independence of the Biafran people and the establishment of their state. Various Biafran secessionist groups have emerged, such as the Indigenous People of Biafra, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, and the Biafra Zionist Front.

==History==

Early modern maps of Africa from the 15th to the 19th centuries, drawn from accounts written by explorers and travellers, show references to Biafar, Biafara, Biafra, and Biafares. According to the maps, the European travellers used the word &quot;Biafara&quot; to describe the region of today&#x27;s West Cameroon, including an area around today&#x27;s Equatorial Guinea. The German publisher Johann Heinrich Zedler, in his encyclopedia of 1731, published the exact geographical location of the capital of Biafara, namely alongside the river Rio dos Camaroes in today&#x27;s Cameroon, underneath 6 degrees 10 min latitude. The words &quot;Biafara&quot; and &quot;Biafares&quot; also appear on maps from the 18th century in the area around Senegal and Gambia.

In his personal writings from his travels, a Rev. Charles W. Thomas defined the locations of islands in the Bight of Biafra as &quot;between the parallels of longitude 5° and 9° East and latitude 4° North and 2° South&quot;.

=== Under independent Nigeria ===
In 1960, Nigeria became independent of the United Kingdom. As with many other new African states, the borders of the country did not reflect earlier ethnic, cultural, religious, or political boundaries. Thus, the northern region of the country has a Muslim majority, being primarily made up of territory of the indigenous Sokoto Caliphate. The southern population is predominantly Christian, being primarily made up of territory of the indigenous Yoruba and Igbo states in the west and east respectively. Following independence, Nigeria was demarcated primarily along ethnic lines: a Hausa and Fulani majority in the north, Yoruba majority in the West, and Igbo majority in the East.

Ethnic tension had simmered in Nigeria during discussions of independence, but in the mid-twentieth century, ethnic and religious riots began to occur. In 1945 an ethnic riot flared up in Jos in which Hausa-Fulani people targeted Igbo people and left many dead and wounded. Police and army units from Kaduna had to be brought in to restore order. A newspaper article describes the event:

At Jos in 1945, a sudden and savage attack by Northerners took the Easterners completely by surprise, and before the situation could be brought under control, the bodies of Eastern women, men, and children littered the streets and their property worth thousands of pounds reduced to shambles

Three thousand Igbo people were murdered in the Jos riots. In 1953 a similar riot occurred in Kano. A decade later in 1964 and during the Western political crisis, the Western Region was divided as Ladoke Akintola clashed with Obafemi Awolowo. Widespread reports of fraud tarnished the election&#x27;s legitimacy. Westerners especially resented the political domination of the Northern People&#x27;s Congress, many of whose candidates ran unopposed in the election. Violence spread throughout the country, and some began to flee the North and West, some to Dahomey. The apparent domination of the political system by the North, and the chaos breaking out across the country, motivated elements within the military to consider decisive action. The federal government, dominated by Northern Nigeria, allowed the crisis to unfold with the intention of declaring a state of emergency and placing the Western Region under martial law. This administration of the Nigerian federal government was widely perceived to be corrupt. In January 1966, the situation reached a breaking point. A military coup occurred during which a mixed but predominantly Igbo group of army officers assassinated 30 political leaders, including Nigeria&#x27;s Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and the Northern premier, Sir Ahmadu Bello. The four most senior officers of Northern origin were also killed. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the President, of Igbo extraction, and the favoured Western Region politician Obafemi Awolowo were not killed. The commander of the army, General Aguiyi Ironsi, seized power to maintain order.

In July 1966, northern officers and army units staged a countercoup, killing General Aguiyi Ironsi and several southern officers. The predominantly Muslim officers named a general from a small ethnic group (the Angas) in central Nigeria, General Yakubu &quot;Jack&quot; Gowon, as the head of the Federal Military Government (FMG). The two coups deepened Nigeria&#x27;s ethnic tensions. In September 1966, approximately 30,000 Igbo civilians were killed and hundreds of thousand more maimed, had their properties confiscated and fled the north, and some Northerners were expelled in backlashes in eastern cities.

In January 1967, the military leaders Yakubu &quot;Jack&quot; Gowon, Chukwuemeka Ojukwu and senior police officials of each region met in Aburi in Ghana and agreed on a less centralised union of regions. The Northerners were at odds with this agreement, known as the Aburi Accords; Obafemi Awolowo, the leader of the Western Region warned that if the Eastern Region seceded, the Western Region would also, which persuaded the northerners.
After returning to Nigeria, the federal government reneged on the agreement and unilaterally declared the creation of several new states including some that gerrymandered the Igbos in Biafra.

=== Nigerian civil war ===
On 26 May, Ojukwu decreed secession from Nigeria after consultations with community leaders from across the Eastern Region. Four days later, Ojukwu unilaterally declared the independence of the Republic of Biafra, citing the Igbos killed in the post-coup violence as reasons for the declaration of independence. It is believed this was one of the major factors that sparked the war. The large amount of oil in the region also created conflict, as oil was already becoming a major component of the Nigerian economy. Biafra was ill-equipped for war, with fewer army personnel and less equipment than the Nigerian military, but had advantages over the Nigerian state as they were fighting in their homeland and had the support of most Biafrans.

The FMG attacked Biafra on 6 July 1967. Nigeria&#x27;s initial efforts were unsuccessful; the Biafrans successfully launched their own offensive, and expansion efforts; occupying areas in the mid-Western Region in August 1967. This led to the creation of the Republic of Benin, a short lived puppet state. However, with the support of the British, American and Soviet governments, Nigeria turned the tide of the war. By October 1967, the FMG had regained the land after intense fighting. In September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the &quot;final offensive&quot;. Initially, the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops. In the latter stages, a Southern FMG offensive managed to break through the fierce resistance.

Due to the proliferation of television and international news organizations, the war found a global audience. 1968 saw the images of malnourished and starving Biafran children reach the mass media of Western countries and led to non-governmental organisations become involved to provide humanitarian aid, leading to the Biafran airlift.

After two-and-a-half years of war, during which almost two million Biafran civilians (three-quarters of them small children) died from starvation caused by the total blockade of the region by the Nigerian government, Biafran forces under Nigeria&#x27;s motto of &quot;No-victor, No-vanquished&quot; surrendered to the Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG). The surrender was facilitated by the Biafran Vice President and Chief of General Staff, Major General Philip Effiong, who assumed leadership of the Republic of Biafra after the first President, Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, fled to Ivory Coast. After the surrender of Biafrans, some Igbos who had fled the conflict returned to their properties but were unable to claim them back from new occupants. This became law in the Abandoned Properties Act (28 September 1979). It was purported that at the start of the civil war, Igbos withdrew their funds from Nigerian banks and converted it to the Biafran currency. After the war, bank accounts owned by Biafrans were seized and a Nigerian panel resolved to give every Igbo person an account with only 20 pounds. Federal projects in Biafra were also greatly reduced compared to other parts of Nigeria. In an Intersociety study it was found that Nigerian security forces also extorted approximately $100 million per year from illegal roadblocks and other methods from Igboland – a cultural sub-region of Biafra in what is now southern Nigeria, causing the Igbo citizenry to trust the Nigerian security forces even less than before.

==Geography==
The Republic of Biafra comprised over of land, with terrestrial borders shared with Nigeria to the north and west, and with Cameroon to the east. Its coast is on the Gulf of Guinea of the South Atlantic Ocean in the south.

The country&#x27;s northeast bordered the Benue Hills and mountains that lead to Cameroon. Three major rivers flow from Biafra into the Gulf of Guinea: the Imo River, the Cross River and the Niger River.

The territory of the Republic of Biafra is covered nowadays by the reorganised Nigerian states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Ebonyi, Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Delta and southern Kogi and Benue states.

==Languages==
The languages of Biafra were Igbo, Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, Ogoni, and Ijaw. However, English was used as the national language.

==Politics==
The Republic of Biafra, a short-lived state that existed from 1967 to 1970, was characterized by a unitary republic structure administered under emergency measures. It comprised an executive branch led by the Biafran president and the Biafran Cabinet, along with a judicial branch that included the Ministry of Justice, the Biafran Supreme Court, and other subordinate courts, reflecting its attempts to establish a functioning governmental system during the period of secession.

=== International recognition ===
Biafra was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, and Zambia. Other nations, that did not officially recognise Biafra, but granted &quot;de facto&quot; recognition in the form of diplomatic support or military aid, included France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Israel, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Vatican City. Biafra received aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, foreign mercenaries, Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland, Caritas Internationalis, and Catholic Relief Services of the United States. Doctors Without Borders also originated in response to the suffering.

Although the government of the United States under the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson maintained an officially neutral stance during the war, there was strong public support for Biafra in the United States. The American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive was founded by American activists to spread pro-Biafran propaganda. U.S. president Richard Nixon was sympathetic to Biafra. Before he won the 1968 election, he accused Nigeria of committing genocide against Biafrans and called for the United States to intervene in the war to support Biafra. However, he was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts to aid Biafra due to the demands of the Vietnam War.

==Economy==
An early institution created by the Biafran government was the Bank of Biafra, accomplished under &quot;Decree No. 3 of 1967&quot;. The bank carried out all central banking functions including the administration of foreign exchange and the management of the public debt of the Republic. The bank was administered by a governor and four directors; the first governor, who signed on bank notes, was Sylvester Ugoh. A second decree, &quot;Decree No. 4 of 1967&quot;, modified the Banking Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Republic of Biafra.

The bank was first located in Enugu, but due to the ongoing war, it was relocated several times. Biafra attempted to finance the war through foreign exchange. After Nigeria announced its currency would no longer be legal tender (to make way for a new currency), this effort increased. After the announcement, tons of Nigerian bank notes were transported in an effort to acquire foreign exchange. The currency of Biafra had been the Nigerian pound until the Bank of Biafra started printing out its own notes, the Biafran pound. The new currency went public on 28 January 1968, and the Nigerian pound was not accepted as an exchange unit. The first issue of the bank notes included only 5 shillings notes and 1 pound notes. The Bank of Nigeria exchanged only 30 pounds for an individual and 300 pounds for enterprises in the second half of 1968.

In 1969, new notes were introduced: £10, £5, £1, 10/- and 5/-.

It is estimated that a total of £115–140 million Biafran pounds were in circulation by the end of the conflict, with a population of about 14 million, approximately £10 per person.

==Military==


At the beginning of the war Biafra had 3,000 soldiers, but at the end of the war, the soldiers totalled 30,000. There was no official support for the Biafran Army by any other nation throughout the war, although arms were clandestinely acquired. Because of the lack of official support, the Biafrans manufactured many of their weapons locally. Europeans served in the Biafran cause; German-born Rolf Steiner was a lieutenant colonel assigned to the 4th Commando Brigade and Welshman Taffy Williams served as a Major until the very end of the conflict. A special guerrilla unit, the Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighters, was established, designed to emulate the insurrectionist guerrilla forces of the Viet Cong in the American – Vietnamese War, targeting Nigerian Federal Army supply lines and forcing them to shift forces to internal security efforts.

The Biafrans managed to set up a small yet effective air force. The BAF commander was Polish World War II ace Jan Zumbach. Early inventory included four World War II American bombers: two B-25 Mitchells, two B-26 Invaders (Douglas A-26) (one piloted by Zumbach), a converted Douglas DC-3 and one British de Havilland Dove. In 1968 the Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen suggested the MiniCOIN project to General Ojukwu. By early 1969, Biafra had assembled five MFI-9Bs in neighbouring Gabon, calling them the &quot;Biafra Babies&quot;. They were painted in green camouflage and armed with two Matra Type 122 rocket pods, each being able to carry six 68 mm SNEB anti-armour rockets under each wing and had Swedish WW2 reflex sights from old FFVS J 22s. The six aeroplanes were flown by three Swedish pilots and three Biafran pilots. In September 1969, Biafra acquired four ex-French North American T-6 Texans (T-6G), which were flown to Biafra the following month, with another aircraft lost on the ferry flight. These aircraft flew missions until January 1970 and were flown by Portuguese ex-military pilots.

Biafra also had a small improvised navy, but it never gained the success that their air force did. It was headquartered in Kidney Island, Port Harcourt, and commanded by Winifred Anuku. The Biafran Navy was made up of captured craft, converted tugs, and armour-reinforced civilian vessels armed with machine guns or captured 6-pounder guns. It mainly operated in the Niger River delta and along the Niger River.

==Legacy==
The international humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières originated in response to the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.

In their study &quot;Smallpox and its Eradication&quot;, Fenner and colleagues describe how vaccine supply shortages during the Biafra smallpox campaign led to the development of the focal vaccination technique, later adopted worldwide by the World Health Organization of the United Nations, which led to the early and cost-effective interruption of smallpox transmission in West Africa and elsewhere.

In 2010, researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and University of Nigeria at Nsukka showed that Igbos born in Biafra during the years of the famine were of higher risk of suffering from obesity, hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism compared to controls born a short period after the famine had ended in the early 1970s. The findings are in line with the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis suggesting that malnutrition in early life is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes later in life.

A 2017 paper found that Biafran &quot;women exposed to the war in their growing years exhibit reduced adult stature, increased likelihood of being overweight, earlier age at first birth, and lower educational attainment. Exposure to a primary education program mitigates the impacts of war exposure on education. War-exposed men marry later and have fewer children. War exposure of mothers (but not fathers) has adverse impacts on child growth, survival, and education. Impacts vary with the age of exposure. For mother and child health, the largest impacts stem from adolescent exposure.&quot;

==Post-war events and Biafran nationalism ==
The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) emerged in 1999 as a nonviolent Biafran nationalist group, associated with Igbo nationalism. The group enacted a &quot;re-launch&quot; of Biafra in Aba, the commercial centre of Abia State and a major commercial centre in Igboland. MASSOB says it is a peaceful group and advertises a 25-stage plan to achieve its goal peacefully. It has two arms of government, the Biafra Government in Exile and the Biafra Shadow Government. MASSOB accuses Nigeria of marginalising Biafran people. Since August 1999, protests have erupted in cities across Nigeria&#x27;s south-east. Though peaceful, the protesters have been routinely attacked by the Nigerian police and army, with large numbers of people reportedly killed. Many others have been injured and/or arrested.

On 29 May 2000, the Lagos &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that the former president Olusegun Obasanjo commuted to retirement the dismissal of all military persons, soldiers and officers, who fought for the breakaway Republic of Biafra during Nigeria&#x27;s 1967–1970 civil war. In a national broadcast, he said the decision was based on the belief that &quot;justice must at all times be tempered with mercy&quot;.

In July 2006, the Center for World Indigenous Studies reported that government-sanctioned killings were taking place in the southeastern city of Onitsha, because of a shoot-to-kill policy directed toward Biafrans, particularly members of the MASSOB.

The Nigerian federal government accuses MASSOB of violence; MASSOB&#x27;s leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, was arrested in 2005 and was detained on treason charges. He has since been released and has been rearrested and released more than five times. In 2009, MASSOB leader Chief Uwazuruike launched an unrecognised &quot;Biafran International Passport&quot; and also launched a &quot;Biafra Plate Number&quot; in 2016 in response to persistent demand by some Biafran sympathizers in the diaspora and at home. On 16 June 2012, a Supreme Council of Elders of the Indigenous People of Biafra, another pro-Biafra organisation, was formed. The body is made up of some prominent persons in the Biafra region. They sued the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the right to self-determination. Debe Odumegwu Ojukwu, the eldest son of ex-President / General Ojukwu and a Lagos state-based lawyer was the lead counsel that championed the case.

MASSOB leader Chief Ralph Uwazuruike established Radio Biafra in the United Kingdom in 2009, with Nnamdi Kanu as his radio director; later Kanu was said to have been dismissed from MASSOB because of accusations of supporting violence. The Nigerian Government, through its broadcasting regulators, the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigerian and Nigerian Communications Commission, has sought to clamp down on Radio Biafra with limited success. On 17 November 2015, the Abia state police command seized an Indigenous People of Biafra radio transmitter in Umuahia. On 23 December 2015, Kanu was detained and charged with charges that amounted to treason against the Nigerian state. He was released on bail on 24 April 2017 after spending more than 19 months without trial of his treason charges. Self-determination is not a crime in Nigerian law.

According to the South-East Based Coalition of Human Rights Organisations, security forces under the directive of the federal government have killed 80 members of the Indigenous People of Biafra and their supporters between 30 August 2015 and 9 February 2016 in a renewed clampdown on the campaign. A report by Amnesty International between August 2015 and August 2016, at least 150 pro-Biafran activists overall were killed by Nigerian security forces, with 60 people shot in a period of two days in connection with events marking Biafran Remembrance Day. The Nigerian military killed at least 17 unarmed Biafrans in the city of Onitsha prior to a march on 30 May 2016 commemorating the 49th anniversary of Biafra&#x27;s 1967 declaration of independence.

Another group is the Biafra Nations League, formerly known as Biafra Nations Youth League, which has its operational base in the Bakassi Peninsula. The group is led by Princewill Chimezie Richard, alias Prince Obuka, and Ebuta Akor Takon (not to be confused wth the group&#x27;s former deputy, Ebuta Ogar Takon). The group also has a Chief of Staff and operational commander who are both natives of the Bakassi. BNL have recorded a series of security clampdowns, especially in the Bakassi where soldiers of &#x27;Operations Delta Safe&#x27; apprehended the National Leader, Princewill, in the Ikang-Cameroon border area on 9 November 2016. During an attempt to mobilise a protest in support of Kanu&#x27;s release, he was again re-arrested by the Nigeria Police Force in the same area on 16 January 2018 along with 20 of their supporters. Many media outlets reported that BNL is linked to the Southern Cameroons separatists; although the group confirms this, they denied involvement in violent activities in Cameroon. The Deputy Leader, Ebuta Akor Takon is an Ejagham native, a tribe in Nigeria and also in significant number in Cameroon. BNL, which operates more in the Gulf of Guinea, has links with Dokubo Asari, a former militant leader. About 100 members of the group were reportedly arrested in Bayelsa during a meeting with Dokubo on 18 August 2019.

The Incorporated Trustees of Bilie Human Rights Initiative, representing the Indigenous People of Biafra, have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Attorney General of the Federation, seeking the actualisation of the sovereign state of Biafra by legal means. The Federal High Court, Abuja has fixed 25 February 2019 for hearing the suit.

On 31 July 2020, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra/Biafra Independence Movement (BIM-MASSOB) joined the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO).

=== Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ===
The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is a separatist group in Nigeria that aims to restore the defunct Republic of Biafra, a country which seceded from Nigeria in 1967 prior to the Nigerian Civil War and was subsequently dissolved following its defeat in 1970. Since 2021, IPOB and other Biafran separatist groups have been fighting a low-level guerilla conflict in southeastern Nigeria against the Nigerian government. The group was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu who has been the leader and Uche Mefor, who served as the deputy leader.

Kanu is known as a British political activist known for his advocacy of the contemporary Biafran independence movement. It was declared a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government in 2017 under the Nigerian Terrorism Act but the declaration was nullified by a High Court sitting in Enugu in 2023. As of May 2022, the United Kingdom started denying asylum to members of IPOB who allegedly engaged in human rights abuses, though the UK government clarified that IPOB had not been designated as a terrorist organisation.

IPOB has criticized the Nigerian federal government for poor investment, political alienation, inequitable resource distribution, ethnic marginalization, and heavy military presence, extrajudicial killings in the South-Eastern, South-Central and parts of North-Central regions of the country. The organization rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and is now the largest Biafran independence organization by membership. In recent years, it has gained significant media attention for becoming a frequent target of political crackdowns by the Nigerian government. It also has numerous sites and communication channels serving as the only trusted social apparatus educating and inculcating first-hand information and news to its members.

===Biafra Republic Government in Exile (BRGIE)===
An organization for the restoration of an independent Biafran state has been led by Simon Ekpa, a Finnish politician and Biafran political activist. Ekpa describes himself as Nnamdi Kanu&#x27;s disciple. He has served as the leader (&quot;prime minister&quot;) of the Biafra Republic Government in Exile (BRGIE) since 2023.

In 2023, BRGIE inaugurated an administrative office in Maryland, United States. It initiated the process of declaring the restoration of Biafra and in October 2023, it convened a three-day convention where the possibility of a Biafra referendum was discussed, attended by over 500 Biafrans and delegates globally. On 1 February 2024, a digital e-voting system was adopted, and a self-referendum launched the same day. Within days of the referendum exercise, more than two million electorates were reportedly recorded. Prior to the self-referendum exercise, BRGIE had already inaugurated a committee for the Biafra restoration declaration process in January 2024.

On 24 June 2024, the Organization of Emerging African States (OEAS) endorsed the referendum.

BRGIE intended to issue a &quot;declaration of the restoration of independent state of Biafra&quot; on December 2, 2024, at the 2024 Finland convention. Former U.S. Congressman Jim Moran advocates for Biafran independence under the BRGIE with a contract that has been in effect since June 15, 2024.

In emulation of Lithuania&#x27;s historical part on the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania that restored Lithuania as an independent State on 11 March 1990, the Biafra Restoration Declaration Act was enacted with the term &quot;Declaration of the restoration of the independent State of Biafra&quot; adopted. The recruitment process for the drafting board to be responsible for the restoration declaration of independence was opened on 2 January 2024.

Following the conclusion of the self-referendum exercise held from 1 February to 28 November 2024 through electronic and physical voting, the restoration of Biafra was declared on 29 November 2024 by Biafrans gathered in Lahti, Finland.

Water Island was part of the Danish West Indies until 1905, when the Danish state sold it to the East Asiatic Company, a private shipping company.

The islands of St Thomas, St John, and St Croix were purchased by United States in 1917 and are now known collectively as the U. S. Virgin Islands. 


== Historical overview ==

=== Acquisition ===
The Danish West India-Guinea Company annexed uninhabited St. Thomas in 1672. It annexed St. John in 1718 and bought St. Croix from France (King Louis XV) on 28 June 1733. When the Danish West India-Guinea Company went bankrupt in 1754, King Frederik V of Denmark–Norway assumed direct control of the three islands. Although, during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain twice occupied the Danish West Indies, first in 1801–1802 and again in 1807–1815. 

=== Colonisation and slavery ===
The economy of the Danish West Indies depended on slavery. Danish colonizers in the West Indies aimed to exploit the profitable triangular trade, involving the export of firearms and other manufactured goods to Africa in exchange for slaves, who were then transported to the Caribbean to work the sugar plantations. Caribbean colonies, in turn, exported sugar, rum and molasses to Denmark. After a rebellion, slavery was officially abolished in 1848, leading to the near economic collapse of the plantations.

=== Disposition ===
In 1852, the Danish parliament first debated the sale of the increasingly unprofitable colony. Denmark tried several times to sell or exchange the Danish West Indies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the United States and the German Empire. The islands were eventually sold to the United States for $25 million ($ in 2025) which took over the administration on 31 March 1917 and renamed the territory the United States Virgin Islands.

The Danes overstruck Spanish coins, issued by Charles III. However, the used stroke is of Christian VI (1730– 1746) and not of Christian VII (1766–1808). Bearing witness to the difficulty not only of producing or procuring flans, but also even just obtaining new striking tools.

==History==
===Foundation===

Merchants in Copenhagen asked King Christian IV for permission to establish a West Indian trading company in 1622, but, by the time an eight-year monopoly on trade with the West Indies, Virginia, Brazil and Guinea was granted on 25 January 1625, the failure of the Danish East India and Iceland Companies and the beginning of Danish involvement in the Thirty Years&#x27; War dried up any interest in the idea. Prince Frederick organized a trading mission to Barbados in 1647 under Gabriel Gomez and the de Casseres brothers, but it and a 1651 expedition of two ships were unsuccessful. It was not until Erik Smit&#x27;s private 1652 expedition aboard the &quot;Fortuna&quot; was successful that interest in the West Indies&#x27; trade grew into an interest in the creation of a new Danish colony.

Smit&#x27;s 1653 expedition and a separate expedition of five ships were quite successful, but Smit&#x27;s third expedition found his two vessels captured for a loss of 32,000 rigsdaler. Two years later, a Danish flotilla was destroyed by a hurricane in August. Smit returned from his fourth expedition in 1663 and formally proposed the settlement of St. Thomas to the king in April 1665. After only three weeks&#x27; deliberation, the scheme was approved and Smit was named governor. Settlers departed aboard the &quot;Eendragt&quot; on 1 July, but the expedition was ill-starred: The ship hit two large storms and suffered from fire before reaching its destination, and then it was raided by English privateers prosecuting the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in which Denmark was allied with the Netherlands. Smit died of illness, and a second band of privateers stole the ship and used it to trade with neighboring islands. Following a hurricane and a renewed outbreak of disease, the colony collapsed, with the English departing for the nearby French colony on Saint Croix, the Danes fleeing to Saint Christopher, and the Dutch assisting their countrymen on Ter Tholen in stealing everything of value, particularly the remaining Danish guns and ammunition.

===Danish West India Company===

The Danes formed a Board of Trade in 1668 and secured a commercial treaty with Britain, providing for the unmolested settlement of uninhabited islands, in July 1670. The Danish West India Company was organized in December and formally chartered by King Christian V the next year on 11 March 1671. Jørgen Iversen Dyppel, a successful trader on Saint Christopher, was made governor and the king provided convicts from his jails and two vessels for the establishment of the colony, the yacht &quot;Den forgyldte Krone&quot; and the frigate &quot;Færøe&quot;. &quot;Den forgyldte Krone&quot; was ordered to run ahead and wait but ended up returning to Denmark after the &quot;Færøe&quot; under Capt. Zacharias Hansen Bang was delayed for repairs in Bergen. The &quot;Færøe&quot; completed her mission alone, establishing a settlement on St. Thomas on 25 May 1672. From an original contingent of 190 12 officials, 116 company &quot;employees&quot; (indentured servants), and 62 felons and former prostitutes only 104 remained, 9 having escaped and 77 having died in transit. Another 75 died within the first year, leaving only 29 to carry on the colony.

In 1675, Iversen claimed St. John and placed two men there; in 1684, Governor Esmit granted it to two English merchants from Barbados but their men were chased off the island by two British sloops sent by Governor Stapleton of the British Leeward Islands. Further instructions in 1688 to establish a settlement on St. John seem not to have been acted on until Governor Bredal made an official establishment on 25 March 1718.

The islands quickly became a base for pirates attacking ships in the vicinity and also for the Brandenburg African Company. Governor Lorentz raised enormous taxes upon them and seized warehouses and cargoes of tobacco, sugar, and slaves in 1689 only to have his actions repudiated by the authorities in Copenhagen; his hasty action to seize Crab Island prohibited the Brandenburgers from establishing their own Caribbean colony, however. Possession of the island was subsequently disputed with the Scottish in 1698 and fully lost to the Spanish in 1811.

St. Croix was purchased from the French West India Company in 1733. In 1754, the islands were sold to king Frederick V, becoming royal Danish-Norwegian colonies.

===Later history (1801–1917)===


The first British invasion and occupation of the Danish West Indies occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars, when at the end of March 1801 a British fleet arrived at St Thomas. The Danes accepted the Articles of Capitulation the British proposed and the British occupied the islands without a shot being fired. The British occupation lasted until April 1802, when the British returned the islands to Denmark.

The second British invasion of the Danish West Indies took place during the Napoleonic Wars in December 1807 when a British fleet captured St Thomas on 22 December and Saint Croix on 25 December. The Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. This British occupation of the Danish West Indies lasted until 20 November 1815, when Britain returned the islands to Denmark.

By the 1850s, the Danish West Indies had a total population of about 41,000 people. The government of the islands was under a governor-general, whose jurisdiction extended to the other Danish colonies of the group. However, because the islands formerly belonged to Great Britain, the inhabitants were English in customs and in language. The islands of that period consisted of:
* St. Thomas had a population of 12,800 people and had sugar and cotton as its chief exports. St. Thomas city was the capital of the island, then a free port, and the chief station of the steam-packets between Southampton, in England, and the West Indies.
* St. John had a population of about 2,600 people.
* St. Croix, though inferior to St. Thomas in commerce, was of greater importance in extent and fertility, and, with 25,600 people, was the largest in population.

The United States had been interested in the islands since at least the 1860s when President Andrew Johnson came close to obtaining St. Thomas and St. John, as Denmark agreed to sell in 1867 for $7.5 million and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the US Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired. In 1889, there were rumours of negotiations between the Danish and the Germans for sale of the islands. In 1902, the Danish Parliament rejected both a convention and a treaty with the United States.

The United States acted again in 1915 because of the islands&#x27; strategic position near the approach to the Panama Canal and because of a fear that Germany might seize them to use as U-boat bases during World War I. A referendum was held in Denmark itself on the future of the islands, which had become both a financial burden and a strategic concern. On 17 January 1917, according to the Treaty of the Danish West Indies, the Danish government sold the islands to the United States for $25 million ($ in current prices), when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications and with the US removing its objections to Denmark taking control of the whole of Greenland. Danish administration ended on 31 March 1917, when the United States took formal possession of the territory and renamed it the United States Virgin Islands. Rear Admiral James H. Oliver was the first American governor of the Danish West Indies.

At the time of the U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies in 1917, the colony did not include Water Island, which had been sold by Denmark to the East Asiatic Company, a private shipping company, in 1905. The company eventually sold the island to the United States in 1944, during the German occupation of Denmark.

==Postage stamps==

St Thomas was a hub of the West Indies packet trade from 1851 to 1885. Denmark issued stamps for the Danish West Indies from 1856 onward.
==Religion==
The Danish West Indies were inhabited by many different cultures, and each had its own traditions and religions. The king and the church worked closely together to maintain law and order; the church was responsible for people&#x27;s moral upbringing, and the king led the civil order. There was no state-sponsored religion in Denmark until 1849, but in the Danish West Indies there had always been a great deal of religious freedom. Danish authorities tended to be lenient towards religious beliefs, but required that all citizens had to observe Danish holidays. Freedom of religion was partially granted to help settle the islands, as there was a shortage of willing settlers from Europe. This worked to an extent, seeing that a large proportion of settlers were in fact Dutch and British natives fleeing religious persecution.

Jews began settling the colony in 1655, and by 1796 the first synagogue was inaugurated. In its heyday in the mid-19th century, the Jewish community made up half of the European population. One of the earliest colonial governors, Gabriel Milan, was a Sephardic Jew.

In spite of a general tolerance for religion, many African religions were not recognized because they typically revolved around belief in animism and magic, beliefs that were consistently met with scorn, and were regarded as immoral and subservient. A widespread viewpoint was that if one could convert slaves to Christianity, they could have a better life, and therefore many slaves were converted.

By 1900, with a population of 30,000, a fourth of the people were Catholics, while most of the rest were Anglicans, Moravians, or other Protestants. For decades, the Moravians had organized missions and also taken charge of the educational system.

==Slavery==

Chattel slavery was practiced in the Danish West Indies from at least the 1670s until the abolition of slavery in 1848. Most slaves worked on plantations, particularly in sugar production, though some also worked at the harbors.

===Demographics===

Slaves outnumbered Europeans on all islands, often by large margins. On Saint Thomas, population expansion was recorded as 422 Africans and 317 Europeans in 1688, 555 Africans and 383 Europeans in 1699, and 3,042 Africans and 547 Europeans in 1715 (a ratio of more than 5:1), and by 1755 slaves outnumbered Europeans 12:1. On Saint John, there were 677 Africans and 123 Europeans in 1728, 1086 Africans and 208 Europeans in 1733 (a ratio of more than 5:1), and by 1770 slaves outnumbered Europeans 19:1. On Saint Croix in 1797, there were 25,452 slaves and 2,223 Europeans (a ratio of more than 11:1) as well as 1,164 freedmen, and in 1815 there were 24,330 slaves and 180 Europeans (a ratio of more than 135:1) as well as 2,480 freedmen. At that time, freedmen (many of whom had purchased their freedom) also outnumbered Europeans on Saint Thomas and Saint John.

===Slave trade===
Trading African slaves was part of the transatlantic slave trade by Denmark–Norway around 1671, when the Danish West India Company was chartered, until 1 January 1803, when the 1792 law to abolish the slave trade came into effect.

By 1778, it was estimated that the Danes were bringing about 3,000 Africans to the Danish West Indies yearly for enslavement. These transports continued until the end of 1802, when a 1792 law by Crown Prince Regent Frederik that banned the trade of slaves came into effect.

===Slave codes===

Laws and regulations in the Danish West Indies were based on Denmark&#x27;s laws, but the local government was allowed to adapt them to match local conditions. For example, things like animals, land, and buildings were regulated according to Danish law, but Danish law did not regulate slavery. Slaves were treated as common property, and therefore did not necessitate specific laws.

In 1733, differentiation between slaves and other property was implied by a regulation that stated that slaves had their own will and thus could behave inappropriately or be disobedient. There was a general consensus that if the slaves were punished too hard or were malnourished, the slaves would start to rebel. This was borne out by the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John, where many plantation owners and their families were killed by the Akwamu, including Breffu, before it was suppressed later the following year. In 1755 Frederick V of Denmark issued more new Regulations, in which slaves were guaranteed the right not to be separated from their children and the right to medical support during periods of illness or old age. However, the colonial government had the ability to amend laws and regulations according to local conditions, and thus the regulations were never enacted in the colony, on grounds that it was more disadvantageous than advantageous.

===1733 slave insurrection===

The 1733 slave insurrection on St. John, which lasted from November 1733 until August 1734, was one of the earliest and longest slave rebellions in the Americas. The insurrection started on 23 November 1733, when 150 slaves, primarily Akwamus, revolted against plantation owners and managers. The slaves captured the fort in Coral Bay and took control of most of the island.

Planters regained control by the end of May 1734, after the Akwamu were defeated by several hundred better-armed French and Swiss troops sent in April from Martinique, a French colony. Colony militia continued to hunt down maroons and finally declared the rebellion at an end in late August 1734.

===Emancipation===
By the 1830s and 1840s, the sugar beet industry had reduced the profitability of sugarcane. The British Slavery Abolition Act 1833 emancipated slaves in the neighboring British West Indies, fully effective as of 1840. Abolition in the Danish West Indies was discussed, with Governor von Scholten, who had been seeking reforms since 1830, in favor of emancipation. Scholarly consensus suggests von Scholten&#x27;s views were influenced by his free-colored mistress Anna Heegaard.

King Christian VIII supported the gradual abolition of slavery and ruled in 1847 that every child born of an unfree woman should be free from birth, and that slavery would end entirely after 12 years. That ruling satisfied neither the slaves nor the plantation owners.

Meanwhile, on 27 April 1848, France signed a law to abolish slavery in their colonies within two months, but a slave insurrection on Martinique led to immediate abolition on Martinique on 22 May and Guadeloupe on 27 May.

The slaves in the Danish West Indies did not want to wait for their freedom, either. On 2 July 1848, freedman John Gottlieb (also known as &quot;Moses Gottlieb&quot; or &quot;General Buddhoe&quot;) and Admiral Martin King (among others) led a slave rebellion, taking over Frederiksted, Saint Croix. That evening, hundreds of slaves gathered peaceably outside Fort Frederik refusing to work the next day and demanding freedom. By 10 a.m. the following morning, about 8,000 slaves had joined.

On the afternoon of 3 July 1848 (now known as Emancipation Day), Peter von Scholten, in order to end the rebellion and prevent bloodshed and damages, went to Frederiksted and announced an immediate and total emancipation of all slaves. He then went to Christiansted, where a second rebellion had formed and some fires had been set, and had notices disseminated to the other islands. General Buddhoe worked with the governor and other officials to end the riots and violence that had broken out on a few estates.

In the aftermath, Buddhoe is said to have been jailed and exiled to Trinidad. Governor von Scholten also fared poorly. As governor, he did not actually have the authority to end slavery, but had found himself in a situation where he needed to take immediate action that could not wait for communicating with Denmark. For his actions, he was called back to Denmark to face a trial for treason. He was first denied his pension, but later cleared of the charges.

When Denmark abolished slavery in 1848, many plantation owners wanted full reimbursement on the grounds that their assets were damaged by the loss of the slaves, and by the fact that they would have to pay for labor in the future. The Danish government paid fifty dollars for every slave the plantation owners had owned and recognized that the slaves&#x27; release had caused a financial loss for the owners.

===Post-slavery===

The lives of the formerly enslaved people changed very little because many continued to be bound to the plantation system through contractual servitude. Most were bound to serve the plantations where they had previously been enslaved. As employees, former slaves were not the plantation owners&#x27; responsibility and did not receive food or care from their employers. As part of a sharecropping system, some formerly enslaved people received a small hut, a little land, and some money; however, this one-time compensation did not change the harsh working conditions.

The Fireburn labor riot, considered to be the largest labor revolt in Danish colonial history, took place on 1 October 1878. The revolt began because the formerly enslaved continued to live and work in slave-like conditions even though three decades had passed since the abolition of slavery. Mary Leticia Thomas, today referred to as Queen Mary of St. Croix, spearheaded the revolt alongside three other women: Axeline ‘Agnes’ Elizabeth Salomon, Matilde McBean and Susanna ‘Bottom Belly’ Abrahamsson. The Fireburn uprising and its leaders continue to have a meaningful role in St. Croix.

2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the sale of the colony by Denmark to the United States. With this centennial, conversations on the legacy of Danish–Norwegian colonization and slavery were reignited in the Scandinavian mainstream. For example, the artists Jeannette Ehlers and La Vaughn Belle unveiled Denmark&#x27;s first statue of a black woman, I Am Queen Mary, to memorialize Denmark&#x27;s colonial impact.

<doc id="44434" wikidata="Q20147" url="?curid=44434" title="Tractor beam">
<text>A tractor beam is a device that can attract one object to another from a distance. The concept originates in fiction: The term was coined by E. E. Smith (an update of his earlier &quot;attractor beam&quot;) in his novel &quot;Spacehounds of IPC&quot; (1931). Since the 1990s, technology and research have labored to make it a reality, and have had some success on a microscopic level. Less commonly, a similar beam that repels is known as a pressor beam or repulsor beam. Gravity impulse and gravity propulsion beams are traditionally areas of research from fringe physics that coincide with the concepts of tractor and repulsor beams.

==Physics==
A force field confined to a Collimated beam with clean borders is one of the principal characteristics of tractor and repulsor beams. Several theories that have predicted that repulsive effects do not fall within the category of tractor and repulsor beams because of the absence of field collimation. For example, Robert L. Forward of Hughes Research Laboratories showed that general relativity theory allowed the generation of a very brief impulse of a gravity-like repulsive force along the axis of a helical torus containing accelerated condensed matter. The mainstream scientific community has accepted Forward&#x27;s work.

A variant of Burkhard Heim&#x27;s theory by Walter Dröscher, Institut für Grenzgebiete der Wissenschaft (IGW), Innsbruck, Austria, and Jocham Häuser, University of Applied Sciences and CLE GmbH, Salzgitter, Germany, predicted a repulsive force field of gravitophotons could be produced by a ring rotating above a very strong magnetic field. Heim&#x27;s theory, and its variants, have been treated by the mainstream scientific community as fringe physics. But the works by Forward, Dröscher, and Häuser could not be considered as a form of repulsor- or tractor-beam because the predicted impulses and field effects were not confined to a well-defined, collimated region.

The following are summaries of other notable experiments and theories that resemble repulsor and tractor beam concepts:

===1960s===
In July 1960, trade magazine &quot;Missiles and Rockets&quot; reported that Martin N. Kaplan, a research engineer at Ryan Aeronautical Company, had conducted experiments that could lead to an ability to direct an anti-gravitational force toward or away from a second body.

In 1964, physicists Leopold Halpern of the Niels Bohr Institute and B. Laurent of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics indicated general relativity theory and quantum theory allowed the generation and amplification of gravitons in a manner like the laser. They showed, in principle, gravitational radiation in the form of a beam of gravitons could be generated and amplified by using induced, resonant emissions.

===1990s – Podkletnov experiment===
In 1992, Professor Yevgeny Podkletnov and R. Nieminen, of the Tampere University of Technology, discovered weight fluctuations in objects above an electromagnetically levitated, massive, composite superconducting disk. Three years later, Podkletnov reported the results of additional experiments with a toroidal disk superconductor. They reported the weight of the samples would fluctuate between −2.5% and +5.4% as the angular speed of the superconductor increased. Certain combinations of disk angular speeds and electromagnetic frequencies caused the fluctuations to stabilize at a 0.3% reduction. The experiments with the toroidal disk yielded reductions that reached a maximum of 1.9–2.1%. Reports about both sets of experiments stated the weight loss region was cylindrical, extending vertically for at least three meters above the disk. Qualitative observations of an expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone were reported in the Fall of 1995. Several groups around the world tried to replicate Podkletnov&#x27;s gravity shielding observations.

Italian physicist Giovanni Modanese, while a Von Humboldt Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, made the first attempt to provide a theoretical explanation of Podkletnov&#x27;s observations. He argued that the shielding effect and slight expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone could be explained in terms of induced changes in the local cosmological constant. Modanese described several effects regarding responses to modifications to the local cosmological constant within the superconductor. Ning Wu of the Institute of High Energy Physics (Beijing), used the quantum gauge theory of gravity he had developed in 2001 to explain Podkletnov&#x27;s observations. Wu&#x27;s theory approximated the relative gravity loss as 0.03% (an order of magnitude smaller than the reported range of 0.3–0.5%).

C. S. Unnikrishan, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, showed that if the effect had been caused by gravitational shielding, the shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield. For example, the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical. The height of the cone&#x27;s apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth. Podkletnov and Nieminen described the shape of the weight loss region as a cylinder that extended through the ceiling above the cryostat.

===2010s===
A team of scientists at the Australian National University (ANU) led by Professor Andrei Rode created a device similar to a tractor beam to move small particles 1.5 meters through the air. Rather than create a new gravitational field, however, the device utilizes a doughnut-shaped Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam, which has a high-intensity ring of light that surrounds a dark core along the beam axis. This method confines particles to the center of the beam using photophoresis, whereby illuminated sections of the particle have a higher temperature and thus impart more momentum to air molecules incident on the surface. Owing to this method, such a device cannot work in space due to lack of air. Rode states that there are practical applications for the device on Earth, for example, the transportation of microscopic hazardous materials and other microscopic objects.

John Sinko and Clifford Schlecht researched a form of reversed-thrust laser propulsion as a macroscopic laser tractor beam. Intended applications include remotely manipulating space objects at distances up to about 100 km, removal of space debris, and retrieval of adrift astronauts or tools on-orbit.

Functioning tractor beams based on solenoidal modes of light were demonstrated in 2010 by physicists at New York University.
The spiraling intensity distribution in these non-diffracting beams tends to trap illuminated objects and thus helps to overcome the radiation pressure that ordinarily would drive them down the optical axis. 
Orbital angular momentum transferred from the solenoid beam&#x27;s helical wavefronts then drives the trapped objects upstream along the spiral. Both Bessel-beam and solenoidal tractor beams are being considered for applications in space exploration by NASA.

In March 2011, Chinese scientists posited that a specific type of Bessel beam (a special kind of laser that does not diffract at the center) is capable of creating a pull-like effect on a given microscopic particle, forcing it toward the beam-source. The underlying physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. They show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle. If the total photon momentum projection along the propagation direction is small, attractive optical force is possible. The Chinese scientists suggest this possibility may be implemented for optical micromanipulation.

In 2013, scientists at the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) and the University of St Andrews created a tractor beam that pulls objects on a microscopic level. The study states that this technique may have potential for bio-medical research. 
Professor Zemanek said: &quot;The whole team have spent a number of years investigating various configurations of particles delivery by light.&quot;
Dr. Brzobohaty said: &quot;These methods are opening new opportunities for fundamental photonics as well as applications for life-sciences.&quot;
Dr Cizmar said: &quot;Because of the similarities between optical and acoustic particle manipulation we anticipate that this concept will inspire exciting future studies in areas outside the field of photonics.&quot;

Physicists from ANU built a reversible tractor beam, capable of transporting particles &quot;one fifth of a millimetre in diameter a distance of up to 20 centimetres, around 100 times further than previous experiments.&quot; According to Professor Wieslaw Krolikowski, of the Research School of Physics and Engineering, &quot;demonstration of a large scale laser beam like this is a kind of holy grail for laser physicists.&quot; The work was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2014. In the same year, Dr. Horst Punzmann and his team at ANU developed a tractor beam that works on water, which could potentially be used to contain oil spills, control floating objects, or study the formation of rips on beaches.

In 2015, a team of researchers built the world&#x27;s first sonic tractor beam that can lift and move objects using sound waves. An &quot;Instructables&quot; webpage was made available with instructions to build a rudimentary device.

In 2016, Rice University scientists discovered that Tesla coils can generate force fields able to manipulate matter through a process called teslaphoresis.

In December 2016, researchers were able to manipulate the movement of bacterial cells using a tractor beam, thereby opening the possibility that tractor beams could have future applications in biological sciences.

In 2018, a research team from Tel-Aviv University, led by Dr. Alon Bahabad, experimentally demonstrated an optical analog of the Archimedes&#x27; screw where the rotation of a helical-intensity laser beam is transferred to the axial motion of optically trapped micrometer-scale, airborne, carbon-based particles. With this optical screw, particles were easily conveyed with controlled velocity and direction, upstream or downstream of the optical flow, over half a centimeter.

In 2019, researchers at the University of Washington used a tractor beam to assemble nanoscale materials in a process they describe as &quot;photonic nanosoldering&quot;.

==Fiction==

Science fiction movies and telecasts normally depict tractor and repulsor beams as audible, narrow rays of visible light covering a small target area. Tractor beams are most commonly used on spaceships and space stations. They are generally used in three ways:
# As a device for securing or retrieving cargo, passengers, shuttlecraft, etc. This is analogous to cranes on modern ships.
# As a device to harness objects that can then be used as impromptu weapons by the craft
# As a means of preventing an enemy from escaping, analogous to grappling hooks.

In the latter case, countermeasures can usually be employed against tractor beams. These may include pressor beams (a stronger pressor beam will counteract a weaker tractor beam) or &quot;plane shears&quot; &quot;shearing planes&quot; (a device to &quot;cut&quot; the tractor beam and render it ineffective). In some fictional realities, shields can block tractor beams, or the generators can be disabled by sending a large amount of energy along the beam to its source.

Tractor beams and pressor beams can be used together as a weapon: by attracting one side of an enemy spaceship while repelling the other, one can create severely damaging shear effects in its hull. Another mode of destructive use of such beams is rapid alternating between pressing and pulling force in order to cause structural damage to the ship as well as inflicting lethal forces on its crew.

Two objects being brought together by a tractor beam are usually attracted toward their common center of gravity. This means that if a small spaceship applies a tractor beam to a large object such as a planet, the ship will be drawn toward the planet, rather than vice versa.

In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, tractor beams are imagined to work by placing a target in the focus of a subspace/graviton interference pattern created by two beams from an emitter. When the beams are manipulated correctly the target is drawn along with the interference pattern. The target may be moved toward or away from the emitter by changing the polarity of the beams. The range of the beam affects the maximum mass that the emitter can move, and the emitter subjects its anchoring structure to significant force.

===Literature===
* Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;As Easy as A.B.C.&quot; (1912) made use of the &quot;flying loop&quot;, generated by one of the airships of the Aerial Board of Control, when a woman tried, as a political statement, to publicly kill herself. The loop pulled the knife from her hand and, instead of drawing it toward the airship, flung it fifty yards away; it also continued to hold her arm rigid for a second or so afterward. John Brunner, in the foreword to a collection of Kipling&#x27;s science fiction, said this may be the first depiction of a tractor beam.
* E. E. Smith coined the term &quot;tractor beam&quot; (an update of his earlier &quot;attractor-beam&quot;) in his novel &quot;Spacehounds of IPC&quot;, originally serialized in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; magazine in 1931. The hero of his &quot;Skylark of Space&quot; books (1929 onwards) had invented &quot;attractor beams&quot; and &quot;repellor beams&quot;. Repellors can also be emitted isotropically as a defensive force field against material projectiles. The device also appears in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lensman&quot; books.
* In Philip Francis Nowlan&#x27;s Buck Rogers novel &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; (1928), the enemy airships used &quot;repellor beams&quot; for support and propulsion, similar to the &quot;eighth ray&quot; beams used for support and propulsion of Martian airships in the Barsoom/John Carter of Mars series (first published 1912–1943) by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
* &quot;Tom Swift&quot; – In the Tom Swift Jr. book &quot;Tom Swift and The Deep-Sea Hydrodome&quot; (1958), Tom invents the &quot;repellatron&quot;. The device can be set to repel specific chemical elements. It was used to create a bubble habitat on the ocean floor, and as the propulsion system for his spacecraft &quot;Challenger&quot;.
* The &quot;Sector General&quot; books by James White: The 1963 novel &quot;Star Surgeon&quot; is the source of the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon called the Rattler. The weapon attracts then repels the target (an entire ship or a segment of the ship&#x27;s hull) at 80 &quot;g&quot;s, several times a minute. The novel also featured a type of force field called a &quot;repulsion screen&quot;.
* &quot;The Trigger&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke involves the development of tractor beams in the early part of the novel.
* &quot;Sixth Column&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein describes tractor/pressor beams as a product of the physics of a &quot;newly-discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra&quot; featured in the novel.

===Comics===
* &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comic strip – originally just repulsor-beams; tractors appeared by the 1970s
* Iron Man&#x27;s various armor suits usually feature repulsor beam projectors mounted in the palms as one of the main weapon systems.

===Movies and television series===
* &quot;Star Trek&quot; (TV series, films, books and games). One of the most visible and iconic uses of the concept. One of the few prominent fictitious depictions which used such beams repeatedly and referred to them consistently as tractor beams.

<text>Wilhelm Johannsen (3 February 1857 – 11 November 1927) was a Danish pharmacist, botanist, plant physiologist, and geneticist. He is best known for coining the terms gene, phenotype and genotype, and for his 1903 &quot;pure line&quot; experiments in genetics.

==Biography==
Johannsen was born in Copenhagen. While very young, he was apprenticed to a pharmacist and worked in Denmark and Germany beginning in 1872 until passing his pharmacist&#x27;s exam in 1879. In 1881, he became assistant in the chemistry department at the Carlsberg Laboratory under the chemist Johan Kjeldahl. Johannsen studied the metabolism of dormancy and germination in seeds, tubers and buds. He showed that dormancy could be broken by various anesthetic compounds, such as diethyl ether and chloroform.

In 1892, he was appointed lecturer at Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and later became professor of botany and plant physiology. He taught plant physiology. His best-known research concerned so-called &quot;pure lines&quot; of the self-fertile common bean. He was able to show that even in populations homozygous for all traits, i.e. without genetic variation, seed size followed a normal distribution. This was attributable to resource provision to the mother plant and to the position of seeds in pods and of pods on the plant. This led him to coin the terms &quot;phenotype&quot; and &quot;genotype&quot;.

Johannsen&#x27;s findings led him to oppose contemporary Darwinists, most notably Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who held the occurrence of normal distributed trait variation in populations as proof of gradual genetic variation on which selection could act. Only with the modern synthesis, was it established that variation needed to be heritable to act as the raw material for selection.

He created the terms &quot;phenotype&quot; and &quot;genotype&quot;, first using them in his book in German as &quot;Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre&quot; (Elements of the exact theory of heredity). This book was based in large part on &quot;Om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier&quot; (&quot;On heredity in society and in pure lines&quot;) and in his book &quot;Arvelighedslærens Elementer&quot;. It was in this book Johannsen also introduced the term &quot;gene&quot;. This term was coined in opposition to the then common &quot;pangene&quot; that stemmed from Darwin&#x27;s theory of pangenesis. The book became one of the founding texts of genetics.

Also in 1905, Johannsen was appointed professor of plant physiology at the University of Copenhagen, becoming vice-chancellor in 1917. In December 1910, Johannsen was invited to give an address before the American Society of Naturalists. This talk was printed in the American Naturalist. In 1911, he was invited to give a series of four lectures at Columbia University.

Johannsen was a corresponding member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (elected 1915). He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1916.

<text>The Great Ziegfeld is a 1936 American musical drama film directed by Robert Z. Leonard and produced by Hunt Stromberg. It stars William Powell as the theatrical impresario Florenz &quot;Flo&quot; Ziegfeld Jr., Luise Rainer as Anna Held, and Myrna Loy as Billie Burke.

The film, shot at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in Culver City, California in the fall of 1935, is a fictionalized and sanitized tribute to Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. and a cinematic adaptation of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, with highly elaborate costumes, dances and sets. Many of the performers of the theatrical &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; were cast in the film as themselves, including Fanny Brice and Harriet Hoctor, and the real Billie Burke acted as a supervisor for the film. The &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; set alone was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US$ in dollars), featuring a towering rotating volute of diameter with 175 spiral steps, weighing 100 tons. The music to the film was provided by Walter Donaldson, Irving Berlin, and lyricist Harold Adamson, with choreographed scenes. The extravagant costumes were designed by Adrian, taking some 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to prepare them using of silver sequins and of white ostrich plumes. Over a thousand people were employed in the production of the film, which required 16 reels of film after the cutting.

One of the biggest successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was acclaimed as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture for producer Hunt Stromberg, Best Actress for Luise Rainer, and Best Dance Direction for Seymour Felix, and was nominated for four others.

MGM made two more &quot;Ziegfeld&quot; films: &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; (1941), starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr and Lana Turner, which recycled some footage from &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;; and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946) by Vincente Minnelli. In 1951, the studio produced a Technicolor remake of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which Ziegfeld had presented as a stage musical.

==Plot==
The son of a highly respected music professor, Florenz &quot;Flo&quot; Ziegfeld Jr. yearns to make his mark in show business. He begins by promoting Eugen Sandow, the &quot;world&#x27;s strongest man&quot;, at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, overcoming the competition of rival Jack Billings and his popular attraction, belly dancer Little Egypt, with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow&#x27;s muscles).

Ziegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the Chicago Musical College, and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.

Flo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star Anna Held. Despite losing all his money gambling at Monte Carlo, Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn&#x27;t know Billings. Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty. Ziegfeld promises to give her &quot;more publicity than she ever dreams of&quot; and to feature her alongside America&#x27;s most prominent theatrical performers.

At first, Anna&#x27;s performance at the Herald Square Theatre is not a success. However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill. The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her. Audience members comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success. Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying &quot;you were magnificent my wife&quot;, and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers.

However, one success is not enough for the showman. He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will &quot;glorify&quot; the American girl. The new show, the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies.

Ziegfeld tries to make a star out of Audrey Dane, who is plagued with alcoholism, and he lures Fanny Brice from vaudeville, showering both with lavish gifts. He gives stagehand Ray Bolger his break as well. Mary Lou, now a young woman, visits Ziegfeld, who doesn&#x27;t recognize her initially, and hires her as a dancer.

The new production upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo&#x27;s world does not revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey at the wrong moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings for a third time for the new show.

Flo meets the red-headed Broadway star Billie Burke and soon marries her. When she hears the news, a heartbroken Anna telephones Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named Patricia.

Flo&#x27;s new shows are a success, but after a while, the public&#x27;s taste changes, and people begin to wonder if the times have not passed him by. After a string of negative reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber&#x27;s shop saying that he&#x27;ll &quot;never produce another hit&quot;. Stung, he vows to have &quot;four&quot; hits on Broadway at the same time.

He achieves his goal, with the hits &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927), &quot;Rio Rita&quot; (1927), &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and invests over $1 million (US$ in dollars) of his earnings in the stock market. However, the stock market crash of 1929 bankrupts him, forcing Billie to return to the stage.

Shaken by the reversal of his financial fortunes and the growing popularity of movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of &quot;The Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the Ziegfeld Theatre, in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to have more steps, higher, higher&quot;, before dying in his chair.

==Production==
Ziegfeld&#x27;s widow, Billie Burke, was keen to pay off Ziegfeld&#x27;s debts without filing for bankruptcy, and sold the rights to a biopic of him to Universal Pictures in late 1933. As a result, the film went into the pre-production phase in January 1934. In the early stages of script development, Burke was listed as coauthor with Macguire. Macguire had initially proposed the biographical film to them in the form of a &quot;filmusical entertainment&quot; set in a &quot;theatrical tradition&quot; and William Powell was cast as Ziegfeld. However, by February 1935, Macguire had fallen into disagreement with Universal over financial problems at the studio, and the entire production, including some already constructed sets and musical arrangements, was sold to MGM for US$300,000 (US$ in dollars). As part of the deal however, Universal retained the services of Powell for the classic screwball comedy &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, which was released the same year as &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;.

The film was shot at MGM Studios in Culver City, California mostly in the latter half of 1935 under a budget of US$1,500,000 (US$ in dollars), produced by Hunt Stromberg. The cost exceeded US$2 million (US$ in dollars) by the end of the production in early 1936, exorbitant for the period, and it was MGM&#x27;s most expensive film to date after &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; (1925). The principal cinematography was shot by Oliver T. Marsh, and George J. Folsey and Karl Freund were brought in to shoot the Ziegfeld Roof numbers. Ray June shot the &quot;Melody&quot; number and Merritt B. Gerstad is credited for the Hoctor Ballet.

In the advertising for the film, MGM boasted of the film&#x27;s ostentatious nature, bragging that it was &quot;SO BIG that only MGM could handle it&quot;, with its &quot;countless beauties, trained lions, ponies, dogs and other animals&quot;. Busby Berkeley, who had led Warner Brothers to become the leading producer of musicals in Hollywood in the 1930s, was a major influence on the producers which had &quot;glamorous, excessive 1930s cinematic musical numbers&quot;. The film also came at a time when producers had begun seeing the economic and cultural importance of the cinematic medium in comparison to theater. &quot;Variety&quot; notes that the film producers were likely very concerned with the presentation of the film after production was wrapped up, and that the long length of the film at 176 minutes was understandable in that they probably &quot;wanted to preserve as much footage as possible&quot;. William S. Gray was responsible for the editing of the film. Over a thousand people were employed in the production, and &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; required 16 reels of film after the cutting.

By coincidence, Universal&#x27;s 1936 film version of the Ziegfeld musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, the most faithful of all the film versions of the stage production, was filmed at the same time as &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; and released in the same year.

===Screenplay===

The screenplay by William Anthony McGuire was a &quot;novelty&quot; to many audiences who were familiar with the theatrical Broadway shows of the follies. The script, although fictionalized with embellishments needed for the motion picture, did show some accuracies in the life of Ziegfeld. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the script: &quot;What William Anthony McGuire has attempted in his screen play, and with general success, is to encompass not merely the fantastic personal history of Ziegfeld but the cross-sectional story of the development of the Follies, the Midnight Frolic on the New Amsterdam Roof and the other theatrical enterprises floated under the Glorifier&#x27;s aegis during a span of about forty years. The two biographies—of the man and of his creations—are, naturally, inseparable; but both have been told with such wealth of detail and circumstance (real and imaginative) that even the three-hour film narrative is fragmentary and, in some places, confused.&quot;

Although it has some accuracies, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld&#x27;s life and the history of the &quot;Follies&quot;, resulting in many inaccuracies. The earlier scenes with Sandow, the milk bath advertising scenario, and many other sequences including several of the dramatic ups and downs of the film were fictional. George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; was never featured in the &quot;Follies&quot;, and the number &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; was written for the 1919 &quot;Follies&quot;, not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film. Ray Bolger was never cast in a &quot;Follies&quot; show, and although she was born in the U.S., Billie Burke grew up in England and spoke with a Mid-Atlantic accent throughout her life; Loy who portrays her clearly has an American accent in the film.

In the film, the last few lines of the song &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; (from &quot;Show Boat&quot;) are sung by what sounds like a tenor, while the song was intended for bass Paul Robeson and sung in the original production by bass-baritone Jules Bledsoe. Further, the screenplay also gives the impression that the successful original production of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the Great Depression. In fact &quot;Show Boat&quot; ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.

In real life, Ziegfeld did not die in his room at the Hotel Warwick (not mentioned) which stood in front of the Ziegfeld Theatre; he actually died in Los Angeles and had not even spent his last years in New York. However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld&#x27;s traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling. McGuire&#x27;s script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.

===Casting===
Initially, the main cast proposed for the film included Marilyn Miller, Gilda Gray, Ann Pennington, and Leon Errol. Featured in the film are William Powell as Ziegfeld, Myrna Loy as Billie Burke, Luise Rainer as Anna Held, Nat Pendleton as Eugen Sandow, and Frank Morgan. Powell admitted to being &quot;amazed&quot; with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering it to be a very important moment in his career. He said &quot;After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no &#x27;folks&#x27;, as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews. I felt for the first time in my acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him.&quot;

Many of the performers of the earlier Broadway version of the Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including Fanny Brice and Harriet Hoctor, the ballet dancer and contortionist. &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; marked Rainer&#x27;s second Hollywood film role after &quot;Escapade&quot; (also with Powell). Fanny Brice appears as a comedian in the abridged song sequence &quot;My Man&quot; and played an effective version of herself in addition to her routine comic role as the funny girl. 
Nat Pendleton, a freestyle wrestler who had won the silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and had appeared alongside Powell in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934), was cast as the circus strongman Eugen Sandow.
Billie Burke objected to her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) since she was also an actress under contract to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point she was not a big enough star to play herself in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke&#x27;s biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio&#x27;s refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.

Both Miller and Lillian Lorraine threatened legal action if their names were so much as mentioned in the film. Thus Miller&#x27;s character was renamed Sally Manners, and Lorraine&#x27;s character was renamed Audrey Dane (played by Virginia Bruce). In real life, Ziegfeld reportedly was obsessed with Miller, and was involved in numerous sex scandals. In 1922, Miller had given an interview in which she accused him of &quot;making love to chorus girls&quot; and sending her a diamond ring as &quot;big as her hand&quot;; this essence of Ziegfeld&#x27;s character is captured in the film. Incidentally, Miller died from toxicity complications after surgery just before the release of the film on April 7, 1936, which led one reviewer writing in &quot;Liberty&quot; to denounce an urban legend which had arisen surrounding the timing of her death, writing &quot;It&#x27;s not true that Marilyn Miller died of a broken heart at not getting the lead in this.&quot; Another myth surrounding her untimely death at the age of 37 is that she had contracted syphilis.

Frank Morgan, a stage and film character actor, played the role of promoter Billings in the film. Dennis Morgan, in an uncredited role, performs in &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; (dubbed by Allan Jones). Pat Ryan, the future Pat Nixon, wife of Richard Nixon and First Lady of the United States, was an extra in the film. Will Rogers was to appear in the film, but he was killed in a plane crash in August 1935. He was played by stand-in A.A. Trimble.

===Costumes===
The extravagant costumes, which even Ziegfeld initially considered too flamboyant, were designed by Adrian, who had worked with many of the greatest actresses of the period, including Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Jeanette MacDonald, Jean Harlow, Katharine Hepburn and Joan Crawford, and later designed for films such as &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938), &quot;The Women&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Howard Gutner documents that due to MGM&#x27;s wealth and the high budget, Adrian indulged in &quot;sheer lavishness&quot; in making the costumes, surpassing anything he had done previously. It took 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to sew the costumes that Adrian had designed for the film, using of silver sequins and of white ostrich plumes. The costumes worn by women in the film are diverse, varying from &quot;puffy hooped skirts to catlike leotards&quot; to &quot;layers of tulle and chiffron&quot;, with the men mostly wearing black tuxedos.

===Mise en scène and music===

Leonard, a film director who specialized in melodrama and musicals, anchored the music for the film, working with Walter Donaldson, Irving Berlin, and lyricist Harold Adamson. The extravagant dances and ensemble sequences were choreographed by Seymour Felix and Harold Adamson, including the song sequence of &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; (it was Irving Berlin&#x27;s 13th annual edition in 1919). The &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; set, known as the &quot;Wedding Cake&quot;, involved several weeks of shooting time and was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US$ in dollars). As many as 180 performers were involved in the scenes which included singers, dancers and musicians. The sequence starts with Stanley Morner (soon to be known as Dennis Morgan) alone in front of the curtain, apparently singing “A Pretty Girl…” Apparently because, although he was an excellent singer “the song had previously been recorded by Allan Jones, another M-G-M contract player, and the studio apparently decided not to re-record the number.” After he sings the entire first verse and refrain, the front curtain begins to pull away and the stage begins to rotate, revealing people in 18th century costumes. The chorus continues to sing as the stage rotates through excerpts from romantic musical history, eventually reaching “&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;” and an elaborate dance number. Then Morgan re-appears, standing among a crowd of pretty girls who are seated on the stairs. As he finishes the song, Virginia Bruce is revealed seated atop the tower, wearing a voluminous gown that spills over the edge. She faces front as the tower continues to turn. The camera pulls back to show the entire structure, and the satin curtain descends, enclosing each level in turn until the stage curtain closes.

The curtains, made of rayon silk, measured . Sheldon Hall and Stephen Neale note the theatrical sense that the cinematographers achieved through shooting the sequence in virtually a single take. They mention that &quot;the camera traverses an enormous platform set contained within a curtained proscenium (also enormous)&quot;, and that the &quot;set itself revolves to meet the camera, rather than the camera entering the space of the set.&quot; Linda Mizejewski, author of a book on the Ziegfeld girls, argues that the Pretty Girl sequence is more than just about being showy; it is symbolic of womanhood which &quot;powerfully visualizes women as the raw material for male aesthetic vision and design&quot;. In the film she believes that womanhood is defined by the &quot;young, white, blond and slender&quot; female, which in the sequence are &quot;delineated as the fluffy, artificial tiers of costuming and staging&quot;.
The Harriet Hoctor ballet music was scored by Con Conrad to lyrics written by Herb Magidson. The circus ballet was an adaptation from the old Ziegfeld stage shows. &quot;Variety&quot; called the Hoctor ballet &quot;in itself intricate with its maneuverings of six Russian wolfhounds in terp formations&quot;, and said that the &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; sequence in the film is a &quot;nifty Berlin tune [which] becomes the fulcrum for one of Frank Skinner&#x27;s best arrangements as Arthur Lange batons the crescendos into a mad, glittering potpourri of Saint-Saëns and Gershwin, Strauss and Verdi, beautifully blended against the Berlinesque background. It&#x27;s a scenic flash which makes the auditor wonder &#x27;What can they do to follow that?&#x27; meaning in this or future film production.&quot; Juan Antonio Ramírez refers to the wedding cake as a &quot;famous spiral column&quot;, citing it as one of the best known pieces of mobile architecture in film, but notes that in design the cake was not exclusive to &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, explaining that a wedding cake, albeit less flamboyant, had appeared in previous films such as &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930), &quot;The Kid from Spain&quot; (1932), &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), and &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936). Ramírez describes the film&#x27;s &quot;Mise en scène&quot; as representing &quot;the last word in flashy vulgarity, Surrealist kitsch, or perhaps both at once&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Farida Mazar filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers shortly before her death, claiming that they &quot;presented Little Egypt as a lewd character&quot;. 14 witnesses who had seen the act at the 1893 Chicago World Fair supported this, although the lawsuit was dropped after Mahzar died from a heart attack. Burke caused much controversy and upset among many of Ziegfeld&#x27;s friends and colleagues when she sold the rights to a production on Broadway, the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, also starring Fanny Brice, at the time the film was released in 1936, due to the fact that the show was produced by the Shubert brothers, whom Ziegfeld detested. Worse still for his associates, was that the show was a bigger success than Ziegfeld&#x27;s last production of the Follies in 1931. The &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; under Vincente Minnelli initially was performed in December 1935 before making its Broadway debut on January 30, 1936. It was performed in Boston and Philadelphia until the production was postponed after Brice collapsed on stage with exhaustion. When it reopened on Broadway in September 1936, five months after the release of the film, it was retitled &quot;The New Ziegfeld Follies of 1936–1937&quot;, and was revamped considerably, with changes to the show&#x27;s humor.

In 1941, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced a sequel titled &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot;, starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner, which recycled some film from &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. In 1946, MGM made another sequel, &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, directed by Vincente Minnelli, director of the stage show.

==Reception==

===Box office===
According to MGM records, the film earned a then-massive $3,089,000 in the US and Canada and $1,584,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $822,000.

It was the 5th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36.

===Critical response at the time of release===
The film, which premiered in Los Angeles at the Carthay Circle Theatre, was the first musical film in history for which one of its cast members won an Academy Award. Luise Rainer received the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Anna Held, Ziegfeld&#x27;s first wife. The film, the pride of MGM at a time when Warner Brothers and RKO Pictures were the leading studios in Hollywood for musical production, was a major commercial and critical success and one of the most successful films of the 1930s, grossing US$4,673,000 (US$ in dollars) worldwide at the box office. It was acclaimed upon release as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. At just over three hours, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; was also the longest talking film of the time. (D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Intolerance&quot;, both silent films, had each run over three hours.) TCM has acclaimed the &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; sequence as one of &quot;the most famous musical numbers ever filmed&quot;. Thomas S. Hischak has said that the film has rarely been topped for pure showmanship and glamor, and &quot;Variety&quot; considered it an &quot;outstanding picture&quot;, a &quot;symbol of a tradition of show business&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the performances of the cast, remarking that as Ziegfeld, William Powell &quot;endows the impersonation with all the qualities of a great entrepreneur and sentimentalist without sacrificing the shades and moods called for&quot; and noting that Luise Rainer is &quot;tops of the femmes with her vivacious Anna Held&quot;. Stanley Green cited &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; as &quot;the first of a number of elaborate show-business screen biographies&quot;. Otis Ferguson, writing for &quot;New Republic&quot; magazine, remarked that the &quot;musical numbers seem as irresistible as Ziegfeld himself&quot;. The &quot;New York American&quot; said that the film is &quot;pretty nearly everything such an extravaganza should be&quot;, with &quot;romance and reality, song and dance, gaiety and beauty, pathos and bathos&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; qualified it as &quot;Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment.&quot; A reviewer for the &quot;Spokane Chronicle&quot; praised the film for its superb acting, writing that &quot;[even] the great producer [Ziegfeld] would have been unable to produce scenes of magnitude and splendor that are given as part of the picture telling his life.&quot; Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also highly praising of the film, noting that it had &quot;more stars than there are in the heavens&quot; and remarking that &quot;the picture achieves its best moments in the larger sequences devoted to the Girls — ballet, chorus and show. At least one of these spectacular numbers, filmed to the music of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &#x27;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&#x27;, with overtones of &#x27;Rhapsody in Blue&#x27;, never has been equaled on the musical comedy stage or screen.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;the most lavish display the screen has had to offer&quot; with chorus numbers that were &quot;gigantic and effective&quot;, though he found the romance to be &quot;peculiarly average screen-story stuff.&quot; Both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Film Daily&quot; rated the film in the &quot;Ten Best&quot; of the year.

However, not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film; Graham Greene of the British &quot;Spectator&quot; called it a &quot;huge inflated gas-blown object&quot; and criticized its length, comparing it to the feat of a flagpole sitter. A number of critics, although praising the film in general, felt that Myrna Loy, who appears rather late on in the film, gave a lackluster performance as Billie Burke. Nugent said that &quot;Miss Loy is a stately Bille Burke, and somewhat lacking, we fear, in Miss Burke&#x27;s effervescence and gaiety&quot;, and Cecilia Agner thought she came across as &quot;stilted, like her rigidly waxed and set blonde wig&quot;. Harrison Carroll of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot;, however, sympathized with the difficulty of her role in portraying a prominent living actress, confessing that he was pleased that Loy did not attempt to imitate Burke&#x27;s mannerisms. Emily W. Leider believes that any of her character flaws were due to a &quot;mushy&quot; script, rather than her performance as an actress.

===Critical re-evaluation===
Although the film is still viewed as a symbol of glamour and excess during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the film&#x27;s contemporary reception is mixed. Since its release, the film has been criticized in particular for its reliance on extravagance, being unnecessarily lengthy, and its overacting (particularly by Rainer). Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 71% approval rating based on 70 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;This biopic is undeniably stylish, but loses points for excessive length, an overreliance on clichés, and historical inaccuracies&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Christopher Null stated that &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; is a &quot;textbook case of how a film can lose its appeal over the years&quot;. The film is occasionally cited as a &quot;prime example of the Academy&#x27;s fallibility&quot; in a year when other critically acclaimed pictures such as &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; were released, which some argue was more deserving of Best Picture.

Emily W. Leider claims the film to be &quot;more remarkable for its &quot;legs and tinsel&quot; extravagance than for its excellence.&quot; David Parkinson of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five stars and concluded that it &quot;Drags in places and doesn&#x27;t even try for a true-to-life portrait of the great theatre entrepreneur but it&#x27;s shiny and big spectacle with impressive choreography.&quot;

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called it &quot;amazingly dull, even with William Powell in the lead and guest appearances by the likes of Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice.&quot; Emanuel Levy gave it a C grade and stated that it was &quot;overlong and overblown but ultimately mediocre as a musical movie and as a biopic of the legendary showman.&quot;

James Berardinelli awarded it two and a half out of four stars, stating that &quot;although some of the production&#x27;s technical aspects remain impressive, the dramatic elements come across as trite and many of the musical numbers are dated&quot;, but said that it was a &quot;reasonably competent – albeit &quot;airbrushed&quot; – presentation of the main character&#x27;s life.&quot;

===Accolades===
The seven Academy Award nominations were announced on February 7, 1937, and on March 4, 1937, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; won three Oscars at the 9th Academy Awards for 1936:

Although he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, Powell did receive the Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild award for Best Actor in a tie with C. Aubrey Smith who was in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. In addition, the Guild&#x27;s Best Actress was given to Luise Rainer.

<text>Erotic spanking is the act of spanking another person for the sexual arousal or gratification of either or both parties. The intensity of the act can vary in both its duration and severity, and may include the use of one or more spanking implements (such as the wooden spoon or cane). Activities range from a spontaneous smack on bare buttocks during sexual activity to sexual roleplaying, such as ageplay or domestic discipline. Erotic spanking is often found within and associated with BDSM, but the activity is not exclusive to it. The term &quot;spankee&quot; is commonly used within erotic spanking to refer to the individual receiving a spanking.

== History ==
=== Pre 19th century ===
One of the earliest depictions of erotic spanking is found in the Etruscan Tomb of the Whipping from the fifth century BC.

Early sex manuals such as the Indian &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; (circa 400 BC), Indian &quot;Koka Shastra&quot; (ca. 1150 AD) and Arabic &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; (ca. 1400 AD) have among their recommendations the use of spanking to enhance sexual arousal.

=== 19th century ===
An increase in interest in erotic spanking can be observed during the 19th century in the form of spanking literature and spanking photography, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. Numerous limited edition spanking novels were published, many of which are now classified as novellas.

=== Early 20th century ===

This interest for spanking (both in regards to literature and photography) followed into the next century, with the early 20th century being considered the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of spanking literature. This period of spanking literature is marked by three notable characteristics. First, greater audiences were reached with the availability of less expensive editions and greater print runs. Second, many of the spanking novels contained numerous illustrations (many of which have fallen under public domain and are easily available online). Third, this period saw a gradual increase in the output and publication of spanking literature, growing particularly within the 1920s and peaking within the 1930s. Much of the output of spanking literature during this period was by French publishers, writers and illustrators. For example, Jules Malteste, known as Louis Malteste (1862–1928) was a French writer, painter, engraver, lithographer, draughtsman, and illustrator, commonly known for his depictions of spanking. Similarly, within the context of spanking photography, France was also the home to the creation of much content, with the most notable studios being the Biederer Studio and the related Ostra Studio. This &quot;Golden Age&quot; of spanking literature (and French spanking photography) came to an end as a result of the Second World War, more specifically due to the German occupation of France between 1940 and 1944 and later the enforcement of censorship laws. A somewhat notable exception to the decline of spanking literature during this period was John Willie&#x27;s bondage &quot;Bizarre&quot; magazine (published between 1946 and 1959).
Of the many French works from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; few at the time were translated into other languages within which spanking literature was popular, namely English and German, but beginning during the mid-1960s a number of these French works were translated into English and published, along with these works being republished in French and older British works also being republished. The occurrence of this was facilitated by the availability of mass-produced paperbacks and changes in censorship laws.

=== Late 20th century ===
During the latter half of the 20th century changes in both censorship laws and improvements within technology enabled greater accessibility for those interested in obtaining content related to erotic spanking.

As an extension of the earlier developments within spanking literature and photography, during this period various fetish magazines devoted to stories and imagery of erotic spanking became legally available.

This period also saw an important development in both the production and consumer accessibility of erotic spanking films. Whilst recordings of erotic spanking had been produced as early as the 1920s, until the 1980s technology limited the quality of their recording and the ability for consumers to easily watch them. In addition to changes in censorship laws, the introduction of the videocassette recorder enabled creators to produce and distribute erotic spanking films that were far easier for consumers to both obtain and watch.

=== 21st century ===
The proliferation of the internet has enabled individuals, of various level of pre-existing interest and/or knowledge, more ease then ever to explore and consume content relating to erotic spanking.

Partially developing from earlier erotic spanking magazine and video producers, numerous pornographic websites (primary American or British based) within the 21st century are devoted to producing spanking films of various lengths and about various scenarios.

The internet has also resulted in the creation of various blogs which discuss the topic of erotic spanking and non-profit websites which publish erotic spanking stories.

== Practice ==
=== Implements ===
Whilst a spanking may be simply given with the palm of the hand, the use of spanking implements is common within erotic spanking. Spanking implements which are commonly used within erotic spanking are a reflection of the traditional spanking implements that were/are used in corporal punishment more broadly. Common and traditional spanking implements include those which have been specifically manufactured for such purpose (i.e. the cane, spanking paddle, strap, tawse, and martinet) and those which have been adapted/improvised from available items (such as the slipper, wooden spoon, hairbrush, bath brush, carpet beater, riding crop, switch and birch). Other less common and atypical spanking implements include the (handle of a) feather duster (common, however, in China), fly swatter, ruler, and stinging nettles.

Some spanking implements can be characterised as being either &#x27;stingy&#x27; or &#x27;thuddy&#x27;. Stingy implements (such as a cane) produce a sharp and quick burning sensation which is mostly felt on the skin. Thuddy implements (such as a paddle), in contrast, whilst not producing a stinging sensation penetrate deeper into tissue of the buttocks. As a general rule, the heavier a spanking implement is the greater thud it will produce. A person receiving an erotic spanking may have a preference for either a stingy or thuddy sensation.

=== Safety ===
For safety, during a spanking, particularly with spanking implements, care should be taken to avoid striking the tailbone and hipbones.

=== Apparatuses ===
Erotic spanking can include the use of apparatuses, both those which are adapted/improvised and those which are specifically created for such use.

The use of adapted/improvised apparatuses within erotic spanking derives from how such apparatuses were used in non-erotic spanking. The gymnastic vaulting-buck (which sees the receiver of the spanking bent-over it) was often employed during non-erotic school slipperings and canings; consequently erotic spanking, particularly that which involves school roleplay, may incorporate use of a vaulting-buck.

A spanking bench or spanking horse is a piece of erotic furniture explicitly created for erotic spanking. It is used to position a &quot;spankee&quot; on, with or without restraints. They come in many sizes and styles, the most popular design of which is similar to a sawhorse (used in woodworking) with a padded top and rings for restraints. The 19th-century British dominatrix Mrs. Theresa Berkley became famous for her invention of the Berkley Horse, a similar form of BDSM apparatus.

=== Fetish wear ===
Often erotic spanking will be combined with sexual roleplay which may see one or more parties dress-up in certain clothing, for example a female &quot;spankee&quot; wearing a schoolgirl uniform in a Teacher – Student scenario.
A spank skirt or spanking skirt is a skirt that has an additional opening in back designed to expose the buttocks. While the name &quot;spank skirt&quot; suggests the intention that the wearer be spanked without removing or repositioning the skirt, this item may be worn for reasons other than spanking (for instance, exhibitionism.) Considered fetish wear, these kind of skirts are typically tight-fitting and made of fetishistic materials (such as leather, PVC or latex). Regardless of the gender of the wearer, spank skirts are usually considered female attire. The male gender role equivalent might be motorcycle chaps (a.k.a. &quot;assless chaps&quot;).

=== Self-spanking ===
Self-spanking is the practice in which the individual spanks themselves, thus making the spankee and the spanker one and the same. This can occur for a number of reasons: the individual is experimenting with spanking; the individual may lack someone (who is willing and the spankee is comfortable with doing so) to give them a spanking; the individual spanks themselves during masturbation; the individual is a submissive in a BDSM relationship and is self-spanking on orders of the dominant partner.

== Psychology and prevalence ==
A number of explanations have been put forward to account why an individual may enjoy erotic spanking, although there is almost certainly no universal explanation. Interest and gratification in spanking varies per the individual: an individual may gain gratification in spanking another and gain no gratification in being spanked themself; an individual may gain gratification in being spanked and gain no gratification in spanking another; an individual may gain gratification in both spanking another and being spanked themself.

A scientific survey of 152 people who claimed to practice sadomasochism — of which spanking is a subset — categorised the origin of such interest to be either extrinsic (i.e. the interest originating from a source external to the person) or intrinsic (i.e. emerged naturally). 22% of those surveyed reported origins that were categorised by researchers as extrinsic, such as parental discipline or being introduced to sadomasochism in adulthood by another. In contrast, 78% reported intrinsically having such an interest. Most commonly an intrinsic interest was reported to have emerged in either childhood or adolescence (though at such age the interest was not necessarily sexualised); a small sub-group reported that only in adulthood did they accept or acknowledge what they now recognise to be an intrinsic interest. The majority of those that reported an intrinsic interest were unable to explain the origin of such interest.

From the same scientific survey as above, a third of testimonies reported enjoying receiving pain as to why they practiced sadomasochism; researchers noted that practitioners commonly stressed the difference between &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; pain. Interpersonal power (either through giving or exchanging power) was also a commonly reported reason as to why people practice sadomasochism, and researchers noted that this taking place with a trusted partner was a recurring specified need.

Journalist Jillian Keenan has argued that spanking fetishism is a form of sexual orientation, which should not be considered a mental illness. Whilst there has been an increasing ability to talk openly about erotic spanking within mainstream society, individuals may still find it difficult to express that they have an interest in erotic spanking.

<doc id="44441" wikidata="Q75207" url="?curid=44441" title="Pax Romana">
<text>The  (Latin for ) is a roughly 200+-year-long period of Roman history which is identified as a golden age of increased and sustained Roman imperialism, relative peace and order, prosperous stability, hegemonic power, and regional expansion. This is despite several revolts and wars, and continuing competition with Parthia. It is traditionally dated as commencing with the accession of Augustus, founder of the Roman principate, in 27 BC and concluding in AD 180 with the death of Marcus Aurelius, the last of the &quot;Five Good Emperors&quot;. 

During this period of about two centuries, the Roman Empire achieved its greatest territorial extent in AD 117 (Emperor Trajan), and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people, which was around 33% of the world&#x27;s population. According to Cassius Dio, the dictatorial reign of Commodus, later followed by the Year of the Five Emperors and the Crisis of the Third Century, marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust&quot;.

==Overview==
The Pax Romana, spanning from 27 BC to 180 AD, stands as one of the most enduring periods of peace in the annals of civilization. However, Walter Goffart wrote: &quot;The volume of the &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot; for the years AD 70–192 is called &#x27;The Imperial Peace&#x27;, but peace is not what one finds in its pages&quot;. Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the Roman Republic in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: &quot;Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous &#x27;Roman Peace&#x27; in the Mediterranean, are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: Sicily after 210 [BC], the Italian Peninsula after 200 [BC]; the Po Valley after 190 [BC]; most of the Iberian Peninsula after 133 [BC]; North Africa after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the Greek East.&quot;

The first known record of the term &quot;Pax Romana&quot; appears in a writing by Seneca the Younger in AD 55. The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. Arnaldo Momigliano noted that &quot;&quot;Pax Romana&quot; is a simple formula for propaganda, but a difficult subject for research.&quot;

The Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC and became Roman emperor. He became princeps, or &quot;first citizen&quot;. Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a junta of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of civil war. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in Hispania and in the Alps. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the Gates of Janus (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times, first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but Inez Scott Ryberg (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the Ara Pacis. At the time of the Ludi Saeculares in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicized, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and Agrippa jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.

Augustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the Romans, who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years. Romans regarded peace not as an absence of war, but as a rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist. Augustus&#x27; challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. Subsequent emperors followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.

After Augustus&#x27; death in AD 14, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics. The last five emperors of the Pax Romana are known as the &quot;Five Good Emperors&quot;.

==Influence on trade==

Roman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana. Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices. Romans benefited from large profits, and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.

As the Pax Romana of the western world by Rome was largely contemporaneous to the Pax Sinica of the eastern world by Han China, long-distance travel and trade in Eurasian history was significantly stimulated during these eras.

==Pax imperia: analogous peaces==

The prominence of the concept of the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; led to historians coining variants of the term to describe other systems of relative peace that have been established, attempted, or argued to have existed. Some variants include:
* Pax Americana
* Pax Assyriaca
* Pax Atomica
* Pax Britannica
* Pax Europaea
* Pax Guptana
* Pax Hispanica
* Pax Khazarica
* Pax Kushana
* Pax Mafiosa (Pax Narcotica)
* Pax Mongolica
* Pax Ottomana
* Pax Porfiriana
* Pax Sinica
* Pax Sovietica
* Pax Syriana
* Pax Tokugawana

More generically, the concept has been referred to as &quot;pax imperia&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;pax imperium&quot;), meaning &quot;imperial peace&quot;, or—less literally—&quot;hegemonic peace&quot;. Raymond Aron notes that imperial peace—peace achieved through hegemony can—sometimes, but not always— become civil peace. As an example, the German Empire&#x27;s imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like Saxony) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire dissolved because the Greek city states maintained their political identity. Aron notes that during the Pax Romana, the First Jewish–Roman War was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, &quot;In other words, &quot;imperial peace&quot; becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state.&quot;

The concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and there were attempts to imitate it in the Byzantine Empire, and in the Christian West, where it morphed into the Peace and Truce of God (&quot;pax Dei&quot; and &quot;treuga Dei&quot;). A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was Dante Aligheri. Dante&#x27;s works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by William Mitchell Ramsay in the book &quot;The Imperial Peace: An Ideal in European History&quot; (1913).

<doc id="44442" wikidata="Q236875" url="?curid=44442" title="Thora Birch">
<text>Thora Birch (born March 11, 1982) is an American actress, producer, and director. She made her feature film debut with a starring role in &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; (1988), for which she won a Young Artist Award for &quot;Best Actress Under Nine Years of Age&quot;. Birch rose to prominence as a child star during the 1990s through a string of parts in films, including &quot;Paradise&quot; (1991), &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992), &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993), &quot;Monkey Trouble&quot; (1994), &quot;Now and Then&quot; (1995), and &quot;Alaska&quot; (1996). Her breakthrough into adult-oriented roles came with her portrayal of Jane Burnham in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), for which she was nominated for that year&#x27;s BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.

Birch received further acclaim—and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress—for starring as Enid Coleslaw in the cult hit &quot;Ghost World&quot; (2001), and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work in the 2003 television film &quot;Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story&quot;. Her other film credits during the 2000s included &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2000), &quot;The Hole&quot; (2001), &quot;Silver City&quot; (2004), and &quot;Dark Corners&quot; (2006). Birch took a break from acting after producing and starring in the film &quot;Petunia&quot; (2012). She returned in 2016 and has since appeared in various independent films, such as &quot;The Last Black Man in San Francisco&quot; (2019). From 2019 to 2020, she played Mary (aka &quot;Gamma&quot;) in the tenth season of the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

In 2022, Birch made her directorial debut with the Lifetime television film &quot;The Gabby Petito Story&quot;. She will make her directorial debut film with an adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;Mr. Paradise&quot;, making her the first woman to direct an adaptation of Leonard&#x27;s writings.

== Early life ==
Birch was born in Los Angeles, California, to Jack Birch and Carol Connors, ex-pornographic film actors who both appeared in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. She is of German-Jewish, Scandinavian, French-Canadian and Italian ancestry. Her forename is derived from that of Norse god of thunder and lightning, &quot;Thor&quot;, which would have been her name if she had been born a boy. She has a younger brother, Bolt Birch.

Because of their own experience with the entertainment industry, Birch&#x27;s parents were reluctant to encourage her to act, but were persuaded to show Birch&#x27;s photograph to talent agents by a babysitter who noticed her imitating commercials. Birch got her first big break at the age of four, when the babysitter accompanied her to a successful audition for a Quaker Oats commercial.

== Career ==
=== 1988–1998: Television work and film breakthrough ===
Birch appeared in commercials in the late 1980s for Burger King, California Raisins, Quaker Oats, and Vlasic Pickles. She made her film debut as Molly Johnson in the 1988 science fiction comedy &quot;Purple People Eater&quot;, for which she received a Young Artist Award in the category of &quot;Best Young Actress Under Nine Years of Age&quot;. That same year, she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;, and was cast in the regular role of Molly on the NBC sitcom &quot;Day By Day&quot;. The show ran for two seasons and earned Birch a further two Young Artist nominations.

In 1990, Birch was cast in a principal role on &quot;Parenthood&quot;, a sitcom based on the 1989 film of the same name, which ran for a single season on NBC. Birch co-starred as Billie Pike in the 1991 drama &quot;Paradise&quot;, with Roger Ebert commenting in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that Birch played the role with &quot;strong, simple charm&quot;. She appeared in the festive comedy &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; that same year, playing a girl who schemes to reunite her divorced parents. The film was a moderate financial success, but found an audience on television and home video in subsequent years. She then co-starred as the daughter of Jack Ryan in the spy thriller &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992), a commercial success which grossed US$178 million at the worldwide box office.

At age 11, Birch starred in the Halloween-set fantasy film &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993), playing Dani Dennison, the younger sister of a teenage boy who inadvertently resurrects a trio of witches. Making US$39 million in the U.S. (against a budget of US$28 million), &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; was not considered a financial success, but quickly developed a sizeable cult following due to strong home video sales and television re-runs. &quot;I think the most surreal thing is that it keeps getting more popular instead of the other way around&quot;, Birch later said, while admitting the experience was &quot;the most amount of fun I&#x27;ve ever had on a set&quot;.

In the 1994 comedy &quot;Monkey Trouble&quot;, Birch portrayed a girl who befriends a Capuchin monkey. In a positive review for the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, Marjorie Baumgarten observed that Birch&#x27;s &quot;nuanced performance (a rarity amongst child performers) no doubt lends &quot;Monkey Trouble&quot; its realistic touch&quot;. That same year, she reprised her &quot;Patriot Games&quot; role in its sequel, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, which grossed over US$215 million globally. She was then cast as &quot;Teeny&quot; Tercell in the 1995 coming-of-age drama &quot;Now and Then&quot;. The film was largely dismissed by critics upon release, but has since been recognised as a milestone of its genre. Next, Birch headlined the adventure film &quot;Alaska&quot; (1996), playing one of two siblings who cross the Alaskan wilderness in search of their lost father. The &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; found it to be a &quot;decent kids&#x27; adventure movie&quot; with an &quot;impeccable&quot; performance by Birch. For the next two years, she did not appear on film but guest-starred in episodes of &quot;Promised Land&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

===1999–2003: Transition to adult roles ===

Birch appeared in several projects in 1999: firstly, the made-for-television film &quot;Night Ride Home&quot;, where she played a teenager grieving the loss of her older brother. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, David Kronke called it &quot;a thoughtful and sensitive examination of how a family copes with grief&quot;, and said of the performances, &quot;De Mornay … digs deep and comes up with a character that seems true; Burstyn and Birch competently complement [her]&quot;. Next, she played the small, uncredited role of Mary in &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot;.

Birch&#x27;s portrayal of insecure teenager Jane Burnham in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, Sam Mendes&#x27; dark dramedy about the struggles of a middle class household, was roundly praised by critics, with Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writing that she with grown-up radiance&quot;. The performance earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress, while the film was the recipient of the 1999 Academy Award for Best Picture and grossed over US$356 million worldwide, emerging as the biggest commercial success of Birch&#x27;s career to date. She later said of the experience, &quot;There was a lot of therapy involved … A lot of opening up and sharing things from our own lives about why we related to these characters. Everybody brought a lot of themselves to it. I know Annette did a lot of research about women becoming obsessed with the self-help realm. Kevin was working out obsessively and already in the headspace of [his character] Lester, even in rehearsals. And then there was Wes, Mena and I, who were these kids just incredibly excited to be there and watching [these] masters at their craft — just trying to absorb as much as we could from them&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;American Beauty&quot;, Birch appeared in two films released in 2000: low-budget drama &quot;The Smokers&quot;, in which Birch was called &quot;a scene-stealer&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, a poorly-received adaptation of the fantasy role-playing game of the same name. British horror film &quot;The Hole&quot; came next, where she starred as Elizabeth Dunn, a devious schoolgirl who lures her friends into an underground bunker. In a mixed review for &quot;Variety&quot;, Derek Elley stated that Birch gave &quot;an effectively creepy lead [performance]&quot;, but called the film &quot;clunky&quot; in its &quot;attempt to merge the psychothriller and teen movie genres&quot;.

Birch&#x27;s next project was the satirical 2001 comedy &quot;Ghost World&quot;, directed by Terry Zwigoff. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, the film was released to an enthusiastic critical reception and developed a loyal cult following. James Berardinelli found Birch&#x27;s part to be her &quot;first effectively developed role&quot; since &quot;American Beauty&quot;, commending the actress for the &quot;quirkiness [and the] underlying sense of melancholy and ennui&quot; in her portrayal of Enid Coleslaw. Meanwhile, A. O. Scott said in his appraisal for &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

Birch received various accolades for &quot;Ghost World&quot;, including a nomination for the 2002 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.

In 2003, she appeared as the title character in the biographical television film &quot;Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story&quot;, starring as a young woman who, after becoming homeless at 15 amid personal tragedies, decides to finish her schooling. Birch&#x27;s performance earned her a nomination for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress that year.

===2004–2012: Independent films ===

Birch played a supporting role in &quot;Silver City&quot;, a political satire directed by John Sayles, which premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The independent feature received mixed reviews, but &quot;Empire&quot; Angie Errigo thought Birch&#x27;s portrayal of whistleblower Karen Cross was &quot;terrific&quot;. She co-starred in the crime drama &quot;Slingshot&quot; the following year.

In &quot;Dark Corners&quot; (2006), a psychological horror-thriller about a young woman who wakes up one day as a different person, Birch starred in the dual role of Susan Hamilton and Karen Clarke. The film received a mixed reception, with Adam DiLeo of &quot;IGN&quot; praising its surreal, David Lynch-style elements, but criticizing Birch&#x27;s performance. She followed this with roles in two more genre films: &quot;Train&quot;—a loose remake of the 1980 slasher film &quot;Terror Train&quot;, released in 2008—and the psychological thriller &quot;Deadline&quot;, in which she co-starred with Brittany Murphy, who died shortly after the film&#x27;s release in December 2009. Birch later revealed she had been concerned about Murphy&#x27;s wellbeing during filming.

In the true crime drama &quot;Winter of Frozen Dreams&quot; (2009), Birch played Barbara Hoffman, a Wisconsin prostitute convicted of murder in the first-ever televised murder trial. In a review for &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot;, John Marrone described Birch&#x27;s &quot;alluring&quot; performance as the highlight of the film. Next, she took on the role of journalist Sidney Bloom in &quot;The Pregnancy Pact&quot;, a Lifetime movie based on the true story of a group of high schoolers in Gloucester, Massachusetts, who plotted to get pregnant at the same time and raise their children communally. The film was watched by 5.9 million viewers when it premiered in January 2010. Later that year, Birch was cast—in what would have been her stage debut—as Lucy in the off-Broadway revival of Hamilton Deane&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, but was subsequently dismissed from the production for the alleged behavior of her father—her manager at the time—who was reported to have physically threatened one of the show&#x27;s cast members during a rehearsal.

Birch played the role of Vivian in &quot;Petunia&quot; (2012), an independent dramedy depicting the lives and romantic relationships of a dysfunctional New York family. Birch, who is credited as one of its producers, described the &quot;intimate [and] honest&quot; feature as &quot;a little bit different&quot;. Given a small theatrical release in the U.S., the film garnered mixed reviews, though Birch and the rest of the ensemble were praised.

===2013–present: Break from acting and subsequent return===

After devoting herself to academic pursuits, which included securing a degree in legal studies through Kaplan University, Birch returned to acting in 2015 with a recurring role as software engineer Morgan on the first season of USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Colony&quot;. It was later revealed that Birch would not return for the second season because of a scheduling conflict, and that the part had been recast.

Birch starred as a left-wing activist in the 2018 political thriller &quot;Affairs of State&quot;, which Noel Murray of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;refreshingly smart&quot;. In a less favorable review for &quot;Forbes&quot;, Luke Y. Thompson wrote, &quot;[cinematographer] Horacio Marquinez gamely films everything like it&#x27;s an art movie, though there&#x27;s one scene in which he shoots Birch so unflatteringly that you wonder what she must have done to make him mad&quot;. She headlined and co-produced &quot;The Competition&quot; that same year, an independent romantic comedy.

Next, Birch starred in the 2018 drama &quot;The Etruscan Smile&quot;—an adaptation of José Luis Sampedro&#x27;s novel—which was filmed in Scotland and received strong reviews. The following year, she played a supporting role in the crime thriller &quot;Above Suspicion&quot;, which—after &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; in the 1990s—marked her third collaboration with director Phillip Noyce. In a positive review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw commented, &quot;There&#x27;s an interesting cameo from Thora Birch [as the] long-suffering Jolene&quot;.

Birch&#x27;s cameo appearance in &quot;The Last Black Man in San Francisco&quot; (2019), a drama about a young man&#x27;s pursuit to reclaim the Victorian home built by his grandfather, was considered a crucial part of the film&#x27;s success. Speaking of her casting and the symbolic nature of the part, director Joe Talbot said:

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019, where it won awards for Best Directing and a Special Jury Prize for Creative Collaboration. It was released theatrically in the U.S. by A24.

Between 2019–2020, Birch appeared in the role of Mary (aka &quot;Gamma&quot;) on the tenth season of AMC&#x27;s post-apocalyptic horror series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, with &quot;Collider&quot; commenting that she brought &quot;emotional depth&quot; to the part. Birch called the experience &quot;a fun, massive thing to have been a part of&quot;. Next, in the independent drama &quot;13 Minutes&quot; (2021), she played a single mother struggling to keep her family together in the wake of a destructive tornado. Rex Reed of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; felt that the film succeeded on the strength of its &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;likable&quot; ensemble, singling out Birch as a highlight.

Birch made her directorial debut in 2022 with &quot;The Gabby Petito Story&quot;, a Lifetime television movie in which she also co-starred. The film is based on the 2021 disappearance of Petito, a 22-year-old who was murdered by her boyfriend during a cross-country drive. Birch said she had been wanting to direct since she was &quot;nine or ten years old&quot; and that it was the subject matter which drew her to the project: &quot;There&#x27;s an element of abusive relationships in this story that I think so many of us can relate to … [it] captured the entire nation&#x27;s attention in the middle of Covid … Everyone stopped and took a minute and [said] &quot;Where’s Gabby? What happened to Gabby?&quot; That kind of fascination and focus point was something that I thought was a third character in [the] story&quot;. The ethical nature of dramatizing such recent events was met with public criticism, especially as the film—which premiered on October 12, 2022, just over one year after Petito&#x27;s death—was made without the involvement of the Petito family.

Also in 2022, Birch played Audrey Beach in the ten-part fictional podcast &quot;Overleaper&quot;, an espionage-style thriller about a female soldier embarking on a top-secret mission. Birch said it was the idea of &quot;a return to the old radio dramas … from the [1920s and &#x27;30s]&quot;, as well as the luxury of acting with her voice and not having to endure &quot;the harsh physical positions that the character is in&quot;, which drew her to the project.

It was announced at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival that Birch&#x27;s next project as director—her feature debut—will be an adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;Mr. Paradise&quot;, making her the first woman to direct a Leonard adaptation.

== Personal life ==

Birch married talent manager and philanthropist Michael Benton Adler on December 21, 2018. Birch is a long-time Democrat who was a delegate at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She has supported Joe Biden and local political efforts, such as Congressman Wiley Nickel&#x27;s campaign.

<text>Anti-capitalism is a political ideology and movement encompassing a variety of attitudes and ideas that oppose capitalism. In this sense, anti-capitalists are those who wish to replace capitalism with another type of economic system, such as socialism or communism.

== History of movements ==
Anti-capitalism was widespread among workers in the United States in the 1900s and 1910s, and Colorado was especially known as a center of anti-capitalist labor movements in that era.

== Socialism ==
Socialism advocates public or direct worker ownership and administration of the means of production and allocation of resources, and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals, with an egalitarian method of compensation.
# A theory or policy of social organisation which aims at or advocates the ownership and democratic control of the means of production, by workers or the community as a whole, and their administration or distribution in the interests of all.
# Socialists argue for a worker cooperative/community economy, or the commanding heights of the economy, with democratic control by the people over the state, although there have been some undemocratic philosophies. &quot;State&quot; or &quot;worker cooperative&quot; ownership is in fundamental opposition to &quot;private&quot; ownership of means of production, which is a defining feature of capitalism. Most socialists argue that capitalism unfairly concentrates power, wealth and profit, among a small segment of society that controls capital and derives its wealth through exploitation.

Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; they argue that &quot;making money&quot;, or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand.

Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to inaccessible economic decisions that result in immoral production, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of overproduction. According to socialists, private property in the means of production becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in the allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant. With no need for capital accumulation and a class of owners, private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a free association of individuals based on public or common ownership of these socialized assets. Socialists view private property relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy.

Early socialists (Utopian socialists and Ricardian socialists) criticized capitalism for concentrating power and wealth within a small segment of society, and for not utilising available technology and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.

=== Anarchism and libertarian socialism ===

For the influential German individualist anarchist philosopher Max Stirner, &quot;private property is a spook&quot; which &quot;lives by the grace of law&quot; and it &quot;becomes &#x27;mine&#x27; only by the effect of the law&quot;. In other words, private property exists purely &quot;through the protection of the State, through the State&#x27;s grace.&quot; Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner argued that &quot;[i]t need not make any difference to the &#x27;good citizens&#x27; who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always &#x27;love&#x27;? Not that of labour&quot;, rather it is &quot;interest-bearing possession ... labouring capital, therefore ... labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one&#x27;s own, but labour of capital and of the—subject labourers.&quot; French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Giménez Igualada saw:capitalism [as] an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.Within anarchism there emerged a critique of wage slavery, which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-voluntary slavery, where a person&#x27;s livelihood depends on wages, especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a negatively connoted term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person. The term &quot;wage slavery&quot; has been used to criticize economic exploitation and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops), and the latter as a lack of workers&#x27; self-management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy. Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with direct democracy, voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life, including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use, Luddites emphasized the dehumanization brought about by machines, while later American anarchist Emma Goldman famously denounced wage slavery by saying: &quot;The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves.&quot; Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. &quot;The only demand that property recognizes,&quot; she wrote in &quot;Anarchism and Other Essays&quot;, &quot;is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.&quot; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, &quot;turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.&quot;

Noam Chomsky contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one&#x27;s self to an owner or &quot;wage slavery&quot;. He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace. Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor. As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of &quot;private property&quot; and &quot;personal possession&quot;. Whereas &quot;private property&quot; grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and regardless of its productive capacity, &quot;possession&quot; grants no rights to things that are not in use.

In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s &quot;big four&quot; monopolies (land, money, tariffs, and patents), Kevin Carson argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization, in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker&#x27;s focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. Carson holds that &quot;capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable.&quot; Carson coined the pejorative term &quot;vulgar libertarianism&quot;, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase &quot;vulgar political economy&quot;, which Karl Marx described as an economic order that &quot;deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life].&quot;

=== Marxism ===

Karl Marx saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but which would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marx claimed that capitalism was nothing more than a necessary stepping stone for the progression of man, which would then face a political revolution before embracing the classless society.

=== Contemporary anti-capitalism ===
Inspired by Marxist thought, the Frankfurt School in Germany was established in 1923, with the purpose of analyzing the superstructure. Marx defined the superstructure as the social stratification and mores reflecting the economic base of capitalism. Through the 1930s, the Frankfurt School, led by thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse and Max Horkheimer created the philosophical movement of critical theory. Later, Critical theorist Jürgen Habermas noted that the universality of modern worldviews posed a threat to marginalized perspectives outside of western rationality. While Critical Theory emphasized the social issues stemming from capitalism with the intention towards liberating humanity, it did not directly offer an alternative economic model. Instead its analysis shifted attention to the reinforcement of existing power dynamics through statecraft and a complicit citizenry. 

In turn, Critical Theory inspired postmodern philosophers such as Michel Foucault to conceptualize how we form identities through social interaction. During the 1960s and 1970s the global political movement called the New Left explored what liberation entailed through social activism on behalf of these identities. Therefore, socialist identifying movements critical of capitalism extended their reach beyond purely economic considerations and became involved in anti-war and civil rights movements. Later this postmodern activism centered around identities regarding ethnicity, gender, orientation, and race would influence more direct anti-capitalist movements.

New critiques of capitalism also developed in accordance with modern concerns. Anti-globalization and alter-globalization oppose what they view as the sweeping neoliberal and pro-corporate capitalism that spread internationally in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x27;s fall. They are particularly critical of international financial institutions and regulations such as the IMF, WTO, and free trade agreements. In response, they promote the autonomy of sovereign people and the importance of environmental concerns as priorities over international market participation. Notable examples of contemporary anti-globalist movements include Mexico&#x27;s EZLN. The World Social Forum, began in 2002, is an annual international event dedicated to countering capitalist globalization through networking of attending organizations.

According to historian Gary Gerstle, the ideological space for anti-capitalism in the United States shrank significantly with the end of the Cold War and the globalization of capitalism, forcing the left to &quot;redefine their radicalism in alternative terms&quot; by heavily focusing on multiculturalism and partisan culture war issues, which &quot;turned out to be those that the capitalist system could more, rather than less, easily manage.&quot; Late philosopher Mark Fisher referred to this phenomenon as capitalist realism: &quot;the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it.&quot;

<text>Gregory Dale Bear (August 20, 1951 – November 19, 2022) was an American science fiction writer. His work covered themes of galactic conflict (&quot;Forge of God&quot; books), parallel universes (&quot;The Way&quot; series), consciousness and cultural practices (&quot;Queen of Angels&quot;), and accelerated evolution (&quot;Blood Music&quot;, &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Radio&quot;, and &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Children&quot;). His last work was the 2021 novel &quot;The Unfinished Land&quot;. Greg Bear wrote over 50 books in total. 

He was one of the five co-founders of San Diego Comic-Con.

==Early life==
Greg Bear was born in San Diego, California. He attended San Diego State University (1968–1973), where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree. At the university, he was a teaching assistant to Elizabeth Chater in her course on science fiction writing, and in later years her friend.

==Career==
Bear is often classified as a hard science fiction author because of the level of scientific detail in his work. Early in his career, he also published work as an artist, including illustrations for an early version of the reference book &quot;Star Trek Concordance&quot; and covers for periodicals &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. He sold his first story, &quot;Destroyers&quot;, to &quot;Famous Science Fiction&quot; in 1967.

In his fiction, Bear often addresses major questions in contemporary science and culture and proposes solutions. For example, &quot;The Forge of God&quot; offers an explanation for the Fermi paradox, supposing that the galaxy is filled with potentially predatory intelligences and that young civilizations that survive are those that do not attract their attention but stay quiet. In &quot;Queen of Angels&quot;, Bear examines crime, guilt, and punishment in society. He frames these questions around an examination of consciousness and awareness, including the emergent self-awareness of highly advanced computers in communication with humans. In &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Radio&quot; and &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Children&quot;, he addresses the problem of overpopulation with a mutation in the human genome making, basically, a new series of humans. The question of cultural acceptance of something new and unavoidable is also indicated.

One of Bear&#x27;s favorite themes is reality as a function of observation. In &quot;Blood Music&quot;, reality becomes unstable as the number of observers (trillions of intelligent single-cell organisms) spirals higher and higher. &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot; (sequel to &quot;The Forge of God&quot;) and &quot;Moving Mars&quot; postulate a physics based on information exchange between particles, capable of being altered at the &quot;bit level.&quot; In &quot;Moving Mars&quot;, that knowledge is used to remove Mars from the Solar System and transfer it to an orbit around a distant star.

&quot;Blood Music&quot; was first published as a short story (1983) and then expanded to a novel (1985) features nanotechnology. In later works, beginning with &quot;Queen of Angels&quot; and continuing with its sequel, &quot;Slant&quot;, Bear gives a detailed description of a near-future nanotechnological society. This historical sequence continues with &quot;Heads&quot;—which may contain the first description of a so-called &quot;quantum logic computer&quot;—and with &quot;Moving Mars&quot;. The sequence also charts the historical development of self-awareness in artificial intelligence. Its continuing character Jill was inspired in part by Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s self-aware computer Mycroft HOLMES in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966).

Bear, Gregory Benford, and David Brin wrote a trilogy of prequel novels to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy. Bear wrote the middle book named &quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot;.

While most of Bear&#x27;s work is science fiction, he has written in other fiction genres. Examples include &quot;Songs of Earth and Power&quot; (fantasy) and &quot;Psychlone&quot; (horror). Bear has described his &quot;Dead Lines&quot;, which straddles the line between science fiction and fantasy, as a &quot;high-tech ghost story&quot;. He has received many accolades, including five Nebula Awards and two Hugo Awards.

Bear cited Ray Bradbury as the most influential writer in his life. He met Bradbury in 1967 and had a lifelong correspondence. As a teenager, Bear attended Bradbury lectures and events in Southern California.

He also served on the Board of Advisors for the Museum of Science Fiction. Bear was also one of the five co-founders of San Diego Comic-Con.

==Personal life and death==
In 1975, Bear married Christina M. Nielson; they divorced in 1981. In 1983, he married Astrid Anderson, the daughter of the science fiction and fantasy authors Poul and Karen Anderson. They had two children, Chloe and Alexandra, and resided near Seattle, Washington.

Bear died on November 19, 2022, at the age of 71, from multiple strokes, caused by clots that had been hiding in a false lumen of the anterior artery to the brain since a surgery in 2014. After he had been on life support for two days and was not expected to recover, per his advance healthcare directive, life support was withdrawn.

<text>A Condorcet method (; ) is an election method that elects the candidate who wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property, the &quot;pairwise champion&quot; or &quot;beats-all winner&quot;, is formally called the &quot;Condorcet winner&quot; or &quot;Pairwise Majority Rule Winner&quot; (PMRW). The head-to-head elections need not be done separately; a voter&#x27;s choice within any given pair can be determined from the ranking.

Some elections may not yield a Condorcet winner because voter preferences may be cyclic—that is, it is possible that every candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest. The possibility of such cyclic preferences is known as the Condorcet paradox. However, a smallest group of candidates that beat all candidates not in the group, known as the Smith set, always exists. The Smith set is guaranteed to have the Condorcet winner in it should one exist. Many Condorcet methods elect a candidate who is in the Smith set absent a Condorcet winner, and is thus said to be &quot;Smith-efficient&quot;.

Condorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French mathematician and philosopher Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the Marquis de Condorcet, who championed such systems. However, Ramon Llull devised the earliest known Condorcet method in 1299. It was equivalent to Copeland&#x27;s method in cases with no pairwise ties.

Condorcet methods may use preferential ranked, rated vote ballots, or explicit votes between all pairs of candidates. Most Condorcet methods employ a single round of preferential voting, in which each voter ranks the candidates from most (marked as number 1) to least preferred (marked with a higher number). A voter&#x27;s ranking is often called their &quot;order of preference.&quot; Votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. All Condorcet methods will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. If there is no Condorcet winner different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle—Condorcet methods differ on which other criteria they satisfy.

The procedure given in Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by expressing their orders of preference. There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing survives to be paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually, only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is analogous to a single-winner or round-robin tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert&#x27;s Rules. But this method cannot reveal a voting paradox in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner (though it will always elect someone in the Smith set). A considerable portion of the literature on social choice theory is about the properties of this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments to administer.

==Summary==
In a contest between candidates A, B and C using the preferential-vote form of Condorcet method, a head-to-head race is conducted between each pair of candidates. A and B, B and C, and C and A. If one candidate is preferred over all others, they are the Condorcet Winner and winner of the election.

Because of the possibility of the Condorcet paradox, it is possible, but unlikely, that a Condorcet winner may not exist in a specific election. This is sometimes called a &quot;Condorcet cycle&quot; or just &quot;cycle&quot; and can be thought of as Rock beating Scissors, Scissors beating Paper, and Paper beating Rock. Various Condorcet methods differ in how they resolve such a cycle. (Most elections do not have cycles. See Condorcet paradox#Likelihood of the paradox for estimates.) If there is no cycle, all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate and are operationally equivalent.

*Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference (top-to-bottom, or best-to-worst, or 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The voter may be allowed to rank candidates as equals and to express indifference (no preference) between them. Candidates omitted by a voter may be treated as if the voter ranked them at the bottom.
*For each pairing of candidates (as in a round-robin tournament) count how many votes rank each candidate over the other candidate. Thus each pairing will have two totals: the size of its majority and the size of its minority (or there will be a tie).

For most Condorcet methods, those counts usually suffice to determine the complete order of finish (i.e. who won, who came in 2nd place, etc.). They always suffice to determine whether there is a Condorcet winner.

Additional information may be needed in the event of ties. Ties can be pairings that have no majority, or they can be majorities that are the same size. Such ties will be rare when there are many voters. Some Condorcet methods may have other kinds of ties. For example, with Copeland&#x27;s method, it would not be rare for two or more candidates to win the same number of pairings, when there is no Condorcet winner.

==Definition==
A Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found (if they exist; see next paragraph) by checking if there is a candidate who beats all other candidates; this can be done by using Copeland&#x27;s method and then checking if the Copeland winner has the highest possible Copeland score. They can also be found by conducting a series of pairwise comparisons, using the procedure given in Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order described above. For &quot;N&quot; candidates, this requires &quot;N&quot; − 1 pairwise hypothetical elections. For example, with 5 candidates there are 4 pairwise comparisons to be made, since after each comparison, a candidate is eliminated, and after 4 eliminations, only one of the original 5 candidates will remain.

To confirm that a Condorcet winner exists in a given election, first do the Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order procedure, declare the final remaining candidate the procedure&#x27;s winner, and then do at most an additional &quot;N&quot; − 2 pairwise comparisons between the procedure&#x27;s winner and any candidates they have not been compared against yet (including all previously eliminated candidates). If the procedure&#x27;s winner does not win all pairwise matchups, then no Condorcet winner exists in the election (and thus the Smith set has multiple candidates in it).

Computing all pairwise comparisons requires ½&quot;N&quot;(&quot;N&quot;−1) pairwise comparisons for &quot;N&quot; candidates. For 10 candidates, this means 0.5*10*9=45 comparisons, which can make elections with many candidates hard to count the votes for.

The family of Condorcet methods is also referred to collectively as Condorcet&#x27;s method. A voting system that always elects the Condorcet winner when there is one is described by electoral scientists as a system that satisfies the Condorcet criterion. Additionally, a voting system can be considered to have Condorcet consistency, or be Condorcet consistent, if it elects any Condorcet winner.

In certain circumstances, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a &quot;majority rule cycle&quot;, described by Condorcet&#x27;s paradox. The manner in which a winner is then chosen varies from one Condorcet method to another. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods, or Condorcet consistent, because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.

Not all single winner, ranked voting systems are Condorcet methods. For example, instant-runoff voting and the Borda count are not Condorcet methods.

==Basic procedure==
===Voting===

In a Condorcet election the voter ranks the list of candidates in order of preference. If a ranked ballot is used, the voter gives a &quot;1&quot; to their first preference, a &quot;2&quot; to their second preference, and so on. Some Condorcet methods allow voters to rank more than one candidate equally so that the voter might express two first preferences rather than just one. If a scored ballot is used, voters rate or score the candidates on a scale, for example as is used in Score voting, with a higher rating indicating a greater preference. When a voter does not give a full list of preferences, it is typically assumed that they prefer the candidates that they have ranked over all the candidates that were not ranked, and that there is no preference between candidates that were left unranked. Some Condorcet elections permit write-in candidates.

===Finding the winner===

The count is conducted by pitting every candidate against every other candidate in a series of hypothetical one-on-one contests. The winner of each pairing is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. Unless they tie, there is always a majority when there are only two choices. The candidate preferred by each voter is taken to be the one in the pair that the voter ranks (or rates) higher on their ballot paper. For example, if Alice is paired against Bob it is necessary to count both the number of voters who have ranked Alice higher than Bob, and the number who have ranked Bob higher than Alice. If Alice is preferred by more voters then she is the winner of that pairing. When all possible pairings of candidates have been considered, if one candidate beats every other candidate in these contests then they are declared the Condorcet winner. As noted above, if there is no Condorcet winner a further method must be used to find the winner of the election, and this mechanism varies from one Condorcet consistent method to another. In any Condorcet method that passes Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives, it can sometimes help to identify the Smith set from the head-to-head matchups, and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure for that Condorcet method.

===Pairwise counting and matrices===

Condorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates summarize all the pairwise preferences of all the voters.

Pairwise counts are often displayed in a &quot;pairwise comparison matrix&quot;, or &quot;outranking matrix&quot;, such as those below. In these matrices, each row represents each candidate as a &#x27;runner&#x27;, while each column represents each candidate as an &#x27;opponent&#x27;. The cells at the intersection of rows and columns each show the result of a particular pairwise comparison. Cells comparing a candidate to themselves are left blank.

Imagine there is an election between four candidates: A, B, C, and D. The first matrix below records the preferences expressed on a single ballot paper, in which the voter&#x27;s preferences are (B, C, A, D); that is, the voter ranked B first, C second, A third, and D fourth. In the matrix a &#x27;1&#x27; indicates that the runner is preferred over the &#x27;opponent&#x27;, while a &#x27;0&#x27; indicates that the runner is defeated.

Using a matrix like the one above, one can find the overall results of an election. Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using matrix addition. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix. Suppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:
When the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner, opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent, runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.

Cells marked &#x27;—&#x27; in the matrices above have a numerical value of &#x27;0&#x27;, but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner, opponent) is ¬(opponent, runner). Or (runner, opponent) + (opponent, runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner, opponent) + (opponent, runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.

==Example: Voting on the location of Tennessee&#x27;s capital==
To find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of imaginary one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. When results for every possible pairing have been found they are as follows:

The results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:

As can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. Nashville will thus win an election held under any possible Condorcet method.

While any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, if instead an election based on the same votes were held using first-past-the-post or instant-runoff voting, these systems would select Memphis and Knoxville respectively. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those &quot;winners&quot;. Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.

On the other hand, in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If we changed the basis for defining preference and determined that Memphis voters preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.

An alternative way of thinking about this example if a Smith-efficient Condorcet method that passes ISDA is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a mutual majority, ranked Memphis last (making Memphis the majority loser) and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would have had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won as the majority&#x27;s 1st choice.

==Circular ambiguities==

As noted above, sometimes an election has no Condorcet winner because there is no candidate who is preferred by voters to all other candidates. When this occurs the situation is known as a &#x27;Condorcet cycle&#x27;, &#x27;majority rule cycle&#x27;, &#x27;circular ambiguity&#x27;, &#x27;circular tie&#x27;, &#x27;Condorcet paradox&#x27;, or simply a &#x27;cycle&#x27;. This situation emerges when, once all votes have been tallied, the preferences of voters with respect to some candidates form a circle in which every candidate is beaten by at least one other candidate (Intransitivity).

For example, if there are three candidates, Candidate Rock, Candidate Scissors, and Candidate Paper, there will be no Condorcet winner if voters prefer Candidate Rock over Candidate Scissors and Scissors over Paper, but also Candidate Paper over Rock. Depending on the context in which elections are held, circular ambiguities may or may not be common, but there is no known case of a governmental election with ranked-choice voting in which a circular ambiguity is evident from the record of ranked ballots. Nonetheless a cycle is always possible, and so every Condorcet method should be capable of determining a winner when this contingency occurs. A mechanism for resolving an ambiguity is known as ambiguity resolution, cycle resolution method, or &quot;Condorcet completion method&quot;.

Circular ambiguities arise as a result of the voting paradox—the result of an election can be intransitive (forming a cycle) even though all individual voters expressed a transitive preference. In a Condorcet election it is impossible for the preferences of a single voter to be cyclical, because a voter must rank all candidates in order, from top-choice to bottom-choice, and can only rank each candidate once, but the paradox of voting means that it is still possible for a circular ambiguity in voter tallies to emerge.

The idealized notion of a political spectrum is often used to describe political candidates and policies. Where this kind of spectrum exists, and voters prefer candidates who are closest to their own position on the spectrum, there is a Condorcet winner (Black&#x27;s Single-Peakedness Theorem).

In Condorcet methods, as in most electoral systems, there is also the possibility of an ordinary tie. This occurs when two or more candidates tie with each other but defeat every other candidate. As in other systems this can be resolved by a random method such as the drawing of lots. Ties can also be settled through other methods like seeing which of the tied winners had the most first choice votes, but this and some other non-random methods may re-introduce a degree of tactical voting, especially if voters know the race will be close.

The method used to resolve circular ambiguities is the main difference between the various Condorcet methods. There are countless ways in which this can be done, but every Condorcet method involves ignoring the majorities expressed by voters in at least some pairwise matchings. Some cycle resolution methods are Smith-efficient, meaning that they pass the Smith criterion. This guarantees that when there is a cycle (and no pairwise ties), only the candidates in the cycle can win, and that if there is a mutual majority, one of their preferred candidates will win.

Condorcet methods fit within two categories:

* Two-method systems, which use a separate method to handle cases in which there is no Condorcet winner
* One-method systems, which use a single method that, without any special handling, always identifies the winner to be the Condorcet winner

Many one-method systems and some two-method systems will give the same result as each other if there are fewer than 4 candidates in the circular tie, and all voters separately rank at least two of those candidates. These include Smith-Minimax (Minimax but done only after all candidates not in the Smith set are eliminated), Ranked Pairs, and Schulze. For example, with three candidates in the Smith set in a Condorcet cycle, because Schulze and Ranked Pairs pass ISDA, all candidates not in the Smith set can be eliminated first, and then for Schulze, dropping the weakest defeat of the three allows the candidate who had that weakest defeat to be the only candidate who can beat or tie all other candidates, while with Ranked Pairs, once the first two strongest defeats are locked in, the weakest cannot, since it&#x27;d create a cycle, and so the candidate with the weakest defeat will have no defeats locked in against them).

==Two-method systems==

One family of Condorcet methods consists of systems that first conduct a series of pairwise comparisons and then, if there is no Condorcet winner, fall back to an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner. The simplest such fall-back methods involve entirely disregarding the results of the pairwise comparisons. For example, the Black method chooses the Condorcet winner if it exists, but uses the Borda count instead if there is a cycle (the method is named for Duncan Black).

A more sophisticated two-stage process is, in the event of a cycle, to use a separate voting system to find the winner but to restrict this second stage to a certain subset of candidates found by scrutinizing the results of the pairwise comparisons. Sets used for this purpose are defined so that they will always contain only the Condorcet winner if there is one, and will always, in any case, contain at least one candidate. Such sets include the

* Smith set: The smallest non-empty set of candidates in a particular election such that every candidate in the set can beat all candidates outside the set. It is easily shown that there is only one possible Smith set for each election.
* Schwartz set: This is the innermost unbeaten set, and is usually the same as the Smith set. It is defined as the union of all possible sets of candidates such that for every set:
*#Every candidate inside the set is pairwise unbeatable by any other candidate outside the set (i.e., ties are allowed).
*#No proper (smaller) subset of the set fulfills the first property.
* Landau set or uncovered set or Fishburn set: the set of candidates, such that each member, for every other candidate (including those inside the set), either beats this candidate or beats a third candidate that itself beats the candidate that is unbeaten by the member.

One possible method is to apply instant-runoff voting in various ways, such as to the candidates of the Smith set. One variation of this method has been described as &quot;Smith/IRV&quot;, with another being Tideman&#x27;s alternative methods. It is also possible to do &quot;Smith/Approval&quot; by allowing voters to rank candidates, and indicate which candidates they approve, such that the candidate in the Smith set approved by the most voters wins; this is often done using an approval threshold (i.e. if voters approve their 3rd choices, those voters are automatically considered to approve their 1st and 2nd choices too). In Smith/Score, the candidate in the Smith set with the highest total score wins, with the pairwise comparisons done based on which candidates are scored higher than others.

==Single-method systems==

Some Condorcet methods use a single procedure that inherently meets the Condorcet criteria and, without any extra procedure, also resolves circular ambiguities when they arise. In other words, these methods do not involve separate procedures for different situations. Typically these methods base their calculations on pairwise counts. These methods include:

*Copeland&#x27;s method: This simple method involves electing the candidate who wins the most pairwise matchings. However, it often produces a tie.
*Kemeny–Young method: This method ranks all the choices from most popular and second-most popular down to least popular.
* Minimax: Also called &quot;Simpson&quot;, &quot;Simpson–Kramer&quot;, and &quot;Simple Condorcet&quot;, this method chooses the candidate whose worst pairwise defeat is better than that of all other candidates. A refinement of this method involves restricting it to choosing a winner from among the Smith set; this has been called &quot;Smith/Minimax&quot;.
* Nanson&#x27;s method and Baldwin&#x27;s method combine Borda Count with an instant runoff procedure.
* Dodgson&#x27;s method extends the Condorcet method by swapping candidates until a Condorcet winner is found. The winner is the candidate which requires the minimum number of swaps.
* Ranked pairs breaks each cycle in the pairwise preference graph by dropping the weakest majority in the cycle, thereby yielding a complete ranking of the candidates. This method is also known as &quot;Tideman&quot;, after its inventor Nicolaus Tideman.
*Schulze method iteratively drops the weakest majority in the pairwise preference graph until the winner becomes well defined. This method is also known as &quot;Schwartz sequential dropping&quot; (SSD), &quot;cloneproof Schwartz sequential dropping&quot; (CSSD), &quot;beatpath method&quot;, &quot;beatpath winner&quot;, &quot;path voting&quot;, and &quot;path winner&quot;.
*Smith Score is a rated voting method which elects the Score voting winner from the Smith set.

Ranked Pairs and Schulze are procedurally in some sense opposite approaches (although they very frequently give the same results):
* Ranked Pairs (and its variants) starts with the strongest defeats and uses as much information as it can without creating ambiguity.
* Schulze repeatedly removes the weakest defeat until the ambiguity is removed.

Minimax could be considered as more &quot;blunt&quot; than either of these approaches, as instead of removing defeats it can be seen as immediately removing candidates by looking at the strongest defeats (although their victories are still considered for subsequent candidate eliminations). One way to think of it in terms of removing defeats is that Minimax removes each candidate&#x27;s weakest defeats until some group of candidates with only pairwise ties between them have no defeats left, at which point the group ties to win.

===Kemeny–Young method===
The Kemeny–Young method considers every possible sequence of choices in terms of which choice might be most popular, which choice might be second-most popular, and so on down to which choice might be least popular. Each such sequence is associated with a Kemeny score that is equal to the sum of the pairwise counts that apply to the specified sequence. The sequence with the highest score is identified as the overall ranking, from most popular to least popular.

When the pairwise counts are arranged in a matrix in which the choices appear in sequence from most popular (top and left) to least popular (bottom and right), the winning Kemeny score equals the sum of the counts in the upper-right, triangular half of the matrix (shown here in bold on a green background).

In this example, the Kemeny Score of the sequence Nashville &gt; Chattanooga &gt; Knoxville &gt; Memphis would be 393.

Calculating every Kemeny score requires considerable computation time in cases that involve more than a few choices. However, fast calculation methods based on integer programming allow a computation time in seconds for some cases with as many as 40 choices.

===Ranked pairs===

The order of finish is constructed a piece at a time by considering the (pairwise) majorities one at a time, from largest majority to smallest majority. For each majority, their higher-ranked candidate is placed ahead of their lower-ranked candidate in the (partially constructed) order of finish, except when their lower-ranked candidate has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate.

For example, suppose the voters&#x27; orders of preference are such that 75% rank B over C, 65% rank A over B, and 60% rank C over A. (The three majorities are a rock paper scissors cycle.) Ranked pairs begins with the largest majority, who rank B over C, and places B ahead of C in the order of finish. Then it considers the second largest majority, who rank A over B, and places A ahead of B in the order of finish. At this point, it has been established that A finishes ahead of B and B finishes ahead of C, which implies A also finishes ahead of C. So when ranked pairs considers the third largest majority, who rank C over A, their lower-ranked candidate A has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate C, so C is not placed ahead of A. The order of finish is &quot;A, B, C&quot; and A is the winner.

An equivalent definition is to find the order of finish that minimizes the size of the largest reversed majority. (In the &#x27;lexicographical order&#x27; sense. If the largest majority reversed in two orders of finish is the same, the two orders of finish are compared by their second largest reversed majorities, etc. See the discussion of MinMax, MinLexMax and Ranked Pairs in the &#x27;Motivation and uses&#x27; section of the Lexicographical Order article). (In the example, the order of finish &quot;A, B, C&quot; reverses the 60% who rank C over A. Any other order of finish would reverse a larger majority.) This definition is useful for simplifying some of the proofs of Ranked Pairs&#x27; properties, but the &quot;constructive&quot; definition executes much faster (small polynomial time).

===Schulze method===
The Schulze method resolves votes as follows:

:At each stage, we proceed as follows:

:# For each pair of undropped candidates X and Y: If there is a directed path of undropped links from candidate X to candidate Y, then we write &quot;X → Y&quot;; otherwise we write &quot;not X → Y&quot;.
:# For each pair of undropped candidates V and W: If &quot;V → W&quot; and &quot;not W → V&quot;, then candidate W is dropped and all links, that start or end in candidate W, are dropped.
:# The weakest undropped link is dropped. If several undropped links tie as weakest, all of them are dropped.

:The procedure ends when all links have been dropped. The winners are the undropped candidates.

In other words, this procedure repeatedly throws away the weakest pairwise defeat within the top set, until finally the number of votes left over produce an unambiguous decision.

===Defeat strength===

Some pairwise methods—including minimax, Ranked Pairs, and the Schulze method—resolve circular ambiguities based on the relative strength of the defeats. There are different ways to measure the strength of each defeat, and these include considering &quot;winning votes&quot; and &quot;margins&quot;:

*Winning votes: The number of votes on the winning side of a defeat.
*Margins: The number of votes on the winning side of the defeat, minus the number of votes on the losing side of the defeat.

If voters do not rank their preferences for all of the candidates, these two approaches can yield different results. Consider, for example, the following election:

The pairwise defeats are as follows:

*B beats A, 55 to 45 (55 winning votes, a margin of 10 votes)
*A beats C, 45 to 44 (45 winning votes, a margin of 1 vote)
*C beats B, 29 to 26 (29 winning votes, a margin of 3 votes)

Using the winning votes definition of defeat strength, the defeat of B by C is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest. Using the margins definition of defeat strength, the defeat of C by A is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest.

Using winning votes as the definition of defeat strength, candidate B would win under minimax, Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, but, using margins as the definition of defeat strength, candidate C would win in the same methods.

If all voters give complete rankings of the candidates, then winning votes and margins will always produce the same result. The difference between them can only come into play when some voters declare equal preferences amongst candidates, as occurs implicitly if they do not rank all candidates, as in the example above.

The choice between margins and winning votes is the subject of scholarly debate. Because all Condorcet methods always choose the Condorcet winner when one exists, the difference between methods only appears when cyclic ambiguity resolution is required. The argument for using winning votes follows from this: Because cycle resolution involves disenfranchising a selection of votes, then the selection should disenfranchise the fewest possible number of votes. When margins are used, the difference between the number of two candidates&#x27; votes may be small, but the number of votes may be very large—or not. Only methods employing winning votes satisfy Woodall&#x27;s plurality criterion.

An argument in favour of using margins is the fact that the result of a pairwise comparison is decided by the presence of more votes for one side than the other and thus that it follows naturally to assess the strength of a comparison by this &quot;surplus&quot; for the winning side. Otherwise, changing only a few votes from the winner to the loser could cause a sudden large change from a large score for one side to a large score for the other. In other words, one could consider losing votes being in fact disenfranchised when it comes to ambiguity resolution with winning votes. Also, using winning votes, a vote containing ties (possibly implicitly in the case of an incompletely ranked ballot) does not have the same effect as a number of equally weighted votes with total weight equaling one vote, such that the ties are broken in every possible way (a violation of Woodall&#x27;s symmetric-completion criterion), as opposed to margins.

Under winning votes, if two more of the &quot;B&quot; voters decided to vote &quot;BC&quot;, the A-&gt;C arm of the cycle would be overturned and Condorcet would pick C instead of B. This is an example of &quot;Unburying&quot; or &quot;Later does harm&quot;. The margin method would pick C anyway.

Under the margin method, if three more &quot;BC&quot; voters decided to &quot;bury&quot; C by just voting &quot;B&quot;, the A-&gt;C arm of the cycle would be strengthened and the resolution strategies would end up breaking the C-&gt;B arm and giving the win to B. This is an example of &quot;Burying&quot;. The winning votes method would pick B anyway.

==Related terms==
Other terms related to the Condorcet method are:
;Condorcet loser: the candidate who is less preferred than every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by fewer voters than any other candidate).
;Weak Condorcet winner: a candidate who beats or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by at least as many voters as any other candidate). There can be more than one weak Condorcet winner.
;Weak Condorcet loser: a candidate who is defeated by or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup. Similarly, there can be more than one weak Condorcet loser.

;Improved Condorcet winner: in improved condorcet methods, additional rules for pairwise comparisons are introduced to handle ballots where candidates are tied, so that pairwise wins can not be changed by those tied ballots switching to a specific preference order. A strong improved condorcet winner in an improved condorcet method must also be a strong condorcet winner, but the converse need not hold. In tied at the top methods, the number of ballots where the candidates are tied at the top of the ballot is subtracted from the victory margin between the two candidates. This has the effect of introducing more ties in the pairwise comparison graph, but allows the method to satisfy the favourite betrayal criterion.

==Condorcet ranking methods==
Some Condorcet methods produce not just a single winner, but a ranking of all candidates from first to last place. A Condorcet ranking is a list of candidates with the property that the Condorcet winner (if one exists) comes first and the Condorcet loser (if one exists) comes last, and this holds recursively for the candidates ranked between them.

Single winner methods that satisfy this property include:
* Copeland&#x27;s method
* Kemeny–Young method
* Ranked pairs
* Schulze method

Proportional forms which satisfy this property include:
* CPO-STV
* Schulze STV

Though there will not always be a Condorcet winner or Condorcet loser, there is always a Smith set and &quot;Smith loser set&quot; (smallest group of candidates who lose to all candidates not in the set in head-to-head elections). Some voting methods produce rankings that sort all candidates in the Smith set above all others, and all candidates in the Smith loser set below all others, with this holding recursively for all candidates ranked between them; in essence, this guarantees that when the candidates can be split into two groups, such that every candidate in the first group beats every candidate in the second group head-to-head, then all candidates in the first group are ranked higher than all candidates in the second group. Because the Smith set and Smith loser set are equivalent to the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser when they exist, methods that always produce Smith set rankings also always produce Condorcet rankings.

==Comparison with instant runoff and first-past-the-post (plurality)==

Many proponents of instant-runoff voting (IRV) are attracted by the belief that if their first choice does not win, their vote will be given to their second choice; if their second choice does not win, their vote will be given to their third choice, etc. This sounds perfect, but it is not true for every voter with IRV. If someone voted for a strong candidate, and their 2nd and 3rd choices are eliminated before their first choice is eliminated, IRV gives their vote to their 4th choice candidate, not their 2nd choice. Condorcet voting takes all rankings into account simultaneously, but at the expense of violating the later-no-harm criterion and the later-no-help criterion. With IRV, indicating a second choice will never affect your first choice. With Condorcet voting, it is possible that indicating a second choice will cause your first choice to lose.

Plurality voting is simple, and theoretically provides incentives for voters to compromise for centrist candidates rather than throw away their votes on candidates who cannot win. Opponents to plurality voting point out that voters often vote for the lesser of evils because they heard on the news that those two are the only two with a chance of winning, not necessarily because those two are the two natural compromises. This gives the media significant election powers. And if voters do compromise according to the media, the post election counts will prove the media right for next time. Condorcet runs each candidate against the other head to head, so that voters elect the candidate who would win the most sincere runoffs, instead of the one they thought they had to vote for.

There are circumstances, as in the examples above, when both instant-runoff voting and the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; plurality system will fail to pick the Condorcet winner. (In fact, FPTP can elect the Condorcet loser and IRV can elect the second-worst candidate, who would lose to every candidate except the Condorcet loser.) In cases where there is a Condorcet Winner, and where IRV does not choose it, a majority would by definition prefer the Condorcet Winner to the IRV winner. Proponents of the Condorcet criterion see it as a principal issue in selecting an electoral system. They see the Condorcet criterion as a natural extension of majority rule. Condorcet methods tend to encourage the selection of centrist candidates who appeal to the median voter. Here is an example that is designed to support IRV at the expense of Condorcet:

B is preferred by a 501–499 majority to A, and by a 502–498 majority to C. So, according to the Condorcet criterion, B should win, despite the fact that very few voters rank B in first place. By contrast, IRV elects C and plurality elects A. The goal of a ranked voting system is for voters to be able to vote sincerely and trust the system to protect their intent. Plurality voting forces voters to do all their tactics before they vote, so that the system does not need to figure out their intent.

The significance of this scenario, of two parties with strong support, and the one with weak support being the Condorcet winner, may be misleading, though, as it is a common mode in plurality voting systems (see Duverger&#x27;s law), but much less likely to occur in Condorcet or IRV elections, which unlike Plurality voting, punish candidates who alienate a significant block of voters.

Here is an example that is designed to support Condorcet at the expense of IRV:

B would win against either A or C by more than a 65–35 margin in a one-on-one election, but IRV eliminates B first, leaving a contest between the more &quot;polar&quot; candidates, A and C. Proponents of plurality voting state that their system is simpler than any other and more easily understood.

All three systems are susceptible to tactical voting, but the types of tactics used and the frequency of strategic incentive differ in each method.

==Potential for tactical voting==

Like all voting methods, Condorcet methods are vulnerable to compromising. That is, voters can help avoid the election of a less-preferred candidate by insincerely raising the position of a more-preferred candidate on their ballot. However, Condorcet methods are only vulnerable to compromising when there is a majority rule cycle, or when one can be created.

Condorcet methods are vulnerable to burying. In some elections, voters can help a more-preferred candidate by insincerely lowering the position of a less-preferred candidate on their ballot. For example, in an election with three candidates, voters may be able to falsify their second choice to help their preferred candidate win.

Example with the Schulze method:

* B is the sincere Condorcet winner. But since A has the most votes and almost has a majority, with A and B forming a mutual majority of 90% of the voters, A can win by publicly instructing A voters to bury B with C (see * below), using B-top voters&#x27; 2nd choice support to win the election. If B, after hearing the public instructions, reciprocates by burying A with C, C will be elected, and this threat may be enough to keep A from pushing for his tactic. B&#x27;s other possible recourse would be to attack A&#x27;s ethics in proposing the tactic and call for all voters to vote sincerely. This is an example of the chicken dilemma.

* B beats A by 8 as before, and A beats C by 82 as before, but &quot;now&quot; C beats B by 12, forming a Smith set greater than one. Even the Schulze method elects A: The path strength of A beats B is the lesser of 82 and 12, so 12. The path strength of B beats A is only 8, which is less than 12, so A wins. B voters are powerless to do anything about the public announcement by A, and C voters just hope B reciprocates, or maybe consider compromise voting for B if they dislike A enough.

Supporters of Condorcet methods which exhibit this potential problem could rebut this concern by pointing out that pre-election polls are most necessary with plurality voting, and that voters, armed with ranked choice voting, could lie to pre-election pollsters, making it impossible for Candidate A to know whether or how to bury. It is also nearly impossible to predict ahead of time how many supporters of A would actually follow the instructions, and how many would be alienated by such an obvious attempt to manipulate the system.
* In the above example, if C voters bury B with A, A will be elected instead of B. Since C voters prefer B to A, only they would be hurt by attempting the burying. Except for the first example where one candidate has the most votes and has a near majority, the Schulze method is very resistant to burying.

==Evaluation by criteria==

Scholars of electoral systems often compare them using mathematically defined voting system criteria. The criteria which Condorcet methods satisfy vary from one Condorcet method to another. However, the Condorcet criterion implies the majority criterion, and thus is incompatible with independence of irrelevant alternatives (though it implies a weaker analogous form of the criterion: when there is a Condorcet winner, losing candidates can drop out of the election without changing the result), later-no-harm, the participation criterion, and the consistency criterion.

==Use of Condorcet voting==

Condorcet methods are not known to be currently in use in government elections anywhere in the world, but a Condorcet method known as Nanson&#x27;s method was used in city elections in the U.S. town of Marquette, Michigan in the 1920s, and today Condorcet methods are used by a number of political parties and private organizations.

In Vermont, Bill H.424 would enable towns, cities, and villages to adopt a Condorcet-based voting system for single-seat office elections through a majority vote at a town meeting. The system first checks for a majority winner among first preferences. If none, pairwise Condorcet comparisons are counted and the Condorcet winner is elected. If none, it resorts to a first-past-the-post tiebreaker. Once adopted, the system remains in effect until the community decides to revert to a previous method or another system through a subsequent town meeting vote.

Organizations which currently use some variant of the Condorcet method are:

* The Libertarian Party of Washington allows for a Condorcet method, in addition to other systems
* The Free State Project used Minimax for choosing its target state
* The uk.* hierarchy of Usenet uses a Condorcet method
* Baldwin&#x27;s method was in use by the Trinity College Dialectic Society around 1864.
* Schulze method is used in many places. Some examples:
** The Wikimedia Foundation used the Schulze method to elect its Board of Trustees until 2013, when it switched to a ratings ballot with Support/Neutral/Oppose ballots.
** The Pirate Party of Sweden uses the Schulze method for its primaries
** The Debian project uses the Schulze method for internal referendums and to elect its leader
** The Software in the Public Interest corporation uses the Schulze method for internal referendums and to elect its board of directors
** The Gentoo Foundation uses the Schulze method for internal referendums and to elect its board of trustees and its council
** Kingman Hall and Hillegass Parker House, two loosely affiliated student housing cooperatives, each use the Schulze method to elect their management teams.
** The Kubernetes community uses Elekto&#x27;s implementation of the Schulze method.
** &quot;The Schulze method article has a longer list of users of that method.&quot;

<text>The Forge of God is a 1987 science fiction novel by American writer Greg Bear. Earth faces destruction when an inscrutable and overwhelming alien form of life attacks.

== Plot ==

The novel features scenes and events, including the discovery of a nearly-dead alien in the desert, who clearly says in English, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but there is bad news,&quot; and the alien&#x27;s subsequent interrogation and autopsy; the discovery of an artificial geological formation and its subsequent nuclear destruction by a desperate military; and the Earth&#x27;s eventual destruction by the mutual annihilation of a piece of neutronium and a piece of antineutronium dropped into Earth&#x27;s core.

There is another alien faction at work, however, represented on Earth by small spider-like robots that recruit human agents through some form of mind control. They frantically collect all the human data, biological records, tissue samples, seeds, and DNA from the biosphere that they can and evacuate a handful of people from Earth. In outer space, this faction&#x27;s machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers but not before Earth&#x27;s fate is sealed. The evacuees eventually settle a newly terraformed Mars while some form the crew of a Ship of the Law to hunt down the home world of the killers, a quest described in the sequel, &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot;.

One of the point-of-view characters is Arthur Gordon, a scientist. He, his wife Francine and son Martin are among those rescued from the destruction of Earth. Some other characters are close to an American president, who fails to take action against the threat.

The two books show at least one solution to the Fermi paradox, with electromagnetically noisy civilizations being snuffed out by the arrival of self-replicating machines designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long-dead) creators. (A similar theme is explored in Fred Saberhagen&#x27;s &quot;Berserker&quot; novels.)

==Cultural reference==
It features a character, Lawrence Van Cott, that is modelled on science fiction author Larry Niven, whose full name is &quot;Laurence van Cott Niven&quot;.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Forge of God&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #95, and stated that &quot;A good nasty read [...] with a flicker of optimism: in the jungle Out There, someone is on our side ...&quot;

&quot;The Forge of God&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1987, and was also nominated for the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1988.

==Movie==
In the early 2000s, &quot;The Forge of God&quot; and &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot;, as well as an as-yet-unwritten third book, were optioned by Warner Bros. to be made into movies. It was reported that Stephen Susco worked on a script for &quot;The Forge of God&quot;. In July 2006, Greg Bear mentioned on his website that the movie is &quot;Still under option. Studio engaged in &#x27;silent running.&#x27; &quot;

However, in October 2010, Bear commented on his website that Ken Nolan (who wrote the screen adaptation for Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; film), was actively working on a screenplay.

<text>Blood Music is a 1985 science fiction novel by American writer Greg Bear.
It is an expanded version of a short story of the same title, originally published in the June 1983 issue of &quot;Analog&quot; and the winner of both the 1983 Nebula and 1984 Hugo awards for Best Novelette. The novel won the 1986 Prix Apollo Award, given to the best science fiction novel published in France during the preceding year, under the title &quot;La Musique du sang&quot;.

&quot;Blood Music&quot; deals with themes including biotechnology, nanotechnology (including the grey goo hypothesis), the nature of reality, consciousness, and artificial intelligence.

==Plot summary==
Renegade biotechnologist Vergil Ulam creates simple biological computers based on his own lymphocytes. Faced with orders from his nervous employer to destroy his work, he injects them into his own body, intending to smuggle the &quot;noocytes&quot; (as he calls them) out of the company and work on them elsewhere. Inside Ulam&#x27;s body, the noocytes multiply and evolve rapidly, altering their own genetic material and quickly becoming self-aware. 

The nanoscale civilization they construct soon begins to transform Ulam, then others. The people who are infected start to find that genetic faults such as myopia and high blood pressure are fixed. Ulam&#x27;s eyesight, posture, strength, and intelligence are all improved. The infected can even have conversations with their noocytes, with some reporting that the cells seem to sing.

Through infection, conversion, and assimilation of humans and other organisms, the cells eventually aggregate most of the biosphere of North America into a region wide. This civilization, which incorporates both the evolved noocytes and recently assimilated conventional humans, is eventually forced to abandon the normal plane of existence in favor of one in which thought does not require a physical substrate. The reason for the noocytes&#x27; inability to remain in this reality is somewhat related to the strong anthropic principle.

The book&#x27;s structure is titled &quot;inter-phase&quot;, &quot;prophase&quot;, &quot;metaphase&quot;, &quot;anaphase&quot;, &quot;telophase&quot;, and &quot;interphase&quot;. This mirrors the major phases of cell cycle: interphase and mitosis.

==Characters==
* Vergil Ulam: Physically unhealthy and mentally amoral (e.g., he got his Genetron job by falsifying his university credentials), Vergil is the &quot;pure&quot; scientist who wants to unlock the mysteries of nature, without care for the consequences.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Blood Music&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #79, and stated that &quot;The finale is magnificent. The only problem is that it&#x27;s nigglingly close to the conclusion reached by an author extrapolating from a different start-point: Arthur C. Clarke in &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. But Bear, I think does it better – and goes beyond even Clarke. Strongly recommended.&quot;

Martin Lewis of the SF Site writes in a 2002 review, &quot;For a novel that moves so quickly you might expect some fudge for the sake of plot, but the ideas that are presented are fully explored and the characters are all well drawn... Bear also succeeds in pulling off probably the hardest task in SF, depicting a believable strongly superhuman AI.&quot; He adds, &quot;As can be expected, Bear explicitly references both &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Prometheus. However, although the novel charts the demise of humanity, &quot;Blood Music&quot; is optimistic in tone. Despite the prejudices of the masses Frankenstein&#x27;s monster is triumphant. The noocytes, cultured in Ulam&#x27;s body, are genuinely better than humans and happy to invite them to share this new future.&quot; Placing &quot;Blood Music&quot; among its contemporaries, specifically the cyberpunk fiction of the 1980s, Lewis calls it &quot;a modern classic&quot; in its handling of Transhumanism, which explores ideas such as genetic engineering and translation of consciousness. Lewis concludes, &quot;To this day, it remains the defining novel of &quot;wet&quot; nanotechnology&quot;.

Drawing parallel literary connections, Thomas Christensen (in a 1999 retrospective review) calls it &quot;a DNA based Frankenstein&#x27;s fantastic voyage-story for the last quarter of the twentieth century. The story may seem a bit simplistic and stereotypical these days (the mad scientist and the ignorant environmental activists),&quot; yet it offers &quot;a fairly well written and fairly interesting story about the wonders that bioengineering can give us, if we use it right and the horrors it can bring us if we aren&#x27;t careful.&quot;

The Worlds Without End site calls the novel both &quot;suspenseful and grotesque&quot; but also &quot;compelling and exciting... especially considering the ideas that it touches upon (E.g. genetic memory, consciousness, &amp; reality).&quot; The reviewer muses, &quot;I think that some consider this to fall into the horror genre, but I don&#x27;t know if I agree fully. Suspenseful? Sure. Body horror? Absolutely. But I don&#x27;t think that the horror elements are really the focus. A stunner for sure, highly recommended.&quot;

The novel won the 1986 Prix Apollo Award, given to the best science fiction novel published in France during the preceding year, under the title &quot;La Musique du sang&quot;. It was also nominated for the Nebula Award in 1985 and for the Hugo, Campbell, and British Science Fiction Awards in 1986.

==Notes==
:1.Reviewer Martin Lewis writes, &quot;What he has injected himself with is a solution containing cellular organisms, noocytes, as intelligent as rhesus monkeys. These noocytes continue to evolve within him, getting smarter, learning about his body.&quot; The term derives from the Greek &quot;noos&quot; or &quot;nous&quot;, indicating &quot;mind, intelligence, perception, intellect.&quot;

<text>The Third Battle of Ypres (; ; ), also known as the Battle of Passchendaele ( ), was a campaign of the First World War, fought by the Allies against the German Empire. The battle took place on the Western Front, from July to November 1917, for control of the ridges south and east of the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders, as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917. Passchendaele lies on the last ridge east of Ypres, from Roulers (now Roeselare), a junction of the Bruges-(Brugge)-to-Kortrijk railway. The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German 4th Army. Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured, the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout (now Torhout) to Couckelaere (Koekelare).

Further operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport (Nieuwpoort), combined with an amphibious landing (Operation Hush), were to have reached Bruges and then the Dutch frontier. Although a general withdrawal had seemed inevitable in early October, the Germans were able to avoid one due to the resistance of the 4th Army, unusually wet weather in August, the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to Italy. The campaign ended in November, when the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year. The Battle of the Lys (Fourth Battle of Ypres) and the Fifth Battle of Ypres of 1918, were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.

A campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. The British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, opposed the offensive, as did General Ferdinand Foch, the Chief of Staff of the French Army. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July. Matters of dispute by the participants, writers and historians since 1917 include the wisdom of pursuing an offensive strategy in the wake of the Nivelle Offensive, rather than waiting for the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France.

Remaining controversial are the choice of Flanders, its climate, the selection of General Hubert Gough and the Fifth Army to conduct the offensive, and debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives. Also debated are the time between the Battle of Messines and the first Allied attack (the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, 31 July), the extent to which the French Army mutinies influenced the British, the effect of the exceptional weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human costs of the campaign.
==Background==

===Flanders===

====1914====

Belgium had been recognised in the Treaty of London (1839) as a sovereign and neutral state after the secession of the southern provinces of the Netherlands in 1830. The German invasion of Belgium on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the treaty, was the British against Germany. British military operations in Belgium began with the arrival of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) at Mons on 22 August. Operations in Flanders began during the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the French and German armies to turn their opponents&#x27; northern flank, through Picardy, Artois and Flanders. On 10 October, Lieutenant-General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Chief of Staff of the (OHL, supreme army command), ordered an attack towards Dunkirk and Calais, followed by a turn south behind the Allied armies, to gain a decisive victory. On 16 October, the Belgians and some French reinforcements began the defence of western Belgium and the French Channel ports, at the Battle of the Yser. When the German offensive failed, Falkenhayn ordered the capture of Ypres to gain a local advantage. By 18 November, the First Battle of Ypres had also ended in failure, at a cost of casualties. In December, the British Admiralty began discussions with the War Office, for a combined operation to re-occupy the Belgian coast but were obliged to conform to French strategy and participate in offensives further south.

====1915====

Large British offensive operations in Flanders were not possible in 1915, due to a lack of resources. The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 15 May 1915), making the Ypres salient more costly to defend. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December. A week after his appointment, Haig met Rear-Admiral Reginald Bacon, who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by German U-boats. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.

====1916====


Minor operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from their preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later attempts to divert Allied resources from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinghe and on 14 February at Hooge and Sanctuary Wood. There were actions from and at The Bluff, April at the St Eloi Craters and the Battle of Mont Sorrel from In January 1917, the Second Army (General Herbert Plumer) with the II Anzac, IX, X and VIII corps, held the Western Front in Flanders from Laventie to Boesinghe, with eleven divisions and up to two in reserve. There was much trench mortaring, mining and raiding by both sides and from January to May, the Second Army suffered In May, reinforcements began arriving in Flanders from the south; the II Corps headquarters and had arrived by the end of the month.

In January 1916, Plumer began to plan offensives against Messines Ridge, Lille and Houthulst Forest. General Henry Rawlinson was also ordered to plan an attack from the Ypres Salient on 4 February; planning continued but the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme took up the rest of the year. In November, Haig, the French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre and the other Allies met at Chantilly. The commanders agreed on a strategy of simultaneous attacks, to overwhelm the Central Powers on the Western, Eastern and Italian fronts, by the first fortnight of February 1917. A meeting in London of the Admiralty and the General Staff urged that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917 and Joffre replied on 8 December, agreeing to a Flanders campaign after the spring offensive. The plan for a year of attrition offensives on the Western Front, with the main effort to be made in the summer by the BEF, was scrapped by the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle in favour of a return to a strategy of decisive battle.

===Allied strategy===

Nivelle planned preliminary offensives to pin German reserves by the British at Arras and the French between the Somme and the Oise, then a French breakthrough offensive on the Aisne, followed by pursuit and exploitation. Haig had reservations and on 6 January Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to a breakthrough, the operations would be stopped and the British could move their forces north for the Flanders offensive, which was of great importance to the British government. On 23 January, Haig wrote that it would take six weeks to move British troops and equipment to Flanders and on 14 March, noted that the Messines Ridge operation could begin in May. On 21 March, he wrote to Nivelle that it would take two months to prepare the offensive from Messines to Steenstraat but that the Messines operation could be ready in five or six weeks. The main French attack took place from 9 April to 9 May and failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 16 May, Haig wrote that he had divided the Flanders operation into two parts, one to take Messines Ridge and the main attack several weeks later. British determination to clear the Belgian coast took on more urgency after the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917. On 1 May 1917, Haig wrote that the Nivelle Offensive had weakened the German army but that an attempt at a decisive blow would be premature. The wearing-out process would continue on a front where the Germans had no room to retreat. Even limited success would improve the tactical situation in the Ypres salient, reducing the exceptional wastage, even in quiet periods. In early May, Haig set the date for the Flanders offensive, the attack on Messines Ridge to begin on 7 June.

===Kerensky offensive===


The Russian army conducted the Kerensky Offensive in Galicia, to honour the agreement struck with the Allies at the Chantilly meeting of 15 to 16 November 1916. After a brief period of success from 1 to 19 July, the Russian offensive was contained by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, which counter-attacked and forced the Russian armies to retreat. On the Baltic coast from 1 to 5 September 1917, the Germans attacked with their strategic reserve of six divisions and captured Riga. In Operation Albion (September–October 1917), the Germans took the islands at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga. The British and French commanders on the Western Front had to reckon on the German western army () being strengthened by reinforcements from the on the Eastern Front by late 1917. Haig wished to exploit the diversion of German forces in Russia for as long as it continued and urged the British War Cabinet to commit the maximum amount of manpower and munitions to the battle in Flanders.

==Prelude==

===Ypres salient===

Ypres is overlooked by Kemmel Hill in the south-west and from the east by a line of low hills running south-west to north-east. Wytschaete (Wijtschate) and Hill 60 are to the east of Verbrandenmolen, Hooge, Polygon Wood and Passchendaele (Passendale). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, from Ypres, while at Hollebeke the ridge is distant and recedes to at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about above the plain; on the Ypres–Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about and at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of Zonnebeke, which has a gradient of From Hooge and further east, the slope is near Hollebeke, it is heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs south-east to Messines (Mesen) with a gentle slope on the east side and a westwards. Further south, is the muddy valley of the River Douve, Ploegsteert Wood (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem (Spanbroekmolen) Spur and on the east side, the Oosttaverne Spur, which is also parallel to the main ridge. The general aspect south and east of Ypres, is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele, into a featureless plain.

Possession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres, gives an army ample scope for ground observation, enfilade fire and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size, like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and Sanctuary Wood. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks tangled with barbed wire and more wire festooning the ground, which was full of shell-holes; fields in the gaps between the woods were wide and devoid of cover. The main road to Ypres from Poperinge to Vlamertinge is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. Roads in the area were unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses dotted along them. The lowland west of the ridge was a mixture of meadows and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and a network of drainage ditches emptying into canals.

=== Topography ===

In Flanders, sands, gravels and marls predominate, covered by silts in places. The coastal strip is sandy but a short way into the hinterland, the ground rises towards the Vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden. Ypres is above sea level; Bixschoote to the north is at . To the east the land is at for several miles, with the Steenbeek river at near St Julien. There is a low ridge from Messines, at its highest point, running north-east past Clapham Junction at the west end of Gheluvelt plateau ( miles from Ypres at and Gheluvelt, above to Passchendaele, ( miles from Ypres at declining from there to a plain further north. Gradients vary from negligible, to at Hooge and at Zonnebeke.

Underneath the soil is London clay, sand and silt; according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission categories of &quot;sand&quot;, &quot;sandy soils&quot; and &quot;well-balanced soils&quot;, Messines ridge is well-balanced soil and the ground around Ypres is sandy soil. The ground is drained by many streams, canals and ditches, which need regular maintenance. Since 1914 much of the drainage had been destroyed, though some parts were restored by land drainage companies from England. The British considered the area drier than Loos, Givenchy and Plugstreet Wood further south. A study of weather data recorded at Lille, from Ypres from published in 1989, showed that August was more often dry than wet, that there was a trend towards dry autumns (September–November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased since the 1860s.

===British plans===

Preparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck–Ypres rail line and the building of a new line from Bergues to Proven, which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917, gave the area the most efficient supply system of the BEF. Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916, the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders. On 14 February 1917, Colonel Norman MacMullen of GHQ proposed that the plateau be taken by a massed tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain Giffard LeQuesne Martel found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.

On 9 February, Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army, suggested that Messines Ridge could be taken in one day and that the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau should be fundamental to the attack further north. He suggested that the southern attack from St Yves to Mont Sorrel should come first and that Mont Sorrel to Steenstraat should be attacked within After discussions with Rawlinson and Plumer and the incorporation of Haig&#x27;s changes, Macmullen submitted his memorandum on 14 February. With amendments the memorandum became the &quot;GHQ 1917&quot; plan. A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig gave his objectives to his army commanders, the wearing out of the enemy, securing the Belgian coast and connecting with the Dutch frontier by capturing Passchendaele ridge, followed by an advance on Roulers and Operation Hush, an attack along the coast with a combined amphibious landing. If manpower and artillery were insufficient, only the first part of the plan might be fulfilled. On 30 April, Haig told Gough, the Fifth Army commander, that he would lead the Northern Operation and the coastal force, although Cabinet approval for the offensive was not granted until 21 June.

===German defences===


The 4th Army held a front of with three , composed of a corps headquarters and a varying complement of divisions; Group Staden, based on the headquarters of the Guards Reserve Corps was added later. Group Dixmude held with four front divisions and two divisions, Group Ypres held from Pilckem to Menin Road with three front divisions and two divisions and Group held a similar length of front south of the Menin road, with three front divisions and three divisions. The divisions were stationed behind the Menin and Passchendaele ridges. About further back, were four more divisions and beyond them, another two in OHL reserve.

The Germans were anxious that the British would attempt to exploit the victory of the Battle of Messines, with an advance to the Tower Hamlets spur beyond the north end of Messines Ridge. On 9 June, Crown Prince Rupprecht proposed a withdrawal to the line east of Messines. Construction of defences began but was terminated after Fritz von Loßberg was appointed Chief of Staff of the 4th Army. Loßberg rejected the proposed withdrawal to the line and ordered that the front line east of the &quot;Oosttaverne&quot; line be held rigidly. The (Flanders Position) along Passchendaele Ridge, in front of the line, would become and a new position, , would run west of Menin, northwards to Passchendaele. Construction of a east of Menin northwards to Moorslede was also begun. From July 1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by the front position, the (second position), (third position), (fourth position), (fifth position) and , the sixth position (incomplete). Between the German defences lay villages such as Zonnebeke and Passchendaele, which were fortified and prepared for all-round defence.

On 25 June, Erich Ludendorff, the First Quartermaster General, suggested to Crown Prince Rupprecht that Group Ypres should withdraw to the , leaving only outposts in the . On 30 June, the army group Chief of Staff, General von Kuhl, suggested a withdrawal to the along Passchendaele ridge, meeting the old front line in the north near Langemarck and Armentières in the south. Such a withdrawal would avoid a hasty retreat from Pilckem Ridge and force the British into a time-consuming redeployment. Loßberg disagreed, believing that the British would launch a broad front offensive, that the ground east of the was easy to defend and that the Menin road ridge could be held if it was made the (point of main effort) of the German defensive system. Pilckem Ridge deprived the British of ground observation over the Steenbeek Valley, while the Germans could see the area from Passchendaele Ridge, allowing German infantry to be supported by observed artillery-fire. Loßberg&#x27;s judgement was accepted and no withdrawal was made.

===Battle of Messines===


The first stage in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German positions south of Ypres at Messines Ridge. The Germans on the ridge had observation over Ypres and unless it was captured, observed enfilade artillery-fire could be fired against a British attack from the salient further north. Since mid-1915, the British had been mining under the German positions on the ridge and by June 1917, 21 mines had been filled with nearly of explosives. The Germans knew the British were mining and had taken counter-measures but they were surprised at the extent of the British effort. Two of the mines failed to detonate but off on 7 June, at British Summer Time. The final objectives were largely gained before dark and the British had fewer losses than the expected the initial attack. As the infantry advanced over the far edge of the ridge, German artillery and machine-guns east of the ridge opened fire and the British artillery was less able to suppress them. The attack removed the Germans from the dominating ground on the southern face of the Ypres salient, which the 4th Army had held since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914.

==Battles==

===JulyAugust===


Haig selected Gough to command the offensive on 30 April and on 10 June Gough and the Fifth Army headquarters took over the Ypres salient north of Messines Ridge. Gough planned an offensive based on the &quot;GHQ 1917&quot; plan and the instructions he had received from Haig. Gough held meetings with his corps commanders on 6 and 16 June, where the third objective, which included the (third line), a second-day objective in earlier plans, was added to the two objectives due to be taken on the first day. A fourth objective, the red line, was also given for the first day, to be attempted by fresh troops, at the discretion of divisional and corps commanders, in places where the German defence had collapsed. The attack was not planned as a breakthrough operation and , the fourth German defensive position, lay behind the front line and was not an objective on the first day.

The Fifth Army plan was more ambitious than the plans devised by Rawlinson and Plumer, which had involved an advance of on the first day, by compressing their first three attacks into one day instead of three. Major-General John Davidson, Director of Operations at GHQ, wrote in a memorandum that there was &quot;ambiguity as to what was meant by a step-by-step attack with limited objectives&quot; and suggested reverting to a advance on the first day to increase the concentration of British artillery. Gough stressed the need to plan to exploit opportunities to take ground left temporarily undefended, more likely in the first attack, which would have the benefit of long preparation. This had not been done in earlier battles and vacant ground, there for the taking, had been re-occupied by the Germans. At the end of June, Haig added a division to II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob) from the Second Army and next day, after meeting with Gough and General Herbert Plumer, the Second Army commander, Haig endorsed the Fifth Army plan.

====Battle of Pilckem Ridge====


The British attack began at on 31 July; the attack was to commence at dawn but a layer of unbroken low cloud meant that it was still dark when the infantry advanced. The main attack, by II Corps across the Ghelveult Plateau to the south, confronted the principal German defensive concentration of artillery, ground-holding divisions () and divisions. The attack had most success on the northern flank, on the fronts of XIV Corps and the French First Army, both of which advanced to the line of the Steenbeek river. In the centre, XVIII Corps and XIX Corps pushed forward to the line of the Steenbeek (black line) to consolidate and sent fresh troops towards the green line and on the XIX Corps front to the red line, for an advance of about . Group Ypres counter-attacked the flanks of the British break-in, supported by every artillery piece and aircraft within range, around noon. The Germans were able to drive the three British brigades back to the black line with casualties; the German advance was stopped at the black line by mud, artillery and machine-gun fire.

====Capture of Westhoek====


After rain delays from 2 August, II Corps attacked again on 10 August, to capture the rest of the black line (second objective) on the Gheluvelt plateau. The infantry advance succeeded but German artillery-fire and infantry counter-attacks isolated the infantry of the 18th (Eastern) Division in Glencorse Wood. At about German infantry attacked behind a smokescreen and recaptured all but the north-west corner of the wood; only the 25th Division gains on Westhoek Ridge to the north were held. Lieutenant-Colonel Albrecht von Thaer, Chief of Staff of (Group Wytschaete, the headquarters of the IX Reserve Corps), noted that casualties after in the line averaged compared to on the Somme in 1916 and that German troop morale was higher than the year before.

====Battle of Hill 70====

Attacks to threaten Lens and Lille were to be made by the First Army in late June near Gavrelle and Oppy, along the Souchez river. The objective was to eliminate a German salient between Avion and the west end of Lens, by taking reservoir Hill (Hill 65) and Hill 70. The attacks were conducted earlier than planned to use heavy and siege artillery before it was transferred to Ypres, the Souchez operation being cut back and the attack on Hill 70 postponed. The Battle of Hill 70, south of Ypres, eventually took place from 15 to 25 August. The Canadian Corps fought four divisions of the German 6th Army in the operation. The capture of Hill 70 was a costly success in which three Canadian divisions inflicted many casualties on the German divisions opposite and pinned down troops reserved for the relief of tired divisions in Flanders. Hermann von Kuhl, chief of staff of Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht, wrote later that it was a costly defeat and wrecked the plan for relieving fought-out (exhausted) divisions in Flanders.

====Battle of Langemarck====

The Battle of Langemarck was fought from the Fifth Army headquarters was influenced by the effect that delay would have on Operation Hush, which needed the high tides due at the end of August or it would have to be postponed for a month. Gough intended that the rest of the green line, just beyond the (German third line), from Polygon Wood to Langemarck, was to be captured and the Steenbeek crossed further north. In the II Corps area, the disappointment of 10 August was repeated, with the infantry managing to advance, then being isolated by German artillery and forced back to their start line by German counter-attacks, except in the 25th Division area near Westhoek. Attempts by the German infantry to advance further were stopped by British artillery-fire with many casualties. The advance further north in the XVIII Corps area retook and held the north end of St Julien and the area south-east of Langemarck, while XIV Corps captured Langemarck and the north of the Ypres–Staden railway, near the Kortebeek stream. The French First Army conformed, pushing up to the Kortebeek and St Jansbeck stream west of the northern stretch of the , where it crossed to the east side of the Kortebeek.

====Local attacks====


On the higher ground, the Germans continued to inflict many losses on the British divisions beyond Langemarck but on 19 August, after two fine dry days, XVIII Corps conducted a novel infantry, tank, aircraft and artillery operation. German strongpoints and pillboxes along the St Julien–Poelcappelle road in front of the were captured. On 22 August, more ground was gained by XIX and XVIII corps but the tactical disadvantage of being overlooked by the Germans continued. A II Corps attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau from 22 to 24 August, to capture Nonne Bosschen, Glencorse Wood and Inverness Copse, failed in fighting that was costly to both sides. Gough laid down a new infantry formation of skirmish lines to be followed by &quot;worms&quot; on 24 August and Cavan noted that pillboxes should be attacked on a broad front, to engage them simultaneously. Another general offensive intended for 25 August, was delayed by the failure of the preliminary attacks and then postponed due to more bad weather. On 27 August, II Corps tried a combined tank and infantry attack but the tanks bogged, the attack failed and Haig called a halt to operations until the weather improved.

====Weather====

In &quot;Field Marshal Earl Haig&quot; (1929), Brigadier-General John Charteris, the BEF Chief of Intelligence from 1915 to 1918, wrote that

only the first part of which was quoted by Lloyd George (1934), Liddell Hart (1934) and Leon Wolff (1959); in a 1997 essay, John Hussey called the passage by Charteris &quot;baffling&quot;. The BEF had set up a Meteorological Section under Ernest Gold in 1915, which by the end of 1917 had and The section predicted the warm weather and thunderstorms of 7 to 14 June; in a letter to the press of 17 January 1958, Gold wrote that the facts of the Flanders climate contradicted Charteris. In 1989, Philip Griffiths examined August weather in Flanders for the thirty years before 1916 and found that,

From 1901 to 1916, records from a weather station at Cap Gris Nez showed that of August days were dry and that from 1913 to 1916, there were rainless days and monthly rainfall of ;

There were of rain in August 1917 and of the total fell on The month was overcast and windless, which much reduced evaporation. Divided into two ten-day and an eleven-day period, there were of rain; in the before on 31 July, fell. From on 31 July to on 4 August, there was another of rain. August 1917 had three dry days and with less than of rain. Three days were sunless and one had six minutes of sunshine; from 1 to 27 August there were of sunshine, an average of per day. Hussey wrote that the wet weather in August 1917 was exceptional and that Haig had been justified in expecting little rain and that it would be dried swiftly by sunshine and breezes.

====Verdun====

Petain had committed the French Second Army to an attack at Verdun in mid-July, in support of the Flanders offensive. The attack was delayed, partly due to mutinies in the French army after the failure of the Nivelle Offensive and because of a German attack at Verdun from 28 to 29 June, which captured some of the French jumping-off points. A French counter-attack on 17 July re-captured the ground, the Germans regained it on 1 August, then took ground on the east bank on 16 August. The French attacked on 20 August and by 9 September had taken Sporadic fighting continued into October, adding to the German difficulties on the Western Front and elsewhere. Ludendorff wrote

No German counter-attack was possible because the local divisions had been transferred to Flanders.

===September–October===


The 4th Army had held on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its casualties worsened the German manpower shortage. Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres–Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau. Plumer continued the tactical evolution of the Fifth Army during its slow and costly progress in August. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in four steps, with six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies. The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigade tactics were changed to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice on 31 July, to adapt to the dispersed defences being encountered between the and the .

Plumer arranged for the medium and heavy artillery reinforcements reaching Flanders to be added to the creeping bombardment, which had been impossible with the amount of artillery available to the Fifth Army. The tactical changes ensured that more infantry attacked on narrower fronts, to a shallower depth than on 31 July, like the Fifth Army attacks in August. The shorter and quicker advances possible once the ground dried were intended to be consolidated on tactically advantageous ground, especially on any reverse slopes in the area, with the infantry still in contact with the artillery and aircraft, ready to repulse counter-attacks. The faster tempo of operations was intended to add to German difficulties in replacing tired divisions through the railway bottlenecks behind the German front. The pause in British attacks misled some of the German commanders and Albrecht von Thaer, the chief of staff of , wrote that it was &quot;almost boring&quot;. Kuhl doubted that the offensive had ended but had changed his mind by 13 September; two divisions, thirteen heavy artillery batteries, twelve field batteries, three fighter squadrons and four other units of the were transferred from the 4th Army.

====German tactical changes====

After setting objectives distant on 31 July, the British attempted shorter advances of approximately in August but were unable to achieve these lesser objectives in the south of the battlefield, because the rain soaked ground and poor visibility were to the advantage of the defenders. After the dry spell in early September, British advances had been much quicker and the final objective was reached a few hours after dawn, which confounded the German counter-attack divisions. Having crossed of mud, the divisions found the British already dug in, with the German forward battle zone and its weak garrison gone beyond recapture. In August, German front-line divisions had two regiments deployed in the front line, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected due to the power of British attacks, constant artillery-fire and the weather. Replacement units became mixed up with ones holding the front and reserve regiments had failed to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until divisions arrived some hours later.

In July and August, German counter-attack () divisions had conducted an &quot;advance to contact during mobile operations&quot;, which had given the Germans several costly defensive successes. After the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, German tactics were changed. After another defeat on 26 September, the German commanders made more tactical changes to counter the more conservative form of limited attacks adopted by the British. German counter-attacks in September had been &quot;assaults on reinforced field positions&quot;, due to the restrained nature of British infantry advances. The fine weather in early September had greatly eased British supply difficulties, especially in ammunition and the British made time to establish a defence in depth on captured ground, protected by standing artillery barrages. The British attacked in dry, clear conditions, with more aircraft over the battlefield for counter-attack reconnaissance, contact patrol and ground-attack operations. Systematic defensive artillery-fire was forfeited by the Germans, due to uncertainty over the position of their infantry, just when the British infantry benefited from the opposite. German counter-attacks were costly failures and on 28 September, Thaer wrote that the experience was &quot;awful&quot; and that he did not know what to do.

Ludendorff ordered the (ground holding divisions) to reinforce their front garrisons; all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every . The were reinforced by the (shock) regiments of divisions, which were moved into the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, to counter-attack sooner. The other regiments of the divisions were to be held back and used for a methodical counter-attack () a day or two after and for spoiling attacks as the British reorganised. More tactical changes were ordered on 30 September; operations to increase British infantry losses were to continue and gas bombardments were to be increased, weather permitting. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions with infantry for the German artillery to bombard them. Between 26 September and 3 October, the Germans attacked at least and Operation High Storm , a (methodical counter-attack), to recapture the area around Zonnebeke was planned for 4 October.

====Battle of the Menin Road Ridge====


The British plan for the battle fought from included more emphasis on the use of heavy and medium artillery to destroy German concrete pill-boxes and machine-gun nests, which were more numerous in the battle zones being attacked, than behind the original July front line and to engage in more counter-battery fire. The British had and medium and guns and howitzers, more than double the quantity of artillery available at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge. Aircraft were to be used for systematic air observation of German troop movements, to avoid the failures of previous battles, where too few aircrews had been burdened with too many duties and had flown in bad weather, which made their difficulties worse.

On 20 September, the Allies attacked on a front and by mid-morning had captured most of their objectives, to a depth of about . The Germans made many hasty counter-attacks (), beginning around until early evening, all of which failed to gain ground or made only a temporary penetration of the new British positions. The German defence had failed to stop a well-prepared attack made in good weather. Minor attacks took place after 20 September, as both sides jockeyed for position and reorganised their defences. A mutually-costly attack by the Germans on 25 September, recaptured pillboxes at the south western end of Polygon Wood. Next day, the German positions near the wood were swept away in the Battle of Polygon Wood.

====German counter-attack, 25 September====

Two regiments of the German 50th Reserve Division attacked on a front, either side of the Reutelbeek stream, supported by aircraft and and batteries of artillery, four times the usual amount for a division. The German infantry managed to advance on the flanks, about near the Menin road and north of the Reutelbeek. The infantry were supported by artillery-observation and ground-attack aircraft; a box-barrage was fired behind the British front-line, which isolated the British infantry from reinforcements and ammunition. Return-fire from the 33rd Division and the 15th Australian Brigade of the 5th Australian Division along the southern edge of Polygon Wood to the north, forced the attackers under cover around some of the pillboxes, near Black Watch Corner, at the south-western edge of Polygon Wood. German attempts to reinforce the attacking troops failed, due to British artillery observers isolating the advanced German troops with artillery barrages.

Plumer ordered the attack due on 26 September to go ahead but reduced the objectives of the 33rd Division. The 98th Brigade was to advance and cover the right flank of the 5th Australian Division and the 100th Brigade was to re-capture the lost ground further south. The 5th Australian Division advance the next day began with uncertainty as to the security of its right flank; the attack of the depleted 98th Brigade was delayed and only managed to reach Black Watch Corner, short of its objectives. Reinforcements moved into the 5th Australian Division area and attacked south-westwards at noon as a silent (without artillery support) frontal attack was made from Black Watch Corner, because British troops were known to be holding out in the area. The attack succeeded by and later in the afternoon, the 100th Brigade re-took the ground lost north of the Menin road. Casualties in the 33rd Division were so great that it was relieved on 27 September by the 23rd Division, which had only been withdrawn on the night of 

====Battle of Polygon Wood====


The Second Army altered its Corps frontages soon after the attack of 20 September, for the next effort so that each attacking division could be concentrated on a front. Roads and light railways were extended to the new front line, to allow artillery and ammunition to be moved forward. The artillery of VIII Corps and IX Corps on the southern flank, simulated preparations for attacks on Zandvoorde and Warneton. At on 26 September, five layers of barrage fired by British artillery and machine-guns began. Dust and smoke thickened the morning mist and the infantry advanced using compass bearings. Each of the three German ground-holding divisions attacked on 26 September had an division in support, twice the ratio of 20 September. No ground captured by the British was lost and German counter-attacks managed only to reach ground to which survivors of the front-line divisions had retired.

===October–November===

====German counter-attacks, 30 September – 4 October====

At on 30 September, a thick mist covered the ground and at German artillery began a bombardment between the Menin road and the Reutelbeek. At German troops emerged from the mist on an front. The attack was supported by flame-throwers and German infantry throwing smoke- and hand-grenades. The British replied with small-arms fire and bombs, forcing the Germans to retreat in confusion but a post was lost south of the Menin road, then retaken by an immediate counter-attack. SOS rockets were not seen in the mist and the British artillery remained silent. The Germans were repulsed again at but German artillery-fire continued during the day.

On 1 October, at a German hurricane bombardment began from the Reutelbeek north to Polygon Wood and Black Watch Corner; by coincidence a Second Army practice barrage began at The British front line was cut off and German infantry attacked in three waves at Two determined German attacks were repulsed south of Cameron Covert, then at German troops massed near the Menin road. The German attack was defeated by small-arms fire and the British artillery, whose observers had seen the SOS rockets. The British were forced out of Cameron Covert and counter-attacked but a German attack began at the same time and the British were repulsed. Another German attack failed and the German troops dug in behind some old German barbed wire; after dark, more German attacks around Cameron Covert failed. North of the covert near Polygon Wood, deep mud smothered German shells before they exploded but they still caused many casualties. Communication with the rear was lost and the Germans attacked all day but British SOS rockets remained visible and the attacks took no ground; after dark German attacks were repulsed by another three SOS barrages.

 (Operation High Storm) was planned by to recapture the Tokio Spur from Zonnebeke south to Molenaarelsthoek at the eastern edge of Polygon Wood on 3 October. The attacking infantry from the 45th Reserve and the 4th Guard divisions were commanded by Major Freiherr von Schleinitz in the north and Lieutenant-Colonel Rave in the south. After the costly failure of the methodical counter-attack ( ) on 1 October, the attack was put back to 4 October, rehearsals taking place from 2 to 3 October. On the night of the German commanders had doubts about the attack but decided to proceed with the , warning the artillery to be ready to commence defensive bombardments. A contact patrol aircraft was arranged to fly over the area at 

====Battle of Broodseinde====

On 4 October, the British began the Battle of Broodseinde to complete the capture of the Gheluvelt Plateau and occupy Broodseinde Ridge. By coincidence, the Germans sought to recapture their defences around Zonnebeke with a at the same time. The British attacked along a front and as the I Anzac Corps divisions began their advance towards Broodseinde Ridge, men were seen rising from shell-holes in no man&#x27;s land and more German troops were found concealed in shell-craters. Most of the German troops of the 45th Reserve Division were overrun or retreated through the British barrage, then the Australians attacked pillboxes one-by-one and captured the village of Zonnebeke north of the ridge. When the British barrage began on Broodseinde Ridge, the Keiberg Spur and Waterdamhoek, some of the German forward headquarters staffs only realised that they were under attack when British and Australian troops appeared.

As news arrived of the great success of the attack, the head of GHQ Intelligence went to the Second Army headquarters to discuss exploitation. Plumer declined the suggestion, as eight fresh German divisions were behind the battlefield, with another six beyond them. Later in the day, Plumer had second thoughts and ordered I Anzac Corps to push on to the Keiberg spur, with support from the II Anzac Corps. The II Anzac Corps commander wanted to advance north-east towards Passchendaele village but the I Anzac Corps commander preferred to wait until artillery had been brought up and supply routes improved. The X Corps commander proposed an attack northward from In de Ster into the southern flank of the Germans opposite I Anzac Corps. The 7th Division commander objected, due to uncertainty about the situation and the many casualties suffered by the 21st Division on the right flank and Plumer changed his mind again. During the morning, Gough had told the Fifth Army corps commanders to push on but when reports arrived of a repulse at 19 Metre Hill, the order was cancelled.

====German defensive changes====


On 7 October, the 4th Army again dispersed its troops in the front defence zone. Reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and the divisions were organised to intervene as swiftly as possible once an attack commenced, despite the risk of British artillery-fire. Counter-battery fire to suppress the British artillery was to be increased, to protect the divisions as they advanced. All of the German divisions holding front zones were relieved and an extra division brought forward, because the British advances had lengthened the front line. Without the divisions necessary for a counter-offensive south of the Gheluvelt Plateau towards Kemmel Hill, Rupprecht began to plan for a slow withdrawal from the Ypres Salient, even at the risk of uncovering German positions further north and on the Belgian coast.

====Battle of Poelcappelle====

The French First Army and British Second and Fifth armies attacked on 9 October, on a front, from south of Broodseinde to St Jansbeek, to advance half of the distance from Broodseinde ridge to Passchendaele, on the main front, which led to many casualties on both sides. Advances in the north of the attack front were retained by British and French troops but most of the ground taken in front of Passchendaele and on the Becelaere and Gheluvelt spurs was lost to German counter-attacks. General William Birdwood later wrote that the return of heavy rain and mud sloughs was the main cause of the failure to hold captured ground. Kuhl concluded that the fighting strained German fighting power to the limit but that the German forces managed to prevent a breakthrough, although it was becoming much harder to replace losses.

====First Battle of Passchendaele====


The First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October 1917 was another Allied attempt to gain ground around Passchendaele. Heavy rain and mud again made movement difficult and little artillery could be brought closer to the front. Allied troops were exhausted and morale had fallen. After a modest British advance, German counter-attacks recovered most of the ground lost opposite Passchendaele, except for an area on the right of the Wallemolen spur. North of Poelcappelle, the XIV Corps of the Fifth Army advanced along the Broembeek some way up the Watervlietbeek and the Stadenrevebeek streams and the Guards Division captured the west end of the Vijwegen spur, gaining observation over the south end of Houthulst Forest. There were casualties, including Zealanders, whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man&#x27;s-land; it was one of the worst days in New Zealand military history.

At a conference on 13 October, Haig and the army commanders agreed that attacks would stop until the weather improved and roads could be extended, to carry more artillery and ammunition forward. The offensive was to continue, to reach a suitable line for the winter and to keep German attention on Flanders, with a French attack due on 23 October and the Third Army operation south of Arras scheduled for mid-November. The battle was also costly for the Germans, who lost more than The German 195th Division at Passchendaele suffered casualties from 9 to 12 October and had to be relieved by the 238th Division. Ludendorff became optimistic that Passchendaele Ridge could be held and ordered the 4th Army to stand fast. On 18 October, Kuhl advocated a retreat as far to the east as possible; Sixt von Armin and Loßberg wanted to hold on, because the ground beyond the Passchendaele watershed was untenable, even in winter.

==== Action of 22 October ====
On 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps attacked the east end of Poelcappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into Houthulst Forest. The attack was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank of the 35th Division and was intended to obstruct a possible German counter-attack on the left flank of the Canadian Corps as it attacked Passchendaele and the ridge. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division reached the fringe of Houthulst Forest but was outflanked and pushed back in places. German counter-attacks made after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November 1917).

====Battle of La Malmaison====

After numerous requests from Haig, Petain began the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by the Sixth Army (General Paul Maistre). The artillery preparation started on 17 October and on 23 October, the German defenders were swiftly defeated and the French advanced up to , capturing the village and fort of La Malmaison, gaining control of the Chemin des Dames ridge. The Germans lost killed or missing and along with and against casualties, fewer than a third of the German total. The Germans had to withdraw from their remaining positions on the Chemin des Dames to the north of the Ailette Valley early in November. Haig was pleased with the French success but regretted the delay, which had lessened its effect on the Flanders operations.

====Second Battle of Passchendaele====

The British Fifth Army undertook minor operations from to maintain pressure on the Germans and support the French attack at La Malmaison, while the Canadian Corps prepared for a series of attacks from The four divisions of the Canadian Corps had been transferred to the Ypres Salient from Lens, to capture Passchendaele and the ridge. The Canadians relieved the II Anzac Corps on 18 October and found that the front line was mostly the same as that occupied by the 1st Canadian Division back in April 1915. The Canadian operation was to be three limited attacks, on 26 October, 30 October and 6 November. On 26 October, the 3rd Canadian Division captured its objective at Wolf Copse, then swung back its northern flank to link with the adjacent division of the Fifth Army. The 4th Canadian Division captured its objectives but was forced slowly to retire from Decline Copse by German counter-attacks and communication failures between the Canadians and the Australian units to the south.

The second stage began on 30 October, to complete the previous stage and gain a base for the final assault on Passchendaele. The attackers on the southern flank quickly captured Crest Farm and sent patrols beyond the final objective into Passchendaele. The attack on the northern flank again met with exceptional German resistance. The 3rd Canadian Division captured Vapour Farm on the corps boundary, Furst Farm to the west of Meetcheele and the crossroads at Meetcheele but remained short of its objective. During a seven-day pause, the Second Army took over another section of the Fifth Army front adjoining the Canadian Corps. Three rainless days from eased preparation for the next stage, which began on the morning of 6 November, with the 1st Canadian Division and the 2nd Canadian Division. In less than three hours, many units reached their final objectives and Passchendaele was captured. The Canadian Corps attacked on 10 November to gain control of the remaining high ground north of the village near 

===December===

====Night action of 1/2 December 1917====

On 18 November the VIII Corps on the right and II Corps on the left (northern) side of the Passchendaele Salient took over from the Canadian Corps. The area was subjected to constant German artillery bombardments and its vulnerability to attack led to a suggestion by Brigadier C. F. Aspinall, that either the British should retire to the west side of the Gheluvelt Plateau or advance to broaden the salient towards Westroosebeke. Expanding the salient would make the troops in it less vulnerable to German artillery-fire and provide a better jumping off line for a resumption of the offensive in the spring of 1918. The British attacked towards Westroozebeke on the night of 1/2 December but the plan to mislead the Germans by not bombarding the German defences until eight minutes after the infantry began their advance came undone. The noise of the British assembly and the difficulty of moving across muddy and waterlogged ground had also alerted the Germans. In the moonlight, the Germans had seen the British troops when they were still away. Some ground was captured and about were taken but the attack on the redoubts failed and observation over the heads of the valleys on the east and north sides of the ridge was not achieved.

====Action on the Polderhoek Spur====

The attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917, was a local operation by the British Fourth Army (renamed from the Second Army on 8 November). Two battalions of the 2nd New Zealand Brigade of the New Zealand Division attacked the low ridge, from which German observers could view the area from Cameron Covert to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. A New Zealand advance of on a front, would shield the area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers on the Gheluvelt spur. Heavy artillery bombarded the ruins of Polderhoek Château and the pillboxes in the grounds to mislead the defenders and the attack was made in daylight as a ruse to surprise the Germans, who would be under cover sheltering from the routine bombardments. Smoke and gas bombardments on the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs on the flanks and the infantry attack began at the same time as the &quot;routine&quot; bombardment. The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders and the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge. A strong west wind ruined the smoke screens and the British artillery failed to suppress the German machine-guns. New Zealand machine-gunners repulsed a counter-attack but the New Zealand infantry were short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and the arrival of German reinforcements.

==Aftermath==

=== Analysis ===
In a German General Staff publication, it was written that &quot;Germany had been brought near to certain destruction () by the Flanders battle of 1917&quot;. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot; of 1938, Lloyd George wrote, &quot;Passchendaele was indeed one of the greatest disasters of the war ... No soldier of any intelligence now defends this senseless campaign ...&quot;. In 1939, G. C. Wynne wrote that the British had eventually reached Passchendaele Ridge and captured but beyond them were and . The German submarine bases on the coast had not been captured but the objective of diverting the Germans from the French further south, while they recovered from the Nivelle Offensive in April, had succeeded. In 1997, Paddy Griffith wrote that the &quot;bite and hold&quot; system kept moving until November, because the BEF had developed a workable system of offensive tactics, against which the Germans ultimately had no answer. A decade later, Jack Sheldon wrote that relative casualty figures were irrelevant, because the German army could not afford the losses or to lose the initiative by being compelled to fight another defensive battle on ground of the Allies&#x27; choosing. The Third Battle of Ypres had pinned the German army to Flanders and caused unsustainable casualties.

In 2018, Jonathan Boff wrote that after the war the official historians, many of whom were former staff officers, wrote of the tactical changes after 26 September and their scrapping after the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October, as the work of Loßberg. By blaming an individual, the rest of the German commanders were exculpated, which gave a false impression that OHL operated in a rational manner, when Ludendorff imposed another defensive scheme on 7 October. Boff wrote that this narrative was facile and that it avoided the problem faced by the Germans in late 1917. OHL had issued orders to change tactics again days before Loßberg was blamed for giving new orders to the 4th Army. Boff also doubted that all of the divisions in Flanders could act on top-down changes. The 119th Division was in the front line from 11 August to 18 October and replied that new tactics were difficult to implement due to lack of training. The tempo of British attacks and the effect of attrition meant that although six divisions were sent to the 4th Army by 10 October, they were either novice units deficient in training or veteran formations with low morale after earlier defeats; good divisions had been diluted with too many replacements. Boff wrote that the Germans consciously sought tactical changes for an operational dilemma for want of an alternative. On 2 October, Rupprecht had ordered the 4th Army HQ to avoid over-centralising command, only to find that Loßberg had issued an artillery plan detailing the deployment of individual batteries.

At a British conference on 13 October, the Third Army (General Julian Byng) scheme for an attack in mid-November was discussed. Byng wanted the operations at Ypres continued, to hold German troops in Flanders. The Battle of Cambrai began on 20 November and the British breached the first two parts of the Hindenburg Line, in the first successful mass use of tanks in a combined arms operation. The experience of the failure to contain the British attacks at Ypres and the drastic reduction in areas of the western front that could be considered &quot;quiet&quot; after the tank and artillery surprise at Cambrai, left the OHL with little choice but to return to a strategy of decisive victory in 1918. On 24 October, the Austro-German 14th Army ( Otto von Below), attacked the Italian Second Army on the Isonzo at the Battle of Caporetto and in 18 days, inflicted casualties of and In fear that Italy might be put out of the war, the French and British governments offered reinforcements. British and French troops were swiftly moved from but the diversion of resources from the BEF forced Haig to conclude the Third Battle of Ypres short of Westrozebeke; the last substantial British attack took place on 10 November.

===Casualties===

Various casualty figures have been published for the Third Battle of Ypres, sometimes with acrimony; the highest estimates for British and German casualties appear to be discredited but the British claim to have taken has not been disputed. In 1940, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell recorded casualties and In the History of the Great War volume &quot;Military Operations...&quot; published in 1948, James Edmonds put British casualties and wrote that equivalent German figures were not available, estimating German losses A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1972 that no one believed Edmonds&#x27; &quot;farcical calculations&quot;. Taylor put British wounded and killed at German losses at &quot;a proportion slightly better than the Somme&quot;. In 2007, Jack Sheldon wrote that although German casualties from 1 June to 10 November a figure available in Volume III of the (Medical Report, 1934), Edmonds may not have included these data as they did not fit his case, using the phrases &quot;creative accounting&quot; and &quot;cavalier handling of the facts&quot;. Sheldon wrote that the German casualties could only be brought up to by including the who were sick or treated at regimental aid posts for &quot;minor cuts and wounds&quot; but &quot;not struck off unit strength&quot;; Sheldon wrote &quot;it is hard to see any merit&quot; in doing so.

Leon Wolff, writing in 1958, gave German casualties as and British casualties as Wolff&#x27;s British figure was refuted by John Terraine in a 1977 publication. Despite writing that casualties was the BEF total for the second half of 1917, Wolff had neglected to deduct for the Battle of Cambrai, given in the &quot;Official Statistics&quot; from which he quoted or &quot;normal wastage&quot;, averaging month in &quot;quiet&quot; periods. In 1959, Cyril Falls estimated and casualties. In his 1963 biography of Haig, Terraine accepted Edmonds&#x27; figure of casualties and agreed that German losses were at least equal to and probably greater than British, owing to the strength of British artillery and the high number of German counterattacks; he did not accept Edmonds&#x27; calculation that German losses were as high In his 1977 work, Terraine wrote that the German figure ought to be increased because their statistics were incomplete and because their data omitted some lightly wounded men, who would have been included under British casualty criteria, revising the German figure by twenty per cent, which made German casualties Prior and Wilson, in 1997, gave British losses of German casualties at just In 1997, Heinz Hagenlücke gave casualties. Gary Sheffield wrote in 2002 that Richard Holmes guessed that both sides suffered which seemed about right to him.

===Subsequent operations===

====Winter 1917–1918====

The area to the east and south of the ruins of Passchendaele village was held by posts, those to the east being fairly habitable, unlike the southern ones; from Passchendaele as far back as Potijze, the ground was far worse. Each brigade spent four days in the front line, four in support and four in reserve. The area was quiet apart from artillery-fire and in December the weather turned cold and snowy, which entailed a great effort to prevent trench foot. In January, spells of freezing cold were followed by warmer periods, one beginning on 15 January with torrential rain and gale-force winds, washing away plank roads and duckboard tracks. Conditions in the salient improved with the completion of transport routes and the refurbishment of German pillboxes. Both sides raided and the British used night machine-gun fire and artillery barrages to great effect. On the evening of 3 March 1918, two companies of the 8th Division raided Teal Cottage, supported by a smoke and shrapnel barrage, killed many of the garrison and took six prisoners for one man wounded. A German attack on 11 March was repulsed; after that the Germans made no more attacks, keeping up frequent artillery bombardments and machine-gun fire instead. When the German armies further south began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918, &quot;good&quot; divisions in Flanders were sent south; the 29th Division was withdrawn on 9 April and transferred to the Lys.

====Retreat, 1918====

On 23 March, Haig ordered Plumer to make contingency plans to shorten the line and release troops for the other armies. Worn-out divisions from the south had been sent to Flanders to recuperate closer to the coast. On 11 April, Plumer authorised a withdrawal of the southern flank of the Second Army. On 12 April, the VIII Corps HQ ordered the infantry retirement to begin that night and the 59th Division was replaced by part of the 41st Division and transferred south. The II Corps had begun to withdraw its artillery at the same time as VIII Corps, on the night of 11/12 April and ordered the 36th (Ulster) and 30th divisions to conform to the VIII Corps retirement, which was complete by 13 April, with no German interference. On 13 April, Plumer agreed to a retirement in the south side of the salient to a line from Mt Kemmel to Voormezeele [ south of Ypres], White Château [ east of Ypres] and Pilckem Ridge. The 4th Army diary recorded that the withdrawal was discovered at Next day, at the Battle of Merckem, the Germans attacked from Houthulst Forest, north-east of Ypres and captured Kippe but were forced out by Belgian counter-attacks, supported by the II Corps artillery. On the afternoon of 27 April, the south end of the Second Army outpost line was driven in near Voormezeele and another British outpost line was established north-east of the village.

===Commemoration===
The Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing commemorates those of all Commonwealth nations (except New Zealand and Newfoundland) who died in the Ypres Salient and have no known grave. In the case of the United Kingdom only casualties before 16 August 1917 are commemorated on the memorial. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at Tyne Cot Cemetery. There is a New Zealand Memorial marking where New Zealand troops fought at Gravenstafel Ridge on 4 October, located on Roeselarestraat. There are numerous tributes and memorials in Australia and New Zealand to Anzac soldiers who died in the battle, including plaques at the Christchurch and Dunedin railway stations. The Canadian Corps&#x27; participation in the Second Battle of Passchendaele is commemorated with the Passchendaele Memorial at site of the Crest Farm on the south-west fringe of Passchendaele village.

One of the newest monuments to be dedicated to the fighting contribution of a group is the Celtic Cross memorial, commemorating the Scottish contribution to the fighting in Flanders during the Great War. This memorial is on Frezenberg Ridge where the 9th (Scottish) Division and the 15th (Scottish) Division fought during the Third Battle of Ypres. The monument was dedicated by Linda Fabiani, the Minister for Europe of the Scottish Parliament, during the late summer of 2007, the 90th anniversary of the battle. In July 2017 a two-day event was organised in Ypres to mark the centenary of the battle. Members of the British royal family and Prime Minister Theresa May joined the ceremonies, which started in the evening of 30 July with the service at Menin Gate, followed by ceremonies at the Market Square. On the following day, a ceremony was held at Tyne Cot cemetery, headed by the Prince of Wales.

<text>Green Card is a 1990 American romantic comedy film written, produced, and directed by Peter Weir and starring Gérard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell. 

The screenplay focuses on an American woman who enters into a marriage of convenience with a Frenchman so he can obtain a green card and remain in the United States. 

Depardieu won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
Brontë Parrish, a horticulturalist and an environmentalist, enters into a Green Card marriage with Georges Fauré, an undocumented immigrant from France, so he may stay in the United States. In turn, Brontë uses her fake marriage credentials to rent the apartment of her dreams. After moving in, and in order to explain her spouse&#x27;s absence, she tells the doorman and neighbors he is conducting musical research in Africa.

Contacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for an interview to determine if her marriage is legitimate, Brontë tracks down Georges, who is working as a waiter. Although the two have little time to get their facts straight, the agents who question them appear to be satisfied with their answers. But when one of the agents asks to use the bathroom and Georges directs him to a closet, their suspicions are aroused, and they schedule a full, formal interview to be conducted two days later at their office.

Advised by her attorney that she could face criminal charges if their deception is uncovered, Brontë reluctantly invites Georges to move in with her. They try to learn about each other&#x27;s past and their quirks and habits but quickly find they can barely tolerate each other. Georges is a fiery-tempered selfish slob and smoker who prefers red meat to vegetarian food, while Brontë is shown as uptight and cold, obsessed with her plants and wrapped up in environmental issues.

Meanwhile, the parents of Lauren Adler, Brontë&#x27;s best friend, plan to leave New York City and consider donating their trees and plants to the Green Guerrillas, a group overseeing the development of inner-city gardens. Brontë is invited to a dinner party to discuss the issue and discovers Georges is there, having been asked by Lauren. He so impresses the Adlers with an impressionistic piano piece, set to a poem about children and trees, that they agree to donate their plants to the Green Guerrillas. When Brontë&#x27;s parents later arrive at the apartment for an unannounced visit, Georges pretends to be the handyman.

When Brontë&#x27;s boyfriend Phil returns from a trip, Georges reveals that he is married to her. Brontë angrily kicks Georges out, but the pair nonetheless appear at the immigration interview the next day. The two are questioned separately, and when Georges is caught out by the interviewer, he confesses the marriage is a sham. He agrees to deportation but insists Brontë not be charged for her role in the charade. He lets Brontë believe the interview was a success and the two go their separate ways.

A few days later, Georges invites Brontë to join him at the cafe where they first met. When she notices one of the immigration agents is waiting outside, she realizes Georges is being deported and tries to stop him from being sent away as they&#x27;ve both realized they are in love with each other. 

Georges promises to write every day asking the same question &quot;When are you coming, &quot;chérie&quot;?&quot;, a line he had also used when describing their fabricated courtship to the INS. Just before he leaves with the immigration agent, Brontë asks if he still has their wedding rings; he pulls them out of his pocket and they quickly exchange rings again, laughing and kissing. Then Georges departs with the agent as Brontë watches from the sidewalk.

==Cast==
==Production==
Peter Weir wrote the script, an original, specifically as a vehicle for Gérard Depardieu to introduce him to a wide English-speaking audience. The film had a similar theme and plot to &quot;The Paper Wedding&quot; (French: &quot;Les noces de papier&quot;), a 1989 made for television Canadian film directed by Michel Brault, which was subsequently entered into the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.

Partial funding for the film was provided by the Film Finance Corporation Australia and Union Générale Cinématographique. Although the film was set in America and did not feature Australian actors, the fact it was written, directed, filmed, designed and edited by an Australian enabled it to receive funding from the Australian government. This was $3.8 million from the FFC.

==Music==

===Original soundtrack===

&quot;Green Card: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was released on 22 January 1991 on Varèse Sarabande.

Some of the music like &quot;River&quot;, &quot;Watermark&quot;, and &quot;Storms in Africa&quot; by Enya, &quot;Holdin&#x27; On&quot; by Soul II Soul, &quot;Oyin Momo Ado&quot; by Babatunde Olatunji and &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; by The Beach Boys are heard in the movie, but not included in the soundtrack.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 59% approval rating based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;as breezily escapist as a film this facile can be&quot; and added, &quot;Ms. MacDowell ... has a lovely, demure ease that makes George&#x27;s appreciative gaze quite understandable. Mr. Depardieu, in the role that gets him into a New York Yankees cap, proves that he is nothing if not a sport ... He comes to life most fully when he lapses into French or is otherwise momentarily freed from the story&#x27;s constraints.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed the film &quot;is not blindingly brilliant, and is not an example of the very best work of the director who made &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; or the actor who starred in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. But it is a sound, entertaining work of craftsmanship, a love story between two people whose meet is not as cute as it might have been.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the film a &quot;captivating romantic bonbon&quot; and added, &quot;Don&#x27;t look for the originality and grit that distinguished Weir&#x27;s Australian films &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; and &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, &quot;Green Card&quot; has all the heft of a potato chip. But Depardieu&#x27;s charm recognizes no language barriers, and MacDowell, the revelation of &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;, proves a fine, sexy foil.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;Like &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, this romance is blissfully dependent on our staying good and starry-eyed, seduced by the charisma of the leads. And we do, despite its lackadaisical pace and disappointing ending.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;Although a thin premise endangers its credibility at times, &quot;Green Card&quot; is a genial, nicely played romance.&quot; &quot;Time Out London&quot; stated &quot;Weir&#x27;s first romantic comedy boasts a central relationship which is tentative and hopeful, a mood beautifully realised by Depardieu (venturing into new territory with a major English-speaking role). Complemented by the refined MacDowell, his gracious, generous performance is never dominating, and their exchanges offer unexpected pleasures. In terms of the genre&#x27;s conventions, Weir likens this film to &#x27;a light meal.&#x27; It&#x27;s one to savour.&quot; Channel 4 said, &quot;Weir&#x27;s film has its fair share of cute moments as the opposites slowly begin to attract, but this is largely over rated stuff, which proved curiously popular with critics on its release. Depardieu does his obnoxious-yet-strangely-lovable act with ease; however, the romantic comedy fixture MacDowell is less convincing.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Green Card&quot; grossed $29.9 million in the United States and Canada. In Australia, it was the highest-grossing local film with a gross of A$10,585,060 (US$8 million).

===Accolades===
==Home media release==
Touchstone released the film on VHS around 1991 and Touchstone Home Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on 4 March 2003. It is in anamorphic widescreen format with audio tracks in English and French.

&quot;Green Card&quot; was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in February 2004. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the original theatrical trailer, Umbrella Entertainment trailers, and interviews with Peter Weir, Gérard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.

<text>Peter Lindsay Weir ( ; born 21 August 1944) is an Australian retired film director. He is known for directing films crossing various genres over forty years with films such as &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981), &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982), &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Way Back&quot; (2010). He has received six Academy Award nominations. In 2022, he was awarded the Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement career. In 2024, he received an honorary life-time achievement award at the Venice Film Festival (Golden Lion).

Early in his career as a director, Weir was a leading figure in the Australian New Wave cinema movement (1970–1990). Weir made his feature film debut with &quot;Homesdale&quot; (1971), and continued with the mystery drama &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), the supernatural thriller &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977) and the historical drama &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981). Weir gained tremendous success with the multinational production &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982).

After the success of &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;, Weir directed a diverse group of American and international films covering most genres–many of them major box office hits–including Academy Award-nominated films such as the thriller &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), the drama &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989), the romantic comedy &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990), the social science fiction comedy-drama &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998) and the epic historical drama &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; (2003). His final feature before his retirement was the well-received &quot;The Way Back&quot; (2010).

==Early life and education==
Peter Lindsay Weir was born in Sydney, in 1944, the son of Peggy (née Barnsley Sutton) and Lindsay Weir, a real estate agent. Weir attended The Scots College and Vaucluse Boys High School before studying arts and law at the University of Sydney. His interest in film was sparked by him meeting fellow students, including Phillip Noyce and the future members of the Sydney filmmaking collective Ubu Films.

== Career ==

===1960s===
After leaving university in the mid-1960s, he joined Sydney television station ATN-7, where he worked as a production assistant on the groundbreaking satirical comedy program &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot;. During this period, using station facilities, Weir made his first two experimental short films, &quot;Count Vim&#x27;s Last Exercise&quot; and &quot;The Life and Flight of Reverend Buck Shotte&quot;.

In 1969, the founders of Producers Authors Composers and Talent (now PACT Centre for Emerging Artists) attended a Sydney University Architecture Revue, with sets by Geoffrey Atherden and Grahame Bond. They invited Bond, Atherden, Weir, and Weir&#x27;s friend, composer Peter Best, a chance to do a show at the National Art School. Sir Robert Helpmann saw the show and took it to the Adelaide Festival. Soon afterward Weir and Best were commissioned to write a Christmas special TV show for ABC Television titled &quot;Man on a Green Bike&quot;.

===1970s===
Weir took a position with the Commonwealth Film Unit (later renamed Film Australia), for which he made several documentaries, as well as one fiction film, a section of the three-part, three-director feature film &quot;3 to Go&quot; (1970), which won an AFI award. Another notable film in this period was the short rock music performance film &quot;Three Directions in Australian Pop Music&quot; (1972), which featured in-concert colour footage of three of the most significant Melbourne rock acts of the period, Spectrum, The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band, and Wendy Saddington. Weir&#x27;s last major work for the CFU concerned an underprivileged outer Sydney suburb, &quot;Whatever Happened to Green Valley&quot; (1973); here, residents were invited to make their own film segments.

Weir made his first major independent film, the short feature &quot;Homesdale&quot; (1971), an offbeat black comedy. It co-starred rising young actress Kate Fitzpatrick and musician and comedian Grahame Bond, who came to fame in 1972 as the star of &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot;; Weir also played a small role, but this was to be his last significant screen appearance.

Weir&#x27;s first full-length feature film was the underground cult classic, &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot; (1974), a low-budget black comedy about the inhabitants of a small country town who deliberately cause fatal car crashes and live off the proceeds. It was a minor success in cinemas but proved very popular on the then-thriving drive-in circuit. The plot had been inspired by a press report Weir had read about two young English women who had vanished while on a driving holiday in France. With this film, along with the earlier &quot;Homesdale&quot;, Weir set the basic thematic pattern which has persisted throughout his career: nearly all his feature films deal with people who face some form of crisis after finding themselves isolated from society in some way – either physically (&quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;Master and Commander&quot;), socially/culturally (&quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, &quot;The Last Wave&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;Green Card&quot;), or psychologically (&quot;Fearless&quot;).

Weir&#x27;s major breakthrough in Australia and internationally was the lush, atmospheric period mystery &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), made with substantial backing from the state-funded South Australian Film Corporation and filmed on location in South Australia and rural Victoria. Based on the novel by Joan Lindsay and set at the turn of the 20th century, the film relates the purportedly &quot;true&quot; story of a group of students from an exclusive girls&#x27; school who mysteriously vanish from a school picnic on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1900. Widely credited as a key work in the &quot;Australian film renaissance&quot; of the mid-1970s, &quot;Picnic&quot; was the first Australian film of its era to gain both critical praise and be given substantial international theatrical releases. It also helped launch the career of internationally renowned Australian cinematographer Russell Boyd. It was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom praised it as a welcome antidote to the so-called &quot;ocker film&quot; genre, typified by &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; and &quot;Alvin Purple&quot;.

Weir&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977), was a supernatural thriller about a man who begins to experience terrifying visions of an impending natural disaster. It starred American actor Richard Chamberlain, who was well known to Australian and world audiences as the eponymous physician in the popular &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; TV series. He later starred in the major series &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, set in Australia. &quot;The Last Wave&quot; was a pensive, ambivalent work that expanded on themes from &quot;Picnic&quot;, exploring the interactions between the native Aboriginal and European cultures. It co-starred the Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil, whose performance won the Golden Ibex (Oscar equivalent) at the Tehran International Festival in 1977, but it was only a moderate commercial success at the time.

Between &quot;The Last Wave&quot; and his next feature, Weir wrote and directed the offbeat low-budget telemovie &quot;The Plumber&quot; (1979). It starred Australian actors Judy Morris and Ivar Kants and was filmed in three weeks. Inspired by an account told to him by friends, it is a black comedy about a woman whose life is disrupted by a subtly menacing plumber.

=== 1980s ===
Weir scored a major Australian hit and further international praise with his next film, the historical adventure-drama &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981). Scripted by the Australian playwright David Williamson, it is regarded as classic Australian cinema. &quot;Gallipoli&quot; was instrumental in making Mel Gibson (&quot;Mad Max&quot;) into a major star, although his co-star Mark Lee, who also received high praise for his role, has made relatively few screen appearances since.

The climax of Weir&#x27;s early career was the $6 million multi-national production &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982), again starring Gibson, playing opposite top Hollywood female lead Sigourney Weaver in a story about journalistic loyalty, idealism, love and ambition in the turmoil of Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia of 1965. It was an adaptation of the novel by Christopher Koch, which was based in part on the experiences of Koch&#x27;s journalist brother Philip, the ABC&#x27;s Jakarta correspondent and one of the few western journalists in the city during the 1965 attempted coup. The film also won Linda Hunt (who played a man in the film) an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The film was again produced by Hal and Jim McElroy, who had also produced Weir&#x27;s first three films, &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot;, &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; and &quot;The Last Wave&quot;.
Weir&#x27;s first American film was the successful thriller &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), the first of two films he made with Harrison Ford, about a boy who sees the murder of an undercover police officer by corrupt coworkers and has to be hidden in his Amish community to protect him. Weir directed Ford in his only performance to receive an Academy Award nomination, while child star Lukas Haas also received wide praise for his debut film performance. &quot;Witness&quot; also earned Weir his first Academy Award nomination as Best Director, and was his first of several films to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, it later won 2 for Best Film Editing &amp; Best Original Screenplay.

It was followed by the darker, less commercial &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986), Paul Schrader&#x27;s adaptation of Paul Theroux&#x27;s novel. Ford played a man obsessively pursuing his dream to start a new life in the Central American jungle with his family. These dramatic parts provided Harrison Ford with important opportunities to break the typecasting of his career-making roles in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series. Both films showed off his ability to play more subtle and substantial characters and he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in &quot;Witness&quot;, the only Academy Awards recognition in his career. &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; is also notable for a performance by the young River Phoenix.

Weir&#x27;s next film, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, was a major international success, with Weir again receiving credit for expanding the acting range of its Hollywood star. Robin Williams was mainly known for his anarchic stand-up comedy and his popular TV role as the wisecracking alien in &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;; in this film he played an inspirational teacher in a dramatic story about conformity and rebellion at an exclusive New England prep school in the 1950s. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Weir. It won Best Original Screenplay and launched the acting careers of young actors Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. It became a major box-office hit and is one of Weir&#x27;s best-known films to mainstream audiences.

=== 1990s ===
Weir&#x27;s first romantic comedy &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990) was another casting risk. Weir chose French screen icon Gérard Depardieu in the lead—Depardieu&#x27;s first English-language role—and paired him with American actress Andie MacDowell. &quot;Green Card&quot; was a box-office hit but was regarded as less of a critical success, although it helped Depardieu&#x27;s path to international fame. Weir received an Oscar nomination for his original screenplay.

&quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) returned to darker themes and starred Jeff Bridges as a man who believes he has become invincible after surviving a catastrophic air crash. Though well reviewed, particularly the performances of Bridges and Rosie Perez—who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress—the film was less commercially successful than Weir&#x27;s two preceding films. It was entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.

After five years, Weir returned to direct his biggest success to date, &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), a fantasy-satire of the media&#x27;s control of life starring Jim Carrey. &quot;The Truman Show&quot; was both a box office and a critical success, receiving positive reviews and numerous awards, including three Academy Award nominations: Andrew Niccol for Best Original Screenplay, Ed Harris for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and Weir himself for Best Director. In addition to the Academy Award nominations, the film won the 1999 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

=== 2000s ===
In 2003, Weir returned to period dramas with &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, starring Russell Crowe. A screen adaptation from various episodes in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s blockbuster adventure series set during the Napoleonic Wars, the film was well received by critics, but only mildly successful with mainstream audiences. Despite another nomination for Best Picture and winning two Oscars—for frequent collaborator Russell Boyd&#x27;s cinematography and for sound effects editing—the film&#x27;s box office success was moderate ($93 million at the North American box office). The film grossed slightly better overseas, gleaning an additional $114 million.

Weir had developed several other projects in the 2000s that never came to fruition, including an adaptation of &quot;The War Magician&quot; with actor Tom Cruise, an adaptation of Robert Kurson&#x27;s novel &quot;Shadow Divers&quot;, early development of a proposed &quot;Shantaram&quot; film starring Johnny Depp, and an adaptation of William Gibson&#x27;s sci-fi novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Weir resurfaced with the historical epic &quot;The Way Back&quot;, about escapees from a Soviet gulag. The film, while generally well-received critically, was not a financial success.

In 2012, it was reported that Weir would direct his own adapted script of Jennifer Egan&#x27;s gothic thriller &quot;The Keep&quot; the following year and shoot in Europe. Weir described the project as, &quot;Basically, ... a studio-shoot movie.&quot; As the years passed, however, without an official announcement, he started to be described as &quot;retired&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
Speaking in July 2022, speculating about Weir&#x27;s unannounced retirement, Ethan Hawke said, &quot;I think [Weir] lost interest in movies. He really enjoyed that work when he didn&#x27;t have actors giving him a hard time. Russell Crowe and Johnny Depp broke him.&quot;

In November 2022, Weir received an Academy Honorary Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

On the occasion of this award, he also gave his first interview in many years, to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. In the interview, he said Hawke&#x27;s quote &quot;must have been taken out of context. I find it puzzling.&quot; However, Weir confirmed his retirement, saying that &quot;for film directors, like volcanoes, there are three major stages: active, dormant and extinct. I think I&#x27;ve reached the latter! Another generation is out there calling &quot;action&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; and good luck to them.&quot; He stated that he has enjoyed visiting ancient ruins and battlefields and diving on the WWII shipwrecks of the Truk Lagoon during his retirement.

== Personal life ==
On 14 June 1982, Weir was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his service to the film industry.

In a career spanning over five decades on screen and stage, she has received numerous accolades, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, three Tony Awards and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for eight Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and three Grammy Awards. She was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.

Close received eight Academy Award nominations for playing a feminist mother in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982), a baby boomer in &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), a love interest in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), a psychotic ex-lover in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), a cunning aristocrat in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), an English butler in &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; (2011), a troubled wife in &quot;The Wife&quot; (2017), and an eccentric grandmother in &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot; (2020).

Close also portrayed Cruella de Vil in &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996) and its 2000 sequel, and voiced Kala in &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999).

In television, Close received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her role in the ABC film &quot;Something About Amelia&quot; (1984) and later won threeOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for portraying Margarethe Cammermeyer in the NBC film &quot;Serving in Silence&quot; (1995) and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series twice consecutively for playing Patty Hewes in &quot;Damages&quot; (20072012).

On stage, Close made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;Love for Love&quot; (1974). She later won three Tony Awards, two for Best Actress in a Play for her roles in the plays &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1983) and &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (1992), and one for Best Actress in a Musical the musical &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1995).

In 2016 she returned to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; on the West End stage earning a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical nomination.

Close is the president of Trillium Productions and co-founder of the website FetchDog. She has made political donations in support of Democratic politicians and is vocal on issues such as women&#x27;s rights, same-sex marriage, and mental health. Married three times, she has one daughter, Annie Starke, from her relationship with producer John Starke.

==Early life and background==
Glenn Close was born on March 19, 1947, in Greenwich, Connecticut, to socialite Elizabeth Mary Hester &quot;Bettine&quot; (née Moore) and William Taliaferro Close, a doctor who operated a clinic in the Belgian Congo and served as a personal physician to Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. She has two sisters, Tina and Jessie, and two brothers, Alexander (nicknamed Sandy) and Tambu Misoki, whom Close&#x27;s parents adopted while living in Congo.

During her childhood, Close lived with her parents in a stone cottage on her maternal grandfather&#x27;s estate in Greenwich. She began honing her acting abilities in her early years, &quot;I have no doubt that the days I spent running free in the evocative Connecticut countryside with an unfettered imagination, playing whatever character our games demanded, is one of the reasons that acting has always seemed so natural to me.&quot; Although Close has an affluent background, she has stated that her family chose not to participate in WASP society. She would also avoid mentioning her birthplace, the wealthy town Greenwich, whenever asked because she did not want people to think she was a &quot;&quot;dilettante&quot; who didn&#x27;t have to work.&quot;

When Close was seven years old, her parents joined the Moral Re-Armament (MRA), a movement in which her family remained involved for 15 years. During this period, Close&#x27;s family lived in communal centers. She has described MRA as a &quot;cult&quot; that dictated every aspect of her life, from the clothes that had to be worn to what she was allowed to say. Close also spent time in Switzerland when studying at St. George&#x27;s School, and attended Rosemary Hall (now Choate Rosemary Hall), graduating in 1965. She traveled for several years in the mid-to-late 1960s with the nonprofit encouragement singing group Up With People. During her time in Up With People, Close organized a small singing group called the Green Glenn Singers, consisting of herself, Kathe Green, Jennie Dorn, and Vee Entwistle. The group&#x27;s stated mission was &quot;to write and sing songs which would give people a purpose and inspire them to live the way they were meant to live&quot;.
When she was 22, Close broke away from MRA. She once stated that her desire to become an actress allowed her to leave the group, adding, &quot;I have long [ago] forgiven my parents for any of this. They had their reasons for doing what they did, and I understand them. It had terrible effects on their kids, but that&#x27;s the way it is. We all try to survive, right? And I think what actually saved me more than anything was my desire to be an actress.&quot; She attended The College of William &amp; Mary, double majoring in theater and anthropology. During her senior year of college, Close became inspired to pursue a career in acting after watching an interview of Katharine Hepburn on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. It was in the college&#x27;s theater department that Close began to train as a serious actor under Howard Scammon, William and Mary&#x27;s long-time professor of theater. During her years at school in Williamsburg, she also starred in the summer-time outdoor drama, &quot;The Common Glory&quot;, written by Pulitzer Prize author Paul Green. She was elected to membership in the honor society of Phi Beta Kappa. Through the years, Close has returned to William &amp; Mary to lecture and to visit the theater department.

Through her appearance on the first episode of the seventh season of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, she came to find out that she is related to Princess Diana through her 7 times great-grandparents, is also distantly related to fellow actor Clint Eastwood, and that some of her ancestors were slaveholders. She also has a tangential connection to Marjorie Post who was once married to her grandfather, Edward Bennett Close.

==Career==
===1970s: Early work===
Close started her professional career on the stage in 1974 at age 27. In her senior year of college, she called her school&#x27;s theater department to be nominated for a series of auditions through the University Resident Theatre Association and TCG. Eventually, she was given a callback and hired for one season to do three plays at the Helen Hayes Theatre, one of those plays being &quot;Love for Love&quot; directed by Hal Prince. She made her television debut in 1975 with a small role in the anthology series &quot;Great Performances&quot;. In 1976, she played Mary I in the short-lived Broadway musical &quot;Rex&quot;, with a score by Richard Rodgers and Sheldon Harnick.

From September 1978 to April 1979, Glenn appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Crucifer of Blood&quot; playing the part of Irene St. Claire, with Paxton Whitehead and Dwight Schultz. In 1979, she filmed the television movies &quot;Orphan Train&quot; and &quot;Too Far to Go&quot;. The latter film included Blythe Danner and Michael Moriarty in the cast, and Close played Moriarty&#x27;s lover. Her last major stage role before beginning her motion picture career was playing Chairy, the female lead in the Broadway musical &quot;Barnum&quot;, from April 1980 to March 1981.

===1980s: Breakthrough and rise to prominence===
The 1980s proved to be Close&#x27;s breakthrough in Hollywood. In 1980, director George Roy Hill discovered Close on Broadway and asked her to audition with Robin Williams for a role in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, which would become her first film role, as well as her first Academy Award nominated performance. She played Robin Williams&#x27;s mother, despite being just four years older. The following year she played Sarah Cooper in &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, a character that director Lawrence Kasdan said he specifically wrote for her. The movie received positive reviews and was a financial success. Close became the third actor to receive a Tony, Emmy, and Oscar (Academy Award) nomination all in the same calendar year after the release of &quot;The Big Chill&quot;. Also in 1980, she received her first Tony Award nomination for her performance in the musical &quot;Barnum&quot;.

In 1984, Close was given a part in Robert Redford&#x27;s baseball drama &quot;The Natural&quot;, and although it was a small supporting role, she earned a third consecutive Oscar nomination. Close, to this day, credits her nomination to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, stating &quot;That hat was designed so the sunlight would come through. We waited for a certain time of day, so the sun was shining through the back of the stadium. And he had a lens that muted the people around me. It was an incredibly well thought-out shot. And I honestly think that&#x27;s the reason I got nominated.&quot; Close also starred opposite Robert Duvall in the drama &quot;The Stone Boy&quot; (1984), a film about a family coping after their youngest child accidentally kills his older brother in a hunting accident. She continued to appear in television films in the following years, beginning with &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, and in 1984, she starred in the critically acclaimed drama &quot;Something About Amelia&quot;, a television film about a family destroyed by sexual abuse. She won her first Tony Award in 1984 for &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, directed by Mike Nichols.

Eventually, Close began to seek different roles to play because she did not want to be typecast as a motherly figure. She starred in the 1985 romantic comedy &quot;Maxie&quot;, alongside Mandy Patinkin. Close was given favorable reviews and even received her second Golden Globe Award nomination, but the movie was critically panned and under-performed at the box office. In 1985, Close starred in the legal thriller &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;, opposite Jeff Bridges. Initially, Jane Fonda was attached to the role, but was replaced with Close when she requested changes in the script. Producer Martin Ransohoff was against the casting of Close because he said she was &quot;too ugly&quot; for the part. Close eventually heard about this and said she didn&#x27;t want Ransohoff on set while she was making her scenes. Director Richard Marquand stood by her side and sent Ransohoff away. Infuriated, Ransohoff went to the studio heads trying to get Close and Marquand fired from the picture. The studio refused, stating they were pleased with their work in the film. &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews and grossed $40-million on a $15-million budget.

In 1987, Close played the disturbed book editor Alex Forrest in the psychological thriller &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. The film became a huge box-office success, the highest-grossing film worldwide of that year. The film propelled Close to international stardom and the character of Alex Forrest is considered one of her most iconic roles; the phrase &quot;bunny boiler&quot; has even been added to the dictionary, referring to a scene from the movie. During the re-shoot of the ending, Close suffered a concussion from one of the takes when her head smashed against a mirror. After being rushed to the hospital, she discovered, much to her horror, that she was actually a few weeks pregnant with her daughter. Close stated in an interview that, &quot;&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was really the first part that took me away from the Jenny Fields, Sarah Coopers—good, nurturing women roles. I did more preparation for that film than I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; Close received her fourth Oscar nomination for this role, her first in the leading role and also won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actress.

She played a scheming aristocrat, the Marquise de Merteuil, in 1988&#x27;s period romantic drama &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;. Close earned stellar reviews for this performance, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, she received her first BAFTA Award nomination. Also in 1988, she appeared alongside Keith Carradine in &quot;Stones for Ibarra&quot;, a television film adapted from the book written by Harriet Doerr and produced by the Hallmark company. Close&#x27;s final film role of the decade was &quot;Immediate Family&quot; (1989), a drama about a married couple seeking to adopt a child. Producer Lawrence Kasdan had Close star in the film, as he directed her previously in &quot;The Big Chill&quot;.

===1990s: Established actress===
In 1990, Close went on to play the role of Sunny von Bülow opposite Jeremy Irons in &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; to critical acclaim. The film drew some controversy since it dealt with the Claus von Bülow murder trial, while the real Sunny von Bülow was still in a vegetative state. Sunny&#x27;s children publicly criticized the movie. In the same year, Close played Gertrude in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s film adaption of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. It was the first Shakespeare role that Close had ever attempted on screen (she appeared in 1975 in a stage production of &quot;King Lear&quot; in Milwaukee). Close would later go on to join the cast of &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;, reuniting her with Jeremy Irons. She also had a cameo appearance in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot; (1991) as a pirate. In 1991, she starred in the highly rated &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; television movie &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall&quot;, as well as its two sequels.

In 1992, Close starred in &quot;Meeting Venus&quot; for which she received critical acclaim and won Best Actress (Golden Ciak) at the Venice Film Festival. In the same year, Close became a trustee emeritus of The Sundance Institute. She also portrayed the title subject of the fact-based made-for-TV movie &quot;Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story&quot; in 1995, for which she won her first Primetime Emmy Award. Additionally, she has also provided the voice of Mona Simpson, from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, since 1995. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Close one of the 16 best &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars. Close has also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice, in 1989 and in 1992. In 1992, she won her second Tony Award for &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;.

One of her most notable roles on stage was Norma Desmond in the Andrew Lloyd Webber production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, for which Close won her third Tony Award, playing the role on Broadway in 1993–94. For her role, Close was met with critical acclaim. David Richards of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1994 that &quot;Glenn is giving one of those legendary performances people will be talking about years from now. The actress takes breathtaking risks, venturing so far out on a limb at times that you fear it will snap. It doesn&#x27;t.&quot; She would later re-team with the show&#x27;s director, Trevor Nunn, in London for his Royal National Theatre revival of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 2002.

Close appeared in the newsroom comedy-drama &quot;The Paper&quot; (1994), directed by her good friend Ron Howard and in 1996 she acted alongside the cast of Tim Burton&#x27;s alien invasion satire &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). That same year, she portrayed the sinister Cruella de Vil in the Disney live-action hit of &quot;101 Dalmatians.&quot; Her role as Cruella de Vil was universally praised and earned her a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $320.6 million in theaters against a $75 million budget. Per Close&#x27;s contract, she is allowed to keep any costumes from her films. The producers attempted to make copies of Close&#x27;s wardrobe due to the expensive materials being used, but, to their dismay, she rejected their suggestion and kept the originals. The following year, Close appeared in another box office hit with &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), playing the trustworthy vice president to Harrison Ford&#x27;s president. Ford stated in an interview that the role of the vice president was already written for a woman and that he personally chose Close for the role after meeting her at a birthday party for then-president Bill Clinton. Close would later star in the war film &quot;Paradise Road&quot; (1997) as a choir conductor of the women imprisoned by the Japanese in World War II. In 1999, Close provided the voice of Kala in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Tarzan&quot;. She later went on to receive great reviews for her comedic role as Camille Dixon in &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1999).

===2000s: Focus on television===
Close began to appear in television movies rather than doing theatrical films in the early 2000s. She returned as Cruella de Vil in &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000). Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office. Close later filmed &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; which premiered in 2001, a movie about four suburban families dealing with maladies. This was Kristen Stewart&#x27;s first film role, and Close and Stewart would later reunite in the 2015 film &quot;Anesthesia&quot;. Close starred in &quot;Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her&quot; in the same year, this would be one of many future collaborations with director Rodrigo Garcia. In 2004, she played Claire Wellington, an uptight socialite in the comedy &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; opposite Nicole Kidman and Christopher Walken. She provided the voice of the Blue Fairy in the English version of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (2002) and Granny in the animated film &quot;Hoodwinked&quot; (2005). Close continued to do smaller films like &quot;Le Divorce&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Chumscrubber&quot; (2005). In 2005, she reunited with director Rodrigo Garcia to do &quot;Nine Lives&quot;; he would later direct Close in the film &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; (2011). In the same year, she starred in the film &quot;Heights&quot; (2005), an independent drama centered on the lives of five New Yorkers. Close&#x27;s performance was lauded by critics.

In 2001, she starred in a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s classic musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; as Nellie Forbush on ABC. She guest-starred on &quot;Will and Grace&quot; in 2002, portraying a satirical version of Annie Leibovitz, which earned her an Emmy nomination for Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2003, Close played Eleanor of Aquitaine in the Showtime-produced film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. Close won a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. In 2005, Close joined the FX crime series &quot;The Shield&quot;, in which she played Monica Rawling, a no-nonsense precinct captain, which became her first TV role in a series. Close stated that she made the right move because television was in a &quot;golden era&quot; and the quality of some programs had already risen to the standards of film. John Landgraf, CEO of FX, stated that network was the &quot;first to bring a female movie star of Glenn Close&#x27;s stature to television.&quot; He also credits her collaboration with the network with promoting roles for women on television, as well as influencing other film actors to switch to the small screen.

In 2007, she appeared in the same film as her previous co-star Meryl Streep in the ensemble drama &quot;Evening&quot;. This would be Close&#x27;s final theatrical film role of the decade, since she began to star in her own television series, &quot;Damages&quot; (2007). Close was asked about her contributions to independent films, to which she responded &quot;I love the casts that gather around a good piece of writing certainly not for the money but because it is good and challenging. Sometimes I&#x27;ve taken a role for one scene that I thought was phenomenal. Also my presence can help them get money, so it&#x27;s I think a way for me to give back.&quot; Shortly after her stint on &quot;The Shield&quot;, Close was approached by FX executives who pitched a television series for her to star in. Also in 2007, Close began a five-season run playing the ruthless and brilliant lawyer Patty Hewes on &quot;Damages&quot;. Her portrayal of this character was met with rave reviews and a plethora of award nominations, in addition she went on to win two consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Close&#x27;s win also made her the first Best Actress winner in a drama series at the Emmy&#x27;s for a cable show. Throughout the show&#x27;s run, she became one of the highest-paid actresses on cable, earning $200,000 per episode. Close stated that her role of Patty Hewes was the role of her life. She also kept in contact with her co-star Rose Byrne, and the two have become friends. After the series ended, Close stated that she would not return to television in a regular role, but that she was open to do a miniseries or guest spot. In 2008, Close performed at Carnegie Hall, narrating the violin concerto &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot;, a concerto for reader, violin and orchestra, composed and conducted by Glen Roven.

===2010s: Return to film and stage===
In December 2010, Close began filming &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; in Dublin. She had previously won an Obie in 1982 for her role in the play on stage. She had been working on the project, in which she appeared alongside &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; co-star Mark Williams, for almost twenty years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the script and produced the film. Close stated it became more important for her to make the film in order to stimulate discussion on transgender issues, commenting, &quot;There came a point where I asked, &#x27;Am I willing to live the rest of my life having given up on this?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;No I won&#x27;t.&#x27; Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to &#x27;die off&#x27;.&quot; In the film, Close played the title role of &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot;, a woman living as a man in 19th century Ireland after being sexually assaulted as a young girl.

While the film overall received mixed reviews, Close&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim, as it was noted for being the most subtle and introverted of her career to that point and a departure from her previous roles. When asked during the film&#x27;s awards campaign about the fact of not having an Oscar, Close said: &quot;I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. Because if you just do the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you&#x27;re one of five [nominees]. How could you possibly think of yourself as a loser?&quot;

She provided the voice of the &quot;Giant&quot; in the Summer 2012 production of the musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. The production also featured Amy Adams as The Baker&#x27;s Wife and Donna Murphy as The Witch. In 2014, she starred in a production of the &quot;Pirates of Penzance&quot; for the Public Theater in New York, playing the role of Ruth. This production featured Kevin Kline, Martin Short and Anika Noni Rose. In October 2014, Close returned to Broadway in the starring role of Agnes in Pam MacKinnon&#x27;s revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; at the John Golden Theatre. Her co-stars were John Lithgow as Tobias, Martha Plimpton as Julia and Lindsay Duncan as Claire. The production grossed $884,596 over eight preview performances during the week ending October 25, setting a new house record at the Golden Theatre. The production received mixed reviews, although the cast was praised. After her television series &quot;Damages&quot; ended, Close returned to film in 2014, in which she played Nova Prime Rael in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, directed by James Gunn. She also appeared in the independent movies &quot;5 to 7&quot; (2014) and &quot;Low Down&quot; (2014). In 2015, Close made a cameo on Louis C.K.&#x27;s &quot;Louie&quot; on FX, in the season five episode &quot;Sleepover&quot; alongside John Lithgow, Michael Cera, and Matthew Broderick.

In 2016, she appeared in &quot;The Great Gilly Hopkins&quot; and starred in the British zombie horror drama &quot;The Girl with All the Gifts&quot; (2016) as Dr. Caldwell, a scientist researching a cure to save humanity. In April 2016, she returned as Norma Desmond in the musical &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in an English National Opera production in London. Close was met with rave reviews after returning to this same role twenty-three years later. Both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave the production five stars and praised her performance. During the production Close was forced to cancel three shows due to a chest infection. She was hospitalized but later recovered and finished the remaining shows. Close won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Musical Performance, and was nominated for her first Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. That same year, she was inducted into American Theater Hall of Fame for her work on the stage.

The ENO London production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; transferred to the Palace Theatre on Broadway, with Close reprising her role. It opened on February 9, 2017, in a limited run, selling tickets through June 25, 2017. The production featured a 40-piece orchestra, the largest in Broadway history. Close in particular was lauded by critics for her new incarnation of Norma Desmond. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the great stage performances of this century.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the new production positive reviews. That same year, Close starred in a half hour comedy pilot for Amazon, titled &quot;Sea Oak&quot;. The pilot premiered online with viewers voting to choose if it wanted Amazon to produce the series. Although it received favorable reviews it was not picked up. Also in 2017, she was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Theatre World Awards. In 2017, Close appeared alongside Noomi Rapace and Willem Dafoe in &quot;What Happened to Monday&quot;, a science fiction thriller produced by Netflix. Also that year, she was reunited with actors John Malkovich (her co-star in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;) and Patrick Stewart (co-star in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;) in the romantic comedy &quot;The Wilde Wedding&quot;, and co-starred in &quot;Crooked House&quot;, a film adaptation of the novel by Agatha Christie.

Close garnered widespread critical acclaim for her performance in the 2018 drama &quot;The Wife&quot;, which had first premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. An adaptation of Meg Wolitzer&#x27;s novel of the same name, the film stars Close as Joan Castleman, who questions her life choices as she travels with her husband to Stockholm, where he is set to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. The film also features Close&#x27;s daughter, Annie Starke, as a younger version of Castleman. Close won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. She received her seventh Academy Award nomination, her fourth nomination in the Best Actress category, which has made her the most nominated actress without a win. She was widely considered to be the frontrunner to win the Oscar—which would be the first of her career—but ultimately lost to Olivia Colman for &quot;The Favourite&quot;. In addition, Close received a nomination, her second overall, for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, which she also lost to Colman. Also in 2018, Close made a return to the stage, where, from September to December, she featured in the Off-Broadway play, &quot;Mother of the Maid&quot;, at the Public Theater in New York City.

===2020s: Continued film work and further acclaim===
In 2020, Close starred in Netflix&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot;, reuniting with Ron Howard and starring alongside Amy Adams. Close played the Mamaw of JD Vance. While the film, which was released for streaming on Netflix on November 24, 2020, received mixed-to-negative critical reviews, Close received acclaim for her performance. Richard Roeper praised Close for her &quot;masterful, screen-commanding, pitch-perfect performance&quot;, while Peter Travers at ABC News called her &quot;simply sensational&quot; and Owen Gleiberman at Variety wrote that &quot;as long as Close is acting up an award-worthy storm (her performance is actually quite meticulous), &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot; is never less than alive&quot;. For the role, she received the San Francisco International Film Festival&#x27;s Award for Acting along with Academy Award, Golden Globe, and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. Close also received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress for &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot;, making her the third performer—after James Coco for &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; and Amy Irving for &quot;Yentl&quot;—to receive both an Oscar nomination and a Razzie nomination for the same performance.

Also in 2020, Close co-starred with Mila Kunis in the drama &quot;Four Good Days&quot;, directed by Rodrigo García and presented at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2021, Close served as an executive producer alongside Emma Stone for &quot;Cruella&quot;, a Disney live-action spin-off/prequel of &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, directed by Craig Gillespie. Stone plays the younger version of Cruella de Vil (the titular character whom Close portrayed in the 1996 live-action adaptation and its 2000 sequel). The same year, Close appeared opposite Mahershala Ali in the Apple TV+ drama film &quot;Swan Song&quot;. In 2022, she starred in season two of the Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Tehran&quot;. Close learned Persian for her role in &quot;Tehran&quot;. She also portrayed former Harper&#x27;s Bazaar editor Carmel Snow in the Apple TV+ series &quot;The New Look&quot;, reuniting her with &quot;Damages&quot; creator Todd A. Kessler.

In 2022, it was announced that Close would star alongside Andra Day and Mo&#x27;Nique in the exorcism drama &quot;The Deliverance&quot; directed by Lee Daniels for Netflix. The film was released in August 2024. She also stars alongside Josh Brolin and Peter Dinklage in the Amazon MGM Studios film &quot;Brothers&quot;, which was released theatrically on October 10, 2024.
Close was cast alongside Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, and Kyle Chandler in the action-comedy &quot;Back in Action&quot;, for Netflix. The film was released on Netflix globally on January 17, 2025.

====Upcoming projects====
In March 2023, it was announced that Close would star in the upcoming film &quot;The Summer Book&quot;, based on the novel by Tove Jansson, which will be directed by Charlie McDowell.

In May 2024, Close joined the cast of the upcoming &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;. Other cast members for the film include Daniel Craig, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Josh O&#x27;Connor, and Kerry Washington. On June 19, 2024, it was revealed that Close&#x27;s participation in the filming for &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, which by that point in time had only occurred for two days, was delayed, with Close revealing that she got &quot;really hit hard&quot; with both COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Close is set to reprise her stage role of Norma Desmond in a film adaptation of the musical &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, though the film remains in development. In May 2024, it was announced that Close was reuniting with her &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; costar Jeremy Irons in the upcoming Simon Curtis-directed retirement home comedy &quot;Encores&quot;, with Henry Winkler and Don Johnson also co-starring.

==Reception, acting style, and legacy==
Close is regarded as an extraordinarily versatile actress with an immersive acting style and a considerable range. Vanity Fair remarked how Close is &quot;long considered one of the great actresses of our time.&quot; James Lipton described her as an actor who &quot;can find an outstanding number of layers in a role or a single moment; she is a supple actor who performs subtle feats.&quot; Close was also professionally trained by acting coach Harold Guskin, who also mentored Kevin Kline, Bridget Fonda, and James Gandolfini. Working with Guskin, Close learned several important lessons, which she said she&#x27;s applied to her career as well as her life. One such lesson, she claims, was to &quot;read the lines off the page&quot; and remembering to breathe. Close states, &quot;You have to maintain a certain openness, and if you don&#x27;t maintain that, you lose something vital as an actor. It&#x27;s how we&#x27;re wired, and it&#x27;s not a bad thing.&quot; Close says that she went to every rehearsal in order to master her acting skills.

On method acting, Close claims that while she found it an interesting technique, it was not her preferred style. Although Close does extensive research and preparation for her roles, she also relies less on the technicality of a performance saying, &quot;Good acting I think is like being a magician, in that you make people believe; because it&#x27;s only when they believe that they are moved. And I want people to get emotionally involved. I think technique is important but it isn&#x27;t everything. You can have a great technical actor who&#x27;ll leave people cold. That&#x27;s not my idea of great acting. As audience, I don&#x27;t want to be aware of acting.&quot; Longtime collaborator and playwright Christopher Hampton describes Close as an actress who can very easily convey &quot;a sense of strength and intelligence.&quot; Hampton worked on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and the stage production of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, later casting Close in the movie version of the latter production. &quot;Glenn is often described as having a glacial or distant quality about her, but in person she&#x27;s the absolute opposite: warm and intimate,&quot; says actor Iain Glen, who co-starred with her in the 2002 stage production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. &quot;She was able to bring strength to the role, she was able to completely access that vulnerability. There was a real softness to her.&quot;

However, Close is consistently praised for her roles as the villain or antagonist in her performances. Her character in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was ranked number 7 on AFI&#x27;s 100 years...100 heroes and villains list. Regarding her role in the series &quot;Damages&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;There is no actor dead or alive as scary as a smiling Glenn Close.&quot; Journalist Christopher Hooton also praised her, saying, &quot;Christopher Walken, Glenn Close, Al Pacino, and many others have a surprising danger in them. They&#x27;re a little scary to be around, because you feel they might jump you or blow up at you at any time. They are ticking time bombs.&quot; Film historian Cari Beauchamp has stated, &quot;When you look at the top 10 actresses of the past 80 years, since sound came in, first you have Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn and Meryl Streep – but I think Glenn Close is definitely in that list. It&#x27;s a combination of her guts, in the roles she chooses, and her perseverance. We&#x27;re talking about 30 years of nominated performances.&quot;

On January 12, 2009, Close was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of the Roosevelt Hotel. , films featuring Close have grossed over $1.3 billion in North America. She is also regarded as a gay icon, after having played numerous campy roles on screen and stage. She was named one of the most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2019.

In 1989, Close was the commencement speaker at William &amp; Mary and received an honorary doctor of arts degree. In 2023, she returned to the college to serve as the grand marshal of their annual homecoming event. She also helped dedicate William &amp; Mary&#x27;s newly renovated Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall, whose main stage theater was named the Glenn Close Theatre in her honor.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Close has been married three times, with each marriage ending in divorce. Her first marriage at age 22 — which Close has described as &quot;kind of an arranged marriage&quot; — ended before she attended college. This marriage (from 1969 to 1971) was to Cabot Wade, a guitarist and songwriter with whom she had performed during her time at Up with People. From 1979 to 1983, she lived with actor Len Cariou. She was married to grocery heir James Marlas from 1984 to 1987. Later, Close began a relationship with producer John Starke, whom she had met on the set of &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;. Their daughter, Annie Starke, was born in 1988 and is an actress. Close and Starke separated in 1991. In 1995, Close was engaged to carpenter Steve Beers, who had worked on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;; the two never married, and their relationship ended in 1999.

===Interests and views===
Close was born into a Democratic family. Her political donations have mostly been made in support of Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean, John Edwards, Angus King, and Barack Obama. Close also spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. She voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election and attended his inauguration. In a 2016 interview with Andrew Marr for the BBC, Close criticized then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, calling his campaign &quot;terribly frightening.&quot; She reiterated her sentiments about Trump in 2017, stating that &quot;he doesn&#x27;t stand for anything I believe in.&quot;

Close keeps all of her costumes after completing films and rents them out to exhibits. She lent one of the dresses she wore in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; to Madonna for her 1990 VMA performance of &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 2017, she donated her entire costume collection to Indiana University Bloomington.

Close is a New York Mets fan, and has sung the national anthem at Shea Stadium and Citi Field numerous times since 1986.

Due to her upbringing, Close has stated that she is a spiritual but irreligious person.

Close has campaigned for several issues such as women&#x27;s rights, same-sex marriage, and mental health. In 1989 she attended pro-choice marches in Washington, D.C., with Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda. In 1998, Close was a part of a star-studded cast that performed &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; at a benefit. It raised $250,000 in a single evening with proceeds going to the effort to stop violence against women. She was honored with a GLAAD Media Award in 2002 for promoting equal rights among the LGBT community. She volunteered and produced a documentary for &quot;Puppies Behind Bars&quot;, an organization that provides service dogs for wounded war veterans.

Close is also a trustee of The Wildlife Conservation Society and volunteers at Fountain House in New York City, a facility dedicated to the recovery of those suffering from mental illness.

===Mental health initiatives===
Close was a founder and is chairperson of Bring Change to Mind, a US campaign to eradicate the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental illness, supporting her sister Jessie who has bipolar disorder. She contributed chapters to her sister&#x27;s 2015 book about mental illness, &quot;&quot;. In 2010, Close announced to the public that she had her DNA sequenced in order to publicize her family&#x27;s history of mental illness. During the month of July 2013, Close put over 380 designer items up for auction on eBay from the wardrobe of her &quot;Damages&quot; character Patty Hewes. All proceeds were raised to go to her charity Bring Change to Mind. Close had director and friend Ron Howard direct the foundation&#x27;s first PSA. John Mayer also lent his song &quot;Say&quot; for the advert.

In 2013, Close delivered an address at the White House urging passage of the Excellence in Mental-Health Act, which was written to expand treatment for the mentally ill and to provide access to mental-health services. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2014, and will provide $1.1 billion in funding to help strengthen the mental-health-care system in the US. She was awarded the WebMD Health Hero award in 2015 for her contributions to mental-health initiatives. On June 16, 2016, Close donated $75,000 to the Mental-Health Association of Central Florida in order to fund counseling and other assistance to victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.

<doc id="44463" wikidata="Q43252" url="?curid=44463" title="Sophia Loren">
<text>Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone (; born 20 September 1934), known professionally as Sophia Loren ( , ), is an Italian actress, active in her native country and the United States. With a career spanning over 70 years, she is one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema.

Encouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her film career at age 16 in 1950. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with Paramount in 1956 launched her international career. Her film appearances around this time include &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot;, &quot;Houseboat&quot;, and &quot;It Started in Naples&quot;. During the 1950s, she starred in films as a sexually emancipated persona and was one of the best known sex symbols of the time.

Loren&#x27;s performance as Cesira in the film &quot;Two Women&quot; (1960), directed by Vittorio De Sica, won her the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first performer to ever win an Oscar for a non-English-language performance. She holds the record for having earned seven David di Donatello Awards for Best Actress: &quot;Two Women&quot;; &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963); &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; (1964, for which she was nominated for a second Oscar); &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970); &quot;The Voyage&quot; (1974); &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Life Ahead&quot; (2020). She has won five special Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award), a BAFTA Award, a Laurel Award, a Grammy Award, the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, she received the Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievements. In 1999, the American Film Institute named her one of the greatest stars of American film history.

At the start of the 1980s, Loren chose to make rarer film appearances. Since then, she has appeared in films such as &quot;Prêt-à-porter&quot; (1994), &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995), &quot;Nine&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Life Ahead&quot; (2020). Loren was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour in France in July 1991, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (OMRI) in June 1996.

== Early life ==
=== Family and childhood ===
Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone was born on September 20, 1934, in the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome, Kingdom of Italy, the daughter of Romilda Villani (1910–1991) and Riccardo Scicolone Murillo (1907–1976). Her mother was a piano teacher and aspiring actress, her father a failed engineer who worked temporarily for the national railway Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. Loren claimed in her autobiography that he was of noble descent, by virtue of which she is entitled to call herself &quot;Viscountess of Pozzuoli, Lady of Caserta, a title given by the House of Hohenstaufen, Marchioness of Licata Scicolone Murillo&quot;.

Loren&#x27;s father refused to marry her mother, leaving her without financial support. Loren met her father three times, at age five, age seventeen and in 1976 at his deathbed, stating that she forgave him but had never forgotten his abandonment of her mother. Loren&#x27;s parents had another child together, her sister Maria, in 1938. Scicolone did not want to formally recognise Maria as his daughter. When Loren became successful, she paid her father in order to have her sister Maria take the Scicolone last name. Loren has two younger paternal half-brothers, Giuliano and Giuseppe. Romilda, Sofia, and Maria lived with Loren&#x27;s grandmother in Pozzuoli, near Naples.

During the Second World War, the harbour and munitions plant in Pozzuoli was a frequent bombing target of the Allies. During one raid, as Loren ran to the shelter, she was struck by shrapnel and wounded in the chin. After that, the family moved to Naples, where they were taken in by distant relatives. After the war, Loren and her family returned to Pozzuoli. Loren&#x27;s grandmother Luisa opened a pub in their living room, selling homemade cherry liquor. Romilda played the piano, Maria sang, and Loren waited on tables and washed dishes. The place was popular with the American GIs stationed nearby.

=== Pageantry ===
At age 15, Loren as &quot;Sofia Lazzaro&quot; entered the Miss Italia 1950 beauty pageant and was assigned as Candidate No. 2, being one of the four contestants representing the Lazio region. She was selected as one of the last three finalists and won the title of Miss Elegance 1950, while Liliana Cardinale won the title of Miss Cinema and Anna Maria Bugliari won the grand title of Miss Italia. She returned in 2001 as president of the jury for the 61st edition of the pageant. In 2010, Loren crowned the 71st Miss Italia pageant winner.

== Career ==
=== Early roles ===

Sofia Lazzaro enrolled in the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, the national film school of Italy and appeared as an uncredited extra in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, when she was 16 years old.

That same year, Loren appeared in the Italian film &quot;Era lui... sì! sì!&quot;, in which she played an odalisque, and was credited as &quot;Sofia Lazzaro&quot;. In the early part of the decade, she played bit parts and had minor roles in several films, including &quot;La Favorita&quot; (1952).

Carlo Ponti changed her name and public image to appeal to a wider audience as &quot;Sophia Loren&quot;, being a twist on the name of the Swedish actress Märta Torén and suggested by Goffredo Lombardo. Her first starring role was in &quot;Aida&quot; (1953), for which she received critical acclaim.

After playing the lead role in &quot;Two Nights with Cleopatra&quot; (1953), her breakthrough role was in &quot;The Gold of Naples&quot; (1954), directed by Vittorio De Sica. &quot;Too Bad She&#x27;s Bad&quot;, also released in 1954, and &quot;La Bella Mugnaia&quot; (1955) became the first of many films in which Loren co-starred with Marcello Mastroianni. Over the next three years, she acted in many films, including &quot;Scandal in Sorrento&quot;, &quot;Lucky to Be a Woman&quot;, &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Lost&quot; and &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957), the latter film a Napoleonic era war-epic set in Spain starring Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra.

=== International stardom ===

Loren became an international film star following her five-picture contract with Paramount Pictures in 1958. Among her films at this time were &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; with Anthony Perkins, based upon the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play; &quot;Houseboat&quot;, a romantic comedy co-starring Cary Grant; and George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Heller in Pink Tights&quot;, in which she appeared as a blonde for the first time. In 1960, Loren starred in Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Two Women&quot;, a stark, gritty story of a mother who is trying to protect her 12-year-old daughter in war-torn Italy. The two end up gang-raped inside a church as they travel back to their home city following cessation of bombings there. Originally cast as the daughter, Loren fought against type and was eventually cast as the mother (actress Eleonora Brown would portray the daughter). Loren&#x27;s performance earned her many awards, including the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s best performance prize, and an Academy Award for Best Actress, the first major Academy Award for a non-English-language performance or to an Italian actress. She won 22 international awards for &quot;Two Women&quot;. The film was extremely well received by critics and a huge commercial success. Though proud of this accomplishment, Loren did not show up to this award, citing fear of fainting at the award ceremony. Nevertheless, Cary Grant telephoned her in Rome the next day to inform her of the Oscar award.
During the 1960s, Loren was one of the most popular actresses in the world, and continued to make films in the United States and Europe, starring with prominent leading men. In 1961 and 1964, her career reached its pinnacle when she received $1 million to appear in &quot;El Cid&quot; and &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. In 1965, she received a second Academy Award nomination for her performance in &quot;Marriage Italian-Style&quot; opposite Marcello Mastroianni.

Among Loren&#x27;s best-known films of this period are Samuel Bronston&#x27;s epic production of &quot;El Cid&quot; with Charlton Heston, &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1960) with Peter Sellers, &quot;It Started in Naples&quot; (1960) with Clark Gable, Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s triptych &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963) with Marcello Mastroianni, Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Lady L&quot; (1965) with Paul Newman, &quot;Arabesque&quot; (1966) with Gregory Peck, and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s final film, &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot; (1967) with Marlon Brando.

Loren received four Golden Globe Awards between 1964 and 1977 as &quot;World Film Favorite – Female&quot;.

=== Continued success ===
Loren appeared in fewer movies after becoming a mother in 1968. During the next decade, most of her roles were in Italian features. During the 1970s, she was paired with Richard Burton in the last De Sica-directed film, &quot;The Voyage&quot; (1974), and a remake of the film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1974). The film had its premiere on US television on 12 November 1974 as part of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; series on NBC. In 1976, she starred in &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot;. It fared extremely well internationally, and was a respectable box office success in the US market. She co-starred with Marcello Mastroianni again in Ettore Scola&#x27;s &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977). This movie was nominated for 11 international awards such as two Oscars (best actor in leading role, best foreign picture). It won a Golden Globe Award and a César Award for best foreign movie. Loren&#x27;s performance was awarded with a David di Donatello Award, the seventh in her career. The movie was extremely well received by American reviewers.
Following this success, Loren starred in an American thriller &quot;Brass Target&quot;. This movie received mixed reviews, although it was moderately successful in the United States and internationally. In 1978, she won her fourth Golden Globe for &quot;world film favorite&quot;. Other movies of this decade were Academy Award nominee &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970), which was a critical success, and Arthur Hiller&#x27;s &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), which was a critical and commercial failure despite being nominated for several awards, including two Golden Globes. Peter O&#x27;Toole and James Coco were nominated for two NBR awards, in addition the NBR listed &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; in its best ten pictures of 1972 list. Loren headlined the action thriller &quot;Firepower&quot; (1979) co-starring James Coburn and O. J. Simpson, whom she had previously worked with on &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot;.

In 1980, after the international success of the biography &quot;Sophia Loren: Living and Loving, Her Own Story&quot; by A. E. Hotchner, Loren portrayed herself and her mother in a made-for-television biopic adaptation of her autobiography, &quot;Sophia Loren: Her Own Story&quot;. Ritza Brown and Chiara Ferrari each portrayed the younger Loren. In 1981, she became the first female celebrity to launch her own perfume, &#x27;Sophia&#x27;, and a brand of eyewear soon followed.

Loren acted infrequently during the 1980s, preferring to devote more time to raising her sons. In 1981 she turned down the role of Alexis Carrington in the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Although she was set to star in 13 episodes of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1984 as Angela Channing&#x27;s half-sister Francesca Gioberti, negotiations fell through at the last moment and the role went to Gina Lollobrigida instead. She played the title role in the 1984 TV movie &quot;Aurora&quot;, in which she acted alongside her 11-year-old real-life son Edoardo Ponti.

Loren has recorded more than two dozen songs throughout her career, including a best-selling album of comedic songs with Peter Sellers; reportedly, she had to fend off his romantic advances. Partly owing to Sellers&#x27;s infatuation with Loren, he split with his first wife, Anne Howe. Loren has made it clear to numerous biographers that Sellers&#x27;s affections were reciprocated only platonically. This collaboration was covered in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; where actress Sonia Aquino portrayed Loren. The song &quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&quot; by Peter Sarstedt was said to have been inspired by Loren.
=== Later career ===
In 1991, Loren received an Academy Honorary Award, which described her as &quot;One of the genuine treasures of world cinema who, in a career rich with memorable performances, has added permanent luster to our art form.&quot; In 1995, she received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, a similar honorary award, bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, for outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.

She presented Federico Fellini with his honorary Oscar in April 1993. In 2009, Loren stated on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that Fellini had planned to direct her in a film shortly before his death in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Loren was selective about choosing her films and ventured into various areas of business, including cookbooks, eyewear, jewelry, and perfume. She received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;Ready to Wear&quot; (1994), co-starring Julia Roberts.

In 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.

In &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995), Loren played a &quot;femme fatale&quot; opposite Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, and Ann-Margret. The film was a box-office success and became Loren&#x27;s biggest US hit in years. At the 20th Moscow International Film Festival in 1997, she was awarded an Honorable Prize for contribution to cinema. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Loren among the greatest female stars of American film history. In 2001, Loren received a Special Grand Prix of the Americas Award at the Montreal World Film Festival for her body of work. She filmed two projects in Canada during this time: the independent film &quot;Between Strangers&quot; (2002), directed by her son Edoardo and co-starring Mira Sorvino, and the television miniseries &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; (2004).
In 2009, after five years off the set and 14 years since she starred in a prominent US theatrical film, Loren starred in Rob Marshall&#x27;s film version of &quot;Nine&quot;, based on the Broadway musical that tells the story of a director whose midlife crisis causes him to struggle to complete his latest film; he is forced to balance the influences of numerous formative women in his life, including his deceased mother. Loren was Marshall&#x27;s first and only choice for the role. The film also stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Penélope Cruz, Kate Hudson, Marion Cotillard, and Nicole Kidman. As a part of the cast, she received her first nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

In 2010, Loren played her own mother in a two-part Italian television miniseries about her early life, directed by Vittorio Sindoni with Margareth Madè as Loren, entitled &quot;La mia casa è piena di specchi&quot; (&quot;&quot;), based on the memoir by her sister Maria. In July 2013 Loren made her film comeback in an Italian short-film adaptation of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1930 play &quot;The Human Voice&quot; (&quot;La voce umana&quot;), which charts the breakdown of a woman who is left by her lover – with her younger son, Edoardo Ponti, as director. Filming took under a month during July in various locations in Italy, including Rome and Naples. It was Loren&#x27;s first theatrical film since &quot;Nine&quot;. She returned to feature-length film, as Holocaust survivor Madame Rosa, in Ponti&#x27;s 2020 feature film &quot;The Life Ahead&quot;. In 2021 she received AARP Best Actress and AWFJ Grand Dame awards for her role. After turning 90 in September 2024, despite having been inactive since the release of &quot;The Life Ahead&quot;, Loren dismissed rumors about her retirement and expressed her hopes to star in new productions.
On 16 November 2017, Loren received a star at Almeria Walk of Fame in Spain for her work on &quot;White Sister&quot;. She received the Almería Tierra de Cine award.

== Personal life ==
Loren is a Roman Catholic. Since 2006 her primary residence has been in Geneva, Switzerland. Her real estate portfolio has included a ranch in Hidden Valley, California, an apartment in the Hampshire House building in Manhattan, a condo on Williams Island in South Florida, and a villa in Rome.

Loren is an ardent fan of the football club S.S.C. Napoli. In May 2007, when the team was third in Serie B, she (then aged 72) told the &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; that she would do a striptease if the team won. She had recently posed for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar.

In February 2021, she was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; and chose a pizza oven as her luxury item. Her musical choices included Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; as sung by Ella Fitzgerald, and Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Clair de lune&quot; as played by Tamás Vásáry. She revealed that fellow actor Richard Burton was furious with her for cheating at Scrabble.

On 24 September 2023, Loren received emergency surgery following fractures to her hip and femur sustained from a fall at her home in Switzerland.

=== Marriage and family ===

Loren first met Carlo Ponti in 1950, when she was 15 and he was 37, and they soon began an affair. Since divorce was not permitted in Italian law at the time, Ponti was not legally divorced from his wife, Giuliana Fiastri, when Loren married him by proxy (two male lawyers stood in for them) in Mexico on 17 September 1957. The couple had their marriage annulled in 1962 to escape bigamy charges, but continued to live together. In 1965, they became French citizens after their application was approved by then French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. Ponti then obtained a divorce from Giuliana in France, allowing him to marry Loren on 9 April 1966. The marriage lasted until Ponti&#x27;s death on 10 January 2007 from pulmonary complications, aged 94.

The couple had two sons, Carlo Ponti Jr., born on 29 December 1968, and Edoardo Ponti, born on 6 January 1973. Loren&#x27;s daughters-in-law are Sasha Alexander and Andrea Meszaros. Loren has four grandchildren. Drew Barrymore is Loren&#x27;s and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s goddaughter.

In 1962, Loren&#x27;s sister Maria married the youngest son of Benito Mussolini, Romano, with whom she had two daughters, Alessandra, a former MP and MEP, and Elisabetta.

=== Affair with Cary Grant ===

Loren and Cary Grant co-starred in &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958). Grant&#x27;s wife Betsy Drake wrote the original script, and Grant originally intended that Drake would star with him. After he began an affair with Loren while filming &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957), Grant arranged for Loren to take Drake&#x27;s place with a rewritten script for which Drake asked not to receive credit. The affair ended in bitterness before &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot;″s filming ended, causing problems on the &quot;Houseboat&quot; set. Grant hoped to resume the relationship, but Loren decided to marry Carlo Ponti instead.

=== Legal issues and lawsuits ===
In 1982, while in Italy, Loren made headlines after serving 17 days in prison on tax evasion charges. Loren said her accountant had made a mistake on her tax return. The matter did not hamper her popularity or career. In 2013, the Supreme Court of Italy cleared her of the charges in a separate decades-long dispute over the tax she should have paid on her 1974 earnings.

In September 1999, Loren filed a lawsuit against 79 adult websites for posting altered nude photos of her on the internet.

<text>Imereti (Georgian: იმერეთი, ) is a region of Georgia situated in the central-western part of the republic along the middle and upper reaches of the Rioni River. Imereti is the most populous region in Georgia. It consists of 11 municipalities and the city of Kutaisi, which is the capital of the region.

==Subdivisions==
The Imereti region has one self governing city (Kutaisi) and 11 municipalities with 163 administrative communities (temi), totalling to 549 populated settlements:
* Eleven cities: Baghdati, Chiatura, Khoni, Kutaisi, Sachkhere, Samtredia, Terjola, Tkibuli, Tsqaltubo, Vani and Zestaponi;
* Three dabas: Kharagauli, Kulashi and Shorapani;
* Villages: 535

==Economy==
Aside from the capital Kutaisi, significant towns and regional centres include Samtredia, Chiatura (manganese production centre), Tkibuli (coal mining centre), Zestaponi (known for metals production), Vani, Khoni, and Sachkhere. Traditionally, Imereti is an agricultural region, known for its mulberries and grapes.

==Demographics==
The 800,000 Imeretians speak the Imeretian dialect, one of the Northwest dialects of the Georgian language. It is itself subdivided into Upper and Lower Imeretian. They are one of the local culture-groups of the ethnically subdivided Georgian people.

==History==

In ancient times, the region was a part of the Kingdom of Colchis, until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Pontus. After the Third Mithridatic War, Colchis was under loose Roman control, and unsuccessfully revolted in 69 AD under Anicetus. After the collapse of Colchis, the kingdom of Lazica was established in 131 AD as a Roman vassal. Tzath I was the first Christian king of Lazica, being baptized in Constantinople in 523 AD, and fighting alongside Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I in the Iberian War. In 541 AD, the region became the theatre of the Lazic War between Justinian I and Sasanian Persian emperor Khosrow I.

Between 750 and 985, Imereti was ruled by a dynasty of native princes, but was devastated by hostile incursions, reviving only after it became united to Georgia. After the Mongol invasions of Georgia, Imereti was intermittently part of the independent Kingdom of Western Georgia, until being reunited in 1415 as the Duchy of Samokalako under the united Georgian Kingdom. Since that kingdom&#x27;s disintegration in the 15th century, Imereti was an independent kingdom from 1466 onwards.

In the 17th–18th centuries, the kingdom of Imereti experienced frequent invasions by the Turks and paid patronage to the Ottoman Empire until 1810, when it was invaded and annexed by the Russian Empire. The last King of Imereti was Solomon II (1789–1810).

From 1918 to 1921, Imereti was part of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia. Within the USSR, the region was part of the Transcaucasian SFSR from 1922 to 1936, and part of the Georgian SSR from 1936 to 1991. Since Georgian independence in 1991, Imereti has been a region of Georgia with Kutaisi as the regional capital.
