<text>Ars Magica is a role-playing game set in &#x27;Mythic Europe&#x27; – a historically grounded version of Europe and the Levant around AD 1200, with the added conceit that conceptions of the world prevalent in folklore and institutions of the High Middle Ages are factual reality (a situation known informally as the &quot;medieval paradigm&quot;). The players&#x27; involvement revolves around an organization of magi and their allies and foes both mundane and supernatural. The game was originally developed by Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein-Hagen, with its first edition published in 1987.

The current edition (the game&#x27;s fifth) was written by David Chart, and published in 2004 by Atlas Games, who continue to develop new material for it.

&quot;Ars Magica&quot; was one of the first examples of a troupe system. Early editions recommended that the players collaborate to create the campaign world and story with:
* Each player having an opportunity to be Story Guide. (e.g. alternating by play session, &#x27;chapter&#x27; of a story, or at the whim of the troupe)
* Each player having more than one character; when the primary character lacks opportunity or reason to participate in a session (typically due to laboratory or library activity), a secondary character is played.

The Story Guide scheme has been de-emphasised in recent editions; in Fifth Edition it is relegated to an optional play style described at the back of the book. Alternatively a troupe may select one player as the primary story guide responsible for the overall plot, and one or more secondary story guides who run peripheral sessions and/or stories.

To enhance the &#x27;authenticity&#x27; of the historical setting, the game uses medieval Latin for a number of key terms, particularly in the game&#x27;s most prominent feature, a system of Hermetic Magic.

==History==
The first two editions were published by Lion Rampant Games, with several modules published by Atlas Games. In 1991, Lion Rampant merged with White Wolf Magazine to form White Wolf Game Studio.
White Wolf published several adventure modules for the game before adding its Third Edition rulebook, co-authored by Rein•Hagen with Ken Cliffe. This revision greatly expanded the settings and peripheral rules while leaving the core system intact. White Wolf then released at least a dozen supplements for Third Edition, including the addition of Divine and Infernal mechanics, rules for shamanic magic, beginning the Tribunal series and completing the &#x27;Four Seasons&#x27; tetralogy of stories begun by Lion Rampant.

In 1994, publishing rights for the game were sold to Wizards of the Coast, who brought in Jonathan Tweet and started development on a fourth edition. The company published one supplement for the upcoming edition while republishing two supplements for the older edition. Development fell behind schedule, and on December 5, 1995, Wizards of the Coast announced they would leave the tabletop role-playing business altogether, although this turned out to be a temporary departure.
The next year the rights were sold to Atlas Games, who published the 4th edition developed by Tweet and Jeff Tidball. The core book was nominated for the Origins Award in 1996 for Best Roleplaying Game. Continuing to develop the line, Tidwell added several new stories, continued to expand peripheral material and released an extensive line of Tribunal books.

Atlas then assigned David Chart as line developer and released a 5th edition in 2004. This release made extensive changes to the system, especially the mechanics for combat, experience, and character creation. Many players felt that the alterations to the combat system were long overdue, especially the rules for armour, which in previous editions made wearers much more likely to die in combat. This edition won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Role Playing Game of 2004&quot;.

Since 2014, the 4th Edition has been distributed for free at &quot;Warehouse 23&quot; fronted by Steve Jackson Games.

Many characteristics of the Storyteller system developed by White Wolf can be traced to &quot;Ars Magica&quot; and the fact that the Storyteller system was developed by one of &quot;Ars Magica&quot;&#x27;s co-authors; White Wolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was envisioned as &quot;Ars Magica in the Modern World&quot;, and many of the changes in the 3rd edition of &quot;ArM&quot; were to make the game-worlds more compatible.

On the 12th January 2024, Atlas Games announced that a new product in the line, Ars Magica 5th Edition Definitive, was in production and would be crowdfunded later in the year.

==Setting==
The setting, Mythic Europe, is primarily based on Europe of the 12th and 13th centuries; the geography is the same, and the mundane (non-magical) politics are practically identical. However, in &quot;Ars Magica&quot; the &quot;Medieval paradigm&quot; – the way the world was described or understood in that time period – is the literal truth. In this setting, Faeries actually do steal lost children, Demons cause disease and crop failure, Angels help the righteous, and dragons and other Magical creatures are real (though perhaps forgotten or hidden). In 3rd edition, to tie the game into the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; line, this was reality &quot;because&quot; of the beliefs; other editions distance themselves from this interpretation, simply taking place in a world where those beliefs happen to be true.

Player characters typically alternate between the role of a magus (plural &quot;magi&quot;; female maga/magae), and a companion (&quot;Consors&quot;). Companions are select skilled non-magi who help wizards conduct their affairs (as magi tend to be distanced from &quot;mundanes&quot; due to the effects of their magical &quot;Gift&quot;). Additionally, there are a number of Grogs (usually skilled peasants, often bodyguards or watchmen) who can be controlled by any player. (As of the Third Edition, Grogs are also a viable player &#x27;class&#x27;; the Fifth Edition has added an entire supplement dedicated to &#x27;fleshing out&#x27; Grogs.) The wizards generally gather in specialized strongholds called covenants, which are often built in places of power. A covenant is typically a &#x27;home base&#x27; where the magi are in charge (though they may travel Mythic Europe for reasons of politics, resources, study or even leisure). Some consider the covenant to be the central character of the game, and the official rules encourage troupes to develop the covenant along those lines.

===The Order of Hermes===

Standard player-character magi belong to the Order of Hermes, a society of magically &quot;Gifted&quot; humans which was inspired in 767 A.D. by the witch Trianoma and magus Bonisagus after the latter developed a breakthrough in communicating and manipulating magic (termed &#x27;Hermetic Magic&#x27; for its roots in both the Greek deity Hermes, upon which the ancient Roman Cult of Mercury was based, and the works of the legendary figure Hermes Trismegistus).
While magicians at this time were scattered, rarely social and highly distrustful of each other as a rule, two factors strongly favored mutual co-operation. One was Trianoma&#x27;s political vision of an organization that would unite the Gifted for their mutual benefit. The other was Bonisagus&#x27; second breakthrough, the &quot;Parma Magica&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;magic shield&quot;): a highly efficient and easily taught personal ritual which could allow these disparate individuals and traditions to meet on common ground with some assurance of safety. Over subsequent centuries, with very few exceptions, magi who quit or refuse to join the Order have been hunted down and destroyed, giving the Order a definite monopoly over magical resources within its &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27;.

While each of the Order&#x27;s twelve Houses maintains a distinct baseline or tradition in pursuing and transmitting knowledge and power, the Order is also divided into &quot;Tribunals&quot;, each defined by a geographic region of Mythic Europe. Each Tribunal holds a gathering of its magi once every seven years; attendance is not mandatory, though it is essential for certain procedures (e.g. those who have completed their apprenticeships are formally presented for official membership; the &quot;Quæsitores&quot; judge the types of disputes deemed beyond simple inter- or intra-covenant resolution). Once every 33 years, each Tribunal sends a representative to the Grand Tribunal at the site of the Order&#x27;s founding in the Black Forest.

The Tribunals loosely correspond to groupings or portions of modern-day nations; each has a distinct cultural and historical flavor which is expanded in the &quot;Tribunals of Hermes&quot; series. For example, the Roman Tribunal is a densely populated area with a shortage of magical resources, offering highly politicized plot-lines (both within and without the Order itself); Novgorod features vast areas of harsh wilderness, where pagan tribal warfare and magical beasts are significantly more common than elsewhere.

* Greater Alps – including Switzerland with the Alpine regions of Austria and northern Italy.
* Iberian – the precursors to Spain and Portugal; note the Reconquista as current political climate
* Normandy – Northern France and what will soon be known as the Low Countries
* Provençal – Southern France
* Roman – Italy
* Theban – Greece, Bulgaria and Western Asia Minor
* Transylvanian – what will become the Balkans
* Rhine – centered on the Rhine River, core of the Holy Roman Empire
* Novgorod – the broader cultural region known as Rus&#x27;, including Poland
* Stonehenge – England and Wales
* Loch Leglean – Scotland
* Hibernian – Ireland
* Levantine – lands of the Eastern Mediterranean known as the Levant

As with any system of borders not contingent on clear demarcation such as a river or wall, the territory of each Tribunal is rarely defined with precision; this is partially illustrated (via the Fifth Edition &quot;Covenants&quot; book) with the &#x27;Tribunal Border&#x27; characteristic, which situates a covenant in a location that could place it in more than one Tribunal (depending on political favors, conflicts over resources, and so on). Such ambiguity can exist even with &quot;clear&quot; borders such as rivers or mountain ranges, since incorporating supernatural aid or power into the structure (and perhaps the constituency or lifestyle of its inhabitants) can allow them to thrive even in the middle of either such feature.

===Realms of Power===
The overarching premise of the &quot;Ars Magica&quot; setting is that the &quot;mundane&quot; world of ordinary, physical existence is a place where four great supernatural forces have varying degrees of influence and presence.

;The Divine realm: This is the supreme, holy force of Creation – God as represented by the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, and his agents in the world. Divine influence diminishes anything not attuned to it (i.e. anything of a Faerie, Infernal or Magical nature) and is categorically opposed to all things Infernal. One of the Order&#x27;s struggles is in reconciling their avoidance of mundane politics with the inexorable spread of the Dominion (Divine influence permeating the land as more land is settled by Christian and Muslim nations and more centers of Divine worship are constructed).
;The Infernal realm: Satan and his demonic forces. In the medieval context, this includes everything from Satan himself to illnesses and bad smells. Demons are compelled to corrupt, destroy, and tempt all mortals to sin; while the Order of Hermes refuses to explicitly name the Infernal as their enemies (which it is assumed would draw too much attention and wrath to the Order), they have been forbidden from entering into agreements with Hell&#x27;s minions ever since a corruption scandal nearly ruined House Tytalus in the 11th century. As the evil/negative counterpart to the Divine, Infernal power also weakens the effects of any Realm not attuned to Hell or other forsaken spaces. Infernally tainted forms of magic do exist, usually of great deceptive or destructive power, or acquired too easily for understanding, especially in order to tempt magi. Anyone in the Order found guilty of diabolism is expelled and hunted down.
;The Faerie realm: Creatures of traditional fairy tales. These creatures are often capricious, sometimes malicious, but invariably addicted to (even dependent upon for their very existence) human attention, emotion and creative expression. Despite such considerations, Study of the Faerie realm can be rewarding to some. Magi are allowed to associate with the Fae (in fact, one House of the Order has become increasingly dominated by its members&#x27; pursuit of &#x27;Faerie Magic&#x27;) as long as they do not incur their wrath and thereby endanger their fellows.
;The realm of Magic: A mysterious arcane force, to which all magi (among other rare entities) are inherently attuned. This is the power almost exclusively used to cast spells and enchant objects. Magic and Faerie have some positive resonance with each other, reflected in either aura&#x27;s benefit to the other realm&#x27;s powers, and in that remote or lost pagan traditions can have connections with either (in some cases, Faerie entities seem to have &#x27;replaced&#x27; Magical ones when the devotees of the latter either lost their way or became extinct).

Additionally, a &quot;Realm of Reason&quot; appeared in the Third Edition. This was associated with skepticism and empirical observation, and its &quot;rational aura&quot; challenged most supernatural effects. Many fans of the game consider this to be paradoxical and inconsistent, since applying reason and rationality to the world of Ars Magica should really lead to the conclusion that magic does exist and fairies are real, etc., and yet the &quot;True Reason&quot; promoted by this fifth realm posited the contrary, and thus resembled a delusional (yet effective) state of mind rather than a rational one. The realm of Reason had additional counter-intuitive effects – for example, imposing penalties on wizard&#x27;s magic use when in prominent mundane libraries, despite the predominant portrayal of Hermetic Magic as a scholarly pursuit.

Reason proved an unwelcome addition to the game; neither Fourth nor Fifth Edition have included this &#x27;Realm&#x27;, and all references to it have been stricken from the canonical setting.

==System==

===Die-rolling conventions===
There are eight Characteristics: Intelligence, Perception, Strength, Stamina, Presence, Communication, Dexterity and Quickness. Each one is generally rated from −5 to +5 for humans and a Characteristic of 0 is considered &#x27;average&#x27;. To perform a typical action, one of the Characteristics is added to a relevant Ability, and a d10 is rolled. The total of Characteristic + Ability + die roll is compared to a target difficulty or Ease Factor; the action succeeds if the rolled total is greater than or equal to the target number.

If the action is routine or trivial and nothing in particular is at stake, the roll is read as 1–10 and simply added to the total (this is called a &quot;Simple roll&quot;). If there is an opportunity for &quot;exceptional&quot; success or failure, the die is read as 0–9 and is called a &quot;Stress&quot; roll. For Stress rolls, results of &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; have special significance. A &#x27;1&#x27; is rerolled and the result doubled (consecutive &quot;1&quot;s redouble the eventual &quot;non-1&quot;, with consecutive &#x27;1&#x27;s each redoubling the result again). A roll of &#x27;0&#x27; is also re-rolled (more than once in cases of especially hazardous activity) as a Botch roll. If any botch die &quot;also&quot; comes up &#x27;0&#x27;, the action has been botched: failed in some disastrous way. Otherwise, the roll merely equals zero, and the character is assumed to have been unsuccessful at whatever they were trying to accomplish.

===Magic system===
The centerpiece of &quot;Ars Magica&quot; is the system of Hermetic Magic devised by Bonisagus. It consists of 15 Arts, divided into 5 Techniques and 10 Forms. This is sometimes called a &quot;Verb/Noun&quot; system: the Technique is the verb (what effect the magic has), and the Form is the noun (the entity, object or substance that is affected or brought forth). These &#x27;verb-noun&#x27; combinations can be used to cast both Formulaic spells (which are recorded in texts, are learned through study and mastered through experience, and have known, fixed effects) and Spontaneous spells (which a caster improvises with no prior knowledge other than the Arts themselves, giving the potential results greater flexibility but lower potency). Every apprentice (with a few Ex Miscellanea exceptions) is &quot;opened&quot; in all 15 Arts before fully joining the Order; each Art begins with a Score of 0 and a mage may usually only increase one of them during a season (see below).

Each Technique is named by a first-person singular present tense indicative Latin verb:
*Creo (&quot;I create&quot;) brings objects and substances into existence from nothing, or makes an already-existing target a &quot;more perfect&quot; version of itself (e.g. healing magic, as healed bodies are nearer perfection than wounded bodies).
*Intellego (&quot;&quot;I perceive&quot;) detects or reveals, enhances a target&#x27;s natural senses or conveys supernatural ones.
*Muto (&quot;I transform&quot;) alters the nature of a being, object or substance, adding unnatural traits and/or removing natural ones.
*Perdo (&quot;I destroy&quot;) decays, disintegrates or otherwise diminishes the target, making something a worse example of its kind (i.e. the opposite of &quot;Creo&quot;).
*Rego (&quot;I control&quot;&quot;) involves manipulation of the target in any way that does not alter its nature, e.g. direct a target&#x27;s movement, put a creature to sleep, or force a tree to bear fruit out of season. This is the main Technique used in spells of protection or &#x27;warding&#x27;.

Each Form is named by a singular accusative Latin noun:
*Animal affects &quot;all natural living things that are not plants or humans, doing to animals what &quot;Mentem&quot; and &quot;Corpus&quot; spells do to people&quot; as well as &quot;things made with animal products&quot; such as leather, wool, cheese, silk, etc. Since bacteria were unknown in medieval times, illness (e.g.) was considered either a form of possession or an imbalance of &#x27;bodily humors&#x27;; thus, magic dealing with disease is relegated variously to &quot;Creo&quot;, &quot;Mentem&quot; and/or &quot;Vim&quot; effects.
*Auram affects lightning, wind and gaseous substances; other weather effects typically require an &quot;Aquam&quot; requisite (see below).
*Aquam is used for any liquid, with the exception of blood (which requires &quot;Animal&quot; or &quot;Corpus&quot; magic to affect); non-liquid forms of water will involve requisites (see below).
*Corpus (the incorrect declension &quot;Corporem&quot; was used in older editions) applies to the human body, making it crucial to longevity formulas.
*Herbam primarily involves plants, but applies equally to any organic matter, living or dead, that is not of animal origin.
*Ignem involves light and heat, and is heavily represented in the fire spells of House Flambeau.
*Imaginem (previously &quot;Imagonem&quot;) deals with images, sounds, and other sensory stimuli (thus is involved in most illusionary effects).
*Mentem deals with emotions, memories, thoughts and spirits.
*Terram involves earth and minerals: mere soil is the simplest target, while stone, metal and gems require progressively greater investment of spell levels to achieve the same effect.
*Vim (&quot;power&quot;) involves magic itself, as well as demons (the overlap is not widely understood, but the fact that there is one is a significant obstacle to the Order&#x27;s &#x27;public relations&#x27;, particularly concerning the Church).

A mage&#x27;s skill when casting a spell is the sum of their scores in the appropriate technique and form.

Some spells involve more than one Technique, and/or more than one Form at once; each Art used in addition to the basic pair is called a &quot;requisite&quot;. All relevant Art Scores are compared: the caster&#x27;s lowest Technique and lowest Form are used, reflecting the limiting of the caster&#x27;s magical knowledge.

Regardless of how high one&#x27;s Art Scores may rise, there are outer boundaries to the application of Hermetic Magic (whether Formulaic, Spontaneous or even Ritual). Bonisagus&#x27;s theory outlines a set of inherent Limits, similar in concept to the laws of physics; the two central, &#x27;Greater&#x27; Limits are:
# Magic cannot influence a pure manifestation of the Divine; while earthly Relics (however sacred) and agents of the Divine (anything &quot;separate from the mind of God&quot;) may be resistant to magic they are not immune, but it is impossible to (e.g.) interfere with a Miracle (which may be prayed for by an agent or supplicant, but is itself a direct intervention by Divine will).
# Magic cannot permanently change a target&#x27;s Essential Nature (the implications of which vary depending on the target in question).
There are also eleven &#x27;Lesser Limits&#x27; (addressing more specific &#x27;blind spots&#x27; such as aging, creation, time and the soul) which are generally thought either to derive from the two Greater Limits, or to be flaws in Hermetic Theory which may eventually be &#x27;corrected&#x27;.

Additional statistics for every spell (which have been redefined in nearly every new edition of the game) are Target (what or whom the spell is directed at), Range (how far the Target may be from the caster), and Duration.
For reasons of balance, some spells require the expenditure of &quot;vis&quot; – magical essence in physical form – which all magi and covenants tend to make a point of hoarding and/or trading. No &quot;Creo&quot; effect, for example, can be permanent unless vis is consumed during the casting.
Some Formulaic Magic is so effective that it can &quot;only&quot; be achieved with vis and an elaborate, time-consuming ritual (hence, Ritual Spells). This automatically applies to any spell of a greater Level than 50, any spell with a Duration of &#x27;Year&#x27;, and any non-Imaginem spell with a range of &#x27;Sight&#x27;.

===Character development===
All characters (magi, companions and grogs alike) improve their Abilities by applying experience which can be earned through &quot;Exposure&quot;, &quot;Practice&quot;, &quot;Training&quot; or &quot;Study&quot;. Magic, however, is stressed as a multifaceted discipline with a greater variety of avenues for improvement. Magi are expected to spend months at a time with books and/or laboratory equipment: inventing new spells (or learning or modifying existing ones), strengthening their Arts, enchanting items, and so forth. &quot;Ars Magica&quot; includes rules for magical research within the game&#x27;s standard &#x27;advancement&#x27; timescale of 3-month seasons.

These seasonal activities generally concern either study of a text or laboratory activity. Although participating in adventures, missions and other endeavors outside of seasonal activity gives characters &quot;Story Experience&quot;, the most substantial progress (and the &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; of many in the Order) is nearly always from the seasonal activities of magi. Hence, time in an &quot;Ars Magica&quot; campaign may pass much faster than in other RPGs (if, for example, all player-characters are engaged in seasonal activity, standard &quot;roleplaying sessions&quot; are unnecessary for that period) but is also more &#x27;accounted for&#x27; (since regular and exact periods of activity give highly defined benefits). To accommodate this, many magi prolong their lives with unique (to each individual) longevity formulas (generally called &quot;longevity potions&quot;, though the form one takes is not always a potion); this only &quot;delays&quot; the aging process, however; beyond a certain point one&#x27;s longevity formula will have no effect at all and must be reformulated (preferably with increased knowledge of the appropriate Arts and/or greater quantities of &quot;vis&quot;). The increased longevity has led to a prevalent attitude among members of the Order that Companions in general (and Grogs almost invariably) will come and go – perhaps killed in action, occasionally living long enough to retire – while the Magi carry on. Magi &quot;may&quot; concoct longevity formulas for non-magi, but this is a rare consideration, less effective than devising one&#x27;s own personal formula, and is an expensive prospect in time and resources in any case.

Study is primarily achieved with texts, each designed to enhance an Ability, Art or specific Spell(s). A respectable covenant inevitably requires either a respectable library or sufficient commodities to exchange for the use of other libraries, since the dominant form of Hermetic Magic is a scholarly pursuit. Magi who are able to write useful books or teach well can use these as commodities, trading with other magi for books or training (though the Code of Hermes places limits on what its members may sell to &#x27;mundanes&#x27;).

Lab Projects concern projects to enhance one&#x27;s repertoire of spells or magical artifacts. All projects have a level of effect to which the character compares their &#x27;Lab Total&#x27;: Intelligence + Magic Theory ability + sum of a Form and Technique + other bonuses (which may be from local Aura, quality and specialization of lab, assistants, special knowledge, sympathetic connections from items, and in some circumstances an additional Ability). Some merely require a Lab Total to match the Level of Effect; more extensive endeavors simply add up each Lab Total in &#x27;points&#x27; until twice the Level of Effect are accumulated.

The following Lab Projects are the most commonly pursued:
* &quot;Invent Spells&quot;. The magus invents a new magical effect from scratch. A variation of a known spell is easier to invent than a completely original one.
* &quot;Enchant Device&quot;. The magus may create a magical artifact which may hold a magical effect like those of Spells. These can be used by even nonmagical individuals. Usually they cost &quot;vis&quot; to make, but the Lab Total gets a bonus based on the sympathetic Shape &amp; Material bonus of the material used; e.g. if one is enchanting a staff, the fact that it is a staff gives a bonus when the chosen effect is &#x27;controlling things at a distance&#x27;. They can be made as Charged Devices (which cost no &quot;vis&quot; but have a limited number of uses), Lesser Devices (which may only hold one effect, and must have a Level of Effect that the Lab Total can reach in a single season), or Invested Devices (which require additional preparation in advance and thus must be enchanted over several seasons, and may hold several effects based on size and material).
** &quot;Enchant Talisman&quot;. A Talisman is a personalized form of Invested Device with many additional features. Talismans have a much higher capacity for effects with which they may be enchanted, and are easier to enchant. However, should a Talisman fall into the wrong hands, it leaves the magus very vulnerable.
* &quot;Longevity Ritual&quot;. A Creo Corpus effect that prolongs the magus&#x27; life by granting a bonus for Aging Rolls, making it more likely to avoid the deterioration of age which typically begins after 35 years. Thus may a magus live two centuries or longer, barring other mishaps. Magi often pay specialists to devise this ritual for them, to get a better effect than they can personally achieve.
* &quot;Bond with Familiar&quot;. The magus may form a powerful mystical connection with another creature. Usually this will be an animal which is thematically attuned to the magus&#x27; personality and/or specialty: an Auram magus might bond with a bird, or a Herbam magus with a squirrel. The Bonding process is long and hard, but may very well be worth the effort. The animal learns to communicate with the owner, and while it does not become intelligent &quot;per se&quot;, it is almost always brighter than a normal animal of its type. One major benefit of the bond is that the Familiar can be invested with many enchantments (with restrictions as to target and activation), but the primary, unique benefits are from the Bond Scores: the &quot;Gold Cord&quot; concerns magic, and helps the magus avoid magical botches; the &quot;Silver Cord&quot; concerns the mind, helps keep the magus focused and if strong enough may permit speech and telepathy between the two; and the &quot;Bronze Cord&quot; concerns the body, making the magus more enduring and tough.

==Reception==
Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Ars Magica&quot; for &quot;White Wolf&quot; #11, rating it 10 out of 10 overall, and stated that &quot;I really don&#x27;t think I can praise &#x27;Ars Magica&#x27; highly enough. This is simply one of those games that you must get.&quot;

In the December 1988 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 140), Ken Rolston was effusive in his praise, calling &quot;Ars Magica&quot; &quot;a distinctive, original, and intriguing treatment of magic for fantasy role-playing games... earnest, colorful, and meticulous in its development of a magic system with a plausible, coherent rationale. Its attempts to integrate this magic into a historical context are persuasive, and the game master notes and staging tips are wonderfully perceptive.&quot; Rolston concluded, &quot;This is the most interesting and original fantasy role-playing system and setting I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.&quot;

Six months later, Rolston revisited &quot;Ars Magica&quot; for a more in-depth review in the July 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot;. Rolston noted that &quot;the quality of writing, editing, and presentation is first-class&quot;, and he admired the &quot;storyguide&quot; system of role-playing: &quot;This emphasis on the dramatic and narrative elements of role-playing produces some distinctive and thought-provoking perspectives on commonly accepted conventions of role-playing gaming.&quot; Although Rolston gave good marks for the game mechanics, character creation system and combat rules, he was especially drawn to the magic, which he said &quot;has elegant tone and atmosphere.&quot; He also liked the quasi-historical medieval setting. He concluded with strong recommendation: &quot;The &quot;Ars Magica&quot; game features an original and exciting game system, a coherent and satisfying treatment of magic, a convenient and imaginative exploitation of a historical medieval setting, and an explicit and appealing presentation of a role-playing style that emphasizes the common development of the setting, narrative, and PC-group activity over the personal expression of the individual PC.&quot;

In the March 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue #3), Paul Mason believed that this game &quot;truly encourages joint creativity.&quot; He also admired the game mechanics based around single rolls of a ten-sided die, although he found the rules added some unnecessary complications. He suggested that &quot;combat was the weakest part of the game&quot;, finding the game mechanics were too &quot;war-gamey&quot;. But he called the magic system &quot;the centrepiece of the game.&quot; He concluded by giving this game an above-average rating of 4 out of 5, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for a new game to take you away from mechanics and 20th century rationalizations, back into the lands of mystery and enchantment, then this is it.&quot;

In the October–November 1989 edition of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; (Vol. II, Issue 2), J.M. Caparula commented that &quot;In the end, &quot;Ars Magica&quot; is a superb roleplaying game, one that furthers the gaming art in a positive direction.&quot;

In the February–March 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 13), Dave Morris applauded the change in the second edition from four types of dice rolls — something he had initially complained about in the first edition — to only two types of dice rolls. He also admired the re-organization of the magic system, and pointed out that rather than a sample scenario often found in other RPGs, &quot;Ars Magic&quot; offered a sample setting. Morris called this &quot;a more productive inclusion in the main book than a scenario.&quot; He concluded by giving the second edition an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s worth buying for the ideas and the imaginative vision of its authors, even if you don&#x27;t plan to play it.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed the revised edition of &quot;Ars Magica&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #19 (Feb./March, 1990), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;The only other fantasy game which so thoroughly takes advantage of the art of role-playing is &quot;Pendragon&quot; by Chaosium. &quot;Ars Magica&quot; owes something to &quot;Pendragon&quot;, but the unique setting and beautiful magic system of &quot;Ars Magica&quot; truly sets it apart from all the rest.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan liked the extensive magic system, but thought &quot;The game&#x27;s biggest flaw is its combat system, which is far too complicated for an RPG that downplays physical encounters.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;Though the magic rules are fascinating, they&#x27;re probably too sophisticated for newcomers. But for experienced players, &quot;Ars Magica&quot; is one terrific product; this is wizardly role-playing at its finest.&quot;

Matthew Gabbert reviewed &quot;Ars Magica&quot; 3rd edition in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #39 (1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;One thing that pleases me about the new edition is that it doesn&#x27;t make all the previous sourcebooks obsolete. Your investment in older &quot;Ars Magica&quot; products hasn&#x27;t been wasted. If you&#x27;ve never tried the system, this edition is a wonderful way to start.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Ars Magica&quot; was ranked 19th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;This is a fantasy game for the thinking player – although there&#x27;s plenty of scope for action, too. A first success for Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein-Hagen, who both went on to even bigger things, &quot;Ars Magica&quot; includes one of the most flexible, highly-regarded magic systems in the roleplaying hobby. The game, which places heavy emphasis on storytelling, is extremely popular with fans who have followed its troubled history through four different publishers. With Atlas just about to produce a new edition, those fans are currently feeling suitably optimistic.&quot;

<doc id="44606" wikidata="Q255819" url="?curid=44606" title="Casu martzu">
<text> (; ), sometimes spelled &quot;casu marzu&quot;, and also called &quot;casu modde&quot;, &quot;casu cundídu&quot; and &quot;casu fràzigu&quot; in Sardinian, is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese that contains live insect larvae (maggots).

Derived from pecorino, &quot;casu martzu&quot; goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage of decomposition, brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly of the Piophilidae family. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese, promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese&#x27;s fats. The texture of the cheese becomes very soft, with some liquid (called &quot;làgrima&quot;, Sardinian for &quot;teardrop&quot;) seeping out. The larvae themselves appear as translucent white worms, roughly long.

When consumed, the larvae can possibly survive in the intestine, causing enteric pseudomyiasis; however, no cases have been linked to the cheese. Additionally, these larvae can carry harmful microorganisms that may lead to infections. Due to these risks, Italian authorities have banned the sale of this cheese, deeming it dangerous. Consequently, it is also prohibited across the European Union, as EU food safety regulations mandate that only food safe for consumption can be sold.

Variations of this cheese also exist in Corsica, France, where it is called &quot;casgiu merzu;&quot; it is especially produced in some Southern Corsican villages like Sartène.

==Fermentation==
&quot;Casu martzu&quot; is created by leaving whole &quot;pecorino&quot; cheeses outside with part of the rind removed to allow the eggs of the cheese fly &quot;Piophila casei&quot; to be laid in the cheese. A female &quot;P. casei&quot; can lay more than 500 eggs at one time. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the maggots&#x27; digestive system breaks down the cheese&#x27;s fats, making the texture of the cheese very soft; by the time it is ready for consumption, a typical &quot;casu martzu&quot; will contain thousands of these maggots. The &quot;pecorino&quot; is most desirable if made from milk collected towards the end of June, due to the effects of the reproductive cycle of sheep on their lactation, and local fermentation traditions associate higher quality &quot;casu martzu&quot; with exposure to a warm &quot;sirocco&quot; wind, which is thought to additionally soften the cheese to encourage further maggot activity. The overall fermentation process takes a total of three months.

==Consumption==
&quot;Casu martzu&quot; is considered by Sardinian aficionados to be unsafe to eat when the maggots in the cheese have died. Because of this, only cheese in which the maggots are still alive is usually eaten, although allowances are made for cheese that has been refrigerated, which also quickly kills the maggots. Some who eat the cheese prefer not to ingest the maggots. Those who do not wish to eat them place the cheese in a sealed paper bag. The maggots, starved for oxygen, writhe and jump in the bag, creating a &quot;pitter-patter&quot; sound. When the sounds subside, the maggots are dead and the cheese can be eaten. Modern preservation techniques have expanded the cheese&#x27;s shelf life to several years, where it would previously be unobtainable outside of late summer and early autumn.

When the cheese has fermented enough, it is often cut into thin strips and spread on moistened Sardinian flatbread (&quot;pane carasau&quot;), to be served with a strong red wine like cannonau. The flavor is described as &quot;intense&quot;, with Mediterranean, pastoral, and spicy notes. The aftertaste is strong enough to remain for hours after a single serving. Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves distances up to when disturbed, diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots from leaping.

==Health concerns==
It is possible for the larvae to survive the stomach acid and remain in the intestine, leading to a condition called pseudomyiasis. There have been documented cases of pseudomyiasis with &quot;P. casei&quot;, though a report by CNN claims no such cases have been linked to &quot;casu marzu&quot;. The larvae may also carry harmful microorganisms that could cause infections.

A cooperation between sheep farmers and researchers at the University of Sassari developed a hygienic method of production in 2005, aiming to allow the legal selling of the cheese.

Because of its fermentation process, the Guinness World Records listed &quot;casu martzu&quot; as the world&#x27;s most dangerous cheese in 2009.

==History and legal status==
An Italian journalist for &quot;CNN&quot; described &quot;casu martzu&quot;″s cultural status as &quot;revered&quot;, and the unique cheesemaking process combined with the strong, rare taste of the dish are described as icons of the traditional Sardinian pastoral lifestyle. Local gastronome Giovanni Fancello traced the history of Sardinian cuisine to the island&#x27;s time as a province of the Roman Empire, arguing that &quot;we have always eaten worms, Pliny the Elder and Aristotle talked about it... It’s part of our history. We are the sons of this food.&quot; &quot;Casu martzu&quot; is traditionally believed to be an aphrodisiac by Sardinians and the shepherding, milking, and fermentation necessary for the dish feature heavily in the island&#x27;s superstition and mysticism.

The cheese was featured on a cooking show by Gordon Ramsay in 2011, increasing its notoriety to an extent among tourists.

The cheese faced legal challenges from the government of Italy as early as 1962, when it was prohibited under laws against the sale of infested food. Because of European Union food hygiene-health regulations, the cheese has been outlawed, and offenders face heavy fines. Despite this the laws are sometimes not enforced, and some Sardinians organized themselves in order to make &quot;casu martzu&quot; available on the black market, where it may be sold for double the price of an ordinary block of pecorino cheese. As of 2019, the illegal production of this cheese was estimated at per year, worth between €2–3 million.

Attempts have been made to circumvent the Italian and EU ban by having &quot;casu martzu&quot; declared a traditional food. The traditional way of making the cheese is explained by an official paper of the Sardinian government. Sardinia is considered an autonomous region of Italy. 

&quot;Casu martzu&quot; is among several cheeses that are not legal in the United States.

==Other regional variations==

Outside of Sardinia, similar milk cheeses are also produced in the French island of Corsica, as a local variation of the Sardinian cheese produced in some Southern villages and known as or , as well as in a number of Italian regions.

Several other regional varieties of cheese with fly larvae are produced in the rest of Europe. For example, goat-milk cheese is left to the open air until &quot;P. casei&quot; eggs are naturally laid in the cheese. Then it is aged in white wine, with grapes and honey, preventing the larvae from emerging, giving the cheese a strong flavour. In addition, other regions in Europe have traditional cheeses that rely on live arthropods for ageing and flavouring, such as the German and French , both of which rely on cheese mites.

A similar kind of cheese, called &quot;mish&quot;, is also produced in Egypt.

An early printed reference to Stilton cheese points to a similar production technique. Daniel Defoe in his 1724 work &quot;A Tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; notes: &quot;We pass&#x27;d Stilton, a town famous for cheese, which is call&#x27;d our English Parmesan, and is brought to table with the mites or maggots round it, so thick, that they bring a spoon with them for you to eat the mites with, as you do the cheese.&quot;

According to Rabbi Chaim Simons of the Orthodox Union, kosher &quot;casu martzu&quot; can be produced provided that all ingredients are kosher, the rennet comes from a kosher animal slaughtered in accordance with the laws of shechita, and that the cheese is &quot;gevinat Yisrael&quot; (made under Jewish supervision).

<text>The history of British newspapers begins in the 17th century with the emergence of regular publications covering news and gossip. The relaxation of government censorship in the late 17th century led to a rise in publications, which in turn led to an increase in regulation throughout the 18th century. &quot;The Times&quot; began publication in 1785 and became the leading newspaper of the early 19th century, before the lifting of taxes on newspapers and technological innovations led to a boom in newspaper publishing in the late 19th century. Mass education and increasing affluence led to new papers such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; emerging at the end of the 19th century, aimed at lower middle-class readers.

In the early 20th century, the British press was dominated by a few wealthy press barons. Many papers published more popular stories, including sports and other features, in an attempt to boost circulation. In 1969 Rupert Murdoch bought and relaunched &quot;The Sun&quot; as a tabloid and soon added pictures of topless models on Page 3. Within a few years the Sun was the UK&#x27;s most popular newspaper.

In the 1980s national newspapers began to move out of Fleet Street, the traditional home of the British national press since the 18th century. By the early 21st century newspaper circulation began to decline.

In the early 2010s many British newspapers were implicated in a major phone hacking scandal which led to the closure of the &quot;News of the World&quot; after 168 years of publication and the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.

==17th century==
During the 17th century there were many kinds of news publications that told both the news and rumours, such as pamphlets, posters and ballads. Even when news periodicals emerged, many of these co-existed with them. A news periodical differs from these mainly because of its periodicity. The definition for 17th century newsbooks and newspapers is that they are published at least once a week. Johann Carolus&#x27; &quot;Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien&quot;, published in Strassburg in 1605, is usually regarded as the first news periodical.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in the English language was printed in Rome by Joris Veseler around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler&#x27;s earlier Dutch paper &quot;Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &amp;c.&quot; However, when the English started printing their own papers in London, they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of the Star Chamber. After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the &quot;Oxford Gazette&quot; in 1665.

The control over printing relaxed greatly after the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641. The English Civil War escalated the demand for news. News pamphlets or books reported the war, often supporting one side or the other. A number of publications arose after the Restoration, including &quot;The London Gazette&quot; (first published on 18 November 1665 as the &quot;Oxford Gazette&quot;), the first official journal of record and the newspaper of the Crown. Publication was controlled under the Licensing Act 1662, but the act&#x27;s lapses from 1679 to 1685 and from 1695 onwards encouraged a number of new titles.

&quot;Mercurius Caledonius&quot; founded in Edinburgh in 1660, was Scotland&#x27;s first but short-lived newspaper. Only 12 editions were published during 1660 and 1661.

==18th century==

There were twelve London newspapers and 24 provincial papers by the 1720s. The &quot;Daily Courant&quot; (11 March 1702–1703) was the first successful daily newspaper in London. In 1695 the &quot;Postboy&quot; had been started as a daily paper (actually the first in London), but only four numbers appeared. The &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; was started by Henry Woodfall in the 18th century.

The first English journalist to achieve national importance was Daniel Defoe. On 19 February 1704, whilst still in Newgate Prison for a political offence, he began his weekly, &quot;The Review&quot;, which was eventually printed three times a week and was a forerunner of &quot;The Tatler&quot; (started by Richard Steele in 1709) and &quot;The Spectator&quot; (started by Steele and Joseph Addison in 1711). Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Review&quot; came to an end in 1713. Between 1716 and 1720 he published a monthly newspaper with old style title, &quot;Mercurius Politicus.&quot; &quot;The Examiner&quot; started in 1710 as the chief Conservative political mouthpiece, which enjoyed as its most influential contributor, Jonathan Swift. Swift had control of the journal for 33 issues between November 1710 and June 1711, but once he became dean of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Dublin, he gave up regular journalistic work.

In 1702 Edward Lloyd, the virtual founder of the famous &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s&quot; of commerce, started a thrice a week newspaper, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s News&quot;, which had but a brief existence in its initial form, but was the precursor of the modern &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot;. The 76th issue of the original paper contained a paragraph mentioning the House of Lords, for which the publisher was told he would have to pay a fine. He preferred to discontinue his publication instead. In 1726 he in part revived it, under the title of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot;, published at first weekly, it would later become a daily.

The &quot;Edinburgh Courant&quot; was published out of Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland. Its first issue was dated 14-19 Feb 1705 and was sold for a penny. It was one of the country&#x27;s first regional papers, second only to the Norwich Post (1701). The paper was produced twice weekly for five years, then continued as the &quot;Scots Courant&quot; until April 1720. Later that same year, the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant&quot; began publication, and it survived until the &quot;Evening News&quot; came into existence in 1873.

The increasing popularity and influence of newspapers was problematic to the government of the day. The first bill in parliament advocating a tax on newspapers was proposed in 1711. The duty eventually imposed in 1712 was a halfpenny on papers of half a sheet or less and a penny on newspapers that ranged from half a sheet to a single sheet in size. Jonathan Swift expressed in his &quot;Journal to Stella&quot; on 7 August 1712, doubt in the ability of &quot;The Spectator&quot; to hold out against the tax. This doubt was proved justified in December 1712 by its discontinuance. However, some of the existing journals continued production and their numbers soon increased. Part of this increase was attributed to corruption and political connections of its owners. Later, toward the middle of the same century, the provisions and the penalties of the Stamp Act were made more stringent, yet the number of newspapers continued to rise. In 1753 the total number of copies of newspapers sold yearly in Britain amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790 and in 1767 to 11,300,980. In 1776 the number of newspapers published in London alone had increased to 53.

&quot;The News Letter&quot; is one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s main daily newspapers, published Monday to Saturday. It is the oldest English-language general daily newspaper still in publication in the world, having first been printed in 1737. Originally published three times weekly, it became daily in 1855.

The 18th century saw the gradual development of the purely political journal side by side with those papers which were primarily devoted to news, domestic and foreign, and commerce. It was left to Steele and Addison to develop the social side of journalism in their respective papers. In 1761 the &quot;North Briton&quot; came out and it was largely a result of its publisher, John Wilkes, and his campaign for increased freedom of the press that, in 1772 the right to publish parliamentary reports was established.

&quot;The Observer&quot;, first published on 4 December 1791, was the world&#x27;s first Sunday newspaper.

==19th century==

By the early 19th century, there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were gone by 1855) there was a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public&#x27;s need for information. &quot;The Daily Universal Register&quot; began life in 1785 and was later to become known as &quot;The Times&quot; from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860 there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests.

In 1802 and 1815 the tax on newspapers was increased to three pence and then four pence. Unable or unwilling to pay this fee, between 1831 and 1835 hundreds of untaxed newspapers made their appearance. The political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary. Their publishers were prosecuted but this failed to discourage untaxed newspapers. It was chiefly Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden who advocated the case in parliament to first reduce in 1836 and, in 1855, totally repeal the tax on newspapers. The development of the press was greatly assisted by the gradual abolition of the taxes on periodicals as well as by the introduction of a cheap postal system. Both of these developments made the newspaper more affordable to a greater percentage of the population. The burden of the newspaper tax on publishers was heavy, resulting in 29,400,000 tax stamps being issued in 1820. In 1828 the proprietor of &quot;The Times&quot; had to pay the state more than £68,000 in taxes. After the reduction of the stamp tax in 1836 from four pence to one penny, the circulation of English newspapers rose from 39,000,000 to 122,000,000 by 1854.

A number of press directories listing newspapers and periodicals were published in the 19th century, including Mitchell&#x27;s Press Directories, May&#x27;s handbooks and guides, Deacon&#x27;s Newspaper Handbook and the Handy Newspaper List.
===Major papers===
&quot;The Courier&quot; is a newspaper published by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. in Dundee, Scotland. It had five daily editions for Dundee, Fife, Perth and Angus. It was established in 1801 as the &quot;Dundee Courier &amp; Argus&quot;. Like most papers the entire front page was devoted to classified advertisements; &quot;The Courier&quot; was unusual in maintaining this format until 1992, before adopting the headline-news format.

&quot;Seren Gomer&quot; was a Welsh language periodical founded in 1814 by the clergyman and writer Joseph Harris (Gomer), the first Welsh-language newspaper.

The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of non-conformist businessmen. Its most famous editor, Charles Prestwich Scott, made the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s. It is now called &quot;The Guardian&quot; and published in London.

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; was launched in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer William Ritchie and customs official Charles Maclaren in response to the &quot;unblushing subservience&quot; of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment. The paper was pledged to &quot;impartiality, firmness and independence&quot;. Its modern editorial line is firmly anti-independence. After the abolition of newspaper stamp tax in Scotland in 1855, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at 1d and a circulation of 6,000 copies.

The Chartist &quot;Northern Star&quot;, first published on 26 May 1838, was a pioneer of popular journalism but was very closely linked to the fortunes of the movement and was out of business by 1852. At the same time there was the establishment of more specialised periodicals and the first cheap newspaper in the &quot;Daily Telegraph and Courier&quot; (1855), later to be known simply as the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. 

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was first published on 29 June 1855 and was owned by Arthur Sleigh, who transferred it to Joseph Levy the following year. Levy produced it as the first penny newspaper in London. His son, Edward Lawson soon became editor, a post he held until 1885. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; became the organ of the middle class and could claim the largest circulation in the world in 1890. It held a consistent Liberal Party allegiance until opposing Gladstone&#x27;s foreign policy in 1878 when it turned Unionist.

&quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, founded in 1842, was the world&#x27;s first illustrated weekly newspaper. Mason Jackson, its art editor for thirty years, published in 1885 &quot;The Pictorial Press&quot;, a history of illustrated newspapers. &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; was published weekly until 1971 when it became monthly; bimonthly from 1989; and then quarterly before publication ceased.

The &quot;Western Mail&quot; was founded in Cardiff in 1869 by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute as a penny daily paper. It describes itself as &quot;the national newspaper of Wales&quot; (originally &quot;the national newspaper of Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;), although it has a very limited circulation in North Wales.

From 1860 until around 1910 is considered a &#x27;golden age&#x27; of newspaper publication, with technical advances in printing and communication combined with a professionalisation of journalism and the prominence of new owners. Newspapers became more partisan and there was the rise of new or yellow journalism (see William Thomas Stead). Socialist and labour newspapers also proliferated and in 1912 the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was launched as the first daily newspaper of the trade union and labour movement.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was first published in 1896 by Lord Northcliffe. It became Britain&#x27;s second biggest-selling daily newspaper, outsold only by &quot;The Sun&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was Britain&#x27;s first daily newspaper aimed at the newly literate &quot;lower-middle class market resulting from mass education, combining a low retail price with plenty of competitions, prizes and promotional gimmicks&quot;, and the first British paper to sell a million copies a day. It was, from the outset, a newspaper for women, being the first to provide features especially for them, and is the only British newspaper whose readership is more than 50% female, at 53%.

===Style===
With literacy rising sharply, the rapidly growing demand for news led to changes in the physical size, visual appeal, heavy use of war reporting, brisk writing style, and an omnipresent emphasis on speedy reporting thanks to the telegraph. Critics noted how London was echoing the emerging New York style of journalism. The new news writing style first spread to the provincial press through the &quot;Midland Daily Telegraph&quot; around 1900.

Newspapers increasingly made their profit from selling advertising. In the 1850s and 1860s the ads appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.

==20th century==
After the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race. The political parties, which long had sponsored their own papers, could not keep up, and one after another their outlets were sold or closed down. Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base. The niche was dominated by &quot;The Times&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;The Daily Telegraph.&quot; Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London. James Curran and Jean Seaton report: 
: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men, Lords Beaverbrook (1879-1964), Rothermere (1868-1940), Camrose (1879-1954) and Kemsley (1883-1968)–became the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.

&quot;The Times&quot; was long the most influential prestige newspaper, although far from having the largest circulation. It gave far more attention to serious political and cultural news. In 1922, John Jacob Astor (1886-1971), son of the 1st Viscount Astor (1849-1919), bought &quot;The Times&quot; from the Northcliffe estate. The paper advocated appeasement of Hitler&#x27;s demands. Its editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and pushed hard for the Munich Agreement in 1938. Candid news reports by Norman Ebbutt from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy. In March 1939, however, it reversed course and called for urgent war preparations.

Most of the &quot;press barons&quot; who owned and closely supervised major newspapers were empire builders focused on making money and extending their audience. A few tried to exploit their captive audiences to help shape British politics, but they were largely unsuccessful. The large papers were all mildly conservative but none were organs of the Conservative Party. The Liberals lost nearly all their media and Labour had one small captive outlet, The &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. The largely lower-middle-class readership wanted entertainment not political guidance. In 1931 Conservative former prime minister Stanley Baldwin denounced the media barons who had become his enemies by repeated Kipling&#x27;s words: &quot;What proprietorship of these papers is aiming at is power, and power without responsibility—the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages.&quot; Lord Beaverbrook owned the best-selling &quot;Daily Express&quot; as well as London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. It was alleged that he played favourites, giving publicity to politicians he supported, and largely ignoring his enemies. Beaverbrook vehemently denied the allegations. Beaverbrook in 1929 launched a new political party to promote free trade within the British Empire. His Empire Free Trade Crusade had little success; Beaverbrook quickly lost interest, and the new party soon vanished.

===Developments===
By the 1930s, over two-thirds of the population read a newspaper every day, with &quot;almost everyone&quot; taking one on Sundays.

The &quot;Morning Star&quot; was founded in 1930 as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, organ of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). is a left-wing British daily tabloid newspaper with a focus on social and trade union issues. 

A 1938 &quot;Report on the British Press&quot; (from the think tank Political and Economic Planning) expressed concerns that &quot;a dangerous tendency has recently been manifesting itself by which entertainment ceases to be ancillary to news and either supersedes it or absorbs it; many people welcome a newspaper that under the guise of presenting news, enables them to escape from the grimness of actual events and the effort of thought by opening the backdoor of triviality and sex appeal. Such readers are left ill-informed and unable to participate intelligently in political debate.&quot; The report also contained worries about the fact that &quot;general accuracy of the Press is comparatively low by scientific or administrative standards,&quot; and about early press intrusion causing &quot;considerable public indignation against sections of the press.&quot; They closed by advising &quot;the formation of a Press Tribunal to address complaints, and a Press Institute to provide continuous scientific study of the Press.&quot;

The first Royal Commission on the Press recommended in 1949 that a General Council of the Press should be formed to govern the behaviour of the print media. In response to a threat of statutory regulation, the voluntary General Council of the Press was formed in 1953, funded by newspaper proprietors. Membership was initially restricted to newspaper editors but was reformed as the Press Council in 1962, with 20 per cent lay members. The council had a non-binding regulatory framework with the stated aim of maintaining high standards of ethics in journalism. In 1980 the National Union of Journalists withdrew from membership. In 1991, the Press Council was replaced by the Press Complaints Commission.

When he relaunched the flagging &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper in tabloid format on 17 November 1969, Rupert Murdoch began publishing photographs of clothed glamour models on its third page. &quot;Page 3&quot; photographs over the following year were often provocative, but did not feature nudity. On 17 November 1970, editor Larry Lamb celebrated the tabloid&#x27;s first anniversary by publishing a photograph of a model in the nude sitting in a field with one of her breasts visible from the side. The &quot;Sun&quot; gradually began to feature Page Three girls in more overtly topless poses. Although these photographs caused controversy at the time, and led to the &quot;Sun&quot; being banned from some public libraries, they are partly credited with the increased circulation that established the &quot;Sun&quot; as one of the most popular newspapers in the United Kingdom by the mid-1970s. In an effort to compete with the &quot;Sun&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;Daily Star&quot; tabloids also began publishing images of topless women. The Mirror stopped featuring topless models in the 1980s, deeming the photographs demeaning to women.

The &quot;Scottish Daily News&quot; was a left-of-centre daily newspaper published in Glasgow between 5 May and 8 November 1975. It was hailed as Britain&#x27;s first worker-controlled, mass-circulation daily, formed as a workers&#x27; cooperative by 500 of the 1,846 journalists, photographers, engineers, and print workers who were made redundant in April 1974 by Beaverbrook Newspapers when the &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot; closed its printing operations in Scotland and moved to Manchester.

The Wapping dispute was a significant turning point in the history of the trade union movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employers, News International (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by Rupert Murdoch). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in the London district of Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). Despite the widespread use of the offset litho printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers in common with the rest of Fleet Street continued to be produced by the hot-metal and labour-intensive Linotype method, rather than being composed electronically. Eddy Shah&#x27;s Messenger group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at Warrington had benefited from the Thatcher government&#x27;s trade union legislation to allow employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the company to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. He launched &quot;Today&quot; on Tuesday 4 March 1986, as a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot;. It pioneered computer photosetting and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Established national newspapers converted to electronic production and colour printing. &quot;Today&quot; ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; in 1971.

By 1988, nearly all the national newspapers had abandoned Fleet Street to relocate in the Docklands, and had begun to change their printing practices to those being employed by News International. Even though the last major British news office, Reuters, left in 2005, the term &quot;Fleet Street&quot; continues to be used as a metonym for the British national press.

&quot;The Independent&quot; was first published on 7 October 1986. The paper was created at a time of fundamental change and attracted staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to the new headquarters in Wapping. Launched with the advertising slogan &quot;It is. Are you?&quot;, and challenging &quot;The Guardian&quot; for centre-left readers, and &quot;The Times&quot; as a newspaper of record, it reached a circulation of over 400,000 in 1989. Competing in a moribund market, &quot;The Independent&quot; sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as a price war.

&quot;The European&quot;, billed as &quot;Europe&#x27;s first national newspaper&quot;, was a weekly newspaper founded by Robert Maxwell. It lasted from 11 May 1990 until December 1998. The circulation peaked at 180,000, over half of which was British. The Barclay brothers bought the newspaper in 1992, investing an estimated $110 million and in 1996 transforming it into a high-end tabloid format oriented at the business community edited by Andrew Neil.

By the 1980s Robert Maxwell&#x27;s various companies owned the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, the Scottish &quot;Daily Record&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; and several other newspapers. Maxwell was litigious against those who would speak or write against him. The satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; lampooned him as &quot;Cap&#x27;n Bob&quot; and the &quot;bouncing Czech&quot;, the latter nickname having originally been devised by Prime Minister Harold Wilson (under whom Maxwell was an MP). Maxwell took out several libel actions against &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Maxwell&#x27;s untimely death triggered a flood of instability with banks frantically calling in their massive loans, and his publishing empire collapsed. It emerged that, without adequate prior authorisation, Maxwell had used hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies&#x27; pension funds to shore up the shares of the Mirror Group, to save his companies from bankruptcy.

==21st century==
In 2005, the UK-based online newspaper PinkNews was established. It is targeted towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community (LGBT) in the UK and worldwide.

===The phone hacking scandal===

The News International phone hacking scandal is an ongoing controversy involving the &quot;News of the World&quot; and other British newspapers published by News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. Employees of the newspaper were convicted of engaging in phone hacking, police bribery, and exercising improper influence in the pursuit of publishing stories. Advertiser boycotts contributed to the closure of the &quot;News of the World&quot; on 10 July 2011, ending 168 years of publication.

The Leveson Inquiry was a judicial public inquiry into the British press; a series of public hearings were held throughout 2011 and 2012. The Inquiry published the &quot;Leveson Report&quot; in November 2012, which reviewed the general culture and ethics of the British media, and made recommendations for a new, The independent, body to replace the existing Press Complaints Commission, which would be recognised by the state through new laws.

===Declining circulation===
During the early 21st century, newspaper circulation dropped rapidly. The sector&#x27;s advertising revenues fell 15% during 2015 alone, with estimates of a further 20% drop over the course of 2016. ESI ceased print of &quot;The Independent&quot; that year- the newspaper having suffered a 94% drop in sales from its peak in the 1980s. The decline of the newspaper industry has been linked to the rise of internet usage in Britain.

In 2017, European Broadcasting Union research found that people in the United Kingdom trusted the written press least of any European country, by a considerable margin. Within the United Kingdom the written press was trusted less than television and the radio.

<doc id="44608" wikidata="Q4605" url="?curid=44608" title="Sarah Bernhardt">
<text>Sarah Bernhardt (; born Henriette-Rosine Bernard; 22 October 1844 – 26 March 1923) was a French stage actress who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; by Victor Hugo, &quot;Fédora&quot; and &quot;La Tosca&quot; by Victorien Sardou, and &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; by Edmond Rostand. She played female and male roles, including Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet. Rostand called her &quot;the queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture&quot;, and Hugo praised her &quot;golden voice&quot;. She made several theatrical tours worldwide and was one of the early prominent actresses to make sound recordings and act in motion pictures.

She is also linked with the success of artist Alphonse Mucha, whose work she helped to publicize. Mucha became one of the more sought-after artists of this period for his Art Nouveau style.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Henriette-Rosine Bernard was born at 5 rue de L&#x27;École-de-Médecine in the Latin Quarter of Paris on 22 October 1844. She was the daughter of Judith Bernard (also known as Julie and in France as Youle), a Dutch Jewish courtesan with a wealthy or upper-class clientele. The name of her father was not recorded for a long time, but he is known now to have been an attorney in Le Havre. Bernhardt later wrote that her father&#x27;s family paid for her education, insisted she be baptized as a Catholic, and left a large sum to be paid when she came of age. Her mother traveled frequently, and saw little of her daughter. She placed Bernhardt with a nurse in Brittany, then in a cottage in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine.

When Bernhardt was seven, her mother sent her to a boarding school for young ladies in the Paris suburb of Auteuil, paid with funds from her father&#x27;s family. There, she acted in her first theatrical performance in the play &quot;Clothilde&quot;, where she held the Queen of the Fairies role and performed her first of many dramatic death scenes. While in the boarding school, her mother rose to the top of Parisian courtesans, consorting with politicians, bankers, generals, and writers. Her patrons and friends included Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny, the half-brother of Emperor Napoleon III and President of the French legislature.

At the age of 10, with the sponsorship of Morny, Bernhardt was admitted to Grandchamp, an exclusive Augustine convent school near Versailles. At the convent, she performed the part of the Archangel Raphael in a story based on the Book of Tobit. She declared her intention to become a nun but did not always follow convent rules; she was accused of sacrilege when she arranged a Christian burial, with a procession and ceremony, for her pet lizard. She received her first communion as a Roman Catholic in 1856 and was fervently religious after that. However, she never forgot her Jewish heritage. When asked years later by a reporter if she were a Christian, she replied: &quot;No, I&#x27;m a Roman Catholic and a member of the great Jewish race. I&#x27;m waiting until Christians become better.&quot; That contrasted her answer, &quot;No, never. I&#x27;m an atheist&quot; to an earlier question by composer and compatriot Charles Gounod if she ever prayed. Regardless, she accepted the last rites shortly before her death.

In 1857, Bernhardt learned that her father had died overseas. Her mother summoned a family council, including Morny, to decide what to do with her. Morny proposed that Bernhardt should become an actress. This idea horrified Bernhardt, as she had never been inside a theatre. Morny arranged for her to attend her first theatre performance at the Comédie Française in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend Alexandre Dumas &quot;père&quot;. The play they attended was &quot;Britannicus&quot;, by Jean Racine, followed by the classical comedy &quot;Amphitryon&quot; by Plautus. The play&#x27;s emotion so moved Bernhardt that she began to sob loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience. Morny and others in their party were angry at her. They left, but Dumas comforted her and later told Morny that he believed she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her &quot;my little star&quot;.

Morny used his influence with the composer Daniel Auber, the head of the Paris Conservatory, to arrange for Bernhardt to audition. She began preparing, as she described it in her memoirs, &quot;with that vivid exaggeration with which I embrace any new enterprise.&quot; Dumas coached her. The jury comprised Auber and five leading actors and actresses from the Comédie Française. She was supposed to recite verses from Racine, but no one had told her that she needed someone to give her cues as she recited. Bernhardt told the jury she would instead recite the fable of the Two Pigeons by La Fontaine. The jurors were skeptical, but the enthusiasm and pathos of her recitation won them over, and she was invited to become a student.

===Debut and departure from the Comédie-Française (1862–1864)===
Bernhardt studied acting at the Conservatory from January 1860 until 1862 under two prominent actors of the Comédie Française, Joseph-Isidore Samson and Jean-Baptiste Provost. She wrote in her memoirs that Provost taught her diction and grand gestures, and Samson taught her the power of simplicity. For the stage, she changed her name from &quot;Bernard&quot; to &quot;Bernhardt&quot;. While studying, she also received her first marriage proposal, from a wealthy businessman who offered her 500,000 francs. He wept when she refused. Bernhardt wrote that she was &quot;confused, sorry, and delighted—because he loved me the way people love in plays at the theater.&quot;

Before the first examination for her tragedy class, she tried to straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which made it even more uncontrollable, and came down with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that she hardly recognised it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her performance were classical and required carefully stylised emotions, but she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the Théâtre Français, who offered Bernhardt a place as a &quot;pensionnaire&quot; at the theater, at a minimum salary.

Bernhardt made her debut with the company on 31 August 1862 in the title role of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie&quot;. Her premiere was not a success. She experienced stage fright and rushed her lines. Some audience members made fun of her thin figure. When the performance ended, Provost was waiting in the wings, and she asked his forgiveness. He told her, &quot;I can forgive you, and you&#x27;ll eventually forgive yourself, but Racine in his grave never will.&quot; Francisque Sarcey, the influential theater critic of &quot;L&#x27;Opinion Nationale&quot; and &quot;Le Temps&quot;, wrote: &quot;she carries herself well and pronounces with perfect precision. That is all that can be said about her at the moment.&quot;

Bernhardt did not remain long with the Comédie-Française. She played Henriette in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Femmes Savantes&quot; and Hippolyte in &quot;L&#x27;Étourdi&quot;, and the title role in Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Valérie&quot;, but did not impress the critics, or the other members of the company, who had resented her rapid rise. The weeks passed, but she was given no further roles. Her hot temper also got her into trouble; when a theater doorkeeper addressed her as &quot;Little Bernhardt&quot;, she broke her umbrella over his head. She apologised profusely, and when the doorkeeper retired 20 years later, she bought a cottage for him in Normandy. At a ceremony honoring the birthday of Molière on 15 January 1863, Bernhardt invited her younger sister, Regina, to accompany her. Regina accidentally stood on the train of the gown of a leading actress of the company, Zaïre-Nathalie Martel (1816–1885), known as Madame Nathalie. Madame Nathalie pushed Regina off the gown, causing her to strike a stone column and gash her forehead. Regina and Madame Nathalie began shouting at one another, and Bernhardt stepped forward and slapped Madame Nathalie on the cheek. The older actress fell onto another actor. Thierry asked that Bernhardt apologise to Madame Nathalie. Bernhardt refused to do so until Madame Nathalie apologised to Regina. Bernhardt had already been scheduled for a new role with the theater, and had begun rehearsals. Madame Nathalie demanded that Bernhardt be dropped from the role unless she apologised. Because neither yielded, and Madame Nathalie was a senior member of the company, Thierry was forced to ask Bernhardt to leave.

===The Gymnase and Brussels (1864–1866)===
Her family could not understand her departure from the theater; it was inconceivable to them that anyone would walk away from the most prestigious theatre in Paris at age 18. Instead, she went to a popular theatre, the Gymnase, where she became an understudy to two of the leading actresses. She almost immediately caused another offstage scandal, when she was invited to recite poetry at a reception at the Tuileries Palace hosted by Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie, along with other actors of the Gymnase. She chose to recite two romantic poems by Victor Hugo, unaware that Hugo was a bitter critic of the emperor. Following the first poem, the emperor and empress rose and walked out, followed by the court and the other guests. Her next role at the Gymnase, as a foolish Russian princess, was entirely unsuited for her; her mother told her that her performance was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. She decided abruptly to quit the theater to travel, and like her mother, to take on lovers. She went briefly to Spain, then, at the suggestion of Alexandre Dumas, to Belgium.

She carried to Brussels letters of introduction from Dumas, and was admitted to the highest levels of society. According to some later accounts, she attended a masked ball in Brussels where she met the Belgian aristocrat Henri, Hereditary Prince de Ligne, and had an affair with him. Other accounts say that they met in Paris, where the Prince came often to attend the theater. The affair was cut short when she learned that her mother had had a heart attack. She returned to Paris, where she found that her mother was better, but that she was pregnant from her affair with the Prince. She did not notify the Prince. Her mother did not want the fatherless child born under her roof, so she moved to a small apartment on rue Duphot, and on 22 December 1864, the 20-year-old actress gave birth to her only child, Maurice Bernhardt.

Some accounts say that Prince Henri had not forgotten her. According to these versions, he learned her address from the theatre, arrived in Paris, and moved into the apartment with Bernhardt. After a month, he returned to Brussels and told his family that he wanted to marry the actress. The family of the Prince sent his uncle, General de Ligne, to break up the romance, threatening to disinherit him if he married Bernhardt. According to other accounts, the Prince denied any responsibility for the child. She later called the affair &quot;her abiding wound&quot;, but she never discussed Maurice&#x27;s parentage with anyone. When asked who his father was, she sometimes answered, &quot;I could never make up my mind whether his father was Gambetta, Victor Hugo, or General Boulanger.&quot; Many years later, in January 1885, when Bernhardt was famous, the Prince allegedly came to Paris and offered to formally recognise Maurice as his son, but Maurice politely declined, explaining he was entirely satisfied to be the son of Sarah Bernhardt. (While the story is in character for Maurice, note that the Prince died in 1871 when Maurice was 6.)

===The Odéon (1866–1872)===
To support herself after the birth of Maurice, Bernhardt played minor roles and understudies at the Porte Saint-Martin theatre, a popular melodrama theatre. In early 1866, she obtained a reading with Felix Duquesnel, director of the Théâtre de L&#x27;Odéon (Odéon) on the Left Bank. Duquesnel described the reading years later, saying, &quot;I had before me a creature who was marvelous gifted, intelligent to the point of genius, with enormous energy under an appearance frail and delicate, and a savage will.&quot; The co-director of the theatre for finance, Charles de Chilly, wanted to reject her as unreliable and too thin, but Duquesnel was enchanted; he hired her for the theater at a modest salary of 150 francs a month, which he paid out of his own pocket. The Odéon was second in prestige only to the Comédie Française, and unlike that very traditional theatre, specialised in more modern productions. The Odéon was popular with the students of the Left Bank. Her first performances with the theatre were not successful. She was cast in highly stylised and frivolous 18th-century comedies, whereas her strong point on stage was her complete sincerity. Her thin figure also made her look ridiculous in the ornate costumes. Dumas, her strongest supporter, commented after one performance, &quot;she has the head of a virgin and the body of a broomstick.&quot; Soon, however, with different plays and more experience, her performances improved; she was praised for her performance of Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot;. In June 1867, she played two roles in &quot;Athalie&quot; by Jean Racine; the part of a young woman and a young boy, Zacharie, the first of many male parts she played in her career. The influential critic Sarcey wrote &quot;she charmed her audience like a little Orpheus.&quot;

Her breakthrough performance was in the 1868 revival of &quot;Kean&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, in which she played the female lead part of Anna Danby. The play was interrupted in the beginning by disturbances in the audience by young spectators who called out, &quot;Down with Dumas! Give us Hugo!&quot;. Bernhardt addressed the audience directly: &quot;Friends, you wish to defend the cause of justice. Are you doing it by making Monsieur Dumas responsible for the banishment of Monsieur Hugo?&quot;. With this the audience laughed and applauded and fell silent. At the final curtain, she received an enormous ovation, and Dumas hurried backstage to congratulate her. When she exited the theatre, a crowd had gathered at the stage door and tossed flowers at her. Her salary was immediately raised to 250 francs a month.

Her next success was her performance in François Coppée&#x27;s &quot;Le Passant&quot;, which premiered at the Odéon on 14 January 1868, playing the part of the boy troubadour, Zanetto, in a romantic renaissance tale. Critic Théophile Gautier described the &quot;delicate and tender charm&quot; of her performance. It played for 150 performances, plus a command performance at the Tuileries Palace for Napoleon III and his court. Afterwards, the emperor sent her a brooch with his initials written in diamonds.

In her memoirs, she wrote of her time at the Odéon: &quot;It was the theatre that I loved the most, and that I only left with regret. We all loved each other. Everyone was gay. The theatre was a like a continuation of school. All the young came there...I remember my few months at the Comédie Française. That little world was stiff, gossipy, jealous. I remember my few months at the Gymnase. There they talked only about dresses and hats, and chattered about a hundred things that had nothing to do with art. At the Odéon, I was happy. We thought only of putting on plays. We rehearsed mornings, afternoons, all the time. I adored that.&quot; Bernhardt lived with her longtime friend and assistant Madame Guérard and her son in a small cottage in the suburb of Auteuil, and drove herself to the theatre in a small carriage. She developed a close friendship with the writer George Sand, and performed in two plays that she authored. She received celebrities in her dressing room, including Gustave Flaubert and Leon Gambetta. In 1869, as she became more prosperous, she moved to a larger seven-room apartment at 16 rue Auber in the center of Paris. Her mother began to visit her for the first time in years, and her grandmother, a strict Orthodox Jew, moved into the apartment to take care of Maurice. Bernhardt added a maid and a cook to her household, as well as the beginning of a collection of animals; she had one or two dogs with her at all times, and two turtles moved freely around the apartment.

In 1868, a fire completely destroyed her apartment, along with all of her belongings. She had neglected to purchase insurance. The brooch presented to her by the emperor and her pearls melted, as did the tiara presented by one of her lovers, Khalid Bey. She found the diamonds in the ashes, and the managers of the Odéon organised a benefit performance. The most famous soprano of the time, Adelina Patti, performed for free. In addition, the grandmother of her father donated 120,000 francs. Bernhardt was able to buy an even larger residence, with two salons and a large dining room, at 4 rue de Rome.

====Wartime service at the Odéon (1870–1871)====
The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War abruptly interrupted her theatrical career. The news of the defeat of the French Army, the surrender of Napoleon III at Sedan, and the proclamation of the Third French Republic on 4 September 1870 was followed by a siege of Paris by the Prussian Army. Paris was cut off from news and from its food supply, and the theatres were closed. Bernhardt took charge of converting the Odéon into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battles outside the city. She organised the placement of 32 beds in the lobby and the foyers, brought in her personal chef to prepare soup for the patients, and persuaded her wealthy friends and admirers to donate supplies for the hospital. Besides organising the hospital, she worked as a nurse, assisting the chief surgeon with amputations and operations. When the coal supply of the city ran out, Bernhardt used old scenery, benches, and stage props for fuel to heat the theater. In early January 1871, after 16 weeks of the siege, the Germans began to bombard the city with long-range cannons. The patients had to be moved to the cellar, and before long, the hospital was forced to close. Bernhardt arranged for serious cases to be transferred to another military hospital, and she rented an apartment on rue de Provence to house the remaining 20 patients. By the end of the siege, Bernhardt&#x27;s hospital had cared for more than 150 wounded soldiers, including a young undergraduate from the École Polytechnique, Ferdinand Foch, who later commanded the Allied armies in the First World War.

The French government signed an armistice on 19 January 1871, and Bernhardt learned that her son and family had been moved to Hamburg. She went to the new chief executive of the French Republic, Adolphe Thiers, and obtained a pass to go to Germany to return them. When she returned to Paris several weeks later, the city was under the rule of the Paris Commune. She moved again, taking her family to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. She later returned to her apartment on the rue de Rome in May, after the Commune was defeated by the French Army.

===&quot;Ruy Blas&quot; and return to the Comédie Française (1872–1878)===
The Tuileries Palace, city hall of Paris, and many other public buildings had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theaters would reopen in October 1871, and he asked her to play the lead in a new play, &quot;Jean-Marie&quot; by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theatre and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt&#x27;s moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.

&quot;Jean-Marie&quot;, about a young Breton woman forced by her father to marry an old man she did not love, was another critical and popular success for Bernhardt. The critic Sarcey wrote &quot;She has the sovereign grace, the penetrating charm, the I don&#x27;t know what. She is a natural artist, an incomparable artist.&quot; The directors of the Odéon next decided to stage &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;, a play written by Victor Hugo in 1838, with Bernhardt playing the role of the Queen of Spain. Hugo attended all the rehearsals. At first, Bernhardt pretended to be indifferent to him, but he gradually won her over and she became a fervent admirer. The play premiered on 16 January 1872. The opening night was attended by the Prince of Wales and by Hugo; after the performance, Hugo approached Bernhardt, dropped to one knee, and kissed her hand.

&quot;Ruy Blas&quot; played to packed houses. A few months after it opened, Bernhardt received an invitation from Emile Perrin, Director of the Comédie Française, asking if she would return, and offering her 12,000 francs a year, compared with less than 10,000 at the Odéon. Bernhardt asked Chilly if he would match the offer, but he refused. Always pressed by her growing expenses and growing household to earn more money, she announced her departure from the Odéon when she finished the run of &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;. Chilly responded with a lawsuit, and she was forced to pay 6,000 francs of damages. After the 100th performance of &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;, Hugo gave a dinner for Bernhardt and her friends, toasting &quot;His adorable Queen and her Golden Voice.&quot;

She formally returned to the Comédie Francaise on 1 October 1872, and quickly took on some of the more famous and demanding roles in French theatre. She played Junie in &quot;Britannicus&quot; by Jean Racine, the male role of Cherubin in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; by Pierre Beaumarchais, and the lead in Voltaire&#x27;s five-act tragedy Zaïre. In 1873, with just 74 hours to learn the lines and practice the part, she played the lead in Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, playing opposite the celebrated tragedian, Jean Mounet-Sully, who soon became her lover. The leading French critic Sarcey wrote &quot;This is nature itself served by marvelous intelligence, by a soul of fire, by the most melodious voice that ever enchanted human ears. This woman plays with her heart, with her entrails.&quot; &quot;Phèdre&quot; became her most famous classical role, performed over the years around the world, often for audiences who knew little or no French; she made them understand by her voice and gestures.

In 1877, she had another success as Doña Sol in &quot;Hernani&quot;, a tragedy written 47 years earlier by Victor Hugo. Her lover in the play was her lover off-stage, as well, Mounet-Sully. Hugo was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: &quot;Madame, you were great and charming; you moved me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. I place it at your feet.&quot; The note was accompanied by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.

She maintained a highly theatrical lifestyle in her house on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.

Bernhardt repaired her old relationships with the other members of the Comédie Française; she participated in a benefit for Madame Nathalie, the actress she had once slapped. However, she was frequently in conflict with Perrin, the director of the theatre. In 1878, during the Paris Universal Exposition, she took a flight over Paris with balloonist Pierre Giffard and painter Georges Clairin, in a balloon decorated with the name of her current character, &quot;Doña Sol&quot;. An unexpected storm carried the balloon far outside of Paris to a small town. When she returned by train to the city, Perrin was furious; he fined Bernhardt a thousand francs, citing a theatre rule which required actors to request permission before they left Paris. Bernhardt refused to pay, and threatened to resign from the Comédie. Perrin recognised that he could not afford to let her go. Perrin and the Minister of Fine Arts arranged a compromise; she withdrew her resignation, and in return was raised to a &quot;societaire&quot;, the highest rank of the theater.

===Triumph in London and departure from the Comédie Française (1879–1880)===

Bernhardt was earning a substantial amount at the theatre, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from the Parc Monceau. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theatre of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theatre impresario named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances in the homes of wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie. When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theatre in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of &quot;Phèdre&quot; on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, &quot;Le Misanthrope&quot; and &quot;Les Précieuses&quot;.
On 4 June 1879, just before the opening curtain of her premiere in &quot;Phèdre,&quot; she suffered an attack of stage fright. She wrote later that she also pitched her voice too high, and was unable to lower it. Nonetheless, the performance was a triumph. Though a majority of the audience could not understand Racine&#x27;s classical French, she captivated them with her voice and gestures; one member of the audience, Sir George Arthur, wrote that &quot;she set every nerve and fibre in their bodies throbbing and held them spellbound.&quot; In addition to her performances of &quot;Zaïre&quot;, &quot;Phèdre&quot;, &quot;Hernani&quot;, and other plays with her troupe, she gave the private recitals in the homes of British aristocrats arranged by Jarrett, who also arranged an exhibition of her sculptures and paintings in Piccadilly, which was attended by both the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Gladstone. While in London, she added to her personal menagerie of animals. In London, she purchased three dogs, a parrot, and a monkey, and made a side trip to Liverpool, where she purchased a cheetah, a parrot, and a wolfhound and received a gift of six chameleons, which she kept in her rented house on Chester Square, and then took back to Paris.

Back in Paris, she was increasingly discontented with Perrin and the management of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in the play &quot;L&#x27;Aventurière&quot; by Emile Augier, a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticised by the playwright. She responded &quot;I know I&#x27;m bad, but not as bad as your lines.&quot; The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin &quot;You forced me to play when I was not ready...what I foresaw came to pass...this is my first failure at the Comédie and my last.&quot; She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs. She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theatre was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theatre.

===&quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; and first American tour (1880–1881)===
In April 1880, as soon as he learned Bernhardt had resigned from the Comédie Française, the impresario Edward Jarrett hurried to Paris and proposed that she make a theatrical tour of England and then the United States. She could select her repertoire and the cast. She would receive 5,000 francs per performance, 15% of any earnings over 15,000 francs, plus all of her expenses, and an account in her name for 100,000 francs, the amount she owed to the Comédie Française. She accepted immediately.

Now on her own, Bernhardt first assembled and tried her new troupe at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris. She performed for the first time , by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;. She did not create the role; the play had first been performed by Eugénie Dochein in 1852, but it quickly became her most performed and most famous role. She played the role more than a thousand times, and acted regularly and successfully in it until the end of her life. Audiences were often in tears during her famous death scene at the end.

She could not perform &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; on a London stage because of British censorship laws; instead, she put on four of her proven successes, including &quot;Hernani&quot; and &quot;Phèdre&quot;, plus four new roles, including &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; by Eugène Scribe and the drawing-room comedy &quot;Frou-frou&quot; by Meilhac-Halévy, both of which were highly successful on the London stage. In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that she was making far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.

She and her troupe departed from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November in New York City, she performed Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; at Booth&#x27;s Theatre before an audience which had paid a top price of a stunning $40 for a ticket. Few in the audience understood French, but it was not necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theatre-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.

Bernhardt&#x27;s first American tour carried her to 157 performances in 51 cities. She travelled on a special train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maître d&#x27;hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo, whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour. From New York, she made a side trip to Menlo Park, where she met Thomas Edison, who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from &quot;Phèdre,&quot; which has not survived. She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews, and in Boston posed for photos on the back of a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the Methodist press, which only increased ticket sales. She performed &quot;Phèdre&quot; six times and &quot;La Dame Aux Camélias&quot; 65 times (which Jarrett had renamed &quot;Camille&quot; to make it easier for Americans to pronounce, despite the fact that no character in the play has that name). On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of &quot;Camélias&quot; in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins. She described the result of her trip to her friends: &quot;I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which I am most proud.&quot;

===Return to Paris, European tour, &quot;Fédora&quot; to &quot;Theodora&quot; (1881–1886)===

No crowd greeted Bernhardt when she returned to Paris on 5 May 1881, and theatre managers offered no new roles; the Paris press ignored her tour, and much of the Paris theatre world resented her leaving the most prestigious national theatre to earn a fortune abroad. When no new plays or offers appeared, she went to London for a successful three-week run at the Gaiety Theater. This London tour included the first British performance of &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre; her friend, the prince of Wales, persuaded Queen Victoria to authorise the performance. Many years later, she gave a private performance of the play for the queen while she was on holiday in Nice. When she returned to Paris, Bernhardt contrived to make a surprise performance at the annual 14 July patriotic spectacle at the Paris Opera, which was attended by the President of France, and a houseful of dignitaries and celebrities. She recited the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;, dressed in a white robe with a tricolor banner, and at the end dramatically waved the French flag. The audience gave her a standing ovation, showered her with flowers, and demanded that she recite the song two more times.

With her place in the French theatre world restored, Bernhardt negotiated a contract to perform at the Vaudeville Theatre in Paris for 1500 francs per performance as well as 25 percent of the net profit. She also announced that she would not be available to begin until 1882. She departed on a tour of theatres in the French provinces and then to Italy, Greece, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Austria, and Russia. In Kyiv and Odessa, she encountered anti-Semitic crowds who threw stones at her; pogroms were being conducted, forcing the Jewish population to leave. However, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she performed before Czar Alexander III, who broke court protocol and bowed to her. During her tour, she gave performances for King Alfonso XII of Spain, and the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. The only European country where she refused to play was Germany, due to the German annexation of French territory after the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War. Just before the tour began, she met Jacques Damala, who went with her as leading man and then, for eight months, became her first and only husband. 
When she returned to Paris, she was offered a new role in &quot;Fédora&quot;, a melodrama written for her by Victorien Sardou. It opened on 12 December 1882, with her husband Damala as the male lead, and received good reviews. English novelist Maurice Baring, who wrote a biography of Bernhardt, wrote &quot;a secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction, which was at once exotic and cerebral...She literally hypnotised her audience.&quot; Another journalist wrote &quot;She is incomparable...The extreme love, the extreme agony, the extreme suffering.&quot; However, the abrupt end of her marriage shortly after the premiere put her back into financial distress. She had leased and refurbished a theatre, the Ambigu, specifically to give her husband leading roles, and made her 18-year-old son Maurice, who had no business experience, the manager. &quot;Fédora&quot; ran for just 50 performances and lost 400,000 francs. She was forced to give up the Ambigu, and then, in February 1883, to sell her jewellery, her carriages, and her horses at an auction.

When Damala left, she took on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright Jean Richepin, who accompanied her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts. She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theatre of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in &quot;Nana-Sahib&quot;, a new play by Richepin, a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin&#x27;s acting were poor, and it quickly closed. Richepin then wrote an adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, but it was also a failure. The only person who praised the play was Oscar Wilde, who was then living in Paris. He wrote a play, &quot;Salomé&quot;, and Bernhardt planned to originate the title role in London, but British censors banned the play and she never performed it.

Bernhardt then performed a new play by Sardou, &quot;Theodora&quot; (1884), a melodrama set in sixth-century Byzantine Empire. Sardou wrote a nonhistoric but dramatic new death scene for Bernhardt; in his version, the empress Theodora was publicly strangled, whereas the historical empress died of cancer. Bernhardt travelled to Ravenna, Italy, to study and sketch the costumes seen in Byzantine mosaic murals, and had them reproduced for her own costumes. The play opened on 26 December 1884 and ran for 300 performances in Paris and 100 in London, and it was a financial success. She was able to pay off most of her debts, and bought a lion cub, which she named Justinian, for her home menagerie. She also renewed her love affair with her former lead actor, Philippe Garnier.

===World tours (1886–1892)===
&quot;Theodora&quot; was followed by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, &quot;Marion de Lorme&quot;, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not give her a chance to show her talents. She next put on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Sainte-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York City, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: &quot;I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance what they are going to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected.&quot;

In every city she visited, she was feted and cheered by audiences. The actors Edouard Angelo and Philippe Garnier were her leading men. Emperor Pedro II of Brazil attended all of her performances in Rio de Janeiro and presented her with a gold bracelet with diamonds, which was almost immediately stolen from her hotel. The two leading actors both fell ill with yellow fever, and her long-time manager, Edward Jarrett, died of a heart attack. Bernhardt was undaunted, however, and went crocodile hunting at Guayaquil, and bought more animals for her menagerie. Her performances in every city were sold out, and by the end of the tour, she had earned more than 1 million francs. The tour allowed her to purchase her final home, which she filled with her paintings, plants, souvenirs, and animals.

From then on, whenever she ran short of money (which generally happened every three or four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar. Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant&#x27; Angelo in &quot;La Tosca&quot;. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.

===&quot;La Tosca&quot; to &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1887–1893)===
When Bernhardt returned from her 1886–87 tour, she received a new invitation to return to the Comédie Française. The theatre management was willing to forget the conflict of her two previous periods there, and offered a payment of 150,000 francs a year. The money appealed to her, and she began negotiations. However, the senior members of the company protested the high salary offered, and conservative defenders of the more traditional theatre also complained; one anti-Bernhardt critic, Albert Delpit of &quot;Le Gaulois&quot;, wrote &quot;Madame Sarah Bernhardt is forty-three; she can no longer be useful to the Comédie. Moreover, what roles could she have? I can only imagine that she could play mothers...&quot; Bernhardt was deeply offended and immediately broke off negotiations. She turned once again to Sardou, who had written a new play for her, &quot;La Tosca&quot;, which featured a prolonged and extremely dramatic death scene at the end. The play was staged at the Porte Saint-Martin Theatre, opening on 24 November 1887. It was extremely popular, and critically acclaimed. Bernhardt played the role for 29 consecutive sold-out performances. The success of the play allowed Bernhardt to buy a new pet lion for her household menagerie. She named him Scarpia, after the villain of &quot;La Tosca&quot;. The play inspired Giacomo Puccini to write one of his more famous operas, &quot;Tosca&quot; (1900).

Following this success, she acted in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she acted in a stage version of the controversial drama &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; by Emile Zola. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book&#x27;s confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, &quot;My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints.&quot; The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances. She then performed another traditional melodrama, &quot;Francillon&quot; by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot; in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot;, disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; by the poet Jules Barbier, in which the 45-year-old actress played Joan of Arc, a 19-year-old martyr. Barbier had previously written the librettos for some of the more famous French operas of the period, including &quot;Faust&quot; by Charles Gounod and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; by Jacques Offenbach. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou and Moreau, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable death scene. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous asp which bites Cleopatra. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. &quot;I shall see them,&quot; she explained. &quot;If I catch sight of my hand, it will be the hand of Cleopatra.&quot;

Bernhardt&#x27;s violent portrayal of Cleopatra led to the theatrical story of a matron in the audience exclaiming to her companion &quot;How unlike, how very unlike, the home life of our own dear Queen!&quot; However, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; of 28 December 1906 attributed the reaction as being to a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; starring Lillie Langtry, not Bernhardt, &quot;some fifteen years ago,&quot; which would also have been around 1891.

===Théâtre de la Renaissance (1893–1899)===

Bernhardt made a two-year world tour (1891–1893) to replenish her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the Théâtre de la Renaissance, and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed every aspect of the theatre, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week. She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to take off their hats during performances, so the rest of the audience could see, and eliminated the prompter&#x27;s box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theatre the common practice of hiring &quot;claqueurs&quot; in the audience to applaud stars. She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist Alphonse Mucha to design the first of a series of posters for her play &quot;Gismonda&quot;. He continued to make posters of her for six years.

In five years, Bernhardt produced nine plays, three of which were financially successful. The first was a revival of her performance as Phédre, which she took on tour around the world. In 1898, she had another success, in the play &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;, playing the male lead role in a Renaissance revenge drama written in 1834 by Alfred de Musset, but never before actually staged. As her biographer Cornelia Otis Skinner wrote, she did not try to be overly masculine when she performed male roles: &quot;Her male impersonations had the sexless grace of the voices of choirboys, or the not quite real pathos of Pierrot.&quot; Anatole France wrote of her performance in &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;: &quot;She formed out of her own self a young man melancholic, full of poetry and of truth.&quot; This was followed by another successful melodrama by Sardou, &quot;Gismonda&quot;, one of Bernhardt&#x27;s few plays not finishing with a dramatic death scene. Her co-star was Lucien Guitry, who also acted as her leading man until the end of her career. Besides Guitry, she shared the stage with Édouard de Max, her leading man in 20 productions, and Constant Coquelin, who frequently toured with her.

In April 1895, she played the lead role in a romantic and poetic fantasy, &quot;Princess Lointaine&quot;, by little-known 27-year-old poet Edmond Rostand. It was not a monetary success and lost 200,000 francs, but it began a long theatrical relationship between Bernhardt and Rostand. Rostand went on to write &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and became one of the most popular French playwrights of the period.

In 1898, she performed the female lead in the controversial play &quot;La Ville Morte&quot; by the Italian poet and playwright Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio; the play was fiercely attacked by critics because of its theme of incest between brother and sister. Along with Émile Zola and Victorien Sardou, Bernhardt became an outspoken defender of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer falsely accused of betraying France. The issue divided Parisian society; a conservative newspaper ran the headline, &quot;Sarah Bernhardt has joined the Jews against the Army&quot;, and Bernhardt&#x27;s own son Maurice condemned Dreyfus; he refused to speak to her for a year.

At the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Bernhardt staged and performed in several modern plays, but she was not a follower of the more natural school of acting that was coming into fashion at the end of the 19th century, preferring a more dramatic expression of emotions. &quot;In the theatre,&quot; she declared, &quot;the natural is good, but the sublime is even better.&quot;

===Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt (1899–1900)===

Despite her successes, her debts continued to mount, reaching two million gold francs by the end of 1898. Bernhardt was forced to give up the Renaissance, and was preparing to go on another world tour when she learned that a much larger Paris theater, the Théâtre des Nations on Place du Châtelet, was for lease. The theatre had 1,700 seats, twice the size of the Renaissance, enabling her to pay off the cost of performances more quickly; it had an enormous stage and backstage, allowing her to present several different plays a week; and because it was designed as a concert hall, it had excellent acoustics. On 1 January 1899, she signed a 25-year lease with the City of Paris, though she was already 55 years old.

She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, and began to renovate it to suit her needs. The façade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors. She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her more famous roles, painted by Mucha, Louise Abbéma, and Georges Clairin. Her dressing room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, was decorated in Empire Style, featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that was filled with the flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.

Bernhardt opened the theatre on 21 January 1899 with a revival of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;La Tosca&quot;, which she had first performed in 1887. This was followed by revivals of her other major successes, including &quot;Phédre&quot;, &quot;Theodora&quot;, &quot;Gismonda&quot;, and &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;, plus Octave Feuillet&#x27;s &quot;Dalila&quot;, Gaston de Wailly&#x27;s &quot;Patron Bénic&quot;, and Rostand&#x27;s &quot;La Samaritaine,&quot; a poetic retelling of the story of the Samaritan woman at the well from the Gospel of John. On 20 May, she premiered one of her more famous roles, playing the titular character of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in a prose adaptation which she had commissioned from Eugène Morand and Marcel Schwob. She played Hamlet in a manner which was direct, natural, and very feminine. Her performance received largely positive reviews in Paris, but mixed reviews in London. The British critic Max Beerbohm wrote &quot;the only compliment one can conscientiously pay her is that her Hamlet was, from first to last, a truly &quot;grand dame&quot;.&quot;

In 1900, Bernhardt presented &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, a new play by Rostand. She played the Duc de Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon Bonaparte, imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; was a verse drama, six acts long. The 56-year-old actress studied the walk and posture of young cavalry officers and had her hair cut short to impersonate the young Duke. The Duke&#x27;s stage mother, Marie-Louise of Austria, was played by Maria Legault, an actress 14 years younger than Bernhardt. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died &quot;as dying angels would die if they were allowed to.&quot; The play was extremely successful; it was especially popular with visitors to the 1900 Paris International Exposition, and ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling for as much as 600 gold francs. The play inspired the creation of Bernhardt souvenirs, including statuettes, medallions, fans, perfumes, postcards of her in the role, uniforms and cardboard swords for children, and pastries and cakes; the famed chef Escoffier added Peach Aiglon with Chantilly cream to his repertoire of desserts.

Bernhardt continued to employ Mucha to design her posters and expanded his work to include theatrical sets, programs, costumes, and jewellery props. His posters became icons of the Art Nouveau style. To earn more money, Bernhardt set aside a certain number of printed posters of each play to sell to collectors.

===Farewell tours (1901–1913)===

After her season in Paris, Bernhardt performed &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; in London and then made her sixth tour to the United States. On this tour, she travelled with Constant Coquelin, then the most popular leading man in France. Bernhardt played the secondary role of Roxanne to his Cyrano de Bergerac, a role which he had premiered, and he co-starred with her as Flambeau in &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; and as the first grave-digger in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

She also changed, for the first time, her resolution not to perform in Germany or the &quot;occupied territories&quot; of Alsace and Lorraine. In 1902, at the invitation of the French ministry of culture, she took part in the first cultural exchange between Germany and France since the 1870 war. She performed &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; 14 times in Germany; Kaiser William II of Germany attended two performances and hosted a dinner in her honour in Potsdam.

During her German tour, she began to suffer agonising pain in her right knee, probably connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilisation of her leg. Bernhardt promised to see a doctor when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.

In 1903, she had another unsuccessful role playing another masculine character in &quot;Werther&quot;, a gloomy adaptation of the story by German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. However, she quickly came back with another hit, &quot;La Sorcière&quot; by Sardou. She played a Moorish sorceress in love with a Christian Spaniard, leading to her persecution by the church. This story of tolerance, coming soon after the Dreyfus affair, was financially successful, with Bernhardt often giving both a matinee and evening performance.
From 1904 to 1906, she appeared in a wide range of parts, including in &quot;Francesca di Rimini&quot; by Francis Marion Crawford, the role of Fanny in &quot;Sapho&quot; by Alphonse Daudet, the magician Circe in a play by Charles Richet, the part of Marie Antoinette in the historic drama &quot;Varennes&quot; by Lavedan and Lenôtre, the part of the prince-poet Landry in a version of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; by Richepin and Henri Cain, and a new version of the play &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; by symbolist poet Maurice Maeterlinck, in which she played the male role of Pelléas with the British actress Mrs Patrick Campbell as Melissande. She also starred in a new version of &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;, which she wrote, different from the earlier version which had been written for her by Scribe. During this time, she wrote a drama, &quot;Un Coeur d&#x27;Homme&quot;, in which she had no part, which was performed at the Théâtre des Arts, but lasted only three performances. She also taught acting briefly at the Conservatory, but found the system there too rigid and traditional. Instead, she took aspiring actresses and actors into her company, trained them, and used them as unpaid extras and bit players.

Bernhardt made her first American Farewell Tour in 1905–1906, the first of four farewell tours she made to the US, Canada, and Latin America, with her new managers, the Shubert brothers. She attracted controversy and press attention when, during her 1905 visit to Montreal, the Roman Catholic bishop encouraged his followers to throw eggs at Bernhardt, because she portrayed prostitutes as sympathetic characters. The US portion of the tour was complicated due to the Shuberts&#x27; competition with the powerful syndicate of theatre owners which controlled nearly all the major theatres and opera houses in the United States. The syndicate did not allow outside producers to use their stages. As a result, in Texas and Kansas City, Bernhardt and her company performed under an enormous circus tent, seating 4,500 spectators, and in skating rinks in Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa, and other cities. Her private train took her to Knoxville, Dallas, Denver, Tampa, Chattanooga, and Salt Lake City, then on to the West Coast of the United States.

Her appearance in Denver was at the Elitch Theatre for one day and she did a matinee of &quot;La Sorcière&quot; and an evening performance of &quot;Le Dame aux Camélias&quot;. In her biography, Mary Elitch Long tells the story of Bernhardt visiting the lion&#x27;s den at her zoo and beginning to stroke the head of a lioness. While the lioness sat calmly, Bernhardt asked Mary the name of the lion. When Mary said she hadn&#x27;t been named yet, Bernhardt turned to the lioness and said, &quot;You are Sarah Bernhardt.&quot;

She could not play in San Francisco because of the recent 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but she performed across the bay in the Hearst Greek Theatre at the University of California at Berkeley, and gave a recital, titled &quot;A Christmas Night during the Terror&quot;, for inmates at San Quentin penitentiary.

Her tour continued into South America, where it was marred by a more serious event: at the conclusion of &quot;La Tosca&quot; in Rio de Janeiro, she leaped, as always, from the wall of the fortress to plunge to her death in the Tiber. This time, however, the mattress on which she was supposed to land had been positioned incorrectly. She landed on her right knee, which had already been damaged in earlier tours. She fainted and was taken from the theatre on a stretcher, but refused to be treated in a local hospital. She later sailed by ship from Rio to New York. When she arrived, her leg had swollen, and she was immobilised in her hotel for 15 days before returning to France.

In 1906–1907, the French government finally awarded Bernhardt the Legion d&#x27;Honneur, but only in her role as a theatre director, not as an actress. However, the award at that time required a review of the recipients&#x27; moral standards, and Bernhardt&#x27;s behavior was still considered scandalous. Bernhardt ignored the snub and continued to play both inoffensive and controversial characters. In November 1906, she starred in &quot;La Vierge d&#x27;Avila, ou La Courtisane de Dieu&quot;, by Catulle Mendès, playing Saint Theresa, followed on 27 January 1907 by &quot;Les Bouffons&quot;, by Miguel Zamocois, in which she played a young and amorous medieval lord. In 1909, she again played the 19-year-old Joan of Arc in &quot;Le Procès de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; by Émile Moreau. French newspapers encouraged schoolchildren to view her personification of French patriotism.

Despite the injury to her leg, she continued to go on tour every summer, when her own theatre in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities. In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born Lou Tellegen, a very handsome actor who had served as a model for the sculpture &quot;Eternal Springtime&quot; by Auguste Rodin, and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in &quot;Phèdre&quot;, where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of Judas Iscariot in &quot;Judas&quot; by the American playwright John Wesley De Kay. It was performed in New York&#x27;s Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia. The tour took her from Boston to Jacksonville, through Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to Canada and Minnesota, usually one new city and one performance every day.

In April 1912, Bernhardt presented a new production in her theatre, &quot;Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth&quot;, a romantic costume drama by Émile Moreau about Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s romances with Robert Dudley and Robert Devereux. It was lavish and expensive, but was a monetary failure, lasting only 12 performances. Fortunately for Bernhardt, she was able to pay off her debt with the money she received from the American producer Adolph Zukor for a film version of the play. 

She departed on her third farewell tour of the United States in 1913–1914, when she was 69. Her leg had not yet fully healed, and she was unable to perform an entire play, only selected acts. She also separated from her co-star and lover of the time, Lou Tellegen. When the tour ended, he remained in the United States, where he briefly became a silent movie star, and she returned to France in May 1913.

===Amputation of leg and wartime performances (1914–1918)===
In December 1913, Bernhardt performed another success with the drama &quot;Jeanne Doré&quot;. On 16 March, she was made a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Despite her successes, she was still short of money. She had made her son Maurice the director of her new theatre, and permitted him to use the receipts of the theatre to pay his gambling debts, eventually forcing her to pawn some of her jewels to pay her bills.

In 1914, she went as usual to her holiday home on Belle-Île with her family and close friends. There, she received the news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the beginning of the First World War. She hurried back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that gangrene had developed on her leg, still injured from her 1906 performance in Rio de Janeiro. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a palanquin she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the Louis XV style, with white sides and gilded trim.

She returned to Paris on 15 October, and, despite the loss of her leg, continued to go on stage at her theatre; scenes were arranged so she could be seated, or supported by a prop with her leg hidden. She took part in a patriotic &quot;scenic poem&quot; by Eugène Morand, &quot;Les Cathédrales&quot;, playing the part of Strasbourg Cathedral; first, while seated, she recited a poem; then she hoisted herself on her one leg, leaned against the arm of the chair, and declared &quot;Weep, weep, Germany! The German eagle has fallen into the Rhine!&quot;
Bernhardt joined a troupe of famous French actors and traveled to the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Argonne, where she performed for soldiers who were just returned or about to go into battle. Propped on pillows in an armchair, she recited her patriotic speech at Strasbourg Cathedral. Another actress present at the event, Beatrix Dussanne, described her performance: &quot;The miracle again took place; Sarah, old, mutilated, once more illuminated a crowd by the rays of her genius. This fragile creature, ill, wounded and an immobile, could still, through the magic of the spoken word, re-instill heroism in those soldiers weary from battle.&quot;

She returned to Paris in 1916 and made two short films on patriotic themes, one based on the story of Joan of Arc, the other called &quot;Mothers of France&quot;. Then she embarked on her final American farewell tour. Despite the threat of German submarines, she crossed the Atlantic and toured the United States, performing in major cities including New York and San Francisco. Bernhardt was diagnosed with uremia, and had to have an emergency kidney operation. She recuperated in Long Beach, California, for several months, writing short stories and novellas for publication in French magazines. In 1918, she returned to New York and boarded a ship to France, landing in Bordeaux on 11 November 1918, the day that the armistice was signed ending the First World War.

===Final years (1919–1923)===
In 1920, she resumed acting in her theatre, usually performing single acts of classics such as Racine&#x27;s &quot;Athelée&quot;, which did not require much movement. For her curtain calls, she stood, balancing on one leg and gesturing with one arm. She also starred in a new play, &quot;Daniel&quot;, written by her grandson-in-law, playwright Louis Verneuil. She played the male lead role, but appeared in just two acts. She took the play and other famous scenes from her repertory on a European tour and then for her last tour of England, where she gave a special command performance for Queen Mary, followed by a tour of the British provinces.

In 1921, Bernhardt made her last tour of the French provinces, lecturing about theatre and reciting the poetry of Rostand. Later that year, she produced a new play by Rostand, &quot;La Gloire&quot;, and another play by Verneuil, &quot;Régine Arnaud&quot; in 1922. She continued to entertain guests at her home. One such guest, French author Colette, described being served coffee by Bernhardt: &quot;The delicate and withered hand offering the brimming cup, the flowery azure of the eyes, so young still in their network of fine lines, the questioning and mocking coquetry of the tilted head, and that indescribable desire to charm, to charm still, to charm right up to the gates of death itself.&quot;

In 1922, she began rehearsing a new play by Sacha Guitry, called &quot;Un Sujet de Roman.&quot; On the night of the dress rehearsal, she collapsed, going into a coma for an hour, then awakened with the words, &quot;when do I go on?&quot; She recuperated for several months, with her condition improving; she began preparing for a new role as Cleopatra in &quot;Rodogune&quot; by Corneille, and agreed to make a new film by Sasha Guitry called &quot;La Voyante&quot;, for a payment of 10,000 francs a day. She was too weak to travel, so a room in her house on Boulevard Pereire was set up as a film studio, with scenery, lights, and cameras. However, on 21 March 1923, she collapsed again, and never recovered. She died from uremia on the evening of 26 March 1923. Newspaper reports stated she died &quot;peacefully, without suffering, in the arms of her son&quot;. At her request, her Funeral Mass was celebrated at the church of Saint-François-de-Sales, which she attended when she was in Paris. The following day, 30,000 people attended her funeral to pay their respects, and an enormous crowd followed her casket from the Church of Saint-Francoise-de-Sales to Pere Lachaise Cemetery, pausing for a moment of silence outside her theatre. The inscription on her tombstone is the name &quot;Bernhardt&quot;.

==Motion pictures==

Bernhardt was one of the early actresses to star in moving pictures. The first projected film was shown by the Lumière brothers at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumière brothers, Clément Maurice, approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The scene was Prince Hamlet&#x27;s duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a stage hand bang pieces of metal together in sync with the sword fight. Maurice&#x27;s finished two-minute film, &quot;Le Duel d&#x27;Hamlet&quot;, was presented to the public at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition from 14 April to 12 November 1900 in Paul Decauville&#x27;s program, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre. This program contained short films of many other famous French theatre stars of the day. The sound quality on the wax cylinders and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the early examples of a sound film.

Eight years later, in 1908, Bernhardt made a second motion picture, &quot;La Tosca&quot;. This was produced by Le Film d&#x27;Art and directed by André Calmettes from the play by Victorien Sardou. The film has been lost. Her next film, with her co-star and lover Lou Tellegen, was &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot;, called &quot;Camille&quot;. When she performed on this film, Bernhardt changed both the fashion in which she performed, significantly accelerating the speed of her gestural action. The film was a success in the United States, and in France, the young French artist and later screenwriter Jean Cocteau wrote &quot;What actress can play a lover better than she does in this film? No one!&quot; Bernhardt received $30,000 for her performance.

Shortly afterwards, she made another film of a scene from her play &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; with Tellegen, in the role of Maurice de Saxe. Then, in 1912, the pioneer American producer Adolph Zukor came to London and filmed her performing scenes from her stage play &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; with her lover Tellegen, with Bernhardt in the role of Lord Essex. To make the film more appealing, Zukor had the film print hand-tinted, making it one of the early color films. &quot;The Loves of Queen Elizabeth&quot; premiered at the Lyceum Theater in New York City on 12 July 1912, and was a financial success; Zukor invested $18,000 in the film and earned $80,000, enabling him to found the Famous Players Film Company, which later became Paramount Pictures. The use of the visual arts–specifically famous c.19 painting–to frame scenes and elaborate narrative action is significant in the work.

Bernhardt was also the subject and star of two documentaries, including &quot;Sarah Bernhardt à Belle-Isle&quot; (1915), a film about her daily life at home. This was one of the early films by a celebrity inviting us into the home, and it is again significant for the use it makes of contemporary art references in the mis-en-scene of the film. She also made &quot;Jeanne Doré&quot; in 1916. This was produced by Eclipse and directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil from the play by Tristan Bernard. In 1917 she made a film called &quot;Mothers of France&quot; (&quot;Mères Françaises&quot;). Produced by Eclipse it was directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil with a screenplay by Jean Richepin. As Victoria Duckett explains in her book &quot;Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film&quot;, this film was a propaganda film shot on the front line with the intent to urge America to join the War.

In the weeks before her death in 1923, she was preparing to make &quot;La Voyante&quot;, another motion picture from her own home, directed by Sacha Guitry. She told journalists &quot;They&#x27;re paying me ten thousand francs a day, and plan to film for seven days. Make the calculation. These are American rates, and I don&#x27;t have to cross the Atlantic! At those rates, I&#x27;m ready to appear in any films they make.&quot; However, she died just before the filming began.

==Painting and sculpture==

Bernhardt began painting while she was at the Comédie-Française; because she rarely performed more than twice a week, she wanted a new activity to fill her time. Her paintings were mostly landscapes and seascapes, with many painted at Belle-Île. Her painting teachers were close and lifelong friends Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She exhibited a 2-m-tall canvas, &quot;The Young Woman and Death&quot;, at the 1878 Paris Salon.

Her passion for sculpture was more serious. Her sculpture teacher was Mathieu-Meusnier, an academic sculptor who specialised in public monuments and sentimental storytelling pieces. She quickly picked up the techniques; she exhibited and sold a high-relief plaque of the death of Ophelia and, for the architect Charles Garnier, she created the allegorical figure of &quot;Song&quot; for the group &quot;Music&quot; on the façade of the Opera House of Monte Carlo. She also exhibited a group of figures, called &quot;Après la Tempête&quot; (&quot;After the Storm&quot;), at the 1876 Paris Salon, receiving an honourable mention. Bernhardt sold the original work, the molds, and signed plaster miniatures, earning more than 10,000 francs. The original is now displayed in the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. Fifty works by Bernhardt have been documented, of which 25 are known to still exist. Several of her works were also shown in the 1893 Columbia Exposition in Chicago and at the 1900 Exposition Universelle. While on tour in New York, she hosted a private viewing of her paintings and sculptures for 500 guests. In 1880, she made an Art Nouveau decorative bronze inkwell, a self-portrait with bat wings and a fish tail, possibly inspired by her 1874 performance in Le Sphinx. She set up a studio at 11 boulevard de Clichy in Montmartre, where she frequently entertained her guests dressed in her sculptor&#x27;s outfit, including white satin blouse and white silk trousers. Rodin dismissed her sculptures as &quot;old-fashioned tripe&quot;, and she was attacked in the press for pursuing an activity inappropriate for an actress. She was defended by Émile Zola, who wrote &quot;How droll! Not content with finding her thin, or declaring her mad, they want to regulate her daily activities...Let a law be passed immediately to prevent the accumulation of talent!&quot;

==&quot;The Art of the Theatre&quot;==
In her final years, Bernhardt wrote a textbook on the art of acting. She wrote whenever she had time, usually between productions, and when she was on vacation at Belle-Île. After her death, the writer Marcel Berger, her close friend, found the unfinished manuscript among her belongings in her house on boulevard Pereire. He edited the book, and it was published as &quot;L&#x27;Art du Théâtre&quot; in 1923. An English translation was published in 1925.

She paid particular attention to the use of the voice, &quot;the instrument the most necessary to the dramatic artist.&quot; It was the element, she wrote, which connected the artist with the audience. &quot;The voice must have all the harmonies...serious, plaintive, vibrant and metallic.&quot; For a voice to be fully complete, she wrote &quot;It is necessary that it be very slightly nasal. An artist who has a dry voice can never touch the public.&quot; She also stressed the importance for artists to train their breathing for long passages. She suggested that an actress should be able to recite the following passage from &quot;Phédre&quot; in a single breath:

::Hélas! ils se voyaient avec pleine licence,
::Le ciel de leurs soupirs approuvait l&#x27;innocence;
::Ils suivaient sans remords leur penchant amoureux;
::Tous les jours se levaient clairs et sereins pour eux! 

She noted that &quot;the art of our art is not to have it noticed by the public...We must create an atmosphere by our sincerity, so that public, gasping, distracted, should not regain its equilibrium and free will until the fall of the curtain. That which is called the work, in our art, should only be the search for the truth.&quot;

She also insisted that artists should express their emotions clearly without words, using &quot;their eye, their hand, the position of the chest, the tilting of the head...The exterior form of the art is often the entire art; at least, it is that which strikes the audience the most effectively.&quot; She encouraged actors to &quot;Work, overexcite your emotional expression, become accustomed to varying your psychological states and translating them...The diction, the way of standing, the look, the gesture are predominant in the development of the career of an artist.&quot;

She explained why she liked to perform male roles: &quot;The roles of men are in general more intellectual than the roles of women...Only the role of Phédre gives me the charm of digging into a heart that is truly anguished...Always, in the theatre, the parts played by the men are the best parts. And yet theatre is the sole art where women can sometimes be superior to men.&quot;

==Memory and improvisation==
Bernhardt had a remarkable ability to memorise a role quickly. She recounted in &quot;L&#x27;Art du Théâtre&quot; that &quot;I only have to read a role two or three times and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely...My memory can&#x27;t contain several parts at the same time, and it&#x27;s impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from &quot;Phèdre&quot; or &quot;Hamlet&quot;. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood.&quot; She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of &quot;L&#x27;Etrangère&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, &quot;If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done...I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today&quot;, then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.

During another performance on her world tour, a backstage door was opened during a performance of &quot;Phèdre&quot;, and a cold wind blew across the stage as Bernhardt was reciting. Without interrupting her speech, she added &quot;If someone doesn&#x27;t close that door I will catch pneumonia.&quot; The door was closed, and no one in the audience seemed to notice the addition.

==Critical appraisals==
French drama critics praised Bernhardt&#x27;s performances; Francisque Sarcey, an influential Paris critic, wrote of her 1871 performance in &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;She has a sovereign grace, a penetrating charm, and I don&#x27;t know what. She is a natural and an incomparable artist.&quot; Reviewing her performance of &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; in 1872, the critic Théodore de Banville wrote that Bernhardt &quot;declaimed like a bluebird sings, like the wind sighs, like the water murmurs.&quot; Of the same performance, Sarcey wrote: &quot;She added the music of her voice to the music of the verse. She sang, yes, sang with her melodious voice...&quot;

Victor Hugo was a fervent admirer of Bernhardt, praising her &quot;golden voice&quot;. Describing her performance in his play, &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; in 1872, he wrote in his &quot;Carnets&quot;, &quot;It is the first time this play has really been played! She is better than an actress, she is a woman. She is adorable; she is better than beautiful, she has the harmonious movements and looks of irresistible seduction.&quot;

Her 1882 performance of &quot;Fédora&quot; was described by the English novelist Maurice Baring: &quot;A secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction which was at once exotic and cerebral...She literally hypnotized the audience&quot;, and played &quot;with such tigerish passion and feline seduction which, whether it be good or bad art, nobody has been able to match since.&quot;

In 1884, Sigmund Freud saw Bernhardt perform &quot;Theodora&quot;, writing:

She also had her critics, particularly in her later years among the new generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. George Bernard Shaw wrote of the &quot;childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her wildly when the curtain falls...It is the art of fooling you.&quot; Ivan Turgenev wrote: &quot;All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!&quot; Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that &quot;We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience.&quot; He wrote that in her roles, &quot;enchantment is smothered in artifice.&quot;

Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s performances were seen and appraised by many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the late 19th century. Mark Twain wrote &quot;There are five kinds of actresses. Bad actresses, fair actresses, good actresses, great actresses, and then there is Sarah Bernhardt.&quot; Oscar Wilde called her &quot;the Incomparable One&quot;, scattered lilies in her path, and wrote a play in French, &quot;Salomé&quot;, especially for her; it was banned by British censors before it could be performed. Shortly before he died, Wilde wrote: &quot;The three women I have most admired in my life are Sarah Bernhardt, Lily Langtry, and Queen Victoria. I would have married any one of them with pleasure.&quot;

After seeing a performance by Bernhardt in 1903, the British actress Ellen Terry wrote &quot;How marvelous Sarah Bernhardt was! She had the transparence of an azalea with even more delicacy, the lightness of a cloud with less thickness. Smoke from a burning paper describes her more nearly.&quot;

British author D.H. Lawrence saw Bernhardt perform &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot; in 1908. Afterward, he wrote to a friend:

==Personal life==
===Paternity, date of birth, ancestry, name===
The identity of Bernhardt&#x27;s father is not known for certain. Her original birth certificate was destroyed when the Paris Commune burned the Hotel de Ville and city archives in May 1871. In her autobiography, &quot;Ma Double Vie&quot;, she describes meeting her father several times, and writes that his family provided funding for her education, and left a sum of 100,000 francs for her when she came of age. She said he frequently travelled overseas, and that when she was still a child, he died in Pisa &quot;in unexplained circumstances which remain mysterious.&quot; In February 1914, she presented a reconstituted birth certificate, which stated that her legitimate father was one Édouard Bernhardt. On 21 May 1856, when she was baptised, she was registered as the daughter of &quot;Edouard Bernhardt residing in Le Havre and Judith Van Hard, residing in Paris.&quot;

A more recent biography by Hélène Tierchant (2009) suggests her father may have been a young man named De Morel, whose family members were notable shipowners and merchants in Le Havre. According to Bernhardt&#x27;s autobiography, her grandmother and uncle in Le Havre provided financial support for her education when she was young, took part in family councils about her future, and later gave her money when her apartment in Paris was destroyed by fire.

Her date of birth is also uncertain due to the destruction of her birth certificate. She usually gave her birthday as 23 October 1844, and celebrated it on that day. However, the reconstituted birth certificate she presented in 1914 gave the date as 25 October. Other sources give the date 22 October, or either 22 or 23 October.

Bernhardt&#x27;s mother Judith, or Julie, was born in the early 1820s. She was one of six children, five daughters and one son, of a Dutch-Jewish itinerant eyeglass merchant, Moritz Baruch Bernardt, and a German laundress, Sara Hirsch (later known as Janetta Hartog or Jeanne Hard). Judith&#x27;s mother died in 1829, and five weeks later, her father remarried. His new wife did not get along with the children from his earlier marriage. Judith and two of her sisters, Henriette and Rosine, left home, moved to London briefly, and then settled in Le Havre, on the French coast. Henriette married a local in Le Havre, but Julie and Rosine became courtesans, and Julie took the new, more French name of Youle and the more aristocratic-sounding last name of Van Hard. In April 1843, she gave birth to twin girls to a &quot;father unknown.&quot; Both girls died in the hospice in Le Havre a month later. The following year, Youle was pregnant again, this time with Sarah. She moved to Paris, to 5 rue de l&#x27;École-de-Médecine, where in October 1844, Sarah was born.

===Lovers and friends===
Early in Bernhardt&#x27;s career, she had an affair with a Belgian nobleman, Charles-Joseph Eugène Henri Georges Lamoral de Ligne (1837–1914), eldest son of Eugène, 8th Prince of Ligne, with whom she bore her only child, Maurice Bernhardt (1864–1928). Maurice did not become an actor, but worked for most of his life as a manager and agent for various theatres and performers, frequently managing his mother&#x27;s career in her later years, but rarely with great success. Maurice and his family were usually financially dependent, in full or in part, on his mother until her death. Maurice married a Polish princess, Maria Jablonowska, of the House of Jablonowski, with whom he had two daughters: Simone, who married Edgar Gross, son of a wealthy Philadelphia soap manufacturer; and Lysiana, who married the playwright Louis Verneuil.

From 1864 to 1866, after Bernhardt left the Comédie-Française, and after Maurice was born, she frequently had trouble finding roles. She often worked as a courtesan, taking wealthy and influential lovers. The French police of the Second Empire kept files on high-level courtesans, including Bernhardt; her file recorded the wide variety of names and titles of her patrons; they included Alexandre Aguado, the son of Spanish banker and Marquis Alejandro María Aguado; the industrialist Robert de Brimont; the banker Jacques Stern; and the wealthy Louis-Roger de Cahuzac. The list also included Khalil Bey, the Ambassador of the Ottoman Empire to the Second Empire, best known today as the man who commissioned Gustave Courbet to paint &quot;L&#x27;Origine du monde&quot;, a detailed painting of a woman&#x27;s anatomy that was banned until 1995, but now on display at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. Bernhardt received from him a diadem of pearls and diamonds. She also had affairs with many of her leading men, and with other men more directly useful to her career, including Arsène Houssaye, director of the Théâtre-Lyrique, and the editors of several major newspapers. Many of her early lovers continued to be her friends after the affairs ended.

During her time at the Odéon, she continued to see her old lovers, as well as new ones including French marshals François-Certain Canrobert and Achille Bazaine, the latter a commander of the French army in the Crimean War and in Mexico; and Prince Napoleon, son of Joseph Bonaparte and cousin of French Emperor Louis-Napoleon. She also had a two-year-long affair with Charles Haas, son of a banker and one of the more celebrated Paris dandies in the Empire, the model for the character of Swann in the novels by Marcel Proust. Indeed, Swann even references her by name in &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;. Sarah Bernhardt is probably one of the actresses after whom Proust modelled Berma, a character present in several volumes of &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.

Bernhardt took as lovers many of the male leads of her plays, including Mounet-Sully and Lou Tellegen. She possibly had an affair with the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, who frequently attended her London and Paris performances and once, as a prank, played the part of a cadaver in one of her plays. When he was King, he travelled on the royal yacht to visit her at her summer home on Belle-Île.

Her last serious love affair was with the Dutch-born actor Lou Tellegen, 37 years her junior, who became her co-star during her second American farewell tour (and eighth American tour) in 1910. He was a very handsome actor who had served as a model for sculpture &quot;Eternal Springtime&quot; by Auguste Rodin. He had little acting experience, but Bernhardt signed him as a leading man just before she departed on the tour, assigned him a compartment in her private railway car, and took him as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles, such as Hippolyte in &quot;Phedre&quot;, where he could take off his shirt. At the end of the American tour, they had a dispute, he remained in the United States, and she returned to France. At first, he had a successful career in the United States and married operatic soprano and film actress Geraldine Farrar, but when they split up his career plummeted. He committed suicide in 1934.

Bernhardt&#x27;s broad circle of friends included the writers Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, his son Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, Émile Zola, and the artist Gustave Doré. Her close friends included the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma, a French impressionist painter, some nine years her junior. This relationship was so close, the two women were rumoured to be lovers. In 1990, a painting by Abbéma, depicting the two on a boat ride on the lake in the bois de Boulogne, was donated to the Comédie-Française. The accompanying letter stated that the painting was &quot;Peint par Louise Abbéma, le jour anniversaire de leur liaison amoureuse&quot; (loosely translated: &quot;Painted by Louise Abbéma on the anniversary of their love affair&quot;) Clairin and Abbéma spent their holidays with Bernhardt and her family at her summer residence at Belle-Île, and remained close with Bernhardt until her death.

===Marriage with Jacques Damala===
In 1882, in Paris, Bernhardt met a Greek diplomat, Aristide Damala (known in France by his stage name Jacques Damala), who was 11 years her junior, and notorious for his romantic affairs. Bernhardt&#x27;s biographer described him as &quot;handsome as Adonis, insolent, vain, and altogether despicable.&quot; His affairs with married women had already led to one suicide and two divorces, and the French government had asked him to leave Paris, transferring him to the Greek Embassy in St. Petersburg. She already had a lover at the time, Philippe Garnier, her leading man, but when she met Damala, she fell in love with him, and insisted that her tour be modified to include a stop in St. Petersburg. Garnier politely stepped aside and let her go to St. Petersburg without him. Arriving in St. Petersburg, Bernhardt invited Damala to give up his diplomatic post to become an actor in her company, as well as her lover, and before long, they decided to marry. During a break in the tour, they were married on 4 April 1882 in London. She told her friends that she married because marriage was the only thing she had never experienced. Upon returning to Paris, she found a minor role for Damala in &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; and a leading role in another play without her, &quot;Les Mères Ennemies&quot; by Catulle Mendès. Critics dismissed him as handsome, but without noticeable talent. Damala began taking large quantities of morphine, and following Bernhardt&#x27;s great success in &quot;Fedora&quot;, Damala took every opportunity to criticise and humiliate her. She later discovered that he was using the money she gave him to buy presents for other women. In early December 1882, when she confronted him, he declared that he was going to North Africa to join the Foreign Legion, and disappeared.
In early 1889, Damala reappeared at Bernhardt&#x27;s door haggard, ill, and penniless. Bernhardt instantly forgave him, and offered him the role of Armand Duval in a new production of &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; at the Variétés. They performed together from 18 May until 30 June. He looked exhausted and old, confused his diction, and forgot his lines. The critic for &quot;Le Rappel&quot; wrote: &quot;Where is, alas, the handsome Armand Duval who was presented to us for the first time a few years ago at the Gaîté?&quot; The critic Francisque Sarcey wrote simply, &quot;he makes us feel sick.&quot; When his contract ended, he was able to get another contract as an actor at a different theater, and continued to harass Bernhardt. He attended one of her performances sitting in the first row, and made faces at her. Her current lover, Philippe Garnier, saw him and beat him. Later, he entered her house and ravaged the furniture. Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic, and did not want to divorce him. He continued to act, sometimes with success, particularly in a play by Georges Ohnet, &quot;Le Maître des Forges,&quot; in 1883. However, his morphine addiction continued to worsen. In August 1889, Bernhardt learned that he had taken an overdose of morphine in Marseille. She hurried to his bedside and nursed him until he died on 18 August 1889, at the age of 34. He was buried in Athens. Bernhardt sent a bust she had made of him to be placed on his tomb, and when she toured in the Balkans, always made a detour to visit his grave. Until the end of her life, she continued to sign official documents as &quot;Sarah Bernhardt, widow of Damala&quot;.

===Belle-Île===
After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a small island off the coast of Brittany, south of the Quiberon peninsula. She purchased a ruined 17th-century fortress, located at the end of the island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her holiday retreat. From 1886 to 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theatre was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also brought her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organised a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.

===Vegetarianism===

Bernhardt was described as a strict vegetarian (what would later be termed vegan), as she avoided dairy, eggs and meat. Her diet consisted of cereal, fruit, nuts and vegetables. In 1913, &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; reported that she became vegetarian to lose weight and regain her figure. However, a 1923 biography of Bernhardt noted that she consumed fish and in her older years favoured Gruyère or Pont-l&#x27;Évêque cheese.

== Legacy ==
Mexican actress Virginia Fábregas (1871–1950) was nicknamed &quot;The Mexican Sarah Bernhardt.&quot;

After Bernhardt&#x27;s death, her theatre was managed by her son Maurice until his death in 1928. It kept its name until the occupation of Paris by the Germans in World War II, when, because of Bernhardt&#x27;s Jewish ancestry, the name was changed to Théâtre de la Cité. The name was changed back to the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in 1947, then in 1957 became the Théâtre des Nations. In 1968, it was renamed the Théâtre de la Ville, which is the name it has today.

In 1876, Bernhardt constructed a large townhouse at 35 rue Fortuny in the 17th arrondissement, not far from Parc Monceau, for her family, servants, and animals. In 1885, when her debts mounted, she sold the house. Once her fortune was replenished by her tours abroad, she bought an even larger house at 56 avenue Pereire in the 17th arrondissement, where she died in 1923. The house was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a modern apartment building. A plaque on the façade commemorates Bernhardt&#x27;s earlier residence.

In 1960, Bernhardt was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 1751 Vine Street. To date, she is the earliest born person on the Walk (born in 1844), followed by Thomas Edison and Siegmund Lubin.

In 2018, Roundabout Theatre Company produced Theresa Rebeck&#x27;s play &quot;Bernhardt/Hamlet&quot;. In the play, Rebeck explores the controversy surrounding Bernhardt&#x27;s decision to play Hamlet. The play opened on Broadway in September at the American Airlines Theater for a limited run. It starred Janet McTeer as Bernhardt and it was directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel. McTeer received a Tony Award nomination for portraying Bernhardt.

=== The New Women&#x27;s Movement in Brazil ===
The new women&#x27;s movement that took place in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century Brazil, was a movement built around a woman&#x27;s ability to gain access to public spaces in Brazil. Among middle-class women, new opportunities and possibilities opened up for women allowing them professional positions in the workforce. Some women also found the acting profession to afford them freedom and independence. The theatre offered women an environment relatively free of social constraints. The profession of an actress held a controversial opinion within society. On one hand, high society embraced women who appeared in plays or opera representing a high culture. While on the other hand, female performers could suffer public scrutiny and gossip for leading unconventional lives.

&quot;The Eternal Feminine&quot; was published 16 January 1886 by Revista Illustrada in Brazil six months before the first visiting of Sarah Bernhardt. &quot;The Eternal Feminine&quot; discussed advances of middle class and elite women in Brazil, citing expanding educational opportunities, acknowledging that women were capable of entering many new professions and industries that had previously been restricted to primarily men. &quot;The Eternal Feminine&quot; stated that &quot;The bello sexo&quot;, as journalists so often called women, may move into new occupations, but their beauty, elegance, and eternal femininity needed to remain in place.&quot;

Bernhardt&#x27;s performances in Brazil had lasting effects in the sense that they encouraged new notions of possibilities for women in a patriarchal and traditional society and in theatre. Bernhardt made use of an array of tropes assigned to women to create a public personality that afforded her freedom, independence, and immense popularity at home and abroad.&quot; Even her famous cross-dressing roles such as Hamlet intervened in the tension between the traditional woman and the New Woman. Bernhardt&#x27;s ability to own her own theatre also speaks to the ways in which she embodies a new form of women.

<text>David James Mattacks (born 13 March 1948) is an English rock and folk drummer, best known for his work with British folk rock band Fairport Convention. 

==Fairport Convention==
He replaced Martin Lamble, who had died on 12 May 1969 in a road accident on the M1 motorway, as the drummer for Fairport Convention. Mattacks left Fairport Convention in early 1972 to join The Albion Country Band. Meanwhile, he had also contributed to numerous studio recordings such as the Morris On project, Nick Drake&#x27;s &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, Steve Ashley&#x27;s &quot;Stroll On&quot; sessions, Steeleye Span&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hark! The Village Wait&quot;, John Martyn&#x27;s &quot;Solid Air&quot; and Harvey Andrews&#x27; album &quot;Writer of Songs&quot;. He returned to Fairport Convention in order to help complete the 1973 album &quot;Rosie&quot; with a revamped line up of the band.

Mattacks also played on &quot;Nine&quot; (1974) but left halfway through the making of the follow-up &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot;, following an altercation with engineer Glyn Johns. Some of Mattacks&#x27; most notable participation in studio recordings in the late 1970s are the work on art rock studio albums by Brian Eno (&quot;Before and After Science&quot;) and 801&#x27;s &quot;Listen Now&quot;, as well as several Ashley Hutchings-related folk rock projects (The Compleat Dancing Master, Son of Morris On etc.).

When Fairport Convention re-formed in 1985 after a six-year absence, Mattacks was recruited as drummer. He had already been playing with them again during annual reunions at the fledgling Cropredy Festival. Mattacks remained with Fairport until 1997. He has rejoined them on occasion, such as at Cropredy in 2019, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;.

== Other works ==
He began as a trainee piano-tuner before taking up the drums. He played with several jazz bands before joining Fairport Convention. 

Mattacks has also worked both as a session musician and as a performing artist. Apart from playing the drums, he is also a proficient keyboard player and occasionally played the bass guitar on studio recordings.

He also established himself as a touring drummer for Richard Thompson, playing on several of Thompson&#x27;s studio albums.

== Personal life ==
Mattacks was born in Edgware, Middlesex, England.

In 1998, he moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts, United States, where he is a sought-after studio musician, record producer, and member of the band Super Genius, while still touring regularly with various acts in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.

<text>Brillat-Savarin () is a soft-ripened triple cream cow&#x27;s milk cheese with at least 72% fat in dry matter (roughly 40% overall). It has a natural, bloomy rind. It was created 1890 as &quot;Excelsior&quot; or &quot;Délice des gourmets&quot; (&quot;Gourmets&#x27; delight&quot;) by the Dubuc family, near Forges-les-Eaux in Seine-Maritime. Brillat-Savarin is produced all year round mainly in Burgundy.

Father and son cheesemakers Pierre and Henri Androuët renamed it in the 1930s, as an homage to 18th-century French gourmet and political figure Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. It comes in wheels approximately 4 cm thick, and is matured for one to two weeks in dry cellar. It is also available as a fresh cheese (&quot;non affiné&quot;) that resembles rich cream cheese.

It is a triple cream soft-ripened cheese that is luscious, creamy and faintly sour.

<text>Thomas Francis Bayard (October 29, 1828 – September 28, 1898) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat from Wilmington, Delaware. A Democrat, he served three terms as the United States Senator from Delaware and made three unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. In 1885, President Grover Cleveland appointed him Secretary of State. After four years in private life, he returned to the diplomatic arena as Ambassador to Great Britain.

Born in Delaware to a prominent family, Bayard learned politics from his father James A. Bayard Jr., who also served in the Senate. In 1869, the Delaware legislature elected Bayard to the Senate upon his father&#x27;s retirement. A Peace Democrat during the Civil War, Bayard spent his early years in the Senate in opposition to Republican policies, especially the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate states. His conservatism extended to financial matters as he became known as a staunch supporter of the gold standard and an opponent of greenbacks and silver coinage which he believed would cause inflation. Bayard&#x27;s conservative politics made him popular in the Southern United States and with financial interests in the Eastern United States, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for president which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880 and 1884.

In 1885, President Cleveland appointed Bayard Secretary of State. Bayard worked with Cleveland to promote American trade in the Pacific while avoiding the acquisition of colonies at a time when many Americans clamored for them. He sought increased cooperation with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal-hunting rights in the waters around the Canada–United States border. As ambassador, Bayard continued to strive for Anglo-American friendship. This brought him into conflict with his successor at the State Department Richard Olney, when Olney and Cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than Bayard wished in the Venezuelan crisis of 1895. His term at the American embassy ended in 1897 and he died the following year.

== Early life and family ==

Bayard was born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1828, the second son of James A. Bayard Jr. and Anne &quot;née&quot; Francis. The Bayard family was prominent in Delaware, as Bayard&#x27;s father would be elected to the United States Senate in 1851. Among Bayard&#x27;s ancestors were his grandfather James A. Bayard, also a U.S. senator; and great-grandfather Richard Bassett, who served as U.S senator from and governor of Delaware. Several other relatives served in high office, including Bayard&#x27;s uncle Richard H. Bayard, another Delaware senator; and his great-great-granduncle Nicholas Bayard, who was mayor of New York City. On his mother&#x27;s side, Bayard descended from Philadelphia lawyer and financier Tench Francis Jr. Bayard was educated in private academies in Wilmington and then in Flushing, New York, when his father moved to New York City for business reasons. Bayard remained in New York when his father returned to Delaware in 1843, and he worked as a clerk in the mercantile firm of his brother-in-law August Schermerhorn.

In 1846, his father secured him a job in a banking firm in Philadelphia, and he worked there for the next two years. Bayard was unsatisfied with his progress at the firm and returned to Wilmington to read law at his father&#x27;s office. Bayard was admitted to the bar in 1851, the year that his father was elected to the U.S. Senate. Thomas took on greater responsibilities in the family law office and rose quickly in the legal profession. In 1853, after the election of Democratic President Franklin Pierce, Bayard was appointed United States Attorney for Delaware. He spent only a year in the position before moving to Philadelphia to open a law practice with his friend William Shippen, a partnership that lasted until Shippen&#x27;s death in 1858. While in Philadelphia, Bayard met Louise Lee, whom he married in October 1856. The marriage produced twelve children.

== Civil War and Reconstruction ==
Bayard&#x27;s return to Wilmington in 1858 brought greater involvement in the political scene. James Bayard was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, and Thomas attended with him. The elder Bayard supported Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia for the nomination. When the convention deadlocked and the Southern Democrats split from the main party, James Bayard adhered to the regular Democrats, but told Thomas that he thought the nominee, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, was untrustworthy. The subsequent election of Republican Abraham Lincoln and secession of the seven states of the Deep South led both Bayards to fear for the future of the Union, and the elder Bayard to propose a convention of all the states to resolve their differences. In the meantime, as four more Southern states seceded, James Bayard encouraged his son to help organize an independent militia unit, the Delaware Guard; Thomas Bayard was commissioned as its First Lieutenant.

In 1860, Delaware occupied an unusual position in the free state-slave state divide; nominally a slave state, Delaware&#x27;s slave population had been in steep decline for decades and represented just 1.6% of the state&#x27;s people. Opinion on secession was mixed in Delaware, but the Bayards were Peace Democrats and leaned to the Southern perspective. They blamed the war on abolitionist Republicans and believed that secession, while unwise, should not be suppressed with military force. Thomas Bayard spoke at a public meeting in Dover in June 1861, saying that &quot;with this secession, or revolution, or rebellion, or by whatever name it may be called, the State of Delaware has naught to do.&quot; Even after the Civil War&#x27;s first battles erupted in Virginia, Bayard continued to hope for peace. By early 1862, the Delaware Guard came under suspicion of Southern sympathies, and Major General Henry du Pont, commander of the state militia, ordered it disarmed. When Bayard refused to comply, he was briefly arrested before being released on parole. Bayard&#x27;s father was reelected to the Senate in 1862, but resigned shortly thereafter in protest of the new oath of office, which demanded that Senators swear they had never borne arms against the United States nor given aid and encouragement to its enemies.

Bayard and his father continued in private law practice through the war. Both were pleased with the Democrats&#x27; peace platform in 1864, but disappointed in the choice of nominee, Major General George B. McClellan, a War Democrat. In 1866, Thomas Bayard successfully represented four South Carolinians in &quot;habeas corpus&quot; cases against the military. The following year, Senator George R. Riddle died and the legislature elected James Bayard to fill the remainder of the term, which ended in 1869. Bayard became more politically active, speaking at a public meeting in September 1867 against constitutional proposals for ending racial discrimination in voting rights. The following year, he condemned the impeachment proceedings against President Andrew Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency in 1865 after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination and had threatened the Republican Congress&#x27;s plans for Reconstruction of the Southern states. Both Bayards attended the 1868 Democratic National Convention and, although they were unenthusiastic about the nominee, Horatio Seymour, supported the unsuccessful ticket that year.

== United States Senator ==

=== Reaction to Reconstruction ===
Bayard&#x27;s father retired from the Senate when his term ended in 1869, and the legislature elected his son to the seat with little opposition. Bayard entered a Senate in which his fellow Democrats were greatly outnumbered by Republicans; the new president, Ulysses S. Grant, was also a Republican. In the Reconstruction Era, Bayard took up the cause of the defeated South, speaking against the continued military rule of the conquered states and advocating a return to civilian (and conservative) government. He protested the requirement that readmitted Southern states ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection of the laws to all Americans. Bayard also inveighed against the continued presence of federal troops in the South. He spoke against each of the three Enforcement Acts, which increased the federal government&#x27;s power to protect black Southerners&#x27; civil and political rights in the face of rising violence by the Ku Klux Klan and other groups.

Although his protests were to little effect, Bayard continued to voice opposition to the majority party&#x27;s plans for reconstructing the South. In 1871, he was named to a joint committee sent by Congress to investigate conditions in the South. The committee, like the Congress, had a Republican majority, and their report detailed many of the Klan&#x27;s outrages against the newly freed slaves. Bayard dissented, questioning the veracity of the witnesses&#x27; testimony and stating that there were few incidents of lawlessness and that the South was generally at peace. The majority disagreed, and their findings were the basis for the Third Enforcement Act later that year.

As more Democrats returned to the Senate, and as Republican goals shifted elsewhere, Bayard&#x27;s ideas gained some traction, but were still largely in vain. In 1873, the Senate passed a resolution he introduced that demanded that Grant disclose how much government money was being expended in enforcing Reconstruction laws in the South, and to whom it was paid; the President ignored the resolution. The next year, Bayard opposed a Republican bill authorizing federal supervision of the upcoming election in Louisiana, attacking the Republican administration there as corrupt; he was unsuccessful, and the election was supervised by federal troops. He spoke forcefully against the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1875, which was to be the last such act for nearly a century. Again, he was unsuccessful and the bill, which guaranteed equal treatment in public accommodations regardless of race, passed Congress and became law. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Bayard&#x27;s actions endeared him to his conservative constituents, and he was elected to another six-year term in 1874.

=== Specie resumption ===
From the start of his congressional career, Bayard was an advocate of hard money, i.e., a dollar backed by gold. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized a new form of currency, redeemable not in specie (gold or silver coin) but in 6% government bonds. These United States Notes, popularly known as &quot;greenbacks,&quot; had helped to finance the war when the government&#x27;s gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in Congress (including Bayard) wanted to return the nation&#x27;s currency to a gold standard as soon as possible. The process of retiring the greenbacks had already begun when Bayard was elected, but stopped when many Senators and Representatives thought the fiscal contraction too severe, and likely to be harmful to the economy. In 1869, Congress passed the Public Credit Act of 1869, which required that the government pay its bond holders in gold, not greenbacks. Bayard thought the bill not strong enough, since it did not require removing greenbacks from circulation, and he voted against it.

In 1873, a business depression (known as the Panic of 1873), increased the pressure for retaining greenbacks, as some in Congress believed that inflating the currency would ease the economic problems. Grant&#x27;s Treasury Secretary, William Adams Richardson, reissued $26 million of the redeemed greenbacks, reversing the administration&#x27;s previous policy of removing them from circulation. This ignited a four-month debate in the Senate over whether and when the government should return to backing all of its currency with gold—including the remaining greenbacks. The majority, including Bayard, favored resumption, but in wording the resolution that passed the Senate, Republican John Sherman of Ohio left vague the exact timing; Bayard feared it would be put off indefinitely. The Sherman bill also proposed to remove greenbacks from circulation by exchanging them for bonds payable in gold; in response, Bayard proposed an amendment limiting the amount of debt the government could incur. When the amendment was rejected, Bayard voted against the bill (known as the Specie Payment Resumption Act), believing that it was likely to cause inflation.

=== Election of 1876 ===


Bayard&#x27;s popularity with his party had grown during his time in the Senate, and by 1875 he was seen as a contender for the presidency. His advocacy of hard money had won him friends in some of the Northern cities, and his stance against Reconstruction made him popular throughout the South. Competing for those same factions of the Democratic party was New York governor Samuel J. Tilden, who had gained national fame for fighting the political corruption of William M. Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall machine in New York City. Other contenders included Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana and Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Tilden&#x27;s wealth and national renown helped gather delegates to his cause, and in June 1876, he entered the convention with 404½ votes; Bayard placed fifth with 33. Tilden was nominated on the second ballot. Displeased with the result, Bayard nonetheless supported the Democratic nominee against Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, the Republican candidate, speaking to large crowds in cities across the North and Midwest.

On election day, the vote was close, but appeared to favor a Tilden victory. Three days later, Tilden looked to have won 184 electoral votes, one short of a majority, while Hayes appeared to have 166 votes, with the votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina still in doubt. Each party sent their people to observe the vote in the disputed states. Abram Hewitt, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asked Bayard to travel to Louisiana along with several others, but Bayard refused to go. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each state producing two sets of returns, one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. There was debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. Bayard supported the idea, and visited Tilden in New York to convince him that it was the only alternative to stalemate and possible renewed civil war. The bill passed, with Bayard&#x27;s vote, and provided for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices.

To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice. Bayard was among the seven Democrats chosen. Davis upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. The commission met and considered all of the disputed ballots, awarding each to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote. Bayard and his fellow Democrats were outraged, and the Democratic majority in the House threatened to filibuster to prevent the results from being accepted. As the March 4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at Wormley&#x27;s Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the committee&#x27;s decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining &quot;unredeemed&quot; states there. The Democrats agreed and the filibuster ended. Tilden later blamed Bayard, among others, for his role in creating the Electoral Commission, but Bayard defended his position, believing that the only alternative to the result was civil war.

=== Gold standard ===
In 1873, Congress had passed a Coinage Act that regulated which coins were legal tender. The list of legal coins duplicated that of the previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins. The rationale in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, it made sense to drop the unused coin. The bill passed easily, with Bayard&#x27;s support, but quickly thereafter became unpopular. Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73,&quot; and would mean it literally, circulating tales of bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents.

Over the next few years, pressure to reintroduce silver coinage grew, and cut across party lines. In 1877, Republican Senator Stanley Matthews of Ohio introduced a resolution to pay the national debt in silver instead of gold. Bayard joined several Republicans in speaking and voting against the measure, calling it &quot;folly,&quot; but it passed the Senate 42 to 20. Meanwhile, Democrat Richard P. Bland of Missouri furthered the silver cause from the House, proposing a free silver bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors.

In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. William B. Allison, a pro-silver Republican from Iowa, offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government&#x27;s credit, not private citizens. Bayard saw the whole effort as the path to inflation and economic ruin. Again, he spoke against the bill, but like the Matthews resolution, the Bland–Allison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878. President Hayes shared Bayard&#x27;s fear of inflation, and vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote necessary to overturn the veto, and it became law.

=== Clashes with Hayes ===
The elections of 1878 returned control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats for the first time since before the Civil War. The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President. Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military&#x27;s involvement in Southern politics. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.

Bayard also clashed with Hayes on the issue of Chinese immigration. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. Bayard criticized the treaty because it treated Americans and the Chinese as equal races, when he believed the latter was inferior. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen&#x27;s wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman&#x27;s Party, was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration. Bayard favored some restriction on Chinese immigration and voted in favor of a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, which passed both houses that year. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among some New England Republicans, but was bitterly denounced in the West. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act, in 1882. Bayard supported this new act, which became law with President Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s signature that year.

=== Election of 1880 ===


As the election of 1880 drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate. Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, which meant the Republicans would not have the advantage of incumbency. On the Democratic side, Tilden was regarded as the natural choice, as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876. Tilden&#x27;s supporters saw Bayard as a rival, and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876. Meanwhile, in the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party&#x27;s candidate in 1880. In fact, the Potter committee&#x27;s investigation had the opposite effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden&#x27;s nephew, William Tilden Pelton, that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The telegrams doomed Tilden&#x27;s hopes for the nomination, and boosted Bayard&#x27;s chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters.

As Tilden&#x27;s star began to fade, many Democrats looked to Bayard. He remained popular in the Eastern cities for his conservatism and hard money beliefs, but many in the South, including Senator Augustus Hill Garland of Arkansas, advised Bayard to embrace silver to help halt the defections of Southern and Western Democrats to the new Greenback Party. Bayard declined to do so. He was also reluctant to strike a deal with John Kelly of New York, whose Tammany faction of the Democratic party was currently at odds with the Tilden machine there. After the party rift caused the defeat of the Democratic governor in New York&#x27;s 1879 election, many Tilden adherents began to think their candidate could not win his home state, and drifted to Bayard, among others. Tilden&#x27;s supporters attempted to weaken Bayard in February 1880 by publishing the speech he gave in Dover in 1861, in which he said that the United States should acquiesce in Southern secession. At the same time, Bayard&#x27;s uncompromising stance on the money question pushed some Democrats to support Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, who had not been identified with either extreme in the gold-silver debate and had a military record that appealed to Northerners.

Leading up to the convention in Cincinnati, Tilden remained ambiguous about his intentions. George Gray, Delaware&#x27;s attorney general, placed Bayard&#x27;s name in nomination, calling the senator &quot;a veteran, covered in scars of many a hard-fought battle, where the principles of constitutional liberty have been at stake ... Bayard is a statesman who will need no introduction to the American people.&quot; When the convention took its first ballot on June 23, Bayard placed second with 153½ votes, trailing only Hancock, who had 171. On the second ballot, the delegates broke for Hancock, and he was nominated. The Southern delegates, whom Bayard thought would be most loyal to him, were among the first to desert him. The convention nominated William Hayden English of Indiana, a Bayard supporter and hard-money man, for vice president, and then closed. Bayard&#x27;s supporters were disappointed, but he supported the ticket as usual, in the interest of party unity. Hancock and English fought to a near-draw in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote to James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur by 214 to 155.

===Budget surplus and civil service reform===
The Delaware legislature re-elected Bayard to the Senate for a third term in 1881 without serious opposition. The Senate in the 47th Congress was evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with the new vice president, Arthur, holding the tie-breaking vote. After spending the special session of March 1881 in an intra-Republican Party fight over the confirmation of Garfield&#x27;s cabinet nominees, the Senate went into recess until October. By that time, Garfield had been assassinated and Arthur was president. When the Senate reconvened, the Democrats held the majority briefly, and Bayard was elected president pro tempore on October 10; Republicans regained the majority three days later as Republican latecomers arrived and were sworn in, and David Davis took over the office.

Among the issues confronting the Senate was the surplus of government funds. With high revenue held over from wartime taxes, the federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to balance the budget; the Democrats wished to lower tariffs, in order to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on internal improvements and pensions for Civil War soldiers while reducing excise taxes. Bayard did not oppose some veterans&#x27; pensions, but worried that pensions would require continued high tariffs, which he opposed. He supported the movement for a commission to examine the tariff and suggest improvements, but opposed the resulting Tariff of 1883, which reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%. Congressional Republicans also sought to deplete the surplus through a Rivers and Harbors Act that increased spending on internal improvements; Bayard opposed the bill and was gratified when Arthur vetoed it against his own party&#x27;s wishes.

Bayard and Arthur also agreed on the need for civil service reform. Garfield&#x27;s assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform. Leaders of both parties, including Bayard, realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system and, by 1882, a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but the bill did not pass. After the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned successfully on the reform issue, the Pendleton bill was proposed again, and again Bayard supported it, saying that &quot;the offices of this Government are created ... for the public service and not for the private use of incumbents.&quot; The Senate approved the bill 38–5 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January 16, 1883.

===Election of 1884===
Despite his rebukes at the Democratic national conventions in 1876 and 1880, Bayard was again considered among the leading candidates for the nomination in 1884. Tilden again was ambiguous about his willingness to run, but by 1883 New York&#x27;s new governor, Grover Cleveland, began to surpass Tilden as a likely candidate. After Tilden definitively bowed out in June 1884, many of his former supporters began to flock to Bayard. Many Democrats were concerned with Cleveland&#x27;s ability to carry his home state after he, like Tilden before him, became embroiled in a feud with the Tammany Hall wing of the party. At the same time, the Tammany Democrats became more friendly to Bayard.

By the time the Democrats had assembled in Chicago on July 8, 1884, to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine. Blaine&#x27;s nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party. Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction. Bayard was optimistic at the start of the convention, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland&#x27;s 392. The reason was the same as in 1880: as Representative Robert S. Stevens of New York said, &quot;I believe if he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [1861] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North.&quot; The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.

The resulting campaign between Cleveland and Blaine focused more on scandal and mudslinging than the issues of the day. In the end, Cleveland eked out a narrow victory. Carrying New York was crucial for the Democrat; a shift of just 550 votes in that state would have given the election to Blaine. Instead, Cleveland carried his home state and a Democrat was elected president for the first time since 1856.

==Secretary of State==
Cleveland recognized Bayard&#x27;s status in the party hierarchy by offering him the top spot in his cabinet, Secretary of State. Bayard did not think himself an expert in foreign affairs and enjoyed the sixteen years he had spent in the Senate; even so, he accepted the post and joined the administration. Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore described Bayard&#x27;s personality and habits at that time:Mr. Bayard has no appreciation of humor or fondness for political intrigue, and department drudgery would be intolerable to him were it not for his passionate fondness for out-door exercise. A bold horseman, an untiring pedestrian, and enthusiastic angler, and a good swimmer, he preserves his health, and gives close attention to the affairs of his Department.

===Samoa and Hawaii===
Among the first foreign policy challenges Bayard and Cleveland faced was that concerning American influence in the Samoan Islands. The United States, Great Britain, and Germany all had treaties with the Samoan government that guaranteed their right to trade and establish naval bases there. In the 1880s, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck began to increase German influence in Samoa, and attempted to replace the Samoan king, Malietoa Laupepa, with Tamasese Titimaea, a claimant to the throne who favored German suzerainty. Bayard and Cleveland opposed any change that would undermine Samoan independence, as did the British government. Bayard filed a note of protest with the German government, and the three powers agreed to meet for a conference in Washington in June 1887, but they failed to achieve any agreement.

Shortly thereafter, Tamasese&#x27;s unpopularity led another claimant, Mata&#x27;afa Iosefo, to start a rebellion that led to the Samoan Civil War. When Tamasese&#x27;s German guards were killed, Bismarck considered it an attack on Germany, and sent warships to Samoa. Cleveland dispatched three American warships, , , and , in response, and a British warship joined them. As the threat of war grew, Bismarck backed down and agreed to another conference in 1889; two weeks later, a hurricane struck the harbor and all of the German and American warships were damaged or sunk. As tempers cooled, the parties met in conference in Berlin. By that time, Cleveland had been defeated for re-election and James G. Blaine took Bayard&#x27;s place as Secretary of State. The three powers agreed to a tripartite protectorate of Samoa with Malietoa Laupepa restored as king; that situation prevailed until 1899, when renewed civil war led to a second convention partitioning the islands between Germany and the United States.

In the Kingdom of Hawaii, Bayard and Cleveland pursued a similar goal of maintaining the Hawaiian kingdom&#x27;s independence while expanding access for American trade. As a Senator, Bayard had voted for free trade with Hawaii, but the treaty was allowed to lapse in 1884. As Secretary of State the following year, Bayard hoped to again have free trade with Hawaii, and also endorsed the idea of establishing an American naval base there, although he preferred Midway Atoll to the eventual location, Pearl Harbor. A treaty to that effect passed the Senate in 1887 by a 43–11 vote. As in Samoa, the administration sought to curb foreign influence, encouraging the Hawaiian government to reject a loan from Britain that would have required pledging future government revenues toward its repayment.

===Relations with Britain===

Despite their agreement on Samoa, much of Bayard&#x27;s term of office was taken up in settling disputes with the United Kingdom. The largest of these concerned the Canadian fisheries off the Atlantic coasts of Canada and Newfoundland. The rights of American fishermen in Canadian waters had been disputed since American independence, but the most recent disagreement stemmed from Congress&#x27;s decision in 1885 to abrogate part of the 1871 treaty that governed the situation. Under that treaty, American fishermen had the right to fish in Canadian waters; in return, fishermen from Canada and Newfoundland had the right to export fish to the United States duty-free. Protectionists in Congress thought the arrangement hurt American fisherman, and convinced their colleagues to repeal it. In response, Canadian authorities fell back on an interpretation of the earlier Treaty of 1818, and began to seize American vessels. In 1887, the lame duck 49th Congress then passed the Fisheries Retaliation Act, which empowered the president to bar Canadian ships from American ports if he thought Canadians were treating American fishermen &quot;unjustly;&quot; Cleveland signed the bill, but did not enforce it and hoped he and Bayard would be able to find a diplomatic solution to the escalating trade war.

Britain agreed to negotiate, and a six-member commission convened in Washington in June 1887. Bayard led the American delegation, joined by James Burrill Angell, president of the University of Michigan, and William LeBaron Putnam, a Maine lawyer and international law scholar. Joseph Chamberlain, a leading statesman in the British Parliament, led their delegation, which also included Lionel Sackville-West, the British ambassador to the United States, and Charles Tupper, a future Prime Minister of Canada. By February 1888, the commission agreed on a new treaty, which would create a mixed commission to determine which bays were open to American fishermen. Americans could purchase provisions and bait in Canada if they purchased a license, but if Canadian fisherman were allowed to sell their catch in the United States duty-free, then the Americans&#x27; licenses to fish in Canada would be free. Bayard believed that the treaty, &quot;if observed honorably and honestly, will prevent future friction ... between the two nations.&quot; The Senate, controlled by Republicans, disagreed, and rejected the treaty by a 27–30 vote. Aware of the risk that the treaty might be rejected, Bayard and Chamberlain agreed on a two-year working agreement, allowing Americans to continue their fishing in Canadian waters by paying a fee. This arrangement was renewed every two years until 1912, when a permanent solution was found.

A similar dispute with Britain arose in the Pacific, over the rights of Canadians to hunt seals in waters off the Pribilof Islands, a part of Alaska. While only Americans had the right to take seals on the islands, the right to hunt in the waters around them was less well-defined, and Americans believed foreign sealers were depleting the herd too quickly by hunting off-shore. Bayard and Cleveland believed the waters around the islands to be exclusively American, but when Cleveland ordered the seizure of Canadian ships there, Bayard tried to convince him to search for a diplomatic solution instead. The situation remained unresolved when the administration left office in 1889, and remained so until the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911.

Relations with Britain were also impaired when Sackville-West intervened in the 1888 election. A Republican, posing as a British immigrant to the United States, asked Sackville-West whether voting for Cleveland or his Republican opponent, Benjamin Harrison, would best serve British interests. Sackville-West wrote that Cleveland was better for Britain; Republicans published the letter in October 1888, hoping to diminish Cleveland&#x27;s popularity among Irish-Americans. Cleveland&#x27;s cabinet discussed the matter and instructed Bayard to inform the ambassador his services would no longer be required in Washington. Bayard attempted to limit the electoral damage, and gave a speech in Baltimore condemning Republicans for scheming to portray Cleveland as a British tool. Cleveland was defeated for re-election the following month in a close election.

==Return to private life==
Bayard&#x27;s term as Secretary of State ended in March 1889 after Cleveland&#x27;s defeat, and he returned to Wilmington to resume his law practice. He lived in &quot;very comfortable circumstances&quot; there, with a fortune estimated at $300,000, although his income from the law practice was modest. His wife having died in 1886, Bayard remarried in 1889 to Mary Willing Clymer, the granddaughter and namesake of the Philadelphia socialite Mary Willing Clymer. Bayard remained involved with Democratic politics and stayed informed on foreign affairs. When Cleveland was re-elected in 1892, many assumed Bayard would resume his position in the cabinet. Instead, Cleveland selected Judge Walter Q. Gresham of Indiana for the State Department and appointed Bayard Ambassador to Great Britain, the first American envoy to Britain to hold that rank (his predecessors had been envoys). Bayard accepted the appointment, which the Senate quickly confirmed.

==Ambassador to Great Britain==

On June 12, 1893, Lord Rosebery, the British Foreign Secretary, received Bayard in London. Bayard began his tenure as ambassador with an &quot;instinctive feeling of friendship for England,&quot; and a desire for peace and cooperation between the two nations. That desire was quickly impaired when Cleveland took the side of Venezuela when that nation insisted on taking a boundary dispute between it and British Guiana to international arbitration. The exact boundary had been in dispute for decades, but Britain had consistently denied any arbitration except over a small portion of the line; Venezuela wished the entire boundary included in any arbitration.

Bayard spent mid-1894 in the United States conferring with Gresham. The tension in the Venezuelan boundary dispute continued to escalate, while British disagreements with Nicaragua also threatened to involve the United States. Britain had once ruled the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua (the Mosquito Coast) but had abandoned it in 1860. Nicaragua had annexed the area while guaranteeing the inhabitants (the Miskito people) a degree of autonomy. When Nicaragua expanded their control of the area in 1894, the Miskito chief, Robert Henry Clarence, protested with the support of the British ambassador. Bayard agreed with Cleveland and Gresham that the British were not attempting to reestablish their colony, but Nicaraguans (and many Anglophobic Americans) saw a more sinister motive, including a possible British-controlled canal through Nicaragua. Returning to England, Bayard met with the new Foreign Secretary, Lord Kimberley, to emphasize Nicaragua&#x27;s right to govern the area.

The tension over Nicaragua soon abated, but the May 1895 death of Secretary Gresham, who like Bayard had favored cooperation with the British, led to increased disagreement over the Venezuela issue. Cleveland appointed Richard Olney to take over the State Department, and Olney soon proved more confrontational than his predecessor. Olney&#x27;s opinion, soon adopted by Cleveland, was that the Monroe Doctrine not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. Olney drafted a long dispatch on the history of the problem, declaring that &quot;to-day the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition ...&quot; Bayard delivered the note to the British Prime Minister (Lord Salisbury, who was also serving as Foreign Secretary) on August 7, 1895.

Olney&#x27;s note was met with vehement disagreement and delay, but when tempers cooled, the British agreed to arbitration later that year. Bayard disagreed with the bellicose tone of the message, which he attributed to an effort to satisfy Anglophobia among &quot;Radical Republicans and the foolish Irishmen.&quot; Olney, for his part, thought Bayard soft-pedaled the note and asked Cleveland to remove Bayard from office, which Cleveland declined. The House of Representatives agreed with Olney, and passed a resolution of censure against Bayard in December 1895. Britain and Venezuela formally agreed to arbitration in February 1897, one month before the Cleveland administration came to an end. The panel&#x27;s final judgement, delivered in 1899, awarded Britain almost all of the disputed territory.

==Death and legacy==

Bayard remained in London until the arrival of his successor, John Hay, in April 1897. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He returned to Wilmington that May and visited ex-President Cleveland at his home in Princeton the following month, remaining friendly with him despite their differences on the Venezuela question. Bayard&#x27;s health had begun to decline in England, and he was often ill after his return to the United States. He died on September 28, 1898, while visiting his daughter Mabel Bayard Warren in Dedham, Massachusetts. Bayard was buried in the Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery at Wilmington. He was survived by his second wife and seven of his twelve children, including Thomas F. Bayard Jr., who would serve in the United States Senate from 1922 to 1929.

Thirteen years after his death, the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; said of Bayard that &quot;his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and polished, if somewhat deliberate, eloquence made him a man of mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, for the expression of some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen, the House of Representatives went so far as to pass ... a vote of censure on him. The value of Bayard&#x27;s diplomacy was, however, fully recognized in the United Kingdom where he worthily upheld the traditions of a famous line of American ministers.&quot; In 1929, the Dictionary of American Biography described Bayard, as a Senator, as being &quot;remembered rather for his opposition to Republican policies ... than for constructive legislation of the successful solution of great problems&quot;, and said that he had &quot;the convictions of an earlier day ... and was never inclined, either politically or socially, to seek popularity with the country at large.&quot; Charles C. Tansill, a conservative historian, found much to praise in Bayard; he published a volume on Bayard&#x27;s diplomatic career in 1940 and another about his congressional career in 1946, the only full-length biographies to appear since Bayard&#x27;s death. Later historians took a dimmer view of Bayard&#x27;s diplomatic career; in a 1989 book, Henry E. Mattox numbered Bayard among the Gilded Age foreign service officers who were &quot;demonstrably incompetent.&quot;

In 1924, Mount Bayard, a mountain in southeast Alaska was named in his honor.

<text>A British [[sitcom]] or a Britcom is a situational comedy programme produced for British television.

British sitcoms have predominantly been recorded on studio sets, while some include an element of location filming. Live audiences and multi-cameras were first used in the US by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball for their American show &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1951 and the system was adopted in the UK. Several are made almost entirely on location (for example, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;) and shown to a studio audience prior to final post-production to record genuine laughter. In contrast to the American team writing system, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson&#x27;s huge successes were of such quality that they became the paradigm for British sitcom writing.

By the time the television set had become a common part of home furnishing, sitcoms were significant expressions of everyday life and were often a window on the times of enormous social changes in the British class system and its conflicts and prejudices. The period from 1970 to 1979 in particular is often considered the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of British sitcom. Since the turn of the century however, many are filmed on a single-camera set-up or entirely on location, with no studio screening or laugh track, such as &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2000, 2006–2012), and &quot;PhoneShop&quot; (2009–2013).

A subset of British comedy consciously avoids traditional situation comedy themes, storylines, and home settings to focus on more unusual topics or narrative methods. &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1983–1989) and &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (1980–1988, 2013) moved what is often a domestic or workplace genre into the corridors of power. A later development was the mockumentary genre exemplified by series such as &quot;The Office&quot; (2001–2003), which also heralded the modern trend of the single-camera sitcom dispensing with live audiences.

A 2004 poll by the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, produced a list topped by traditional sitcoms with &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; holding the first place, and included favourites such as David Croft&#x27;s &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, and &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;. It was not until &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2000) in place 19 that a show without a live studio audience was featured.

British Christmas TV programming has a long-standing tradition of heavily featuring comedy and sitcoms in the schedules, often with episodes that capture holiday spirit, and sometimes emotional moments. In her review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of the 2024 &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; grand finale Rachel Aroesti states &quot;...our greatest sitcoms tend to bow out at their peak, but the festive revival traditionally comes to the rescue, extending the lifespans of iconic shows such as &quot;The Royle Family&quot; and &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; by a decade or more. If there’s still any doubt, Gavin &amp; Stacey (which ostensibly concluded in 2024) belongs firmly in the same modern classic category.&quot; The 2024 Gavin &amp; Stacey Christmas Day special, serving as the grand finale, peaked the ratings and further solidifies Britcom&#x27;s legacy as a staple of British festive television.

On a suggestion to Miranda Hart by sitcom writer Abigail Wilson, who collaborated with comedy actors Dawn French (&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; 1994–2000) and Jennifer Saunders (&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; 1992–1995), the 2009 &quot;Miranda&quot; series staged a highly successful comeback for the &#x27;old school&#x27; 20th century concept of sitcoms with live audiences and multiple cameras.

Writing for the British Film Institute, Phil Wickham, film and TV critic and author of several books about British TV, concludes:

==Early years==

===Beginnings===

The origins of British TV sitcoms trace back to radio comedies of the 1940s and 1950s like &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, which aired on BBC Radio in 1954, British TV sitcoms were initially inspired by American comedy formats, but they quickly developed their own style that highlighted dry wit, social satire, and the nuances of British life. Early shows of the 1950s often featured archetypal British characters such as the staff and pupils in &quot;Whack-O!&quot; and the various facets portrayed in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, and set the stage for what would become the British TV sitcom genre. They were set in post World War II working-class or domestic environments, highlighting issues of class, family dynamics, and British culture, while &quot;The Army Game&quot;, ITV&#x27;s first sitcom, parodied the life of army conscripts during the last years of the National Service which ended in 1963.

===&quot;Pinwright&#x27;s Progress&quot;===

Written by Rodney Hobson, &quot;Pinwright&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1946–1947) was the world&#x27;s first regular half-hour televised sitcom. Broadcast live by the BBC from Alexandra Palace, it was about J. Pinwright, the proprietor of a small shop. Storylines involved his hated rival and his staff, who only added to his problems by attempting to be helpful. The series featured an ensemble cast including James Hayter as J. Pinwright, Clarence Wright as Aubrey, Sara Gregory as Sally Doolittle, Daphne Maddox as Miss Peasbody, Doris Palmer as Mrs Sigsbee, Leonard Sharp as Ralph, Benita Lydal as Mrs Rackstraw, Charles Irwin as a salesman, and Jill Christie as Pinwright&#x27;s daughter. and produced and directed by John Glyn-Jones. The script editor was Ted Kavanagh, who during the World War II years also wrote the BBC Radio comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; (&quot;ITMA&quot; ), which according to Foster and Furst was &quot;entirely new, breaking away from the conventions of both radio and music hall comedy&quot;.

===&quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;===
Transferred to television in 1956 after 48 episodes on BBC radio which began in 1954, &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (1956–1961) by Galton and Simpson was the first modern TV sitcom. Whilst moving away from audio variety towards character development, the radio series had been influential in the development of TV situation comedy. The radio series continued to be produced alongside the TV version. Tony Hancock played a fictionalised version of himself, a loser whose plans and aspirations are continually ruined by bad luck. Its only other regular cast member was the more worldly sidekick played by Sid James, later of &quot;Carry On&quot; fame and &quot;Bless This House&quot; . Other occasional participants included John Le Mesurier (&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;), Kenneth Williams, and Patricia Hayes. Hancock&#x27;s biographer John Fisher dates the first use of the term &#x27;situation comedy&#x27; in British broadcasting to a BBC memo dated 31 March 1953 from radio comedy producer Peter Eton, suggesting the format as the ideal vehicle for Hancock&#x27;s comedic style. &quot;Hancock&#x27;s persona of the pompous loser out of his depth in an uncomprehending society still informs many programmes today&quot;, according to Phil Wickham. The final BBC series of this show was broadcast under the shorter title &quot;Hancock&quot;. In 1963, Hancock changed his writers and moved to ITV for a further 13-episode series also named &quot;Hancock&quot;. The series, though relatively well received, has been described as &quot;clearly not up to the standard of [Hancock&#x27;s] BBC work&quot;.

===&quot;Whack-O!&quot;===
Starring Jimmy Edwards in the lead role as Professor James Edwards, &quot;Whack-O!&quot; written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, is about the drunken, gambling, devious, cane-swishing headmaster who tyrannised staff and children at the fictitious Chiselbury public school &quot;for the sons of Gentlefolk&quot;. From 1956 to 1960 and 1971–1972, it ran for 60 episodes over 8 series. The first six episodes were subtitled &quot;Six of the Best&quot;, alluding to the frequent and traditional caning of disobedient pupils in the UK at the time. The series was revived in colour with updated scripts in 1971–72, slightly retitled &quot;Whacko!&quot;. Other members of the cast included Arthur Howard (series 1–7),
Julian Orchard (series 8),
Kenneth Cope,
Norman Bird,
John Stirling,
Peter Glaze,
Edwin Apps (series 1–7),
Peter Greene (series 8),
David Langford,
Keith Smith,
Brian Rawlinson,
Gordon Phillot, Harold Bennett (series 8),
Frank Raymond,
Gary Warren (series 8), and
Greg Smith (series 8). A feature film, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;, was made in 1960.

===&quot;The Army Game&quot;===
Peter Eton&#x27;s series of &quot;The Army Game&quot; (1957–1961) was probably British television&#x27;s most successful sitcom of this period and ran for 154 episodes. Many of its stars went on to become household names. The original cast consisted of William Hartnell, Michael Medwin, Geoffrey Sumner, Alfie Bass, Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw and Norman Rossington. The cast of &quot;The Army Game&quot; would change over the years with actors such as Geoffrey Palmer, Bill Fraser, Ted Lune, Frank Williams, Harry Fowler and Dick Emery appearing in subsequent series. &quot;The Army Game&quot; follows the exploits of Hut 29, a fictional dysfunctional group of conscripted National Service soldiers during the post-war years. Writers included creator Sid Colin, Larry Stephens, Maurice Wiltshire, Lew Schwarz, John Jowett, John Antrobus, John Foley, Marty Feldman, Barry Took, David Climie, David Cumming, Derek Collyer, Brad Ashton, John Junkin, Talbot Rothwell, Sidney Nelson, Stan Mars, Bob Perkins and Alan MacKinnon. At least three episodes are uncredited. In June 1959, a short &quot;The Army Game&quot; scene was performed by Michael Medwin, Alfie Bass, Norman Rossington, Bill Fraser and Ted Lune at the Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. This was the last Royal Variety Performance that was not televised. This successful series inspired a film spin-off, &quot;I Only Arsked!&quot; (1958), and in 1958, just a year after the series debuted, the first &quot;Carry On&quot; film, the very similar &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, was released, also featuring Hawtrey, Rossington and Hartnell.

==The 1960s==
===Two channel TV===

ITV sitcoms began with the channel&#x27;s launch in 1957 and throughout the 1960s helped shape British comedy with varied and often experimental styles. In the 1960s, the BBC produced a then-rare workplace comedy with &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; (1961–1963, 1977–1978) written by Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney. The success of the series was due partly to the strength of the female ensemble playing the workforce, who included Sheila Hancock, Barbara Windsor and Esma Cannon. It also made the earliest of Richard Waring&#x27;s domestic comedies, &quot;Marriage Lines&quot; (1961–1966), starring Richard Briers (later to star in &quot;The Good Life&quot;) and Prunella Scales (who went on to star in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;), and &quot;Not in Front of the Children&quot; (1967–70), starring Wendy Craig.
Women were usually only cast in secondary roles in this period, though several series with Craig in the lead were an exception. Sitcoms developed by Carla Lane, the first successful female writer in the form, began with &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; (1969–1979, 1996), initially in collaboration with others.

Another change, with &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–65, 1970–74) and &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; (1964–1966), producers began to cast actors, rather than the comedians around whom earlier series like &quot;Whack-O!&quot;, with Jimmy Edwards, or &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, had been built.

===&quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot;===
As a spin-off sequel to &quot;The Army Game&quot; and also starring Bill Fraser and Alfie Bass, &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot;, (1960–1963, 1974) was written by a large team over its 104 episodes. Writers for the 1960–63 episodes included Marty Feldman, Barry Took, John Antrobus, Ray Rigby, David Cumming, Derek Collyer, James Kelly, Peter Lambda, Tom Espie, Jack Rosenthal, Harry Driver, and Doug Eden. The 1974 series was written by David Climie, Ronnie Cass and Lew Schwarz. The series established the reputation of actor Clive Dunn, leading to his role as Corporal Jones in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

===&quot;Marriage Lines&quot;===
Running for 43 episodes over 5 series (1963–1966), first titled &quot;The Marriage Lines&quot;, &quot;Marriage Lines&quot; was written by Richard Waring and directed and produced by Robin Nash and Graeme Muir. The traditional domestic comedy about a young couple learning to cope with married life reflected social attitudes of the times, and provided its lead stars Richard Briers (&quot;The Good Life&quot;, &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;) and Prunella Scales (&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;) with a significant boost to their careers. The supporting cast included Edward de Souza, Ronald Hines and Christine Finn.

===&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;===
With its cast of only two regular characters played by Harry H. Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell, airing 1962–65 and 1970–74, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; was a Galton and Simpson creation and ran for 57 episodes over 8 series. Producers included Duncan Wood, John Howard Davies, Graeme Muir, and Douglas Argent. In 2000, the show was ranked number 44 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Albert was ranked 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters, The series was derived from a one-off Galton and Simpson comic play, &quot;The Offer&quot;, shown on their BBC series Comedy Playhouse in 1962. It is regularly repeated and gave rise to four feature films.

===&quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;===
Written by Johnny Speight and broadcast 1965–1968 and 1972–1975, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; featured Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett and was an instant hit. Centred on the bigoted character of Alf Garnett, it addressed racial and political issues that had been becoming increasingly prevalent in British society. It was criticised by campaigner Mary Whitehouse for its bad language, and due to changing attitudes in political correctness it is seldom repeated.

===&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;===
Based on a World War II theme, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1968–1977) by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, was a gentle mockery of Britain&#x27;s &#x27;finest hour&#x27; and the Home Guard. One of the most enduring British sitcoms, it starred Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, whose interaction with Lowe&#x27;s character Captain Mainwaring was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a memorable part of one of television&#x27;s most popular shows&quot;. It also starred Clive Dunn, John Laurie, Ian Lavender and Arnold Ridley. During its original television run, the show was nominated for multiple British Academy Television Awards, including &quot;Best Situation Comedy&quot; in 1973, 1974 and 1975, although only won &quot;Best Light Entertainment Production Team&quot; in 1971. In 2000, the show was voted 13th in a British Film Institute poll of industry professionals of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In 2004, championed by Phill Jupitus, it came fourth in the BBC poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom. As of 2022 it is one of British television&#x27;s most regularly repeated sitcoms.

===&quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;===
Bringing the first light-hearted satirical look at the church, during 1966–1971 &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; paved the way for &quot;Bless Me, Father&quot; (1978–1981) with Arthur Lowe, and farcical ecclesiastical comedies such as &quot;Father Ted&quot; and &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; in the 1990s. Starring Derek Nimmo with Robertson Hare, William Mervyn, John Barron, Joan Sanderson (&quot;Please Sir!&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;), and Ernest Clark, it was written by husband-and-wife team Pauline Devaney and Edwin Apps and directed by John Howard Davies and Stuart Allen. The successful series, which after an initial controversy became a favourite of Britain&#x27;s clergy, was followed by two spin-offs also starring Nimmo: &quot;Oh, Brother!&quot; (1968–1970), 19 episodes written by David Climie and Austin Steele, with supporting roles by Sir Felix Aylmer, Patrick McAlinney and Derek Francis, and its sequel &quot;Oh, Father!&quot; (1973) with Felix Aylmer, Laurence Naismith, Pearl Hackney and David Kelly, also written by Climie and Steele. &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; was produced by Stuart Allen, John Howard Davies, and Robin Nash, and the music was provided by Stanley Myers.

===&quot;Me Mammy&quot;===
With Milo O&#x27;Shea, and Yootha Joyce (&quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;George and Mildred&quot;) in the lead roles, &quot;Me Mammy&quot; was written by Hugh Leonard, produced by James Gilbert and Sydney Lotterby for the BBC and aired 1968–1971 for 21 episodes over 3 series. Bunjy Kennefick, played by O&#x27;Shea, is an Irish mother&#x27;s boy living in London. He is a top executive of a company and lives a bachelor lifestyle. However, his old-fashioned Catholic mother often puts a stop to his plans, many of them involving his girlfriend Miss Argyll, played by Joyce.

==The 1970s==

===The Golden Era===
The 1970s is often regarded as the golden era of British sitcom. Well-remembered series include John Cleese and Connie Booth&#x27;s farcical &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975, 1979) often cited as the greatest sitcom of all time. John Esmonde and Bob Larbey&#x27;s self-sufficiency comedy &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–78) and &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; by Peter Spence and Christopher Bond were also highly successful. &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; (1973–74), a sequel to &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, is thought to have surpassed the original, while its writers, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, provided Ronnie Barker with his most significant sitcom vehicle, &quot;Porridge&quot; (1974–77). Barker also starred (along with David Jason) in &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1973, 1976–85), written by Roy Clarke, whose &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; began in 1973 and ended in 2010, becoming the world&#x27;s longest running sitcom. The decade also saw the broadcast of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; (1974–81), which has been criticised for the &quot;stereotypes of its handful of Indian supporting characters as alternately servile, foolish, lazy or devious&quot;.

The commercial station ITV had successes with &quot;Rising Damp&quot; (1974–78, sometimes called the best of all ITV sitcoms), &quot;Man About the House&quot; (1973–76) and &quot;George and Mildred&quot; (1976–79). &quot;Rising Damp&quot; star Leonard Rossiter also played the lead role in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; (1976–79). The decline in cinema attendance meant that many of these series were turned into cinema films; the first film version of &quot;On the Buses&quot; (1969–73) was the biggest hit at the British box office in 1971. According to Jeff Evans, &quot;On the Buses&quot; was a &quot;cheerfully vulgar comedy&quot; in which &quot;leering and innuendo dominate[d].&quot; Some of the network&#x27;s other ratings successes from this era included &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; (1972–76) and &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; (1977–79, 1986), which attempted to find humour in racial or ethnic conflict and misunderstandings, but were increasingly criticised over time for &quot;obvious racial name-calling... recurring with distressing regularity&quot; and &quot;offer[ing] only the crudest caricatures&quot;.

Increasing relaxation in regard to the discussion of sex allowed farce and camp humour to become a familiar form in the 1970s and were used in series like &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and comedian Frankie Howerd&#x27;s &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, which ran for 16 episodes (1969–70, 1975, 1991) and starred several female stalwarts from the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Valerie Leon. A feature of the show which inspired three films was Howerd&#x27;s frequent breaking of the fourth wall.

Other controversial topics for comedy included series written by Richard Waring and Wendy Craig. &quot;...And Mother Makes Three&quot; (1971–73), and its sequel &quot;...And Mother Makes Five&quot; (1974–76), starred Craig (who also co-wrote) as a widowed mother who eventually remarries a divorced single father. &quot;My Wife Next Door&quot; (1972), created by Brian Clemens, concerned a divorced couple who accidentally moved next door to each other, &quot;Miss Jones and Son&quot; (1977–78) was about a single mother, and &quot;Rings on Their Fingers&quot; (1978–80) was about a young, unmarried couple.

===&quot;On the Buses&quot;===
Another creation by Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe is &quot;On the Buses&quot;, starring Reg Varney and Bob Grant. Running 1969–1973 for 74 episodes over 7 series, it was initially rejected by the BBC, who did not see much comedy potential in a bus depot as a setting. It was then commissioned by Frank Muir, then at London Weekend Television who said it was &quot;rather at the baked beans end of my menu&quot;. Despite poor critical reception, it gained an audience of up to 20 million. It has been described as cliche-ridden, stereotypical, occasionally racist and totally sexist by today&#x27;s standards, with Varney&#x27;s and Grant&#x27;s characters both lecherous womanisers and ethnic minorities used inappropriately for humour. As David Stubbs wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, Grant and Varney were playing &quot;two conspicuously middle-aged men&quot; (Varney was in his 50s when the series began) pursuing &quot;an endless array of improbably available &#x27;dolly birds&#x27; &quot;. The series was made into three films, &quot;On the Buses&quot; (1971), &quot;Mutiny on the Buses&quot; (1972), and &quot;Holiday on the Buses&quot; (1973).

===&quot;Bless This House&quot;===
Starring Sid James of &quot;Carry On&quot; fame, with Diana Coupland and Sally Geeson, &quot;Bless This House&quot; was created by Vince Powell and Harry Driver, but mainly written by others including Dave Freeman and Carla Lane. Running from 1971 to 1976, It marked a departure from James&#x27; characteristic bawdy slapstick and famous &#x27;dirty laugh&#x27; and ran for 65 episodes over 10 series. The series ended abruptly in 1976, when, just four days after the broadcast of the final episode, James died after collapsing on stage. Ironically, James had told Coupland, &quot;It&#x27;s such fun and so successful, we&#x27;ll still be working on &quot;Bless This House&quot; till one of us kicks the bucket.&quot;
In 2004, it came 67th in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

===&quot;Clochemerle&quot;===
In 1972 the lavish French farce in English based on the 1934 novel of the same name by Gabriel Chevallier, &quot;Clochemerle&quot; was adapted into 9 episodes by Galton and Simpson for the BBC. It was a stark contrast to the dark comedy of their &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. Filmed on location in Colombier-le-Vieux, in the department of Ardèche, it starred Roy Dotrice, Wendy Hiller, Cyril Cusack, Kenneth Griffith, Cyd Hayman, Bernard Bresslaw, Hugh Griffith, Micheline Presle, Madeline Smith, Christian Roberts, Nigel Green, Wolfe Morris and Gordon Rollings, with narration by Peter Ustinov. The show was produced by Michael Mills as a co-production between the BBC and West Germany&#x27;s Bavaria Film. Incidental music was arranged by Alan Roper and played by L&#x27;Harmonie Du Rhone Orchestra, Lyon, under the musical direction of Raymond Jarniat.

===&quot;My Wife Next Door&quot;===
Created by Brian Clemens and written by Richard Waring, &quot;My Wife Next Door&quot; was shown on BBC1 in 1972 and ran for 13 episodes. The series concerns George Basset, played by John Alderton, and Suzie Basset, played by Hannah Gordon, who each try to start afresh after their divorce by moving to the country, only to find that they have moved into adjoining cottages. The music was by Dennis Wilson. In 1973, one episode won a British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy. During a repeat run in January 1980, one episode gained 19.3 million viewers and was the second most-watched programme that week.

===&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;===

Set in a fictional, traditional London department store, the show follows the antics of the staff of the retail ladies&#x27; and gentlemen&#x27;s clothing departments . Known for its innuendo-laden humor, quirky characters, and catchphrases &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (1972–85) was one of the longest-running sitcoms of the era. It was created and written for the BBC by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft and stars Frank Thornton, Mollie Sugden, Wendy Richard, Nicholas Smith, and John Inman, who of the original cast were to appear in all 69 episodes and the same five later featured in the sequel spin-off &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;which aired in 1991–1992. Inman&#x27;s camp characterisation of Mr. Humphries contributed greatly to the series&#x27; success. In 2004, it ranked 20th in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. The series proved to be highly exportable, and is regularly repeated on BBC Two, Drama and Gold in the UK, PBS and BBC America in the United States, and BBC UKTV, Fox Classics and 9Gem in Australia, and Jones! in New Zealand; as of 2024 it is also streamed on Britbox, Apple TV, and in the US on BritBox Amazon Channel. The series was nominated for the 1977 Best Situation Comedy BAFTA TV Award but the 1977 &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; feature film starring the main cast was not well received. A one-off episode with a new cast was broadcast in 2016.

===&quot;Man About the House&quot;===
Considered daring at the time because it featured a man sharing a flat with two single women, the flat-share comedy &quot;Man About the House&quot; was created by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. It starred Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, Paula Wilcox and Sally Thomsett, with Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce as their landlord and landlady. 40 episodes were broadcast over six series on ITV, and ran from 1973 to 1976. The series is regularly repeated on ITV3. After the series ended in 1976, two successful spin-off series followed: &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, in which the Ropers move to the suburbs, and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in which Robin gets married and opens a bistro. The 1977 &quot;Man About the House&quot; spin-off film which included guest stars Arthur Lowe, Bill Pertwee, Aimi MacDonald, and Spike Milligan (as himself), &quot;acquits itself better than most movie spin-offs from TV series.&quot; &quot;Man About the House&quot; placed 69th out of 100 in a 2003 BBC poll to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

===&quot;Porridge&quot;===
Based on life in a UK prison, the &quot;Porridge&quot; sitcom by writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais provided Ronnie Barker (&quot;Open All Hours&quot;), in the role of a prison inmate, with his most significant sitcom vehicle, supported by Richard Beckinsale. It ran from 1974 to 1977 on BBC1 for 22 episodes over three series. The series features two major supporting characters, both prison officers: Mr Mackay, played by Fulton Mackay, and Mr Barrowclough, played by Brian Wilde. The sitcom focused on two prison inmates, Norman Fletcher, played by Barker, and Lennie Godber, played by Beckinsale, who are serving time in a fictional British prison. &quot;Porridge&quot; was critically acclaimed and was ranked No. 35 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000. In 2004, &quot;Porridge&quot; placed seventh in Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom. &quot;Porridge&quot; was appreciated by British prisoners. Erwin James, an ex-prisoner who wrote a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated: &quot;What fans could never know, however, unless they had been subjected to a stint of Her Majesty&#x27;s Pleasure, was that the conflict between Fletcher and Officer Mackay was about the most authentic depiction ever of the true relationship that exists between prisoners and prison officers in British jails up and down the country. I&#x27;m not sure how, but writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais grasped the notion that it is the minor victories against the naturally oppressive prison system that makes prison life bearable.&quot;

===&quot;Rising Damp&quot;===
The ITV production of 28 episodes (1974–78) of &quot;Rising Damp&quot; written by Eric Chappell, is sometimes called the best of all ITV sitcoms. It starred Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby, a miserly, seedy, and ludicrously self-regarding landlord of a run-down Victorian townhouse who rents out his shabby bedsits to a variety of tenants: Ruth Jones, an unmarried woman approaching middle age, played by Frances de la Tour; Alan Moore, a medical student played by Richard Beckinsale; and Philip Smith, a cultured sales representative supposedly descended from African royalty, played by Don Warrington. Chappell defended Rigsby by saying &quot;[he]was not a racist or a bigot, but he was prejudiced and suspicious of strangers. But he accepted Philip and his only concern afterwards was that he didn&#x27;t get a leg over Miss Jones.&quot; Warrington who was born in Trinidad, stated: &quot;There were certain aspects of it that were politically incorrect. On the other, you can see how it held up a mirror to the way we were living.&quot; The series won the 1978 BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy and was the highest-ranking ITV sitcom in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, coming in 27th overall. Frances de la Tour received an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Award in the category of &quot;Best Actress&quot; for her performance as Ruth Jones.

===&quot;Happy Ever After&quot;===
Broadcast 1974–1979 on BBC1 for 41 episodes over 5 series, starring Terry Scott and June Whitfield, with Beryl Cooke, &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; was written by John T. Chapman, Eric Merriman, Christopher Bond, John Kane and Jon Watkins. It was based on a &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; pilot called &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; which aired on 7 May 1974, with Scott and Whitfield playing a middle-class couple whose grown-up children had just left home.

===&quot;The Good Life&quot;===
&quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–1978), written by Bob Larbey and John Esmonde, aired on BBC1 for 30 episodes over four series and two specials. The final episode was recorded in the presence of the Queen to mark her Silver Jubilee; it was reputedly one of her favourite shows. Felicity Kendal and Richard Briers starred as Barbara and Tom Goode – a middle-class suburban couple who decide to quit the rat race and become self-sufficient, much to the consternation of their snooty but well-meaning neighbour Margo, played by Penelope Keith, and her down-to-earth husband Jerry, played by Paul Eddington. The opening theme was composed by Burt Rhodes. In 2004, &quot;The Good Life&quot; came 9th in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. After its success, the four main cast members were given their own &quot;vehicles&quot; commissioned by the then Head of Comedy and producer of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, John Howard Davies. The series provided Felicity Kendal with her big break on television and significantly boosted her career on stage.

===&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;===
Described in the BBC&#x27;s profile of the show as &quot;the British sitcom by which all other British sitcoms must be judged&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975 and 1979) is eminently quotable; the repetition in the episode known as &quot;The Germans&quot; of &#x27;don&#x27;t mention the war&#x27; has become a catch phrase.&quot; In two series, only 12 half-hour episodes were made, because the writers, John Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth, felt that they could not continue to write comedy of the same quality. The series starred Cleese as Basil Fawlty, Prunella Scales as Sybil Fawlty, Connie Booth as Polly Sherman, and Andrew Sachs as Manuel. Supporting roles included Major Gowen, played by Ballard Berkeley, Chef Terry, played by Brian Hall, and Miss Gatsby and Miss Tibbs, played by Renee Roberts and Gilly Flower. Other well known guests from stage and screen, usually two or three for each episode, were featured in various episodes and among many others included Yvonne Gilan, Conrad Phillips, Bernard Cribbins, James Cossins, Allan Cuthbertson, Ann Way, Brenda Cowling, Joan Sanderson, Elspet Gray, Geoffrey Palmer, Derek Royle, Richard Davies, Ken Campbell, Una Stubbs, and John Quarmby. The show was produced by John Howard Davies and Douglas Argent, directed by Davies and Bob Spiers and the music was by Dennis Wilson. The show was ranked first on a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, and in 2019 it was named the greatest ever British TV sitcom by a panel of comedy experts compiled by the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Basil Fawlty has been listed by Channel 4 as the second greatest television character.

===&quot;George and Mildred&quot;===
The spin-off from &quot;Man About the House&quot;, starring Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy, with Norman Eshley, Sheila Fearn, and child star Nicholas Bond-Owen, a domestic sitcom &quot;George and Mildred&quot; is focused on a clash of social class. Written by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer, it ran for 38 episodes and is regularly repeated on ITV3. Yootha Joyce died suddenly in August 1980, just before production of a sixth and final series.

===&quot;Open All Hours&quot;===
Created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; ran for 26 episodes in four series (1976, 1981, 1982 and 1985) and starred Ronnie Barker and David Jason, with a regular supporting cast including Lynda Baron, Stephanie Cole, Barbara Flynn, Maggie Ollerenshaw, and Kathy Staff.
The programme, produced and directed by Sydney Lotterby and developed from a television pilot broadcast in Barker&#x27;s comedy anthology series &quot;Seven of One&quot; (1973), centred around the antics of the eccentric and miserly owner of a traditional English corner shop. Barker took his idea for Arkwright&#x27;s famous stutter from the 1950s writer and performer Glenn Melvyn. &quot;Open All Hours&quot; came 8th in the 2004 Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom poll. Although it ended in 1985, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; had been repeated over 3,000 times by 2021. The theme tune was composed by Joseph Ascher (1829–1869), arranged for a brass band and performed by Max Harris, who also wrote the incidental music. A sequel, &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;, with David Jason and many members of the original cast, began airing nearly 30 years later in 2013 and ran until 2019 for 41 episodes.

===&quot;Miss Jones and Son&quot;===
First broadcast on ITV in 1977 and running for 12 episodes, &quot;Miss Jones and Son&quot; (1977–78) was written by Richard Waring and produced and directed by Peter Frazer-Jones. It starred Paula Wilcox (&quot;Man About The House&quot;), Christopher Beeny, Charlotte Mitchell and Norman Bird. The series depicted the life of Elizabeth Jones, played by Wilcox, a young woman coming to terms with the responsibility of looking after her baby alone. Emotional support came in the form of next-door-neighbour and friend Geoffrey, played by Beeny. Difficulties included the reproaches of her parents, played by Mitchell and Bird, a difficult social life, and a reduced income. The theme song, &quot;Bright Idea&quot;, was written by Roger Webb.

===&quot;Rings on Their Fingers&quot;===
Also written by Richard Waring, &quot;Rings on Their Fingers&quot; (1978–80) ran from 1978 to 1980 for 20 episodes in 3 series and was and produced by Harold Snoad for the BBC. It concerns a young unmarried couple, Sandy Bennett, played by Diane Keen, and Oliver Pryde, played by Martin Jarvis. The cast also included Tim Barrett, Barbara Lott, Anna Dawson, John Kane and Royce Mills. Sandy wishes to marry whereas Oliver is happy to remain unmarried. During the first series they do marry and in the second series they adjust to married life. A proposed fourth series would have concerned Sandy becoming pregnant unexpectedly, and Sandy and Oliver adapting to parenthood, but the series was not re-commissioned.

===&quot;To the Manor Born&quot;===
Co-starring Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton and Peter Bowles as Richard DeVere, &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; (1979–1981, 2007) was a &#x27;feel-good&#x27; series following the leading characters&#x27; &#x27;will-they-won&#x27;t they&#x27; love story. Written by Peter Spence and Christopher Bond and produced and directed by Gareth Gwenlan, it was a sitcom with one of the largest audience ratings of the period. The final episode of series 1, which aired on 11 November 1979, was the most watched British television programme (excluding live events) of the 1970s, drawing 23.95 million viewers. The final episode in 1981 received 17.80 million viewers. The series has been repeated over 1,000 times. Major supporting roles were played by Angela Thorne as Audrey&#x27;s friend Marjory and Daphne Heard as Mrs Polouvicka, Richard&#x27;s mother. Other members of the cast included Alan David, John Rudling, Michael Bilton, Gerald Sim, Michael Cochrane, and Georgie Glen. The music was written by Ronnie Hazlehurst.

===&quot;Terry and June&quot;===
Spun off from &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; after it ended, Terry Scott and June Whitfield returned to star in the 65 episodes of &quot;Terry and June&quot; (1979–1987). It was mostly written by John Kane. Chapman, one of the original writers, said that the original programme had run out of ideas and had to end. BBC Comedy, however, were unwilling to end a successful &#x27;cozy&#x27; show, and so brought in fresh new writers; for legal reasons the programme title had to be changed, and, on 24 October 1979, &quot;Terry and June&quot; was born. It was similar to &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; without Aunt Lucy, but Terry and June&#x27;s surname changed from Fletcher to Medford and the characters moved to Purley in London. In 2004, it came joint 73rd in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; with &quot;Happy Ever After&quot;.

===&quot;Come Back Mrs. Noah&quot;===
The sci-fi sitcom &quot;Come Back Mrs. Noah&quot;, set in space in 2050, was broadcast on BBC1 from 17 July to 14 August 1978, with a pilot being aired on 13 December 1977, but it was not a success and ran for only six episodes. Although written by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, and featuring an all-star sitcom cast including Mollie Sugden (&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;), Ian Lavender (&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;), Gorden Kaye (&quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;), Donald Hewlett (&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; and &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot;) and Michael Knowles (&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; and &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot;), along with Vicki Michelle (&quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;) and Harold Bennett (&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;), some regarded it as one of the worst British sitcoms ever made. It has never been repeated. Writing in &quot;The British Comedy Guide&quot; on 27 June 2021, in his article &quot;Stranger Things: When sitcoms strain to be different&quot;, citing in detail three examples including &quot;Come Back Mrs. Noah&quot;, Graham McCann explains how a sitcom, even when written, produced and acted by a highly successful team, can go horribly wrong.

==The 1980s==
===The alternatives&#x27; incursion===
In the 1980s, the emerging alternative comedians began to develop sitcoms, partly as a response to series such as &quot;Terry and June&quot; (1979–87), with their &quot;complacent gentility, outmoded social attitudes and bourgeois sensibilities&quot;. The alternatives&#x27; incursion began with &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1982–84), written by Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and others. To help make it stand out, the group opted to combine traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom. Mayall was also the star of &quot;The New Statesman&quot; (1987–92), a series created by Maurice Gran and Laurence Marks, whose biggest success, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (1989–98, 2014–20), also deviated from British practice in being scripted by a team of writers.
The alternative comedy genre continued with &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1983–89), mainly written by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis and starring Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Atkinson&#x27;s Edmund Blackadder came at number three in the Channel 4 list of 100 greatest television characters. Other high-ratings mainstream, slice-of-life shows of the decade included &quot;Bread&quot; (1986–1991) written by Carla Lane, about a close-knit, working-class family in Liverpool. Running for 74 episodes, at its peak it attracted 21 million viewers. Another notable series was the Science fiction comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (1988–), while &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; another Croft and Lloyd creation is set in German occupied France during World War II.

===&quot;Yes Minister&quot;===
Starring Paul Eddington, with Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds in the supporting roles, &quot;Yes Minister&quot; which ran for 21 episodes on BBC2 (1980–1984), and its sequel &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (1986–88), which ran for 16 episodes, were political satires. Established Shakespearean actor Hawthorne picked up four BAFTA TV Awards for Best Light Entertainment Performance for his role. Created by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the series received several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll. Writer Michael Dobbs said Jay and Lynn &quot;really got to the heart of so much of what goes on in Whitehall and Westminster&quot;. As the series revolved around the inner workings of central government, most of the scenes take place privately in offices and exclusive members&#x27; clubs. Lynn said that &quot;there was not a single scene set in the House of Commons because government does not take place in the House of Commons. Some politics and much theatre takes place there. Government happens in private. As in all public performances, the real work is done in rehearsal, behind closed doors. Then the public and the House are shown what the government wishes them to see.&quot; Lynn and Jay explained: &quot;After we wrote the episode, we would show it to some secret sources, always including somebody who was an expert on the subject in question. They would usually give us extra information which, because it was true, was usually funnier than anything we might have thought up.&quot; In a 2004 BBC programme paying tribute to the series, it was revealed that Jay and Lynn had drawn on information provided by two insiders from the governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, namely Marcia Falkender and Bernard Donoughue. The series was the favourite television programme of the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. In 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that &quot;I can tell you, as prime minister, it is true to life.&quot;

===&quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;===
Set in 1959–60 in a fictional holiday camp, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; was filmed on location at the real Warner&#x27;s Holiday Centre at Dovercourt Bay. It ran for 58 episodes (1980–1988) on the BBC and is often repeated. It was co-written by Jimmy Perry, based on his experience as a Butlin&#x27;s Redcoat, and director-producer David Croft. With its ensemble cast comprising Paul Shane, Simon Cadell, Ruth Madoc, Jeffrey Holland, Su Pollard, and David Griffin, the series gained large audiences and won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Series in 1984. In a 2008 poll on Channel 4, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; was voted the 35th most popular comedy catchphrase. According to comedy researcher Mark Lewisohn, &quot;Plots became somewhat outlandish during the latter episodes and by the time the BBC called it a day in 1988, it is arguable that the show had already outstayed its welcome by a good couple of years. All in all, though, this was a good British sitcom.&quot;

===&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;===
One of the most successful British sitcoms of all time, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (1981–2003) starred David Jason as Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger brother Rodney. It began in 1981 and ran for 64 episodes, with specials, until 2003. It was the most durable of several series written by John Sullivan. The 1996 episode &quot;Time on Our Hands&quot; (originally billed as the last episode) holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode, attracting 24.3 million viewers. A ratings success with viewers, the series received numerous awards, including recognition from BAFTA, the National Television Awards and the Royal Television Society, as well as winning individual accolades for Sullivan and Jason. It was voted Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Del Boy was ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. The series influenced British culture, contributing several words and phrases to the English language. It was named one of the top 20 cult television programmes of all time by TV critic Jeff Evans. Evans spoke of: &quot;[shows] such as &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, which gets tremendous viewing figures but does inspire conventions of fans who meet in pubs called the Nag&#x27;s Head and wander round dressed as their favourite characters.&quot; The theme music was by Ronnie Hazlehurst (1981) and John Sullivan (1982–2003). &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; came top in a research and analysis by a team of scientists led by Dr Helen Pilcher, a molecular neurobiologist and stand-up comedian with a speciality in scientific humour.

===&quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;===
Running on the BBC for 295 episodes over 31 series and four decades, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (1973–2010) was entirely written by Roy Clarke (&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; and &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;) and produced by Alan J. W. Bell, with music by Ronnie Hazelhurst. It is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world. The family-friendly show was about the antics of a group of male pensioners looking for adventure, &quot;portraying the elderly in a positive and non-stereotypical light.&quot; The show was filmed largely in the small town of Holmfirth in Yorkshire, a location recommended by Barry Took, and surrounding countryside. and features Bill Owen, 186 episodes, Peter Sallis, 295 episodes, and Kathy Staff, 245 episodes, along with Thora Hird, 152 episodes (&quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot;), Stephen Lewis, 135 episodes, (&quot;On the Buses&quot;), 
Frank Thornton, 135 episodes (&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;), 
Brian Murphy, 73 episodes, (&quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;George and Mildred&quot;), 
Josephine Tewson, 62 episodes, (&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;), 
Dora Bryan, 50 episodes, (&quot;Happily Ever After&quot;), 
June Whitfield, 44 episodes, (&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Father, Dear Father&quot;, &quot;Terry and June&quot;), 
Trevor Bannister, 25 episodes, (&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;), and over the years included many other actors for a total cast of 459.
It later became the first comedy series to completely do away with studio sets and a live audience, moving all filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded for a laugh track to avoid the use of canned laughter.
&quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; was nominated numerous times for British television industry awards; it was proposed five times between 1973 and 1985 for the British Academy Film Awards, twice for the Best Situation Comedy Series award (in 1973 and 1979) and three times for the Best Comedy Series award (in 1982, 1983, and 1985). The show was also considered for the National Television Awards four times since 1999 (in 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2004), each time in the Most Popular Comedy Programme category. In 1999 the show won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme. Repeated over 17,000 times, it is regularly broadcast on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than 25 countries.

===&quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;===
On BBC1 for four series and one feature-length special, &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; (1984–1989) was made in a total of 27 episodes. It was written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, and it reunited them with Richard Briers, of their previous hit show &quot;The Good Life&quot;. Sydney Lotterby directed 13 episodes and 14 episodes were produced by Harold Snoad. The show also featured guest appearances by Peter Blake, Ronnie Stevens, Victoria Burgoyne and Ray Winstone. Centred around Martin Bryce, the eccentric mover and shaker of his local community who feels threatened by the verve and aplomb of a new arrival in the village, played by Peter Egan. Its handling was much less brash than most sitcoms, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as having &quot;a quiet, unacknowledged and deep-running despair to it that in retrospect seems quite daring&quot;. Reappraising the series, Andy Dawson observed that &quot;&quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; strayed far from the well-worn path that other Britcoms trudged along in the 70s and 80s. There was a very real darkness at the heart of it, with Martin existing in what was almost certainly a state of permanent mental anguish.&quot; The show was voted number 52 in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll in 2003. At its peak, it attracted television audiences of around 12 million.

===&quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;===
Reminiscent of their 1970s sitcoms such as &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, and &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; was another creation of the writer/producer team of David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. Set in Nazi-occupied France and starring Gorden Kaye as René, a café owner, 85 episodes were produced over nine series. Croft and Lloyd, who wrote the first six series (the rest were scripted by Lloyd and Paul Adam) devised the concept as a farcical parody of BBC wartime drama &quot;Secret Army&quot; (1977-1979) from which many elements were directly taken. Some actors from &quot;Secret Army&quot; also appeared in &quot;″Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;: Richard Marner, Guy Siner, John D. Collins and Hilary Minster. Although it did not have the success of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, it gained respectable ratings, and was adapted to stage. The BBC were able to sell the series to Germany, possibly because its Nazis were depicted &#x27;as harmlessly pervy and bumbling&#x27;.
 A special entitled &quot;The Return of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; aired in 2007, featuring cast members returning to reprise their original roles in a special story, alongside a documentary about the sitcom including a highlight reel of episodes, and interviews with the cast, production team and fans.

===&quot;The Mistress&quot;===
Starring Felicity Kendal (&quot;The Good Life&quot;) and Jane Asher, &quot;The Mistress&quot; (1985–1987) aired on BBC2 for 12 episodes and was written by Carla Lane. Kendal played Maxine, a young florist having an affair with a married man, whose wife was played by Asher. The series was produced and directed by Gareth Gwenlan. Series 2 attempted to broaden its scope, serving as a more general comedy while still retaining the thread of the affair.

===&quot;Chelmsford 123&quot;===
Running for only 13 episodes, &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; (1988–1990), was a short-lived series set in Roman Britain about a young Roman general punished by the Emperor by being sent to govern cold, miserable Britannia, populated by hordes of drunken hooligans. Created and written by Jimmy Mulville and
Rory McGrath, and starring themselves with Philip Pope and Neil Pearson, it has fallen into relative obscurity. Both series are nevertheless available on All 4.

==The 1990s==

The new Channel 4 began to have successful long-running situation comedies. &quot;Desmond&#x27;s&quot; (1989–94) was the first British sitcom with a black cast set in the workplace, and &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; (1990–98) brought topicality to the form as it was recorded close to transmission. &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching&quot; (1995–1997) was the last of many sitcoms by producer David Croft.

Some of the biggest hits of the 1990s were &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, &quot;2point4 Children&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot;, &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; and &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;.

===&quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;===
The &quot;Jeeves&quot; stories by novelist P. G. Wodehouse were made into &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; (1990–1993), a comedy-drama series in sitcom style. Twenty-three episodes in 4 series were adapted by Clive Exton for ITV, starring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, already well known writers and double act stars of their own sketch comedy television series &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;. The productions were well received. The third series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Design for Eileen Diss. The final series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Graphics for Derek W. Hayes and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series; it also earned a British Academy Television Award for Best Original Television Music for Anne Dudley, and a British Academy Television Award for Best Costume Design for Dany Everett. In retrospect, Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline called screenwriter Exton &quot;the series&#x27; real star&quot;, saying his &quot;adaptations come surprisingly close to capturing the flavour of the originals&quot; by &quot;retaining many of Wodehouse&#x27;s most inspired literary similes.&quot;

===&quot;Waiting for God&quot;===
Written by Michael Aitkens, produced by Gareth Gwenlan, and directed by Gwenlan and Sue Bysh, &quot;Waiting for God&quot; (1990–1994) ran on BBC1 for 47 episodes over 5 series and was a major success. It starred Stephanie Cole as Diana Trent and Graham Crowden as Tom Ballard, two elderly but spirited residents of Bournemouth&#x27;s fictional Bayview Retirement Home, who are determined not to grow old gracefully, and spend their time running rings around the home&#x27;s oppressive management and their own families. With Janine Duvitski in the main supporting role and a regular cast including Andrew Tourell, Sandra Payne, Michael Bilton and Paddy Ward, much of the humour was derived from flying in the face of expectations about how the elderly ought to behave. The show became very successful, and came 37th in the 2004 poll to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. It is frequently repeated on the Drama and Gold channels.

===&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;===
The frequently repeated and highly successful series &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; (1990–1995, 1997, 2008), was written by Roy Clarke. The show, which comprised five series and 44 episodes, including four Christmas specials, starred Patricia Routledge as the snobbish Hyacinth &#x27;Bouquet&#x27; Bucket, Clive Swift, playing her husband, and Josephine Tewson, playing her neighbour, with Judy Cornwell, Mary Millar and Geoffrey Hughes as her working class relatives. The theme music was composed by Nick Ingman. It is the BBC&#x27;s most exported television programme, having been sold nearly 1,000 times to overseas broadcasters. As of 2016 &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; is the most-bought BBC and has outsold every other show to international broadcasters in the past 40 years. According to Roy Clarke : &quot;...the secret to her wide fan base is that everyone knows a Hyacinth&quot; In a 2004 BBC poll it placed 12th in Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom and in a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Hyacinth Bucket was ranked 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. Production ended after Routledge decided to move on to other projects.

===&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;===
Written by Jennifer Saunders and starring herself and Joanna Lumley, with Julia Sawalha and June Whitfield in supporting roles, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (1992–1995) was based on the &quot;French and Saunders&quot; sketch &quot;Modern Mother and Daughter&quot;. It ran for 39 episodes with the first three series airing on BBC, followed a two-part special finale entitled &quot;The Last Shout&quot; in 1996. Saunders played Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR agent who spends her time in a desperate attempt to stay young and &quot;hip&quot;, and Lumley played fashion magazine director Patsy Stone, whose drug abuse and alcohol consumption far eclipsed Edina&#x27;s. It returned for two more series and two one-hour specials from 2001 to 2004. In 1997, the pilot episode, &quot;Fashion&quot;, was ranked #47 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time&quot; list. A scene from the show was included in the &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Greatest Moments&quot; programme broadcast by Channel 4 in 1999. In 2000, the show was ranked 17th in the greatest British television show of all time by the BFI. In 2004 and 2007, the show was ranked 24th and 29th on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot; list. In 2019, the series ranked 9th in &quot;Radio Times&quot;&#x27; top 20 British sitcoms. The series has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;, was released in 2016.

===&quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot;===
The BBC1 mini-series of &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot; (1993), broadcast in four 45-minute episodes written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, stars Richard Briers, Adrian Edmondson, Imelda Staunton and Martin Clunes. The humour concerns a man who bumps his head and starts believing he must do everything adverts tell him, with catastrophic results. &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not really a disaster but there&#x27;s something decidedly uneven underfoot here, a feeling that this is the working model for a new type of comedy rather than the finished product. [...] while it&#x27;s sustained with considerable energy by the actors and direction you have to doubt whether it really stands up for one episode, let alone four.&quot; Conversely, a retrospective review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; highlighted the series as &quot;a gem from an era when the BBC took its black comedy seriously&quot;, praising both its dark content and humour, &quot;a Richard Briers sitcom that&#x27;s the opposite of The Good Life.&quot; The series was only broadcast once and never repeated; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, this was &quot;possibly because it was too much of a leap for fans of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, but it has grown in cult status over the years.&quot;

===&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;===
In terms of ratings, &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; (1994–2007) starring Dawn French, is among the most successful British programmes of the digital era. The main character, Geraldine Granger, was invented by Richard Curtis, but he and French extensively consulted Joy Carroll, one of the first female Anglican priests.
The series exploited the 1992 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women. The show included cameos from many actors and celebrities, many appearing as themselves, and including Sarah, Duchess of York, Hugh Bonneville, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Griffiths, Miranda Hart, Alistair McGowan, Geraldine McNulty, Philip Whitchurch, Nicholas Le Prevost, Brian Perkins and Roger Sloman, Pam Rhodes, Kylie Minogue, Rachel Hunter, Terry Wogan, Jeremy Paxman, Martyn Lewis, Darcey Bussell, Sean Bean, Richard Ayoade, Orla Brady, Fiona Bruce, Annette Crosbie, Johnny Depp, Ruth Jones, Hilary Kay, Damian Lewis, Maureen Lipman, Jennifer Saunders, Sting and his wife Trudie Styler, Stephen Tompkinson, Dervla Kirwan, and Emma Watson. Dibley received multiple British Comedy Awards, two International Emmys, and was a multiple British Academy Television Awards nominee. In 2004, it was placed third in a BBC poll to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. In addition to the twenty main episodes between 1994 and 2007, the series included numerous shorter charity specials, as well as &#x27;lockdown&#x27; episodes produced during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic. The theme music was a setting of Psalm 23 composed by Howard Goodall as a serious piece of church choral music, and performed by the choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, with George Humphreys singing the solo. The conductor was Stephen Darlington.

===&quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;===
The 20 episode comedy drama series &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot; (1995–1997), by Scottish screenwriter Daniel Boyle, was filmed mainly on location in the Scottish Highlands, in a departure from the convention that sitcoms are filmed in studio and accompanied by a laugh track. It was loosely adapted from the mystery novels by M. C. Beaton (Marion Chesney) by Daniel Boyle and starred Robert Carlyle as a police officer.

===&quot;Father Ted&quot;===
The highly successful &quot;Father Ted&quot; (1995–1998) series created by Irish writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, produced by British Hat Trick Productions for Channel 4 aired over three series, including a Christmas special, for 25 episodes. Set on the fictional Craggy Island, off Ireland&#x27;s west coast, it starred Dermot Morgan as Father Ted Crilly, Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon as Father Dougal McGuire and Frank Kelly as Father Jack Hackett. Exiled to the island by Bishop Leonard Brennan, played by Jim Norton, the priests live together in the parochial house with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle, played by Pauline McLynn. The show subverts parodies of low-brow humour as it portrays nuanced themes of loneliness, agnosticism, existentialism and purgatory experienced by its title character; this deeper meaning of the show has been much acclaimed. The series won several BAFTA awards, twice winning for Best Comedy Series. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Father Dougal was ranked fifth on a list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2019, &quot;Father Ted&quot; was named the second-greatest British sitcom (after &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;) by a panel of comedy experts for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

===&quot;dinnerladies&quot;===
A winner of many awards, including &quot;Best New TV Comedy&quot; at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and &quot;Best TV Comedy&quot; in 2000. Created, written and co-produced by Victoria Wood, who also starred as the main character, Brenda Furlong, &quot;dinnerladies&quot; is based on the lives and interactions of the employees of a works canteen and ran for a total of 16 episodes during 1998 and 2000. The permanent cast occasionally featured guest actors, including Joanne Froggatt, Tina Malone, Dora Bryan OBE, Lynda Baron, Elspet Gray, Janette Tough, Simon Williams, Kenny Doughty and Eric Sykes CBE,
and Dame Thora Hird DBE. Involving only one set throughout its run (with the exception of quiz show and hospital sets which are both seen on a television screen in the last two episodes), &quot;dinnerladies&quot; was entirely filmed at the London BBC Television Centre in front of a live studio audience employing a multiple-camera setup. The theme music was composed by Victoria Wood.

==2000–2010==

At the turn of the Millennium, examples of the hyperreal approach pioneered by Galton and Simpson in some of their &quot;Hancock&quot; scripts was evident in Steve Coogan&#x27;s 12-episode sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; (1997–2002). Galton and Simpson&#x27;s influence also found its way into &quot;The Office&quot;, a mockumentary, &quot;Early Doors&quot;, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; and many British dramedies.
The BBC began using their digital channels BBC Three and BBC Four to build a following for off-beat series including &quot;The Thick of It&quot; (2005–2012). Channel 4 had successes with &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001), &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000–2004), &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; (2001–2002), &quot;Peep Show&quot; (2003–2015), &quot;Green Wing&quot; (2004–2006), &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; (2006–2013) and &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot; (2008–2010). The late 2000s and early 2010s also saw a major resurgence in traditional-style sitcoms filmed in front of a studio audience and featuring a laughter track, such as &quot;Not Going Out&quot; (2006–), written by Lee Mack, &quot;Miranda&quot; (2009–2015), &quot;Reggie Perrin&quot; (2009–2010), a remake of the 1970s series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; and Irish sitcom &quot;Mrs Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot; (2011–). The most successful BBC sitcom of the time was &quot;My Family&quot; (2000–2011), which came 24th in the Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom poll in 2004 and was the most watched sitcom in the United Kingdom in 2008.

Other sitcoms in the new millennium included &quot;Outnumbered&quot; (2007–2016), &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps&quot; (2001–2011), about a group of young people sharing a flat in Runcorn, and &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; (2006–2013), about IT colleagues.

===&quot;The Royle Family&quot;===
Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash wrote the 25 episodes of &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2012) for the BBC. It centred on the lives of a television-fixated working-class family, the Royles, a stereotype of family life at the turn of the century, sharing elements of kitchen sink drama. &quot;The Royle Family&quot; was placed 31st in the BFI&#x27;s 2000 list of the 100 greatest British television programmes. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Jim Royle, the misanthropic head of the household, was ranked 11th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In a 2004 BBC poll to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, &quot;The Royle Family&quot; was placed 19th. The series also won several BAFTA awards.

===&quot;Doc Martin&quot;===
Like &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot; in the 1990s, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; (2004–2022), is a dramedy series. It stars Martin Clunes as Dr. Martin Ellingham, the general practitioner of a Cornish village, and Caroline Catz. Created by Dominic Minghella and written and produced by Philippa Braithwaite, it was filmed on location in the village of Port Isaac, with most interior scenes shot in a converted local barn. In 2004, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; won the British Comedy Award for &quot;Best TV Comedy Drama&quot;, having also been nominated as &quot;Best New TV Comedy&quot;. As of 2022 a total of 79 episodes have aired. The tenth (and final) series aired from 7 September 2022 to 26 October 2022; one last installment, a Christmas special that aired on 25 December 2022, was the programme&#x27;s final episode.

===&quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;===
Running for 32 episodes over four series and three Christmas specials &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; (2005 and 2009) was a spin-off from &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, produced for the BBC and created and initially written by John Sullivan, who also wrote the theme music. It starred John Challis, Sue Holderness and Jack Doolan from &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. It also featured several guest stars including Paula Wilcox (&quot;Man About the House&quot;), American actor George Wendt and Dame June Whitfield (&quot;Happy Ever After&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;).

===&quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;===
James Corden and Ruth Jones wrote the 20 episodes of &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; produced by Baby Cow Productions (2007–2010) for BBC Cymru Wales over three series which were directed by Christine Gernonmover. It centres on two families, one in Billericay, Essex and the other in Barry, South Wales. Mathew Horne and Joanna Page played Gavin and Stacey and the writers played their best friends Smithy and Nessa. Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb played Gavin&#x27;s parents Pam and Mick, Melanie Walters played Stacey&#x27;s mother Gwen and Rob Brydon played her uncle Bryn. Broadcast on Christmas Day 2009 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2010, Christmas Day 2019, and Christmas Day 2024, episodes of the final series formed a significant part of the prime-time BBC seasonal programming. Acclaimed as both a hit and a breakthrough show for the BBC, it was the most nominated show in the 2007 British Comedy Awards. It won several awards, including the BAFTAs Audience Award, and the British Comedy Awards Best TV Comedy Award, both in 2008. In 2019, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; was named the 17th-greatest British sitcom in a poll by &quot;Radio Times&quot;. 18.49 million people watched the Christmas Day 2019 special, the most-viewed non-sporting event in a decade and the most-watched comedy episode for 17 years, and the 2024 finale with 12.3 million TV viewers was the most watched show on Christmas Day since 2008. After one week&#x27;s consolidated viewing the finale episode had become the UK&#x27;s most-watched scripted show since modern records began with 19.3 million viewers.

===&quot;Benidorm&quot;===
Written and created by Derren Litten and produced by Tiger Aspect for ITV, &quot;Benidorm&quot; (2007–2018) aired for 74 episodes over ten series.

Tony Maudsley and many guest stars. The first series proved to be a hit for ITV, with critics describing it as &quot;beautifully written and performed&quot; and &quot;a gem of wry observation in withering bad taste&quot;.

==Since 2010==
The censoring of repeats, especially where the watershed, the time after which adult programming is allowed to be broadcast, is being eroded by on demand viewing and OTT technology. The standard solution is to provide a warning to viewers of real-time transmissions that the programme contains language which some viewers may find offensive.

Other recent British sitcoms include &quot;Brassic&quot; (2019–present), &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; (2015–2017), &quot;Friday Night Dinner&quot; (2011–2020), &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2012–2014), &quot;Cuckoo&quot; (2012–2019), &quot;Fleabag&quot; (2016–2019) and &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Car Share&quot; (2015–2018).

===&quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;===
The sequel to &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; (2013–2019), was created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. 41 episodes were broadcast. It starred David Jason, supported by James Baxter and a regular supporting cast including Lynda Baron,
Stephanie Cole, Maggie Ollerenshaw, Brigit Forsyth, Johnny Vegas, Kulvinder Ghir, Geoffrey Whitehead, Sally Lindsay, Tim Healy, Sue Holderness, Dean Smith, Archie Panjabi and Nina Wadia, with Baron, Cole, and Ollerenshaw reprising their original characters from &quot;Open All Hours&quot;.
Directed by Dewi Humphreys, and produced by Jason, Alex Walsh-Taylor Sarah Hitchcock, and Gareth Edwards, the series continued the theme of &quot;Open All Hours&quot; while focusing on the life of a much older Granville, running his late uncle Arkwright&#x27;s traditional English corner shop with his son&#x27;s help.

===&quot;Breeders&quot;===
The British-American parental black comedy television series &quot;Breeders&quot; (2020–present), was created by Martin Freeman, Chris Addison and Simon Blackwell. The series follows two parents who struggle with parenthood and is partially based on Freeman&#x27;s own experiences. Freeman also plays the lead role. The series premiered on 2 March 2020, on the American cable network FX, and on the British network Sky One on 12 March 2020.

==Writers, directors and producers==
===Barry Took===
Barry Took came to TV comedy following his hugely successful half-hour radio sketch comedies such as &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (1958 - 1964) and its successor &quot;Round the Horne&quot; 1965 - 1968 and paved the way for the format of many television sitcoms. Took, with writing partner Marty Feldman with whom he collaborated for over ten years in radio and television, created the early sitcoms &quot;The Army Game&quot; in 1958 starring Alfie Bass (&quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;) and Bill Fraser ( &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;) and later wrote its sequel &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; (1960) of which 100 episodes were made, pioneering TV comedy with one of its most enduring features, &#x27;the ill-sorted pair&#x27;.
The team&#x27;s first BBC series was &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; (1965), starring Warren Mitchell and Ronnie Barker. He became Head of Light Entertainment for London Weekend Television and he launched several shows, including the successful &quot;On the Buses&quot;, and was instrumental in launching the team that became &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

===Roy Clarke===
Royston Clarke (born 28 January 1930), usually known as Roy Clarke, began his career 
In the late 1960s writing thrillers for BBC Radio. Clarke is a prolific television drama creator who wrote sixteen of Britain&#x27;s best known sitcoms. In 2002, he received an OBE for his contribution to British comedy. He was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the 2010 British Comedy Awards. He is also the 1996 winner of the BAFTA Dennis Potter Award, the 2010 British Comedy Awards winner, and the 1971 Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain
Best Writer award. Clarke was the sole writer of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, which at its peak had an audience of over 18 million viewers and is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world. Among his well known works are &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; and its sequel series, &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;.

===David Croft===
David Croft (1922–2011) was a screenwriter, producer and director. He produced and wrote a string of BBC sitcoms with partners Jimmy Perry and Jeremy Lloyd, including &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; and &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;. Like Perry, he served in tropical Asia during the Second World War. While &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was still running, Croft began to co-write &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; with Jeremy Lloyd. He continued both writing partnerships for the rest of his career in other series including &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord&quot; with Perry and &quot;″Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; with Lloyd. His last full series, &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot; (1995–1997), was co-written with Richard Spendlove. He created a television pilot in 2007, entitled &quot;Here Comes The Queen&quot;, with Jeremy Lloyd, but the show was not continued as a series. Together with Perry, Croft was presented with a British Comedy Award in 2003 for lifetime achievement, and in 1978 OBE for services to television. He also received the 1981 &quot;Desmond Davies Award&quot; from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for his contributions to the industry.

===Jimmy Perry===
Jimmy Perry (1923–2016) created &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; with David Croft. The song he wrote for the series, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?&quot;, won him an Ivor Novello Award. Croft and Perry wrote together for over 30 years. Along with Frank Muir and Denis Norden, and Galton and Simpson, they were among the dominant writing teams of the period. Perry could send himself up as well as others. His autobiography was to be called &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Own Story&quot;, but it came out in 2002 under the title &quot;A Stupid Boy&quot;.
 In &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, he drew on his experience as a young member of the Home Guard, on his service in India and Burma during the war for &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, and his time as a Butlin&#x27;s holiday camp Redcoat for &quot;Hi-de-Hi&quot;, for which he wrote the song &quot;Holiday Rock&quot;. When he said he wanted to be a film star or a comedian, his father responded: &quot;You stupid boy!&quot; Perry used the phrase in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and it became a catch phrase.
 Perry effectively retired after &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; finished. He was awarded an OBE in 1978. He won Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Writer&#x27;s Guild (1995) and at the British Comedy Awards (2003).

===Galton and Simpson===
Ray Galton and Alan Simpson (1930–2018 and 1929–2017) wrote together for over 50 years; their most famous series were &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;. Some of their scripts for Hancock almost repudiated a narrative structure altogether and attempted to reproduce an everyday environment with the intention of also reproducing its comedy. Both the character played by Tony Hancock in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, and Harold Steptoe, played by Harry H. Corbett, were pretentious would-be intellectuals who found themselves trapped by the squalor of their lives. The Galton and Simpson comedies were often characterised by a bleak and somewhat fatalistic tone. &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in particular was at times an example of black comedy, and close in tone to Social realism drama.

===Chesney and Wolfe===
Chesney and Wolfe was a prolific comedy scriptwriting team of Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe whose partnership contributed significantly to the genre of British sitcoms. Spanning the years from the mid-1950s to 1989, among their best shows are &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; starring Dame Barbara Windsor (&quot;Carry On&quot; films) with Dame Penelope Keith (&quot;The Good Life&quot; and &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;), who also starred again together in &quot;Wild, Wild Women&quot; with an all-star cast and Anna Karen who later starred in Chesney and Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;On the Buses&quot;. These were workplace shows with sexist and humorously indecent comedy that obtained very high viewer ratings but were not well received by TV critics. Their other credits include &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;, an episode of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; (1989), and &quot;Watch This Space&quot; in 1980 which was less of a success. Their shows featured many of the regular actors from award-winning comedy shows and films and including among many others, DameThora Hird - a household name and a British institution, Ian Lavender (&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;), Reg Varney (&quot;On the Buses&quot;), Sheila Hancock (&quot;Mr Digby Darling&quot;), Prunella Scales (&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;), Peter Jones (actor), Their 1971 spin-off film, &quot;On the Buses&quot;, the first of the three based on the TV series, was the highest British box-office earner of that year.

===Jeremy Lloyd===
Jeremy Lloyd (1930–2014) co-wrote &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and &quot;″Allo ″Allo!&quot;; his sitcoms have been called &quot;the essence of Britishness&quot;. &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; was based partly on his own experiences of working in a London department store as a suit salesman. Its success gave rise a spin-off, &quot;Grace and Favour&quot;, which was a collaboration with David Croft.
During 1970 Lloyd was briefly married to actress, presenter and producer Joanna Lumley (&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;) with whom he starred in the sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Awfully Bad for Your Eyes, Darling&quot;. Lloyd was appointed an OBE in 2013.

===John Howard Davies===
John Howard Davies (1939–2011) joined the BBC as a production assistant in 1966, and became a television director and producer specializing in comedy. In 1978 he became the head of comedy, and in 1982 the head of light entertainment. For four decades, he was a major influence as commissioning producer on shows such as &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; by John Cleese and Connie Booth, Galton and Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Steptoe and Son,&quot; &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;, &quot;The Goodies&quot;, and &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;. Davies was also the producer of all four seasons of &quot;The Good Life&quot;. When asked what the best formula for a sitcom is, he replied &quot;All the best sitcom characters are relentlessly horrible.&quot;

=== Cooke and Mortimer ===
Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer were a comedy writing duo whose career began in radio with the critically acclaimed &quot;Round the Horne&quot; of 1968, and its sequel &quot;Stop Messing About&quot; created as a vehicle for Kenneth Williams of Carry On fame. Together they penned many of the 1970s popular TV sitcoms often featuring well known comedy actors such as Paul Eddington of &quot;The Good Life&quot; and &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, Patrick Cargill (&quot;Father, Dear Father&quot;); Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, Yootha Joyce, and Brian Murphy of &quot;Man About the House &quot;; Peter Butterworth (Carry On), Peter Jones, Beryl Reid, Roy Kinnear, Joan Sanderson. Independently, Cooke created &quot;Tripper&#x27;s Day&quot; featuring Leonard Rossiter of &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; and Eric Chappell&#x27;s highly successful &quot;Rising Damp&quot;. On his own, Mortimer wrote &quot;Never the Twain&quot; starring Donald Sinden (&quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;) and Windsor Davies (&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;).

==Composers==

===Burt Rhodes (1923–2003)===
Rhodes wrote the title music for &quot;The Good Life&quot;. He was a successful light entertainment composer and musical director including his arrangements for comedienne Beryl Reid&#x27;s 1968-67 &quot;Beryl Reid Says Good Evening&quot;. He collaborated with many stars including Judy Garland, Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis Jr., Vic Damone and Bruce Forsyth. Rhodes was often referred to as &quot;the musicians&#x27; musician&quot;, counting musicians such as Ronnie Hazlehurst, Monty Norman and Phil Phillips among his friends. In 1958 he scored the theme for &quot;Dr No&quot;, the first James Bond film.

===Ronnie Hazlehurst (1928–2007)===
A prolific composer for sitcoms, comedy productions, game shows and other programmes, Hazlehurst joined the BBC in 1961, and became a staff arranger; his early works included the incidental music for &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; and &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;. In 1968 he became the Light Entertainment Musical Director and composed the theme tunes of many sitcoms, including &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (where he also wrote all the instrumental music for the show), &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know You Cared&quot;, &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;, &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; and &quot;Three Up, Two Down&quot;. He also arranged the themes for &quot;Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Sorry!&quot; and the first series of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.
His theme tunes often included elements designed to fit the programmes, such as a cash till in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, rises and falls in &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; and the Big Ben chimes for &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. For &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, Hazlehurst used Morse code to spell out the programme&#x27;s title. During his career he composed the music for the opening of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1976 Olympics. Jon Plowman, Head of BBC Comedy, said, &quot;He was the composer of many of the best-loved signature tunes of the last 40 years of television - and some of his work is still heard today. He&#x27;s associated with some of the best-loved shows of our lives.&quot;

===Tony Russell (1929–1970)===
Russell wrote the music for &quot;On the Buses&quot; and the children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Herbs&quot;. He studied composition with Richard Rodney Bennett and Bill Russo. He was in Russo&#x27;s London Jazz Orchestra and took over running this when Russo returned to the United States in 1965. He later became a busy composer and wrote the score of the musical &quot;The Matchgirls&quot;.

===Nick Ingman (born 1948)===
The title music for &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; was written by Nick Ingman, a visiting professor at the London College of Music. His collaborators include Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Björk, and &quot;The X Factor&quot;. His arrangements have accounted for fourteen No. 1 singles and five double platinum albums in the UK and he has been nominated for a Grammy three times.

===Simon Brint (1950-2011)===
Brint was closely associated with the Alternative Comedy movement and contributed music to several associated projects including the sitcoms Absolutely Fabulous and &quot;2point4 Children.&quot;

===Anne Dudley (born 1956)===
Dudley composed the title and incidental music for &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;. She is a composer, keyboardist, conductor and pop musician, winning many awards including an Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score for the comedy film &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. Dudley was the first BBC Concert Orchestra&#x27;s Composer in Association in 2001, and has composed the scores for over twenty other films.

===Peter Brewis===
Brewis has music credits for several comedy programmes including the sitcoms &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and &quot;Filthy, Rich and Catflap&quot;.

===Howard Goodall (born 1958)===
The title themes for &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; are among Howard Goodall&#x27;s most memorable melodies. He also presents music-based programmes on television and radio, for which he has won many awards. In 2008, he was named as a presenter and Composer-in-Residence at the British radio station Classic FM. In 2009, he was named &quot;Composer of the Year&quot; at the Classic Brit Awards.

===Jonathan Whitehead (1960-2020)===
An composer for many sitcoms and other comedies, Whitehead&#x27;s sitcom credits include &quot;Black Books&quot;, &quot;Green Wing&quot;, &quot;Campus&quot;, &quot;Nathan Barley&quot; and &quot;Rev.&quot; His music for &quot;Green Wing&quot; was nominated for a BAFTA and won the RTS Award for Best Original Music. He occasionally wrote under the name &quot;Trellis&quot;.
== Film spin-offs ==

By 2020, at least 45 British sitcoms had been adapted into over 50 feature films; the first of the three &quot;On the Buses&quot; films was the biggest hit at the British box office in 1971. However, they were not always critical successes. In a review of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, Michael Stailey of &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; regarded the 1977 film as &quot;guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.&quot; John Pym of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; also gave the film a negative review, stating that &quot;The humour consists mainly of a withering selection of patent British puns; an inflatable brassiere, some let&#x27;s-insult-the-Germans jokes and a rickety thunder-box which bolts from the outside are thrown in for good measure.&quot; The film holds a 58% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the cutoff for a positive rating is 59%. Moreover, as with the series they were based on, some films have been criticised for not meeting contemporary levels of political correctness.

Other sitcom adaptions from the era included
&quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (1960), based on &quot;Whack-O!&quot;,
&quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (1968) and its sequel &quot;The Alf Garnett Saga&quot; (1972),
&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1971),
&quot;On the Buses&quot; (1971) and its sequels,
&quot;Please Sir!&quot; (1971),
&quot;Bless This House&quot; (1972),
&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1972) and its sequel,
&quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot; (1972),
&quot;Father, Dear Father&quot; (1973),
&quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; (1973),
&quot;Man About the House&quot; (1974),
&quot;The Likely Lads&quot; (1976),
&quot;Porridge&quot; (1979), and
&quot;George and Mildred&quot; (1980).

==Criticism and social issues==
British sitcoms reflect changes in public opinion and culture through the times. They began at a time in which, for example, &quot;class and ethnic prejudices were challenged and mocked&quot;. They heavily featured slapstick humour and offensive slurs. Series such as &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; (1972–76), and &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; (1977–79, 1986), which attempted to find humour in racial or ethnic conflict and misunderstandings, have been increasingly criticised over time. Johnny Speight, the creator of &quot;In Sickness and In Health&quot;, defended its depiction of the central character Alf Garnett, saying: &quot;If you do the character correctly, he just typifies what you hear - not only in pubs but in golf clubs around the country. To make him truthful he&#x27;s got to say those things, and they are nasty things. But I feel as a writer that they should be out in the open so we can see how daft these comparisons are.&quot;

The contemporary &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; has also been criticised for racism, homophobia, and whitewashing its cast. The writer, Jimmy Perry, defended it saying those elements were true to life. Meanwhile, &quot;Whack-O!&quot;, a 1960s series set in a private school, has been described as &quot;a little painful&quot; to watch today for its depictions of caning. Even &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, considered one of the best sitcoms of all time, has been criticised for its cruelty.

==Research==
In 2005, a group of scientists led by Dr. Helen Pilcher was commissioned by the satellite channel UKTV Gold to study 20 years of British sitcoms. Using the medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; as a control, the team came up with a formula for measuring the success or failure of sitcoms. This formula assessed the recognisability of the main character and their delusions of grandeur, the wittiness of the script, the physical injuries the cast suffer and their differences in social statues, and the success of any plans. There was a maximum score of 1120, and &quot;Casualty&quot; scored 5.5. The top shows and their scores were &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (which scored 696), &quot;The Office&quot; (678), &quot;Father Ted&quot; (564), &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (557), and &quot;Blackadder&quot; (374.5).

The very worst sitcoms were:
* &quot;Eyes Down&quot; (2003–2004), starring Paul O&#x27;Grady and Sheridan Smith, which scored 96. 
* &quot;According to Bex&quot; (2005), with Jessica Stevenson, and written by Katie Douglas, Julia Barron and Fred Barron. Critical reception to this show was negative, with &quot;The Stage&quot; calling it &quot;the biggest sitcom disaster of the year&quot; and the &quot;British Comedy Guide&quot; describing it as &quot;dull and predictable&quot;. Despite reports that a second series had been planned, the show was cancelled after the first series due to low ratings. Stevenson considered the series so bad that she quit her agent. It scored 67.
* &quot;Sam&#x27;s Game&quot; (2001), starring TV presenter Davina McCall and comedian Ed Byrne. Written by Byrne and uncredited contributors, it ran for only six episodes. It scored 22.
* &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; (1998–1999), a flat-share comedy created and written by Geoff Deane. &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;very shoddy&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to British Cult Comedy&quot; called it &quot;hackneyed&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was highly critical of Claire King&#x27;s guest appearance. In an overview of ITV programmes, columnist Stuart Heritage of &quot;The Guardian&quot; named &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; as one of the worst shows in the network&#x27;s history. He described &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; as &quot;a show where some babes live in St John&#x27;s Wood and literally nothing else happens&quot;. It scored 8.
* &quot;&#x27;Orrible&quot; (2001), written by and starring Johnny Vaughan, and lasting only for 8 episodes, came last with a score of 6.5.

== British sitcoms overseas ==
=== United States ===
British sitcoms are often seen on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), usually thanks to the effort of WGBH, and increasingly on cable television, including BBC America and Comedy Central. &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; and &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; became sleeper hits when they aired on PBS, while &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; enjoyed a significant following when it aired on Comedy Central and &quot;The Office&quot; won a Golden Globe award in 2004 for &quot;Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy&quot;, surpassing American series such as &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

Several British sitcoms have been successfully remade for the American market. Notable examples include &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; which became &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, which became &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and &quot;The Office&quot; which was remade into an American series of the same name. &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, a remake of &quot;Man About the House&quot;, had its own spinoffs: &quot;The Ropers&quot;, based on &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, based on &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Other American remakes of British sitcoms include &quot;What a Country!&quot;, based on &quot;Mind Your Language&quot;. More recently, shows such as &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot; was adapted into an American version, as was &quot;The Thick of It&quot; as &quot;Veep&quot;. A large number of US adaptations end up being cancelled early or are not commissioned after their pilots are created. Another notable difference, which can be both positive or negative depending upon the skill of the cast and writers, is the American media culture of 20 or more episodes in a season, as opposed to the British tendency to have fewer than 10 episodes per series.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia, many British comedy series are aired on the ABC, which is the Australian equivalent of the BBC. British shows are also sometimes shown on the three commercial television networks in Australia, especially Seven Network during the 1970s. In New Zealand, state-run TVNZ also broadcasts many British series. The majority of British comedies now air in both countries on the subscription channels The Comedy Channel and UKTV.

Australian commercial television channels made their own versions of British comedies during the 1970s, often using members of the original casts. These included: &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Father, Dear Father&quot;, &quot;Doctor Down Under&quot;, &quot;Love Thy Neighbour in Australia&quot;. In both countries, locally produced sitcoms have historically been heavily influenced by the structure of British sitcoms, such as in the New Zealand sitcom &quot;Gliding On&quot;.

=== India ===
In the 1980s, India&#x27;s national broadcaster Doordarshan showed &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Mind Your Language&quot;.

<text>Peter William Phipps (born 5 August 1951) is a rock drummer, singer and songwriter known for his work with Gary Glitter, the Glitter Band, and later Eurythmics, XTC and Denim. He is currently a member of both the Glitter Band and Mud.

== Biography ==
Phipps was a founder member of the Glitter Band (originally known as The Glittermen), who started as Gary Glitter&#x27;s backing band, and went on to success in their own right, having six top ten singles in the UK in the mid-1970s. He was later a member of the band Random Hold, who toured with XTC in 1979, leading to him playing the majority of the drums on the XTC album &quot;Mummer&quot; (1983) after Terry Chambers left the band, and he returned for the recording of their next studio album &quot;The Big Express&quot; (1984). He also played drums for Eurythmics, joining the band for their MTV-broadcast performance at the Heaven nightclub in London, and playing live with the band into 1984. He was also a member of Lawrence&#x27;s post-Felt band Denim, which has been described as &quot;self-consciously ironic glitter-pop revivalist project&quot;, playing on the 1992 album &quot;Back in Denim&quot; and the 1996 album &quot;Denim on Ice&quot;. Phipps was also the drummer on Liquid Gold&#x27;s hits which included &quot;Dance Yourself Dizzy&quot;.

== Musical biography ==
After learning to play drums, piano and guitar, his musical career took off at the age of 18, he has worked continuously since that time for a wide range of bands and artists. After leaving school in 1969 he joined Black Velvet, a soul/funk band – tours, recording and radio shows. A year later, he toured with the the Elgins. Then in 1971, he joined CBS band Heaven and supported Jeff Beck on tour in the UK and Germany.

In June 1972, he began working for Gary Glitter&#x27;s backing band the Glittermen and, in the same month, they made their first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot;.
The Glittermen were renamed the Glitter Band and established a separate identity consisting of a six-member lineup Gerry Shephard (lead guitar/lead vocals), John Springate (bass/lead vocals), Pete Phipps (drums and keyboards), Tony Leonard (drums), John Rossall (trombone) Harvey Ellison (saxophone). Tours with Gary Glitter continued.

In December 1975, their third studio album &quot;Listen to the Band&quot;, saw Phipps for the first time on lead vocals on the self-penned &quot;My First Mistake&quot;. In 1977, their fourth studio album, &quot;Paris Match&quot; was recorded in France, plus an extended play (EP) featuring &quot;She Was Alright&quot; (written by Phipps) as the A-side.

Changing direction, Phipps first joined Ex-Directory a jazz rock band where he first met Vic Martin (who would later, with Phipps, join Eurythmics); this was then followed by a short period with a London based punk rock band called the Secret. Phipps was then asked to join Random Hold, a band he had already worked with a year or two before. Random Hold consisted of David Rhodes, Bill MacCormick, David Ferguson, and Pete Phipps were described by a music journalist as &quot;disco orientated rock&quot;, and by Nina Myskow in &quot;The Sun&quot; as a band to watch for as &quot;Their music shows talent, menace, originality and brains. A dynamic combination&quot;. The band produced several singles in this period including &quot;Montgomery Clift&quot; and albums &quot;The View from Here&quot; (1980) and &quot;Burn the Buildings&quot; (1981). Phipps also continued to record with Glitter Band colleagues pursuing solo identities, such as with John Springate recording an album together in Springate&#x27;s own Rock Star Studio and playing drums on the 1979 studio album &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot;, by Gerry Shephard and Peter Oxendale.

In 1982, Phipps was invited by Mike Rutherford of Genesis to play on his final solo studio album &quot;Acting Very Strange&quot;, and later in the same year was invited by XTC to record with them on their studio album, &quot;Mummer&quot;.

Through 1983 and 1984 he was a member of Eurythmics. His first outing with Eurythmics was recorded at Heaven for MTV and later released as the video &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1985). He toured in the US and in the UK. Also in 1984, Phipps returned to work with XTC in the studio to record the album &quot;The Big Express&quot;.

In 1985, Phipps recorded with the Stranglers&#x27; Hugh Cornwell playing on the single &quot;One in a Million&quot;. He then rejoined Gary Glitter for UK, Middle East and US tours. He also restarted Glitter Band gigs, joining with some of the other original members, and has remained part of the Glitter Band with a number of different line-ups to the present day.

In 1986, Phipps performed on &quot;Zipper&quot; an album written by Roger Chapman. In 1987 he toured as a replacement in Culture Club in France and Iceland. The next year, Phipps played with the Legendary Purple Helmets a Stranglers offshoot. Between 1992 and 1996, whilst remaining in the Glitter Band, Phipps joined Denim, a band formed by Lawrence. He recorded &quot;Back in Denim&quot; (1992 and &quot;Denim on Ice&quot; (1996). Through 1998 and 1999, Phipps had further shows with the Glitter Band and appearances with the King Penguins, a spin-off from the Glitter Band. 

The year 2000 saw the founding of Santanarama, a six-piece tribute to Carlos Santana, and Glitz Blitz, a three-piece tribute to the 1970s. Early in 2001, along with shows with the Glitter Band, Santanarama and Glitz Blitz at a range of venues nationwide, Phipps made a return to playing some R&amp;B with a South East-based band Desperate Measures. Later in the year, he recorded an album of material with Alan Merrill of the Arrows which was released the following year.

In August 2020, he released his first solo album of original songs entitled &quot;Wherever You Are&quot;. The album was recorded in Metway Studios, Brighton and produced by Mike Wilton and engineered by Jake Routham.

Phipps currently performs worldwide as the Glitter Band playing a variety of venues up and down the UK and on the Continent, and has also been a member of Mud since 2015. He has recorded with:
* Gary Glitter
* The Glitter Band
* XTC
* Mike Rutherford
* Hugh Cornwell
* Roger Chapman
* Alan Merrill
* Random Hold
* Liquid Gold
* Kahimi Karie
* Eurythmics

<doc id="44618" wikidata="Q1854615" url="?curid=44618" title="Port Salut">
<text>Port Salut is a semi-soft pasteurised cow&#x27;s milk cheese from Pays de la Loire, France, with a distinctive orange rind and a mild flavour. The cheese is produced in wheels approximately 23 cm (9 inches) in diameter, weighing approximately .

Though Port Salut has a mild flavour, it sometimes has a strong smell because it is a mature cheese. The smell increases the longer the cheese is kept; this does not affect its flavour. It can be refrigerated and is best eaten within two weeks of opening.

The cheese was developed by Trappist monks during the 19th century at Port-du-Salut Abbey in Entrammes. The monks, many of whom had left France during the French Revolution of 1789, learned cheese-making skills to support themselves abroad, and brought those skills back upon their return after the Bourbon Restoration. The name of their society, &quot;Société Anonyme des Fermiers Réunis&quot; (S.A.F.R.), later became their registered trademark, and is still printed on the wheels of Port Salut cheese.

In 1873, the head of the abbey came to an agreement with a Parisian cheese-seller granting exclusive rights of distribution, and purchases of the cheese soon began to increase. The abbey sought trade protection, and eventually, sold the rights to the Bel Group in 1950. The cheese is now produced in a factory, with the characteristic smooth rind now the result of a plastic-coated wrapper. When made of wax the rind may be edible, but can detract from the flavour of the cheese.

Handmade Port Salut cheese or &quot;Entrammes&quot; cheese is still produced by various monasteries throughout the French countryside.

<doc id="44621" wikidata="Q173063" url="?curid=44621" title="Castile (historical region)">
<text>Castile or Castille (; ) is a territory of imprecise limits located in Spain. The use of the concept of Castile relies on the assimilation (via a metonymy) of a 19th-century determinist geographical notion, that of Castile as Spain&#x27;s (&quot;tableland core&quot;, connected to the Meseta Central) with a long-gone historical entity of diachronically variable territorial extension (the Kingdom of Castile).

The proposals advocating for a particular semantic codification/closure of the concept (a &quot;dialogical&quot; construct) are connected to essentialist arguments relying on the reification of something that does not exist beyond the social action of those building Castile not only by identifying with it as a homeland of any kind, but also &quot;in opposition&quot; to it. A hot topic concerning the concept of Castile is its relation with Spain, insofar intellectuals, politicians, writers, or historians have either endorsed, nuanced or rejected the idea of the &quot;maternity&quot; of Spain by Castile, thereby permeating non-scholar discourses about Castile.

Castile&#x27;s name is generally thought to derive from &quot;land of castles&quot; (&quot;castle&quot; in Spanish is &quot;castillo&quot;) in reference to the castles built in the area to consolidate the Christian Reconquest from the Moors.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; ascribes the concept to the sum of the regions of Old Castile and New Castile, as they were formally defined in the 1833 territorial division of Spain.

==History==
Originally an eastern county of the kingdom of León, in the 11th century, Castile became an independent realm with its capital at Burgos. The County of Castile, which originally included most of Burgos and parts of Vizcaya, Álava, Cantabria and La Rioja, became the leading force in the northern Christian states&#x27; 800-year Reconquista (&quot;reconquest&quot;) of central and southern Spain from the Moorish rulers who had dominated most of the peninsula since the early 8th century.

The capture of Toledo in 1085 added New Castile to the crown&#x27;s territories, and the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) heralded the Moors&#x27; loss of most of southern Spain. The kingdom of León was integrated in the Crown of Castile in 1230, and the following decades saw the capture of Córdoba (1236), Murcia (1243) and Seville (1248). By the Treaty of Alcaçovas with Portugal on March 6, 1460, the ownership of the Canary Islands was transferred to Castile.

The dynastic union of Castile and Aragon in 1469, when Ferdinand II of Aragon wed Isabella I of Castile, would eventually lead to the formal creation of Spain as a single entity in 1516 when their grandson Charles V assumed both thrones. See List of Spanish monarchs and Kings of Spain family tree. The Muslim Kingdom of Granada (roughly encompassing the modern day provinces of Granada, Malaga and Almeria) was conquered in 1492, formally passing to the Crown of Castile in that year.

==Geography==

Since it lacks official recognition, Castile does not have clearly defined borders. Historically, the area consisted of the Kingdom of Castile. After the kingdom merged with its neighbours to become the Crown of Castile and later the Kingdom of Spain, when it united with the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre, the definition of what constituted &quot;Castile&quot; gradually began to change. Its historical capital was Burgos. In modern Spain, it is generally considered to comprise Castile and León and Castile–La Mancha, with Madrid as its centre. West Castile and León, Albacete, Cantabria and La Rioja are sometimes included in the definition (controversial for historical, political, and cultural reasons).

Since 1982 there have been two nominally Castilian autonomous communities in Spain, incorporating the toponym in their own official names: Castile and Leon and Castile-La Mancha. A third, the Community of Madrid is also regarded as part of Castile, by dint of its geographic enclosure within the entity and, above all, by the statements of its Statute of Autonomy, since its autonomic process originated in national interest and not in popular disaffection with Castile.

Other territories in the former Crown of Castile are left out for different reasons. The territory of the Castilian Crown actually comprised all other autonomous communities within Spain with the exception of Aragon, Balearic Islands, Valencia and Catalonia, all belonging to the former Crown of Aragon, and Navarre, offshoot of the older Kingdom of the same name. Castile was divided between Old Castile in the north, so called because it was where the Kingdom of Castile was founded, and New Castile, called the Kingdom of Toledo in the Middle Ages. The Leonese region, part of the Crown of Castile from 1230, was from medieval times considered a region in its own right on a par with the two Castiles, and appeared on maps alongside Old Castile until the two joined as one region - Castile and Leon - in the 1980s. In 1833, Spain was further subdivided into administrative provinces.

Two non-administrative, nominally &quot;Castilian&quot; regions existed from 1833 to 1982: Old Castile, including Santander (autonomous community of Cantabria since 1981), Burgos, Logroño (autonomous community of La Rioja since 1982), Palencia, Valladolid, Soria, Segovia and Ávila, and New Castile consisting of Madrid (autonomous community of Madrid since 1983), Guadalajara, Cuenca, Toledo and Ciudad Real.

==Language==
The language of Castile emerged as the primary language of Spain—known to many of its speakers as &quot;castellano&quot; and in English sometimes as Castilian, but generally as Spanish. See Names given to the Spanish language.
Historically, the Castilian Kingdom and people were considered to be the main architects of the Spanish State by a process of expansion to the South against the Moors and of marriages, wars, assimilation, and annexation of their smaller Eastern and Western neighbours. From the advent of the Bourbon Monarchy following the War of the Spanish Succession until the arrival of parliamentary democracy in 1977, the Castilian language was the only one with official status in the Spanish state.

<text>Homeland defense (HD) is the protection of a territory, sovereignty, domestic population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression. (Definition will be incorporated into JP 3-26 upon its approval).

Homeland security (HS) is a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks, reduce a nation&#x27;s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur.

==Full definition==
&quot;Homeland defense (HD) is the protection of a sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression, or other threats as directed
by the leader of that nation such as the President of the United States. The United States Department of Defense is partially responsible for the Homeland defense mission of the United States, and therefore leads the HD response, with other departments and agencies in support of DOD efforts.&quot;

==Threat strategy==
HD strategic threat environment is based on the following conditions and profiles:
*Diminished protection afforded by geographic distances
*Traditional threats remain
*Greater risk of a weapon of mass destruction attack
*Increased potential for miscalculation and surprise
*Increased potential for terrorist attacks
*Increased challenges from weak and failing states and non-state actors
*Increasing diversity in sources and unpredictability of the locations of conflict
*Threats to US vital interests overseas
*Increasing transnational.
Responses to the changes in any of the above can affect US&#x27;s international environment through the application of diplomatic, economic, military, and informational means. Thus, a proactive and comprehensive approach to HD is required for US&#x27;s response.

<doc id="44626" wikidata="Q3981155" url="?curid=44626" title="Tarocchini">
<text>Tarocchini (plural for &quot;tarocchino&quot;) are point trick-taking tarot card games popular in Bologna, capital city of the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy and has been confined mostly to this area. They are the diminutive form of &quot;tarocchi&quot; (plural for &quot;tarocco&quot;), referring to the reduction of the Bolognese pack from 78 to 62 cards, which probably occurred in the early 16th century.

The games of Tarocchini are very complex, yet the rules have changed little over the years.

==Deck description==
Tarocchini can be played with a 78-card Tarot deck (where the 2–5 pip cards in each suit have been removed), though normally, a special Tarot deck, the Tarocco Bolognese is used. The trump cards have a unique ordering where the second to fifth trumps are known collectively as the Moretti (Moors) and are of equal rank (the last one played is the highest, in regards to taking a trick). In the Tarocco Bolognese, these cards are depicted with four Moors, two of which are identical.

The Fool is not a trump, it can&#x27;t beat any cards and is played as an excuse from following suit. The Magician is the lowest trump. However, both the Fool and the Magician may be used as contatori (counters or wild cards) to assist in making sequences. The &quot;contatori&quot; are very valuable, because they can be used as wild cards in multiple locations. The four highest trumps, which are unnumbered, are Angel, World, Sun, and Moon and they are collectively known as grande (big). Angel, World, Magician, and the Fool are collectively known as tarocchi.

The &quot;grande&quot;, &quot;Moretti&quot;, and &quot;contatori&quot; are not numbered in the Tarocco Bolognese.

In the modern game, the cards won by each side are counted in pairs, with 1 being subtracted from the total for each pair. There are also six points for winning the final trick, giving a total of 93 points.
==Common rules==
In tarocchini, card points are not as important as bonus or meld points gained from combinations. Combinations can either be associative or sequential. Associative combinations or &quot;cricche&quot; (formerly as &quot;pariglie&quot;) consist of three or four of a kind sets.
 
There are four types of sequential combinations although two of them are more like associative combinations. Each sequence needs at least three cards for 10 points and every extra card is worth 5 points. What separates the sequences from the &quot;cricche&quot; is the use of the &quot;contatori&quot;. The &quot;contatori&quot; may not be used to substitute Angel or a King. For trumps, the sequence ends if the &quot;contatori&quot; are used consecutively with one exception: if the two cards replaced are trump 16 and a &quot;grande&quot;. 
Multiplicative bonuses occur when three or more cricche or three or more sequences are made at one time. This doubles the points.

==Variations==
===Ottocento===
Ottocento, is the most popular version. It is played by 4 players in two partnerships sitting opposite each other. The middle part of the game is very similar to the basic tarot game. It adds a round of point-counting before and after the game based on sets and runs of the cards. An unusual feature is that the partners are allowed to make certain limited signals to each other during play.

As usual for Tarot card games, dealing and card play are counter-clockwise. The dealer gives 15 cards to each player, in 3 rounds of five cards apiece. The dealer picks up the last two cards adding it to those in hand. The dealer has to discard two cards, which can not be &quot;5 point&quot; cards (such as kings, or the trumps worth 5 points). The discards are counted as points to the dealer&#x27;s side, unless they make no tricks at all during the card play in which case the discarded cards must be surrendered to the opponents.

After the first 5 cards have been dealt, if all players agree the game may &quot;andare a monte&quot;. If this happens, all the cards are thrown in, and the deal passes to the next player. Eldest hand speaks first, declaring a monte if wishing to restart the game. This continues with each player until it reaches the dealer. If all have declared a monte, then the game will be restarted.

The game consists of three parts. Just after the hand has been dealt, all players may score their hands according to the meld points contained within. Next, normal card play occurs. Finally, the partners score any meld points that they have in their captured tricks. The scoring of meld points after card play is unique to Tarocchini and Minchiate.

====Declarations====
After the cards have been dealt, each player may declare certain combinations of hand cards to collect meld points. The player does not have to declare anything, and may optionally declare a smaller set or run than actually held. Anything that is declared must be placed face-up on the table. The decision of what to declare is an interesting strategic choice.

====Game play====
Once the first declaration of points is finished, normal card play ensues. Note that some information has been disclosed by the declarations, so players will have more clues than usual as to the contents of the other players&#x27; hands. As in all tarocchi games, there is the rule that a player that can&#x27;t follow suit must trump if possible. If lacking trumps, then any card can be discarded. The Fool excuses the player from following suit: it is played to the trick instead of following suit, and then retrieved to its player&#x27;s pile of won tricks. The Fool&#x27;s player gives a low valued card to the trick&#x27;s winner (only if it is an opponent) at the end of the hand. If the Fool&#x27;s team failed to win any trick, the Fool is surrendered to the opponents but this is very rare. One of the most important strategies is to capture or protect the Begato as it is very useful in scoring. The last trick has a bonus of 6 points.

During play, eldest is permitted to make certain signals to his or her partner. The current game allows only three signals:
*Throwing up the card up which means &quot;I&#x27;m now void in this suit&quot;. Originally, the signal was opening a hand.
*Drawing back the card towards oneself means &quot;You should lead with trumps&quot;.
*Knocking the table with a fist means &quot;You should try to win with your highest card and lead the next trick with the same suit.&quot;

These are some of the formerly allowed signals:
*Saying &quot;sminchiate&quot; means &quot; Lead your highest trump&quot;
*Striking the centre of the table means &quot;I have the highest card of the suit (including trumps).&quot; 
*Striking the table&#x27;s edge means &quot;I have the second highest card...&quot;
*When on lead, drawing back the card slightly towards oneself before laying it down means &quot;Do not play your highest card of the suit in question&quot;.

====Scoring====
Once all tricks have been completed, the captured cards are examined for meld points. Combine these meld points with the meld points from declarations at the beginning of the hand. Next, count card points in pairs with one point subtracted from each pair. Then add the last trick bonus. After adding the meld points with the card points and last trick bonus, the first team to reach 800 wins. It is actually possible to win at the declarations if one team can reach 800 points. If both teams can do it, the team with the higher points win.

===Terziglio===
Terziglio is for three players and the only version to include bidding. Each player is dealt 18 or 19 cards with 8 or 5 going to the stock. During bidding, players can pass, bid &quot;gioco&quot;, or bid &quot;solo&quot; which is the highest bid. In &quot;gioco&quot;, the declarer can exchange cards with the stock but cannot discard 5-point cards. The stock counts towards the declarer if able to win at least one trick otherwise it is surrendered to their opponents. In &quot;solo&quot;, the declarer plays without exchanging with the stock which remains hidden and is awarded to the winner of the last trick. All other rules are the same as Ottocento but some players restrict signalling until the highest card of the trick&#x27;s suit has been played (Kings or the Angel).

====Scoring====
Each side adds up all their points as in Ottocento. The declarer must have more points than their opponents to win the hand, a tie is counted as a loss. The winning side&#x27;s points are rounded down to the nearest multiple of 50 (except if it fell short of a multiple of 50 by less than 5 points it will be rounded up). The score is then divided by 50 to arrive at the game points. If it was a &quot;solo&quot; game, the game points are doubled. Score calculation is unnecessary if one side won all the tricks; they are automatically awarded 40 game points.

<text>The Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815 was a series of international diplomatic meetings to discuss and agree upon a possible new layout of the European political and constitutional order after the downfall of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Participants were representatives of all European powers (other than the Ottoman Empire) and other stakeholders. The Congress was chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and was held in Vienna from September 1814 to June 1815.

The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars through negotiation. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries, but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace, being at the same time shepherds for the smaller powers. More generally, conservative leaders like Metternich also sought to restrain or eliminate republican, liberal, and revolutionary movements which, from their point of view, had upended the constitutional order of the European ancien régime.

At the negotiation table, the position of France was weak in relation to that of Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, partly due to the military strategy of its leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, over the previous two decades, and his recent defeat. In the settlement the parties did reach, France had to give up all recent conquests, while the other three main powers made major territorial gains around the world. Prussia added territory from smaller states: Swedish Pomerania, most of the Kingdom of Saxony, and the western part of the former Duchy of Warsaw. Austria gained much of northern Italy. Russia added the central and eastern parts of the Duchy of Warsaw. All agreed upon ratifying the creation of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands, which had been created just months before from the former Dutch Seven Provinces together with formerly Austrian territory, and was meant to serve as a buffer between the German Confederation and France.

The immediate background was Napoleonic France&#x27;s defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to 23 years of nearly continuous war. Remarkably, negotiations continued unaffected despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon&#x27;s return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March to July 1815. The Congress&#x27;s agreement was signed nine days before Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

Some historians have criticised the outcomes of the Congress for causing the subsequent suppression of national, democratic, and liberal movements, and it has been seen as a reactionary settlement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. Others have praised the Congress for protecting Europe from large and widespread wars for almost a century.

== The Congress format ==

The name &quot;Congress of Vienna&quot; was not meant to suggest a formal plenary session, but rather the creation of a diplomatic organizational framework bringing together stakeholders of all flocks to enable the expression of opinions, interests and sentiments and facilitate discussion of general issues among them. The Congress format had been developed by Austrian Foreign Minister Klemens von Metternich, assisted by Friedrich von Gentz, and was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives and other stakeholders came together in one city at the same time to discuss and formulate the conditions and provisions of treaties. Before the Congress of Vienna the common method of diplomacy involved the exchange of notes sent back and forth among the several capitals and separate talks in different places, a cumbersome process that required much in the way of time and transportation. The format set at the Congress of Vienna would serve as inspiration for the 1856 peace conference brokered by France (the Congress of Paris) that settled the Crimean War. The Congress of Vienna settlement gave birth to the Concert of Europe, an international political doctrine that emphasized the maintaining of political boundaries, the balance of powers, and respecting spheres of influence and which guided foreign policy among the nations of Europe until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

To reach amiable consensus among the many different nations holding great interest in the settlement proceedings, informal, face-to-face deliberative sessions were held where opinions and proposed solutions could be inventoried. The policy work on which the Concert of Europe was built on came about through closed-doors dealing among the five Great Powers – Austria, Britain, Russia, Prussia and France. The first four of the five dominant peacemakers held sway simply because they brought to the table &quot;negotiating power&quot; that came of hard-won victory in the Napoleonic Wars; France enjoyed her advantageous position largely through the brilliant diplomatic maneuvering by senior statesman Talleyrand. Lesser powers, like Spain, Sweden, and Portugal, were given few opportunities to advocate their interests and only occasionally partook in the meetings held between the great powers. However, because all representatives were gathered in one city it was relatively easy to communicate, to hear and spread news and gossip, and to present points of view for both powerful and less powerful nations. Also of great importance to the parties convened in Vienna were the opportunities presented at wine and dinner functions to establish formal relationships with one another and build-up diplomatic networks.

== Preliminaries ==
The Treaty of Chaumont in 1814 had reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and that would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna. They included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The Treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance that formed the balance of power for decades.

Other partial settlements had already occurred at the Treaty of Paris between France and the Sixth Coalition, and the Treaty of Kiel that covered issues raised regarding Scandinavia. The Treaty of Paris had determined that a &quot;general congress&quot; should be held in Vienna and that invitations would be issued to &quot;all the Powers engaged on either side in the present war&quot;. The opening was scheduled for July 1814.

== Participants ==

The Congress functioned through formal meetings such as working groups and official diplomatic functions; however, a large portion of the Congress was conducted informally at salons, banquets, and balls.

=== The four great powers and Bourbon France ===
Four great powers had previously formed the core of the Sixth Coalition, a covenant of nations allied in the war against France. On the verge of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat they had outlined their common position in the Treaty of Chaumont (March 1814), and negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1814) with the Bourbons during their restoration:
* Austria was represented by Prince von Metternich, the Foreign Minister, and by his deputy, Baron Johann von Wessenberg. The Austrians sought to maintain the balance of power, while protecting the interests of the Conservative nations and rebuilding Austria&#x27;s position diplomatically in Germany and Italy. As the Congress&#x27;s sessions were in Vienna, Emperor Francis was kept closely informed.
* The United Kingdom was represented first by its Foreign Secretary, Viscount Castlereagh; then by the Duke of Wellington, after Castlereagh&#x27;s return to England in February 1815. The United Kingdom wanted to prevent the return of France as a superpower (and stop Russia from attaining that status). It also sought to promote the balance of power by protecting the rights of smaller nations. In the last weeks it was headed by the Earl of Clancarty, after Wellington left to face Napoleon during the Hundred Days.
* Tsar Alexander I controlled the Russian delegation which was formally led by the foreign minister, Count Karl Robert Nesselrode. The tsar had two main goals, to gain control of Poland and to promote the peaceful coexistence of European nations, with Russia as the pre-eminent land power. He succeeded in forming the Holy Alliance (1815), based on monarchism and anti-secularism, and formed to combat any threat of revolution or republicanism.
* Prussia was represented by Prince Karl August von Hardenberg, the Chancellor, and the diplomat and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt. The Prussians wanted to strengthen their position in Germany, particularly by annexing all of Saxony and parts of the Ruhr. King Frederick William III of Prussia was also in Vienna, playing his role behind the scenes.
* France, the &quot;fifth&quot; power, was represented by its foreign minister, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, 1st Duke of Benevento, as well as the Minister Plenipotentiary, Emmerich Joseph de Dalberg, 1st Duke of Dalberg. Talleyrand had already negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1814) for Louis XVIII of France. He sought to ensure that France rejoined the group of Great Powers, and avoided being dismembered by the occupying powers. Louis XVIII, however, distrusted him and was also secretly negotiating with Metternich, by mail.

=== The lesser powers, parties to the Treaty of Paris, 1814 ===
These parties had not been part of the Chaumont agreement, but had joined the Treaty of Paris (1814):
* Spain – &quot;Don&quot; Pedro Gómez de Labrador, 1st Marquess of Labrador
* Portugal – Plenipotentiaries: Pedro de Sousa Holstein, Count of Palmela; António de Saldanha da Gama, Count of Porto Santo; Joaquim Lobo da Silveira.
* Sweden – Count Carl Löwenhielm

=== Other nations ===

* Denmark – Count Niels Rosenkrantz, foreign minister. King Frederick VI was also present in Vienna.
* Netherlands – Earl of Clancarty, the British Ambassador at the Dutch court, and Baron Hans von Gagern
* Switzerland – Every canton had its own delegation. Charles Pictet de Rochemont from Geneva played a prominent role.
* Kingdom of Sardinia – Marquis .
* The Papal States – Ercole Cardinal Consalvi, Secretary of State of His Holiness
* The Order of St. John of Malta – Fra&#x27; Antonio Miari, Fra&#x27; Daniello Berlinghieri and Fra&#x27; Augusto Viè de Cesarini
* Republic of Genoa – Marquise Agostino Pareto, Senator of the Republic.
* Grand Duchy of Tuscany – .
* Kingdom of Sicily – Alvaro Ruffo della Scaletta, Luigi de&#x27; Medici di Ottajano, Antonio Maresca di Serracapriola and Fabrizio Ruffo di Castelcicala
* On German issues:
** Bavaria – Maximilian Graf von Montgelas
** Württemberg – 
** Hanover, then in a personal union with the British crown – Graf Ernst zu Münster. (King George III had refused to recognize the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and maintained a separate diplomatic staff as Elector of Hanover to conduct the affairs of the family estate, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, until the results of the Congress were concluded establishing the Kingdom of Hanover.)
** Mecklenburg-Schwerin – 

== Other stakeholders, entertaining side program ==
Virtually every state in Europe had a delegation in Vienna – more than 200 states and princely houses were represented at the Congress. In addition, there were representatives of cities, corporations, religious organizations (for instance, abbeys) and special interest groups – e.g., a delegation representing German publishers, demanding a copyright law and freedom of the press. With them came a host of courtiers, secretaries, civil servants and ladies to enjoy the magnificent social life of the Austrian court. The Congress was noted for its lavish entertainment: according to a famous joke of an attendee, it danced a lot but did not move forward. On the other hand, the possibilities for informal gatherings created by this &quot;side program&quot; may have helped ensure the Congress&#x27;s success.

== Diplomatic tactics ==
=== Talleyrand (France) ===

Initially, the representatives of the four victorious powers hoped to exclude the French from serious participation in the negotiations, but Talleyrand skillfully managed to insert himself into &quot;her inner councils&quot; in the first weeks of negotiations. He allied himself to a Committee of Eight lesser powers (including Spain, Sweden, and Portugal) to control the negotiations. Once Talleyrand was able to use this committee to make himself a part of the inner negotiations, he then left it, once again abandoning his allies.

The major Allies&#x27; indecision on how to conduct their affairs without provoking a united protest from the lesser powers led to the calling of a preliminary conference on the protocol, to which Talleyrand and the Marquess of Labrador, Spain&#x27;s representative, were invited on 30 September 1814.

Congress Secretary Friedrich von Gentz reported, &quot;The intervention of Talleyrand and Labrador has hopelessly upset all our plans. Talleyrand protested against the procedure we have adopted and soundly [be]rated us for two hours. It was a scene I shall never forget.&quot; The embarrassed representatives of the Allies replied that the document concerning the protocol they had arranged actually meant nothing. &quot;If it means so little, why did you sign it?&quot; snapped Labrador.

Talleyrand&#x27;s policy, directed as much by national as personal ambitions, demanded the close but by no means amicable relationship he had with Labrador, whom Talleyrand regarded with disdain. Labrador later remarked of Talleyrand: &quot;that cripple, unfortunately, is going to Vienna.&quot; Talleyrand skirted additional articles suggested by Labrador: he had no intention of handing over the 12,000 &quot;afrancesados&quot; – Spanish fugitives, sympathetic to France, who had sworn fealty to Joseph Bonaparte, nor the bulk of the documents, paintings, pieces of fine art, and books that had been looted from the archives, palaces, churches and cathedrals of Spain.

=== Polish-Saxon questions ===
The most complex topic at the Congress was the Polish-Saxon Crisis. Russia wanted most of Poland, and Prussia wanted all of Saxony, whose king had allied with Napoleon. The tsar would like to become king of Poland. Austria analysed, this could make Russia too powerful, a view which was supported by Britain. The result was a deadlock, for which Talleyrand proposed a solution: admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain. The three nations signed a treaty on 3 January 1815, among only the three of them, agreeing to go to war against Russia and Prussia, if necessary, to prevent the Russo-Prussian plan from coming to fruition.

When the Tsar heard of the treaty he agreed to a compromise that satisfied all parties on 24 October 1815. Russia received most of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw as a &quot;Kingdom of Poland&quot; – called Congress Poland, with the tsar as a king ruling it independently of Russia. However, the majority of Greater Poland and Kuyavia, as well as the Chełmno Land, were given to Prussia and mostly included within the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (Poznań), while Kraków became a free city as a shared protectorate of Austria, Prussia and Russia. Furthermore, the tsar was forbidden from uniting his new realm with the parts of Poland that had been incorporated into Russia in the 1790s. Prussia received 60 percent of Saxony, much of which became part of the new Province of Saxony from 1816 (the now-Prussian parts of Lower Lusatia and some other areas instead became part of the Province of Brandenburg, with Prussian Upper Lusatia becoming part of the Province of Silesia by 1825); the remainder of Saxony returned to King Frederick Augustus I as his Kingdom of Saxony.

=== Subsidies ===
It can be learned from the diaries of the master of affairs Von Gentz that diplomatic tactics possibly included bribing. He notes that at the Congress he received £22,000 through Talleyrand from Louis XVIII, while Castlereagh gave him £600, accompanied by &quot;&quot; (&quot;the wildest promises&quot;); his diary is full of such entries.

== Final agreement ==


The Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (nine days before the Battle of Waterloo). Its provisions included:
* Russia received most of the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and retained Finland (which it had annexed from Sweden in 1809 and would hold until 1917, as the Grand Duchy of Finland).
* Prussia received three-fifths of Saxony, western parts of the Duchy of Warsaw (most of which became part of the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen), Gdańsk (Danzig), the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (merger of the former French departments of Rhin-et-Moselle, Sarre, and Roer (Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, itself a merger of the former Prussian Guelders, Principality of Moers, and the Grand Duchy of Berg).
* A German Confederation of 39 states, under the presidency of the Austrian Emperor, formed from the previous 300 states of the Holy Roman Empire. Only portions of the territories of Austria and Prussia were included in the Confederation (roughly the same portions that had been within the Holy Roman Empire).
* The Netherlands and the Southern Netherlands (approximately modern-day Belgium) became a united monarchy, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the House of Orange-Nassau providing the king (the Eight Articles of London).
* To compensate for Orange-Nassau&#x27;s loss of the Nassau lands to Prussia, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were to form a personal union under the House of Orange-Nassau, with Luxembourg (but not the Netherlands) inside the German Confederation.
* Swedish Pomerania, given to Denmark in January 1814 in return for the Kingdom of Norway was sold to Prussia. France received back Guadeloupe from Sweden, with yearly installments payable to the Swedish king.
* The neutrality of the 22 cantons of Switzerland was guaranteed and a federal pact was recommended to them in strong terms. Bienne and the Prince-Bishopric of Basel became part of the Canton of Bern. The Congress also suggested a number of compromises for resolving territorial disputes between cantons.
* The former Electorate of Hanover was expanded to a kingdom. It gave up the Duchy of Lauenburg to the Kingdom of Denmark, but gained former territories of the Bishop of Münster and formerly Prussian East Frisia.
* Most of the territorial gains of Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Nassau under the mediatizations of 1801–1806 were recognized. Bavaria also gained control of the Rhenish Palatinate and of parts of the Napoleonic Duchy of Würzburg and Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. Hesse-Darmstadt, in exchange for giving up the Duchy of Westphalia to Prussia, received Rhenish Hesse with its capital at Mainz.
* Austria regained control of the Tyrol and Salzburg; of the former Illyrian Provinces; of Tarnopol district (from Russia); and received Lombardy–Venetia in Italy and Ragusa in Dalmatia. Former Austrian territory in Southwest Germany remained under the control of Württemberg and Baden; the Austrian Netherlands were also not recovered.
* Ferdinand III was restored as Grand Duke of Tuscany.
* Archduke Francis IV was acknowledged as the ruler of the Duchy of Modena, Reggio and Mirandola;
* Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este was restored as Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara, and the Imperial fiefs in Lunigiana, which were not re-established, were also bestowed upon her.
* The Papal States under the rule of the Pope were restored to their former extent, with the exception of Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin, which remained part of France.
* Britain retained control of the Cape Colony in Southern Africa; Tobago; Ceylon; and various other colonies in Africa and Asia. Other colonies, most notably the Dutch East Indies and Martinique, reverted to their previous overlords.
* The King of Sardinia, re-established in Piedmont, Nice, and Savoy, gained control of Genoa (putting an end to the brief proclamation of a restored Republic of Genoa).
* The Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla were taken from the House of Bourbon-Parma and given to Marie Louise of Austria for her lifetime.
* The Duchy of Lucca was established temporarily as compensation for the House of Bourbon-Parma, (with reversionary rights to Parma after the death of Marie Louise, which were attributed through a in 1817, also stipulating that, from the same date, the Duchy of Lucca would in turn be annexed by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, as already provided in the Final Act).
* The slave trade was condemned.
* Freedom of navigation was guaranteed for many rivers, notably the Rhine and the Danube.

Representatives of Austria, France, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Sweden-Norway, and Britain signed the Final Act. Spain did not sign, but ratified the outcome in 1817.

Subsequently, Ferdinand IV, the Bourbon King of Sicily, regained control of the Kingdom of Naples after Joachim Murat, the king installed by Bonaparte, supported Napoleon in the Hundred Days and started the 1815 Neapolitan War by attacking Austria.

== Other changes ==

 The Congress&#x27;s principal results, apart from its confirmation of France&#x27;s loss of the territories annexed between 1795 and 1810, which had already been settled by the Treaty of Paris, were the enlargement of Russia, (which gained most of the Duchy of Warsaw) and Prussia, which acquired the district of Poznań, Swedish Pomerania, Westphalia and the northern Rhineland. The consolidation of Germany from the nearly 300 states of the Holy Roman Empire (dissolved in 1806) into a much less complex system of thirty-nine states (4 of which were free cities) was confirmed. These states formed a loose German Confederation under the leadership of Austria.

Representatives at the Congress agreed to numerous other territorial changes. By the Treaty of Kiel, Norway had been ceded by the king of Denmark-Norway to the king of Sweden. This sparked the nationalist movement which led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Norway on 17 May 1814 and the subsequent personal Union with Sweden. Austria gained Lombardy–Venetia in Northern Italy, while much of the rest of North-Central Italy went to Habsburg dynasties (the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Modena, and the Duchy of Parma).

The Papal States were restored to the Pope. The Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored to its mainland possessions, and also gained control of the Republic of Genoa. In Southern Italy, Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, was originally allowed to retain his Kingdom of Naples, but his support of Napoleon in the Hundred Days led to the restoration of the Bourbon Ferdinand IV to the throne.

A large United Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed for the Prince of Orange, including both the old United Provinces and the formerly Austrian-ruled territories in the Southern Netherlands, which gave way to the formation of a democratic state, formally headed by a constitutional monarch. Other, less important, territorial adjustments included significant territorial gains for the German Kingdoms of Hanover (which gained East Frisia from Prussia and various other territories in Northwest Germany) and Bavaria (which gained the Rhenish Palatinate and territories in Franconia). The Duchy of Lauenburg was transferred from Hanover to Denmark, and Prussia annexed Swedish Pomerania. Switzerland was enlarged, and Swiss neutrality was established. Swiss mercenaries had played a significant role in European wars for several hundred years: the Congress intended to put a stop to these activities permanently.

During the wars, Portugal had lost its town of Olivenza to Spain and moved to have it restored. Portugal is historically Britain&#x27;s oldest ally, and with British support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of Olivenza decreed in of the General Treaty of the Final Act, which stated that &quot;The Powers, recognizing the justice of the claims of ... Portugal and the Brazils, upon the town of Olivenza, and the other territories ceded to Spain by the Treaty of Badajoz of 1801&quot;. Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign, and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than to stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivenza and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and, to the present day, this issue remains unresolved.

The United Kingdom received parts of the West Indies at the expense of the Netherlands and Spain and kept the former Dutch colonies of Ceylon and the Cape Colony as well as Malta and Heligoland. Under the Treaty of Paris (1814) France ceded to Britain the islands of &quot;Tobago and Saint Lucia, and of the Isle of France and its dependencies, especially Rodrigues and Les Seychelles&quot;, and under the (signed in Paris on 5 November 1815), as one of the treaties signed during the Peace of Paris (1815), Britain obtained a protectorate over the United States of the Ionian Islands.

== Later criticism and praise ==

The Congress of Vienna has been criticized by 19th century and more recent historians and politicians for ignoring national and liberal impulses, and for imposing a stifling reaction on the Continent. It was an integral part in what became known as the Conservative Order, in which democracy and civil rights associated with the American and French Revolutions were de-emphasized.

In the 20th century, however, historians and politicians looking backward came to praise the Congress as well, because they saw it did prevent another widespread European war for nearly 100 years (1815–1914) and a significant step in the transition to a new international order in which peace was largely maintained through diplomatic dialogue. Among these is Henry Kissinger, who in 1954 wrote his doctoral dissertation, &quot;A World Restored&quot;, on it and Paul Schroeder. Historian and jurist Mark Jarrett argues that the diplomatic congress format marked &quot;the true beginning of our modern era&quot;. To his analyses the Congress organisation was deliberate conflict management and was the first genuine attempt to create an international order based upon consensus rather than conflict. &quot;Europe was ready,&quot; Jarrett states, &quot;to accept an unprecedented degree of international cooperation in response to the French Revolution.&quot; Historian Paul Schroeder argues that the old formulae for &quot;balance of power&quot; were in fact highly destabilizing and predatory. He says the Congress of Vienna avoided them and instead set up rules that produced a stable and benign equilibrium. The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the Concert of Europe, which was an attempt to forge a peaceful balance of power in Europe. It served as a model for later organizations such as the League of Nations in 1919 and the United Nations in 1945.

Before the opening of the Paris peace conference of 1918, the British Foreign Office commissioned a history of the Congress of Vienna to serve as an example to its own delegates of how to achieve an equally successful peace. Besides, the main decisions of the Congress were made by the Four Great Powers and not all the countries of Europe could extend their rights at the Congress. The Italian peninsula became a mere &quot;geographical expression&quot; as divided into seven parts: Lombardy–Venetia, Modena, Naples–Sicily, Parma, Piedmont–Sardinia, Tuscany, and the Papal States under the control of different powers. Poland remained partitioned between Russia, Prussia and Austria, with the largest part, the newly created Kingdom of Poland, remaining under Russian control.

The arrangements made by the Four Great Powers sought to ensure future disputes would be settled in a manner that would avoid the terrible wars of the previous 20 years. Although the Congress of Vienna preserved the balance of power in Europe, it could not check the spread of revolutionary movements across the continent some 30 years later.

Some authors have suggested that the Congress of Vienna may provide a model for settling multiple interlocking conflicts in Eastern Europe that arose after the break-up of the Soviet Union.

<doc id="44629" wikidata="Q102532" url="?curid=44629" title="Diphthong">
<text>A diphthong ( ; , ), also known as a gliding vowel or a vowel glide, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In most varieties of English, the phrase &quot;no highway cowboy&quot; ( ) has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable.

Diphthongs contrast with monophthongs, where the tongue or other speech organs do not move and the syllable contains only a single vowel sound. For instance, in English, the word &quot;ah&quot; is spoken as a monophthong (), while the word &quot;ow&quot; is spoken as a diphthong in most varieties (). Where two adjacent vowel sounds occur in different syllables (e.g. in the English word &quot;re-elect&quot;) the result is described as hiatus, not as a diphthong.

Diphthongs often form when separate vowels are run together in rapid speech during a conversation. However, there are also unitary diphthongs, as in the English examples above, which are heard by listeners as single-vowel sounds (phonemes).

==Transcription==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), monophthongs are transcribed with one symbol, as in English &quot;sun&quot; , in which represents a monophthong. Diphthongs are transcribed with two symbols, as in English &quot;high&quot; or &quot;cow&quot; , in which and represent diphthongs.

Diphthongs may be transcribed with two vowel symbols or with a vowel symbol and a semivowel symbol. In the words above, the less prominent member of the diphthong can be represented with the symbols for the palatal approximant and the labiovelar approximant , with the symbols for the close vowels and , or the symbols for the near-close vowels and :

Some transcriptions are broader or narrower (less precise or more precise phonetically) than others. Transcribing the English diphthongs in &quot;high&quot; and &quot;cow&quot; as or is a less precise or broader transcription, since these diphthongs usually end in a vowel sound that is more open than the semivowels or the close vowels . Transcribing the diphthongs as is a more precise or narrower transcription, since the English diphthongs usually end in the near-close vowels .

The non-syllabic diacritic, the inverted breve below , is placed under the less prominent part of a diphthong to show that it is part of a diphthong rather than a vowel in a separate syllable: . When there is no contrastive vowel sequence in the language, the diacritic may be omitted. Other common indications that the two sounds are not separate vowels are a superscript, , or a tie bar, or . The tie bar can be useful when it is not clear which symbol represents the syllable nucleus, or when they have equal weight. Superscripts are especially used when an on- or off-glide is particularly fleeting.

The period is the opposite of the non-syllabic diacritic: it represents a syllable break. If two vowels next to each other belong to two different syllables (hiatus), meaning that they do not form a diphthong, they can be transcribed with two vowel symbols with a period in between. Thus, &quot;lower&quot; can be transcribed , with a period separating the first syllable, , from the second syllable, .

The non-syllabic diacritic is used only when necessary. It is typically omitted when there is no ambiguity, as in . No words in English have the vowel sequences , so the non-syllabic diacritic is unnecessary.

==Types==

===Falling and rising===
Falling (or descending) diphthongs start with a vowel quality of higher prominence (higher pitch or volume) and end in a semivowel with less prominence, like in &quot;eye&quot;, while rising (or ascending) diphthongs begin with a less prominent semivowel and end with a more prominent full vowel, similar to the in &quot;yard&quot;. (Sometimes, however, the terms &quot;falling&quot; and &quot;rising&quot; are used, instead, to refer to vowel height, i.e. as synonyms of the terms &quot;closing&quot; and &quot;opening&quot;. See below.) The less prominent component in the diphthong may also be transcribed as an approximant, thus in &quot;eye&quot; and in &quot;yard&quot;. However, when the diphthong is analysed as a single phoneme, both elements are often transcribed with vowel symbols (, ). Semivowels and approximants are not equivalent in all treatments, and in the English and Italian languages, among others, many phoneticians do not consider rising combinations to be diphthongs, but rather sequences of approximant and vowel. There are many languages (such as Romanian) that contrast one or more rising diphthongs with similar sequences of a glide and a vowel in their phonetic inventory (see semivowel for examples).

===Closing, opening, and centering===
In closing diphthongs, the second element is more close than the first (e.g. ); in opening diphthongs, the second element is more open (e.g. ). Closing diphthongs tend to be falling (), and opening diphthongs are generally rising (), as open vowels are more sonorous and therefore tend to be more prominent. However, exceptions to this rule are not rare in the world&#x27;s languages. In Finnish, for instance, the opening diphthongs and are true falling diphthongs, since they begin louder and with higher pitch and fall in prominence during the diphthong.

A third, rare type of diphthong that is neither opening nor closing is height-harmonic diphthongs, with both elements at the same vowel height. These may have occurred in Old English:
* &quot;beorht&quot; &quot;bright&quot;
* &quot;ċeald&quot; &quot;cold&quot;

A centering diphthong is one that begins with a more peripheral vowel and ends with a more central one, such as , , and in Received Pronunciation or and in Irish. Many centering diphthongs are also opening diphthongs (, ).

Diphthongs may contrast in how far they open or close. For example, Samoan contrasts low-to-mid with low-to-high diphthongs:
* &quot;&#x27;ai&quot; &#x27;probably&#x27;
* &quot;&#x27;ae&quot; &#x27;but&#x27;
* &quot;&#x27;auro&quot; &#x27;gold&#x27;
* &quot;ao&quot; &#x27;a cloud&#x27;

===Narrow and wide===
Narrow diphthongs are the ones that end with a vowel which on a vowel chart is quite close to the one that begins the diphthong, for example Northern Dutch , and . Wide diphthongs are the opposite – they require a greater tongue movement, and their offsets are farther away from their starting points on the vowel chart. Examples of wide diphthongs are RP/GA English and .

===Length===
Languages differ in the length of diphthongs, measured in terms of morae. In languages with phonemically short and long vowels, diphthongs typically behave like long vowels, and are pronounced with a similar length. In languages with only one phonemic length for pure vowels, however, diphthongs may behave like pure vowels. For example, in Icelandic, both monophthongs and diphthongs are pronounced long before single consonants and short before most consonant clusters.

Some languages contrast short and long diphthongs. In some languages, such as Old English, these behave like short and long vowels, occupying one and two morae, respectively. Languages that contrast three quantities in diphthongs are extremely rare, but not unheard of; Northern Sami is known to contrast long, short and &quot;finally stressed&quot; diphthongs, the last of which are distinguished by a longer second element.

==Phonology==
In some languages, diphthongs are single phonemes, while in others they are analyzed as sequences of two vowels, or of a vowel and a semivowel.

==Sound changes==
Certain sound changes relate to diphthongs and monophthongs. Vowel breaking or diphthongization is a vowel shift in which a monophthong becomes a diphthong. Monophthongization or smoothing is a vowel shift in which a diphthong becomes a monophthong.

==Difference from semivowels and vowel sequences==

While there are a number of similarities, diphthongs are not the same phonologically as a combination of a vowel and an approximant or glide. Most importantly, diphthongs are fully contained in the syllable nucleus while a semivowel or glide is restricted to the syllable boundaries (either the onset or the coda). This often manifests itself phonetically by a greater degree of constriction, but the phonetic distinction is not always clear. The English word &quot;yes&quot;, for example, consists of a palatal glide followed by a monophthong rather than a rising diphthong. In addition, the segmental elements must be different in diphthongs and so when it occurs in a language, it does not contrast with . However, it is possible for languages to contrast and .

Diphthongs are also distinct from sequences of simple vowels. The Bunaq language of Timor, for example, distinguishes &#x27;exit&#x27; from &#x27;be amused&#x27;, &#x27;dance&#x27; from &#x27;stare at&#x27;, and &#x27;choice&#x27; from &#x27;good&#x27;.

Some languages or dialects also articulate the component sounds of a diphthong differently than when those sounds are produced in hiatus. For example, due to English diphthong raising, many North American English speakers pronounce with closer vowels than , and, among a subset of those, the diphthong may be similarly raised as compared to .

==Examples==

===Indo-European languages===

====English====
In words coming from Middle English, most cases of the Modern English diphthongs originate from the Middle English long monophthongs through the Great Vowel Shift, although some cases of originate from the Middle English diphthongs .


====Dutch====

The dialect of Hamont (in Limburg) has five centring diphthongs and contrasts long and short forms of , , , and .

====Afrikaans====
The Afrikaans language has its origin in Dutch but differs in many significant ways, including the use of diphthongs in the place of several non-diphthong Dutch double vowels, or double-vowels being pronounced differently.
Examples include:
*&quot;ee&quot; as in leer
*&quot;eu&quot; as in deur
*&quot;ui&quot; as in buite

* Falling diphthongs. Their first element may be short or somewhat lengthened .
* Rising diphthongs . These variants do not seem to appear word-finally. The sequence is commonly realised as or, more often, , with realised as breathy
* The scholar Daan Wissing argues that is not a phonetically correct transcription and that is more accurate. In his analysis, he found that makes for 65% of the realisations, the other 35% being monophthongal, , and .
* Most often, has an unrounded offset. For some speakers, the onset is also unrounded. That can cause to merge with , which is considered non-standard.
* occur mainly in loanwords.
* Older sources describe as a narrow back diphthong . However, newer sources describe its onset as more front. For example, , states that the onset of is central .
** In some words which, in English, are pronounced with , the Afrikaans equivalent tends to be pronounced with , rather than . That happens because Afrikaans is more similar to the usual South African realization of English .

The long diphthongs (or &#x27;double vowels&#x27;) are phonemically sequences of a free vowel and a non-syllabic equivalent of or : . Both and tend to be pronounced as , but they are spelled differently: the former as , the latter as .

In diminutives ending in formed to monosyllabic nouns, the vowels are realised as closing diphthongs . In the same environment, the sequences are realized as , i.e. as closing diphthongs followed by palatal nasal.

* The suffixes and (phonemically and , respectively) and the diminutive suffix are realised as (with a monophthong), rather than .
* In practice, the diphthong is realised the same as the phonemic diphthong .
* , when it has arisen from diphthongisation of , differs from the phonemic diphthong by having a slightly different onset, although the exact nature of that difference is unclear. This means that &#x27;point&#x27; sounds somewhat different from &#x27;rubble&#x27;.

====German====

=====Standard German=====
Phonemic diphthongs in German:
* as in &#x27;egg&#x27;
* as in &#x27;mouse&#x27;
* as in &#x27;new&#x27;

In the varieties of German that vocalize the in the syllable coda, other diphthongal combinations may occur. These are only phonetic diphthongs, not phonemic diphthongs, since the vocalic pronunciation alternates with consonantal pronunciations of if a vowel follows, cf. &#x27;you hear&#x27; – &#x27;I hear&#x27;. These phonetic diphthongs may be as follows:


: notes that the length contrast is not very stable before non-prevocalic and that &quot;, following the pronouncing dictionaries (, ) judge the vowel in , , to be long, while the vowel in , , is supposed to be short. The factual basis of this presumed distinction seems very questionable.&quot; He goes on stating that in his own dialect, there is no length difference in these words, and that judgements on vowel length in front of non-prevocalic which is itself vocalized are problematic, in particular if precedes.

:According to the &#x27;lengthless&#x27; analysis, the aforementioned &#x27;long&#x27; diphthongs are analyzed as , , , , , , and . This makes non-prevocalic and homophonous as or . Non-prevocalic and may also merge, but the vowel chart in shows that they have somewhat different starting points.

: also states that &quot;laxing of the vowel is predicted to take place in shortened vowels; it does indeed seem to go hand in hand with the vowel shortening in many cases.&quot;

=====Bernese German=====
The diphthongs of some German dialects differ from standard German diphthongs. The Bernese German diphthongs, for instance, correspond rather to the Middle High German diphthongs than to standard German diphthongs:
* as in &quot;lieb&quot; &#x27;dear&#x27;
* as in &quot;guet&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;
* as in &quot;müed&quot; &#x27;tired&#x27;
* as in &quot;Bei&quot; &#x27;leg&#x27;
* as in &quot;Boum&quot; &#x27;tree&#x27;
* as in &quot;Böim&quot; &#x27;trees&#x27;

Apart from these phonemic diphthongs, Bernese German has numerous phonetic diphthongs due to L-vocalization in the syllable coda, for instance the following ones:

==== Yiddish ====
Yiddish has three diphthongs:
* as in פּליטה (&#x27;refugee&#x27; f.)
* as in נײַן (&#x27;nine&#x27;)
* as in אופֿן (&#x27;way&#x27;)

Diphthongs may reach a higher target position (towards ) in situations of coarticulatory phenomena or when words with such vowels are being emphasized.

====Norwegian====
There are five diphthongs in the Oslo dialect of Norwegian, all of them falling:

* as in &quot;nei&quot;, &quot;no&quot;
* as in &quot;øy&quot;, &quot;island&quot;
* as in &quot;sau&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;
* as in &quot;hai&quot;, &quot;shark&quot;
* as in &quot;joik&quot;, &quot;Sami song&quot;

An additional diphthong, , occurs only in the word &quot;hui&quot; in the expression &quot;i hui og hast&quot; &quot;in great haste&quot;. The number and form of diphthongs vary between dialects.

====Faroese====

* as in , &quot;oh well&quot;
* as in , &quot;yes&quot;

====French====
In French, , , and may be considered true diphthongs (that is, fully contained in the syllable nucleus: ). Other sequences are considered part of a glide formation process that turns a high vowel into a semivowel (and part of the syllable onset) when followed by another vowel.

Diphthongs

=====Quebec French=====

In Quebec French, long vowels are generally diphthongized in informal speech when stressed.

* as in &quot;tard&quot; &quot;late&quot;
* as in &quot;père&quot; &quot;father&quot;
* as in &quot;fleur&quot; &quot;flower&quot;
* as in &quot;autre&quot; &quot;other&quot;

* as in &quot;banque&quot; &quot;bank&quot;
* as in &quot;mince&quot; &quot;thin&quot;
* as in &quot;bon&quot; &quot;well&quot;
* as in &quot;un&quot; &quot;one&quot;

====Catalan====
Catalan possesses a number of phonetic diphthongs, all of which begin (&quot;rising diphthongs&quot;) or end (&quot;falling diphthongs&quot;) in or .

In standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with or ) are possible only in the following contexts:
* in word initial position, e.g. &quot;iogurt&quot;.
* Both occur between vowels as in &quot;feia&quot; and &quot;veiem&quot;.
* In the sequences or and vowel, e.g. &quot;guant&quot;, &quot;quota&quot;, &quot;qüestió&quot;, &quot;pingüí&quot; (these exceptional cases even lead some scholars to hypothesize the existence of rare labiovelar phonemes and ).

There are also certain instances of &quot;compensatory diphthongization&quot; in the Majorcan dialect so that (&#x27;logs&#x27;) (in addition to deleting the palatal plosive) develops a compensating palatal glide and surfaces as (and contrasts with the unpluralized ). Diphthongization compensates for the loss of the palatal stop (part of Catalan&#x27;s segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization compensates for the loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in (&#x27;year&#x27;) vs (&#x27;years&#x27;). The dialectal distribution of this compensatory diphthongization is almost entirely dependent on the dorsal plosive (whether it is velar or palatal) and the extent of consonant assimilation (whether or not it is extended to palatals).

====Portuguese====

The Portuguese diphthongs are formed by the labio-velar approximant and palatal approximant with a vowel, European Portuguese has 14 phonemic diphthongs (10 oral and 4 nasal), all of which are falling diphthongs formed by a vowel and a nonsyllabic high vowel. Brazilian Portuguese has roughly the same amount, although the European and non-European dialects have slightly different pronunciations ( is a distinctive feature of some southern and central Portuguese dialects, especially that of Lisbon). A onglide after or and before all vowels as in &quot;quando&quot; (&#x27;when&#x27;) or &quot;guarda&quot; (&#x27;guard&#x27;) may also form rising diphthongs and triphthongs. Additionally, in casual speech, adjacent heterosyllabic vowels may combine into diphthongs and triphthongs or even sequences of them.
In addition, phonetic diphthongs are formed in most Brazilian Portuguese dialects by the vocalization of in the syllable coda with words like &quot;sol&quot; (&#x27;sun&#x27;) and &quot;sul&quot; (&#x27;south&#x27;) as well as by yodization of vowels preceding or its allophone at syllable coda in terms like &quot;arroz&quot; (&#x27;rice&#x27;), and (or ) in terms such as &quot;paz mundial&quot; (&#x27;world peace&#x27;) and &quot;dez anos&quot; (&#x27;ten years&#x27;).

====Spanish====
Phonetically, Spanish has seven falling diphthongs and eight rising diphthongs. In addition, during fast speech, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs wherein one becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in &quot;poeta&quot; (&#x27;poet&#x27;), &quot;almohada&quot; (&#x27;pillow&#x27;), &quot;maestro&quot; (&#x27;teacher&#x27;) and &quot;línea&quot; (&#x27;line&#x27;). The Spanish diphthongs are:
====Italian====
The existence of true diphthongs in Italian is debated; however, a list is:
The second table includes only &#x27;false&#x27; diphthongs, composed of a semivowel + a vowel, not two vowels. The situation is more nuanced in the first table: a word such as &#x27;baita&#x27; is actually pronounced [&#x27;baj.ta] and most speakers would syllabify it that way. A word such as &#x27;voi&#x27; would instead be pronounced and syllabified as [&#x27;vo.i], yet again without a diphthong.

In general, unstressed in hiatus can turn into glides in more rapid speech (e.g. &quot;biennale&quot; &#x27;biennial&#x27;; &quot;coalizione&quot; &#x27;coalition&#x27;) with the process occurring more readily in syllables further from stress.

====Romanian====

Romanian has two true diphthongs: and . There are, however, a host of other vowel combinations (more than any other major Romance language) which are classified as vowel glides. As a result of their origin (diphthongization of mid vowels under stress), the two true diphthongs appear only in stressed syllables and make morphological alternations with the mid vowels and . To native speakers, they sound very similar to and respectively. There are no perfect minimal pairs to contrast and , and because does not appear in the final syllable of a prosodic word, there are no monosyllabic words with ; exceptions might include &quot;voal&quot; (&#x27;veil&#x27;) and &quot;trotuar&quot; (&#x27;sidewalk&#x27;), though Ioana Chițoran argues that these are best treated as containing glide-vowel sequences rather than diphthongs. In addition to these, the semivowels and can be combined (either before, after, or both) with most vowels, while this arguably forms additional diphthongs and triphthongs, only and can follow an obstruent-liquid cluster such as in &quot;broască&quot; (&#x27;frog&#x27;) and &quot;dreagă&quot; (&#x27;to mend&#x27;), implying that and are restricted to the syllable boundary and therefore, strictly speaking, do not form diphthongs.

====Irish====
All Irish diphthongs are falling.
*, spelled &quot;aigh, aidh, agh, adh, eagh, eadh, eigh,&quot; or &quot;eidh&quot;
*, spelled &quot;abh, amh, eabh,&quot; or &quot;eamh&quot;
*, spelled &quot;ia, iai&quot;
*, spelled &quot;ua, uai&quot;

====Scottish Gaelic====
There are 9 diphthongs in Scottish Gaelic. Group 1 occur anywhere (&quot;eu&quot; is usually before &quot;-m&quot;, e.g. &quot;Seumas&quot;). Group 2 are reflexes that occur before &quot;-ll, -m, -nn, -bh, -dh, -gh&quot; and &quot;-mh&quot;.

For more detailed explanations of Gaelic diphthongs see Scottish Gaelic orthography.

====Cornish====
The following diphthongs are used in the Standard Written Form of Cornish. Each diphthong is given with its &quot;Revived Middle Cornish&quot; (RMC) and &quot;Revived Late Cornish&quot; (RLC) pronunciation.

====Welsh====
Welsh is traditionally divided into Northern and Southern dialects. In the north, some diphthongs may be short or long according to regular vowel length rules but in the south they are always short (see Welsh phonology). Southern dialects tend to simplify diphthongs in speech (e.g. is reduced to ).

:† The plural ending is reduced to in the north and in the south, e.g. &#x27;battles&#x27; is (north) or (south).

====Czech====
There are three diphthongs in Czech:

* as in &quot;auto&quot; (almost exclusively in words of foreign origin)
* as in &quot;euro&quot; (in words of foreign origin only)
* as in &quot;koule&quot;

The vowel groups &quot;ia, ie, ii, io&quot;, and &quot;iu&quot; in foreign words are not regarded as diphthongs, they are pronounced with between the vowels .

====Serbo-Croatian====
*, as in (in Ijekavian varieties)
may be pronounced as a diphthong, but also as in hiatus or separated by a semivowel, . For example, in the first line of the national anthem of Croatia, &quot;Lijepa naša domovina&quot;, &quot;ije&quot; is pronounced as a diphthong, but in the first line of the national anthem of Montenegro, &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot;, &quot;ije&quot; is pronounced as two syllables.

Some Serbo-Croatian dialects also have &quot;uo&quot;, as in whereas, in Standard Croatian and Serbian, these words are konj, rod, on.

===Uralic languages===

====Estonian====
All nine vowels can appear as the first component of an Estonian diphthong, but only occur as the second component.

There are additional diphthongs less commonly used, such as in Euroopa (Europe), in söandama (to dare), and in näuguma (to mew).

====Finnish====

All Finnish diphthongs are falling. Notably, Finnish has true opening diphthongs (e.g. ), which are not very common crosslinguistically compared to centering diphthongs (e.g. in English). Vowel combinations across syllables may in practice be pronounced as diphthongs, when an intervening consonant has elided, as in &quot;näön&quot; instead of for the genitive of &quot;näkö&quot; (&#x27;sight&#x27;).
; closing
* as in &quot;laiva&quot; (ship)
* as in &quot;keinu&quot; (swing)
* as in &quot;poika&quot; (boy)
* as in &quot;äiti&quot; (mother)
* as in &quot;öisin&quot; (at nights)
* as in &quot;lauha&quot; (mild)
* as in &quot;leuto&quot; (mild)
* as in &quot;koulu&quot; (school)
* as in &quot;leyhyä&quot; (to waft)
* as in &quot;täysi&quot; (full)
* as in &quot;löytää&quot; (to find)
; close
* as in &quot;uida&quot; (to swim)
* as in &quot;lyijy&quot; (lead)
* as in &quot;viulu&quot; (violin)
* as in &quot;siistiytyä&quot; (to smarten up)
; opening
* as in &quot;kieli&quot; (tongue)
* as in &quot;suo&quot; (bog)
* as in &quot;yö&quot; (night)

====Northern Sami====
The diphthong system in Northern Sami varies considerably from one dialect to another. The Western Finnmark dialects distinguish four different qualities of opening diphthongs:

* as in &quot;leat&quot; &quot;to be&quot;
* as in &quot;giella&quot; &quot;language&quot;
* as in &quot;boahtit&quot; &quot;to come&quot;
* as in &quot;vuodjat&quot; &quot;to swim&quot;

In terms of quantity, Northern Sami shows a three-way contrast between long, short and finally stressed diphthongs. The last are distinguished from long and short diphthongs by a markedly long and stressed second component. Diphthong quantity is not indicated in spelling. 

===Semitic languages===

====Maltese====
Maltese has seven falling diphthongs, though they may be considered VC sequences phonemically.

* &quot;ej&quot; or &quot;għi&quot;
* &quot;aj&quot; or &quot;għi&quot;
* &quot;oj&quot;
* &quot;iw&quot;
* &quot;ew&quot;
* &quot;aw&quot; or &quot;għu&quot;
* &quot;ow&quot; or &quot;għu&quot;

===Sino-Tibetan languages===

====Mandarin Chinese====
Rising sequences in Mandarin are usually regarded as a combination of a medial semivowel () plus a vowel, while falling sequences are regarded as one diphthong.

*ai: , as in &quot;ài&quot; (愛, love)
*ei: , as in &quot;lèi&quot; (累, tired)
*ao: , as in &quot;dào&quot; (道, way)

*
*
*
*

<doc id="44631" wikidata="Q14606226" url="?curid=44631" title="History of Portugal (1415–1578)">
<text>The history of the Kingdom of Portugal from the Illustrious Generation of the early 15th century to the fall of the House of Aviz in the late 16th century has been named the &quot;Portuguese golden age&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Século de Ouro&quot;; &quot;golden century&quot;) and the &quot;Portuguese Renaissance&quot;. During this period, Portugal was the first European power to begin building a colonial empire as during the Age of Exploration Portuguese sailors and explorers discovered an eastern route to India (that rounded the Cape of Good Hope) as well as several Atlantic archipelagos (like the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde) and colonized the African coast and Brazil. They also explored the Indian Ocean and established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia, sending the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to Ming China and to Japan, at the same time installing trading posts and the most important colony: Portuguese Macau (Only in East Asia). The Portuguese Renaissance produced a plethora of poets, historians, critics, theologians, and moralists. The by Garcia de Resende (printed 1516) is taken to mark the transition from Old Portuguese to the modern Portuguese language.

==John I==
John I of Portugal acceded in 1390 and ruled in peace, pursuing the economic development of his realm. The only significant military action was the siege and conquest of the city of Ceuta in 1415. By this step he aimed to control navigation of the African coast. But in the broader perspective, this was the first step opening the Arab world to medieval Europe, which in fact led to the Age of Discovery with Portuguese explorers sailing across the whole world.

Contemporaneous writers describe John as a man of wit, very keen on concentrating power on himself, but at the same time with a benevolent and kind personality. His love for knowledge and culture was passed to his sons, often collectively referred to by Portuguese historians as the &quot;illustrious generation&quot; (&quot;Ínclita Geração&quot;): Edward, the future king, was a poet and a writer; Peter, the Duke of Coimbra, was one of the most learned princes of his time; and Prince Henry the Navigator, the duke of Viseu, invested heavily in science and the development of nautical pursuits. 
In 1430, John&#x27;s only surviving daughter, Isabella, married Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and enjoyed an extremely refined court culture in his lands; she was the mother of Charles the Bold.

==Edward==
Under king Edward, the colony at Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury, and it was realised that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was worthless. In 1437, Duarte&#x27;s brothers Henry and Ferdinand persuaded him to launch an attack on the Marinid sultanate of Morocco. The expedition was not unanimously supported: Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra, and the Infante John were both against the initiative; they preferred to avoid conflict with the king of Morocco. Their instincts proved to be justified. The resulting attack on Tangier, led by Henry, was a debacle. Failing to take the city in a series of assaults, the Portuguese siege camp was soon itself surrounded and starved into submission by a Moroccan relief army. In the resulting treaty, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested. Duarte&#x27;s youngest brother, Ferdinand, was handed over to the Marinids as a hostage for the final handover of the city.

==Afonso V==

===Treaty of Tordesillas===

Meanwhile, colonization progressed in the Azores and Madeira, where sugar and wine were now produced; above all, the gold brought home from Guinea stimulated the commercial energy of the Portuguese. It had become clear that, apart from their religious and scientific aspects, these voyages of discovery were highly profitable. Under Afonso V (1443–1481), surnamed the African, the Gulf of Guinea was explored as far as Cape St Catherine (&quot;Cabo Santa Catarina&quot;),

 and three expeditions (1458, 1461 and 1471) were sent to Morocco; in 1471 Arzila and Tangier were captured from the Moors. Under John II (1481–1495) the fortress of São Jorge da Mina, the modern Elmina, was founded for the protection of the Guinea trade. Diogo Cão, discovered the Congo in 1482 and reached Cape Cross in 1486; Bartolomeu Dias doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, thus proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible by sea.
After 1492 the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the West Indies rendered desirable a delimitation of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. This was accomplished by the Treaty of Tordesillas (June 7, 1494), which modified the delimitation authorized by Pope Alexander VI in two bulls issued on May 4, 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands that might be discovered east of a straight line drawn from the Arctic Pole to the Antarctic, at a distance of 370 leagues west of Cape Verde. Spain received the lands discovered west of this line. The known means of measuring longitude were so inexact, however, that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined (see J. de Andrade Corvo in &quot;Journal das Ciências Matemáticas,&quot; xxxi.147–176, Lisbon, 1881), so the treaty was subject to very diverse interpretations. On its provisions were based both the Portuguese claim to Brazil and the Spanish claim to the Moluccas (see History of East Indies). The treaty was chiefly valuable to the Portuguese as a recognition of the prestige they had acquired. That prestige was enormously enhanced when, in 1497–1499, Vasco da Gama completed the voyage to India.

The tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many primary sources. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon. Unfortunately, due to the fire following the earthquake of 1755, nearly all of the library&#x27;s records were destroyed, but an extra copy available in Goa was transferred to Lisbon Tower of Tombo during the following 100 years. The Corpo Cronológico (Chronological Corpus), a collection of manuscripts on the Portuguese explorations and discoveries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, was inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2007 in recognition of its historical value &quot;for acquiring knowledge of the political, diplomatic, military, economic and religious history of numerous countries at the time of the Portuguese Discoveries.&quot;

===Afonsine Ordinances===
While the Crown was thus acquiring new possessions, its authority in Portugal was temporarily overshadowed by the growth of aristocratic privilege. After the death of Edward, further attempts to curb the power of the nobles were made by his brother, D. Pedro, duke of Coimbra, who acted as regent during the minority of Afonso V of Portugal (1439–1448). The head of the aristocratic opposition was the Duke of Braganza, who contrived to secure the sympathy of the king and the dismissal of the regent. The quarrel led to civil war, and on 20 May 1449, D. Pedro was defeated and killed at the Battle of Alfarrobeira. Thenceforward the grants made by John I were renewed and extended on so lavish a scale that the Braganza estates alone comprised about a third of the whole kingdom.

An unwise foreign policy simultaneously injured the royal prestige, for Afonso married his own niece, Joanna, daughter of Henry IV of Castile, and claimed the kingdom of Castile in her name. At the Battle of Toro, in 1476, he fought an indecisive battle that made him realize that his claims to the Castilian throne were not achievable. However, Portugal defeated Castile in the naval war (1475–79) of the same conflict (War of the Castilian Succession), capturing a large Castilian fleet -full of gold- in the Battle of Guinea (1478).

In 1479 Ferdinand and Isabella and Afonso signed the Treaty of Alcáçovas, by which Joanna was relegated to a convent and Portugal won the hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean.

His successor, John II (1481–1495), reverted to the policy of matrimonial alliances with Castile and friendship with England. Finding, as he said, that the liberality of former kings had left the Crown &quot;no estates except the high roads of Portugal,&quot; he determined to crush the feudal nobility and seize its territories. The &quot;Portuguese Cortes&quot; held at Évora (1481) empowered judges nominated by the Crown to administer justice in all feudal domains. The nobles resisted this infringement of their rights, but their leader, Fernando II, Duke of Braganza, was beheaded for high treason in 1483; in 1484 the king stabbed to death his own brother-in-law, Diogo, Duke of Viseu; and eighty other members of the aristocracy were executed afterwards. Thus John &quot;the Perfect,&quot; as he was called, assured the supremacy of the Crown. He was succeeded in 1495 by Manuel I, who was named &quot;the Great&quot; or &quot;the Fortunate,&quot; because in his reign the sea route to India was discovered and a Portuguese Empire founded.

==Imperial expansion (1481–1557)==
John II (r. 1481–1495) famously restored the policies of Atlantic exploration, reviving the work of his great-uncle, Henry the Navigator. The Portuguese explorations were his main priority in government, pushing south the known coast of Africa with the purpose of discovering the maritime route to India and breaking into the spice trade. Manuel I (r. 1495–1521) proved a worthy successor to his cousin John II, supporting Portuguese exploration of the Atlantic Ocean and the development of Portuguese commerce.

Under John III (r. 1521–1557), Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and in the New World through the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. John III&#x27;s policy of reinforcing Portugal&#x27;s bases in India (such as Goa) secured Portugal&#x27;s monopoly over the spice trade of cloves and nutmeg from the Maluku Islands. As a result, John III has been called the &quot;Grocer King&quot;. On the eve of his death in 1557, the Portuguese empire spanned almost 1 billion acres (about 4 million square kilometers). During his reign, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to make contact with both China, under the Ming Dynasty, and Japan, during the Muromachi period (see Nanban trade). John III abandoned Muslim territories in North Africa in favor of trade with India and investment in Brazil. In Europe, he improved relations with the Baltic region and the Rhineland, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese trade.

==Sebastian I==
Sebastian of Portugal was the penultimate Portuguese monarch of the House of Aviz.
He was the son of John Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and his wife, Joanna of Austria. Sebastian succeeded to the throne at the age of three, on the death of King John III, his paternal grandfather. Soon after his birth, his mother Joanna of Spain left her infant son to serve as Regent of Spain for her father, Emperor Charles V. After his abdication in 1556, she served in the same capacity for her brother Philip II of Spain. Joanna remained in Spain until her death in 1573, never to see her son again. Since Sebastian was still a child, the regency was handled first by his paternal grandmother, Catherine of Austria, and then by his great-uncle, Cardinal Henry of Évora. During this period Portugal continued colonial expansion in Angola, Mozambique, and Malacca, as well as the annexation of Macau in 1557.

During Sebastian&#x27;s short personal reign, he strengthened ties with the Holy Roman Empire, England and France through diplomatic efforts. He also restructured much of the administrative, judicial and military life in his kingdom. In 1568, Sebastian created scholarships to provide financial assistance to students who wished to study medicine or pharmacy at the University of Coimbra. In 1569, Sebastian ordered Duarte Nunes de Leão to compile all the laws and legal documents of the kingdom in a collection of &quot;Leis Extravagantes&quot; known as &quot;Código Sebastiânico&quot; (Sebastian&#x27;s code).

During the great plague of Lisbon in 1569, Sebastian sent for doctors from Seville to help the Portuguese doctors fight the plague. He created two hospitals in Lisbon to take care of the afflicted. In his concern for the widows and orphans of those killed by the plague, he created several &quot;Recolhimentos&quot; (shelters), known as the &quot;Recolhimento de Santa Marta&quot; (shelter of Santa Marta) and the &quot;Recolhimento dos Meninos&quot; (shelter of the children), and provided wet nurses to take care of the babies.

Sebastian created laws for the military, the &quot;Lei das Armas&quot;, that would become a military organization model. In 1570 Goa was attacked by the Indian army, but the Portuguese were successful in repulsing the assault. Also in 1570, Sebastian ordered that Brazilian Indians should not be used as slaves and ordered the release of those held in captivity.

The &quot;Celeiros Comuns&quot; (Communal Granaries) were inaugurated in 1576 on Sebastian&#x27;s orders. These were lending institutions intended to help to poor farmers when farm production decreased, giving credit, lending seeds and commodities to the needy, and allowing them to pay back with farm products when they recovered from losses.

In 1577 Sebastian&#x27;s ordinance &quot;Da nova ordem do juízo, sobre o abreviar das demandas, e execução dellas&quot; decreased the time for handling legal actions, regulated the action of lawyers, scribes and other court officials, and created fines for delays.

Sebastian disappeared (and was presumably killed in action) in the battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578, after the brief reign of King Henry triggering the Portuguese succession crisis.

==Dynastic crisis and union with Spain==
Following the Portuguese crisis of succession, a dynastic union joined the crowns of Castile, Portugal and Aragon along with their respective colonial possessions, under the rule of the Habsburg dynasty

The unification of the peninsula had long been a goal of the region&#x27;s monarchs with the intent of restoring the Visigothic monarchy.
The history of Portugal from the dynastic crisis in 1578 to the first Braganza Dynasty monarchs was a period of transition. The Portuguese Empire&#x27;s spice trade was peaking at the start of this period. It continued to enjoy widespread influence after Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa in 1497–98.

==Explorations==

===Reasons for exploration===
Portugal&#x27;s long shoreline, with its many harbours and rivers flowing westward to the Atlantic Ocean was the ideal environment to raise generations of adventurous seamen. As a seafaring people in the south-westernmost region of Europe, the Portuguese became natural leaders of exploration during the Middle Ages. Faced with the options of either accessing other European markets by sea (by exploiting its seafaring prowess) or by land (and facing the task of crossing Castile and Aragon territory) it is not surprising that goods were sent via the sea to England, Flanders, Italy and the Hanseatic league towns.

Having fought to achieve and to retain independence, the nation&#x27;s leadership had also a desire for fresh conquests. Added to this was a long struggle to expel the Moors that was religiously sanctioned and influenced by foreign crusaders with a desire for martial fame. Making war on Islam seemed to the Portuguese both their natural destiny and their duty as Christians.

One important reason was the need to overcome the expensive eastern trade routes, dominated first by the republics of Venice and Genoa in the Mediterranean, and then controlled by the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, barring European access, and going through North Africa and the historically important combined-land-sea routes via the Red Sea. Both spice and silk were big businesses of the day, and arguably, spices which were used as medicine, drugs and preservatives was something of a necessity—at least to those Europeans of better than modest means.

The Portuguese economy had benefited from its connections with neighbouring Muslim states. A money economy was well enough established for 15th century workers in the countryside as well as in the towns to be paid in currency. The agriculture of the countryside had diversified to the point where grain was imported from Morocco (a symptom of an economy dependent upon Portugal&#x27;s), while specialised crops occupied former grain-growing areas: vineyards, olives, or the sugar factories of the Algarve, later to be reproduced in Brazil (Braudel 1985). Most of all, the Aviz dynasty that had come to power in 1385 marked the semi-eclipse of the conservative land-oriented aristocracy (See The Consolidation of the Monarchy in Portugal.) A constant exchange of cultural ideals made Portugal a centre of knowledge and technological development. Due to these connections with Islamic kingdoms, many mathematicians and experts in naval technology appeared in Portugal. The Portuguese government impelled this even further by taking full advantage of this and by creating several important research centres in Portugal, where Portuguese and foreign experts made several breakthroughs in the fields of mathematics, cartography and naval technology. Sagres and Lagos in the Algarve become famous as such places.

===Portuguese nautical science===
The successive expeditions and experience of the pilots led to a fairly rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science, creating an elite of astronomers, navigators, mathematicians and cartographers, among them stood Pedro Nunes with studies on how to determine the latitudes by the stars and João de Castro.

==== Ships ====
Until the 15th century, the Portuguese were limited to coastal cabotage navigation using barques and &quot;barinels&quot; (ancient cargo vessels used in the Mediterranean). These boats were small and fragile, with only one mast with a fixed quadrangular sail and did not have the capabilities to overcome the navigational difficulties associated with Southward oceanic exploration, as the strong winds, shoals and strong ocean currents easily overwhelmed their abilities. They are associated with the earliest discoveries, such as the Madeira Islands, the Azores, the Canaries, and to the early exploration of the north west African coast as far south as Arguim in the current Mauritania.

The ship that truly launched the first phase of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the caravel, a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing luffing. The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to tack. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but did not hinder its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their &quot;cargo&quot; was what was in the explorer&#x27;s feedback of a new territory, which only took up the space of one person. Among the famous caravels are &quot;Berrio&quot; and &quot;Caravela Annunciation&quot;.

With the start of long oceanic sailing also large ships developed. &quot;Nau&quot; was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily merchant ships. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of &quot;naus&quot; according to the power of its artillery. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade: from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500, they become impressive in the 16th century, having usually two decks, stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century there were also used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2000 tons.

==== Celestial navigation ====

In the thirteenth century celestial navigation was already known, guided by the sun position. For celestial navigation the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used Arab navigation tools, like the astrolabe and quadrant, which they made easier and simpler. They also created the cross-staff, or &quot;cane of Jacob&quot;, for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The Southern Cross become a reference upon arrival at the Southern hemisphere by João de Santarém and Pedro Escobar in 1471, starting the celestial navigation on this constellation. But the results varied throughout the year, which required corrections.

To this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables (Ephemeris), precious tools for oceanic navigation, which have experienced a remarkable diffusion in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing to calculate latitude. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer Abraham Zacuto, published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral.

====Sailing techniques====

Besides coastal exploration, Portuguese also made trips off in the ocean to gather meteorological and oceanographic information (in these were discovered the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, and Sargasso Sea). The knowledge of wind patterns and currents, the trade winds and the oceanic gyres in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the latitude of the Azores, using the permanent favorable winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of atmospheric circulation and the effect of Coriolis, facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese venturing increasingly farther from shore, the maneuver that became known as the &quot;volta do mar&quot; ().

====Cartography====

It is thought that Jehuda Cresques, son of the Catalan cartographer Abraham Cresques have been one of the notable cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. However the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by Pedro Reinel in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by Diogo Cão. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a Wind rose.

With his son, cartographer Jorge Reinel and Lopo Homem, they participated in the making of the atlas known as &quot;Lopo Homem-Reinés Atlas&quot; or &quot;Miller Atlas&quot;, in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time, with Emperor Charles V wanting them to work for him. In 1517 King Manuel I of Portugal handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all compass needles in vessels.

In the third phase of the former Portuguese nautical cartography, characterized by the abandonment of the influence of Ptolemy&#x27;s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents, stands out Fernão Vaz Dourado (Goa ~ 1520 – ~ 1580), whose work has extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time. Many of his charts are large scale.

===Henry the Navigator===
It was the genius of Prince Henry the Navigator that coordinated and utilized all these tendencies towards expansion. Prince Henry placed at the disposal of his captains the vast resources of the Order of Christ, of which he was the head, and the best information and most accurate instruments and maps that could be obtained. He sought to effect a meeting with the half-fabulous Christian Empire of &quot;Prester John&quot; by way of the &quot;Western Nile&quot; (the Sénégal River), and, in alliance with that potentate, to crush the Turks and liberate the Holy Land. The concept of an ocean route to India appears to have originated after his death. On land he again defeated the Moors, who attempted to retake Ceuta in 1418; but in an expedition to Tangier, undertaken in 1437 by King Edward (1433–1438), the Portuguese army was defeated, and could only escape destruction by surrendering as a hostage Prince Ferdinand, the king&#x27;s youngest brother. Ferdinand, known as &quot;the Constant&quot;, from the fortitude with which he endured captivity, died unransomed in 1443. By sea Prince Henry&#x27;s captains continued their exploration of Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1433 Cape Bojador was rounded; in 1434 the first consignment of slaves was brought to Lisbon; and slave trading soon became the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce, until India was reached. The Senegal was reached in 1445, Cape Verde was passed in the same year, and in 1446 Álvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as Sierra Leone. This was probably the farthest point reached before the Navigator died in 1460. Another vector of the discoveries were the voyages westward, during which the Portuguese discovered the Sargasso Sea and possibly sighted the shores of Nova Scotia well before 1492.

===Portuguese in Asia===
The effort to colonize and maintain territories scattered around the entire coast of Africa and its surrounding islands, Brazil, India and Indic territories such as in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Japan, China, Indonesia and Timor was a challenge for a population of only one million.
Combined with constant competition from the Spanish this led to a desire for secrecy about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries were in fact fake documents with fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation&#x27;s possible efforts.

<text>Ultramarine is a deep blue color pigment which was originally made by grinding lapis lazuli into a powder. Its lengthy grinding and washing process makes the natural pigment quite valuable—roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it comes from and as expensive as gold.

The name ultramarine comes from the Latin word . The word means &#x27;beyond the sea&#x27;, as the pigment was imported by Italian traders during the 14th and 15th centuries from mines in Afghanistan. Much of the expansion of ultramarine can be attributed to Venice which historically was the port of entry for lapis lazuli in Europe.

Ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue used by Renaissance painters. It was often used for the robes of the Virgin Mary and symbolized holiness and humility. It remained an extremely expensive pigment until a synthetic ultramarine was invented in 1826.

Ultramarine is a permanent pigment when under ideal preservation conditions. Otherwise, it is susceptible to discoloration and fading.

== Structure ==
The pigment consists primarily of a zeolite-based mineral containing small amounts of polysulfides. It occurs in nature as a proximate component of lapis lazuli containing a blue cubic mineral called lazurite. In the Colour Index International, the pigment of ultramarine is identified as P. Blue 29 77007.

The major component of lazurite is a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate (Na8–10Al6Si6O24S2–4), which makes ultramarine the most complex of all mineral pigments. Some chloride is often present in the crystal lattice as well. The blue color of the pigment is due to the  radical anion, which contains an unpaired electron.

== Visual properties ==

The best samples of ultramarine are a uniform deep blue while other specimens are of paler color.

Particle size distribution has been found to vary among samples of ultramarine from various workshops. Numerous grinding techniques used by painters have resulted in different pigment/medium ratios and particle size distributions. The grinding and purification process results in pigment with particles of various geometries. Different grades of pigment may have been used for different areas in a painting, a characteristic that is sometimes used in art authentication.

== Shades and variations ==

International Klein Blue (IKB) a deep blue hue first mixed by the French artist Yves Klein.

===Electric===
&quot;Electric ultramarine&quot; is the tone of ultramarine that is halfway between blue and violet on the RGB (HSV) color wheel, the expression of the HSV color space of the RGB color model.

== Production ==

=== Natural production ===
Lapis lazuli stone was historically mined near Sar-i-Sang in modern-day Afghanistan and traded to Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt as early as the third millennium BCE. 

A method to produce ultramarine from lapis lazuli was introduced by the 5th century for use in Buddhist cave temples. The method was described by Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. This process consisted of grinding the lapis lazuli mineral, mixing the ground material with melted wax, resins, and oils, wrapping the resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute lye solution, a potassium carbonate solution prepared by combining wood ash with water. The blue lazurite particles collect at the bottom of the pot, while the colorless crystalline material and other impurities remain at the top. This process was performed at least three times, with each successive extraction generating a lower quality material. The final extraction, consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a glaze for its pale blue transparency. This extensive process was specific to ultramarine because the mineral it comes from has a combination of both blue and colorless pigments. If an artist were to simply grind and wash lapis lazuli, the resulting powder would be a greyish-blue color that lacks purity and depth of color since lapis lazuli contains a high proportion of colorless material.

Although the lapis lazuli stone itself is relatively inexpensive, the lengthy process of pulverizing, sifting, and washing to produce ultramarine makes the natural pigment quite valuable and roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it comes from. The high cost of the imported raw material and the long laborious process of extraction combined has been said to make high-quality ultramarine as expensive as gold.

=== Synthetic production ===
In 1990, an estimated 20,000 tons of ultramarine were produced industrially. The raw materials used in the manufacture of synthetic ultramarine are the following:
* white kaolin,
* anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4),
* anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3),
* powdered sulfur,
* powdered charcoal or relatively ash-free coal, or colophony in lumps.

The preparation is typically made in steps:
* The first part of the process takes place at 700 to 750 °C in a closed furnace, so that sulfur, carbon and organic substances give reducing conditions. This yields a yellow-green product sometimes used as a pigment.
* In the second step, air or sulfur dioxide at 350 to 450 °C is used to oxidize sulfide in the intermediate product to S2 and S&quot;n&quot; chromophore molecules, resulting in the blue (or purple, pink or red) pigment.
* The mixture is heated in a kiln, sometimes in brick-sized amounts.
* The resultant solids are then ground and washed, as is the case in any other insoluble pigment&#x27;s manufacturing process; the chemical reaction produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide. (Flue-gas desulfurization is thus essential to its manufacture where SO2 pollution is regulated.)

Ultramarine poor in silica is obtained by fusing a mixture of soft clay, sodium sulfate, charcoal, sodium carbonate, and sulfur. The product is at first white, but soon turns green &quot;green ultramarine&quot; when it is mixed with sulfur and heated. The sulfur burns, and a fine blue pigment is obtained. Ultramarine rich in silica is generally obtained by heating a mixture of pure clay, very fine white sand, sulfur, and charcoal in a muffle furnace. A blue product is obtained at once, but a red tinge often results. The different ultramarines—green, blue, red, and violet—are finely ground and washed with water.

Synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine, since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more uniform than the particles in natural ultramarine and therefore diffuse light more evenly. Its color is unaffected by light nor by contact with oil or lime as used in painting. Hydrochloric acid immediately bleaches it with liberation of hydrogen sulfide. Even a small addition of zinc oxide to the reddish varieties especially causes a considerable diminution in the intensity of the color. Modern, synthetic ultramarine blue is a non-toxic, soft pigment that does not need much mulling to disperse into a paint formulation.

== Structure and classification ==

Ultramarine is the aluminosilicate zeolite with a sodalite structure. Sodalite consists of interconnected aluminosilicate cages. Some of these cages contain polysulfide () groups that are the chromophore (color centre). The negative charge on these ions is balanced by ions that also occupy these cages.

The chromophore is proposed to be or S4.

== History ==

=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===
The name derives from Middle Latin , literally &quot;beyond the sea&quot; because it was imported from Asia by sea. In the past, it has also been known as &quot;azzurrum ultramarine&quot;, , , , . The current terminology for ultramarine includes natural ultramarine (English), (French), (German), (Italian), and (Spanish). The first recorded use of &quot;ultramarine&quot; as a color name in English was in 1598.

Ancient Egyptians used lapis lazuli in solid form for ornamental applications in jewelry, however, there is no record of them successfully formulating lapis lazuli into paint. Archaeological evidence and early literature reveal that lapis lazuli was used as a semi-precious stone and decorative building stone from early Egyptian times. The mineral is described by the classical authors Theophrastus and Pliny. There is no evidence that lapis lazuli was used ground as a painting pigment by ancient Greeks and Romans. Like ancient Egyptians, they had access to a satisfactory blue colorant in the synthetic copper silicate pigment, Egyptian blue.

The first noted use of lapis lazuli as a pigment can be seen in 6th and 7th-century paintings in Zoroastrian and Buddhist cave temples in Afghanistan, near the most famous source of the mineral. Lapis lazuli has been identified in Chinese paintings from the 10th and 11th centuries, in Indian mural paintings from the 11th, 12th, and 17th centuries, and on Anglo-Saxon and Norman illuminated manuscripts from . Ultramarine also appears in Islamic illuminated manuscripts from the 15th and 16th centuries throughout modern-day Afghanistan and Iran. 

=== Renaissance ===
Venice was central to both the manufacturing and distribution of ultramarine during the early modern period. The pigment was imported by Italian traders during the 14th and 15th centuries from mines in Afghanistan. Other European countries employed the pigment less extensively than in Italy; the pigment was not used even by wealthy painters in Spain at that time.

During the Renaissance, ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue that could be used by painters. Color infrared photogenic studies of ultramarine in 13th and 14th-century Sienese panel paintings have revealed that historically, ultramarine has been diluted with white lead pigment in an effort to use the color more sparingly given its high price. The 15th century artist Cennino Cennini wrote in his painters&#x27; handbook: &quot;Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so.&quot; Natural ultramarine is a difficult pigment to grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder.

The pigment was most extensively used during the 14th through 15th centuries, as its brilliance complemented the vermilion and gold of illuminated manuscripts and Italian panel paintings. It was valued chiefly on account of its brilliancy of tone and its inertness in opposition to sunlight, oil, and slaked lime. It is, however, extremely susceptible to even minute and dilute mineral acids and acid vapors. Dilute HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 rapidly destroy the blue color, producing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the process. Acetic acid attacks the pigment at a much slower rate than mineral acids.

Ultramarine was only used for frescoes when it was applied &quot;secco&quot; because frescoes&#x27; absorption rate made its use cost prohibitive. The pigment was mixed with a binding medium like egg to form a tempera and applied over dry plaster, such as in Giotto di Bondone&#x27;s frescos in the Cappella degli Scrovegni or the Arena Chapel in Padua.

European artists used the pigment sparingly, reserving their highest quality blues for the robes of Mary and the Christ child, possibly in an effort to show piety, spending as a means of expressing devotion. As a result of the high price, artists sometimes economized by using a cheaper blue, azurite, for under painting. Most likely imported to Europe through Venice, the pigment was seldom seen in German art or art from countries north of Italy. Due to a shortage of azurite in the late 16th and 17th century, the price for the already-expensive ultramarine increased dramatically.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Johannes Vermeer made extensive use of ultramarine in his paintings. The turban of the &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and lead white, with a thin glaze of pure ultramarine over it. In &quot;Lady Standing at a Virginal&quot;, the young woman&#x27;s dress is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and green earth, and ultramarine was used to add shadows in the flesh tones. Scientific analysis by the National Gallery in London of &quot;Lady Standing at a Virginal&quot; showed that the ultramarine in the blue seat cushion in the foreground had degraded and become paler with time; it would have been a deeper blue when originally painted.

=== 19th century (invention of synthetic ultramarine) ===
The beginning of the development of artificial ultramarine blue is known from Goethe. In about 1787, he observed the blue deposits on the walls of lime kilns near Palermo in Sicily. He was aware of the use of these glassy deposits as a substitute for lapis lazuli in decorative applications. He did not mention if it was suitable to grind for a pigment.

In 1814, Tassaert observed the spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very similar to ultramarine, if not identical with it, in a lime kiln at St. Gobain. In 1824, this caused the to offer a prize for the artificial production of the precious color. Processes were devised by Jean Baptiste Guimet (1826) and by Christian Gmelin (1828), then professor of chemistry in Tübingen. While Guimet kept his process a secret, Gmelin published his, and became the originator of the &quot;artificial ultramarine&quot; industry.

== Permanence ==
Easel paintings and illuminated manuscripts have revealed natural ultramarine in a perfect state of preservation even though the art may be several centuries old. In general, ultramarine is a permanent pigment. Although it is a sulfur-containing compound from which sulfur is readily emitted as H2S, historically, it has been mixed with lead white with no reported occurrences of the lead pigment blackening to become lead sulfide.

A plague known as &quot;ultramarine sickness&quot; has occasionally been observed among ultramarine oil paintings as a grayish or yellowish gray discoloration of the paint surface. This can occur with artificial ultramarine that is used industrially. The cause of this has been debated among experts, however, potential causes include atmospheric sulfur dioxide and moisture, acidity of an oil- or oleo-resinous paint medium, or slow drying of the oil during which time water may have been absorbed, creating swelling, opacity of the medium, and therefore whitening of the paint film.

Both natural and artificial ultramarine are stable to ammonia and caustic alkalis in ordinary conditions. Artificial ultramarine has been found to fade when in contact with lime when it is used to color concrete or plaster. These observations have led experts to speculate if the natural pigment&#x27;s fading may be the result of contact with the lime plaster of fresco paintings.

== Synthetic applications ==
Synthetic ultramarine, being very cheap, is used for wall painting, the printing of paper hangings, and calico. It also is used as a corrective for the yellowish tinge often present in things meant to be white, such as linen and paper. Bluing or &quot;laundry blue&quot; is a suspension of synthetic ultramarine, or the chemically different Prussian blue, that is used for this purpose when washing white clothes. It is often found in makeup such as mascaras or eye shadows.

Large quantities are used in the manufacture of paper, and especially for producing a kind of pale blue writing paper which was popular in Britain. During World War I, the RAF painted the outer roundels with a color made from ultramarine blue. This became BS 108(381C) aircraft blue. It was replaced in the 1960s by a new color made on phthalocyanine blue, called BS110(381C) roundel blue.

== Terminology ==
Ultramarine is a blue made from natural lapis lazuli, or its synthetic equivalent which is sometimes called &quot;French Ultramarine&quot;. More generally &quot;ultramarine blue&quot; can refer to a vivid blue.

The term ultramarine can also refer to other pigments. Variants of the pigment such as &quot;ultramarine red,&quot; &quot;ultramarine green,&quot; and &quot;ultramarine violet&quot; all resemble ultramarine with respect to their chemistry and crystal structure.

The term &quot;ultramarine green&quot; indicates a dark green while barium chromate is sometimes referred to as &quot;ultramarine yellow&quot;. Ultramarine pigment has also been termed &quot;Gmelin&#x27;s Blue,&quot; &quot;Guimet&#x27;s Blue,&quot; &quot;New blue,&quot; &quot;Oriental Blue,&quot; and &quot;Permanent Blue&quot;.

<text>Thomas Lanier Williams III (March 26, 1911 – February 25, 1983), known by his pen name Tennessee Williams, was an American playwright and screenwriter. Along with contemporaries Eugene O&#x27;Neill and Arthur Miller, he is considered among the three foremost playwrights of 20th-century American drama.

At age 33, after years of obscurity, Williams suddenly became famous with the success of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1944) in New York City. It was the first of a string of successes, including &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1947), &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955), &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1959), and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1961). With his later work, Williams attempted a new style that did not appeal as widely to audiences. His drama &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; is often numbered on short lists of the finest American plays of the 20th century alongside Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

Much of Williams&#x27;s most acclaimed work has been adapted for the cinema. He also wrote short stories, poetry, essays, and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, Williams was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Thomas Lanier Williams III was born in Columbus, Mississippi, of English, Welsh, and Huguenot ancestry, the second child of Edwina Dakin (August 9, 1884 – June 1, 1980) and Cornelius Coffin &quot;C. C.&quot; Williams (August 21, 1879 – March 27, 1957). His father was a traveling shoe salesman who became an alcoholic and was frequently away from home. His mother, Edwina, was the daughter of Rose O. Dakin, a music teacher, and the Reverend Walter Dakin, an Episcopal priest from Illinois who was assigned to a parish in Clarksdale, Mississippi, shortly after Williams&#x27;s birth. Williams lived in his grandfather&#x27;s Episcopal rectory with his family for much of his early childhood and was close to his grandparents. Among his ancestors was musician and poet Sidney Lanier.

He had two siblings, older sister Rose Isabel Williams (1909–1996) and younger brother Walter Dakin Williams (1919–2008). As a young child, Williams nearly died from a case of diphtheria that left him frail and virtually confined to his house during a year of recuperation. At least partly due to his illness, he was considered a weak child by his father. Cornelius Williams, a descendant of East Tennessee pioneers, had a violent temper and was prone to use his fists. He regarded what he thought was his son&#x27;s effeminacy with disdain. Edwina, locked in an unhappy marriage, focused her attention almost entirely on her frail young son. Critics and historians agree that Williams drew from his own dysfunctional family in much of his writing and that his desire to break free from his puritan upbringing propelled him towards writing.

When Williams was eight years old, his father was promoted to a job at the home office of the International Shoe Company in St. Louis. His mother&#x27;s continual search for a more appropriate home, as well as his father&#x27;s heavy drinking and loudly turbulent behavior, caused them to move numerous times around St. Louis. Williams attended Soldan High School, a setting he referred to in his play &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. Later he studied at University City High School. At age 16, Williams won third prize for an essay published in &quot;Smart Set&quot;, titled &quot;Can a Good Wife Be a Good Sport?&quot; A year later, his short story &quot;The Vengeance of Nitocris&quot; was published (as by &quot;Thomas Lanier Williams&quot;) in the August 1928 issue of the magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. These early publications did not lead to any significant recognition or appreciation of Williams&#x27;s talent, and he would struggle for more than a decade to establish his writing career. Later, in 1928, Williams first visited Europe with his maternal grandfather Dakin.

==Education==
From 1929 to 1931, Williams attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he enrolled in journalism classes. He was bored by his classes and distracted by unrequited love for a girl. Soon he began entering his poetry, essays, stories, and plays in writing contests, hoping to earn extra income. His first submitted play was &quot;Beauty Is the Word&quot; (1930), followed by &quot;Hot Milk at Three in the Morning&quot; (1932). As recognition for &quot;Beauty,&quot; a play about rebellion against religious upbringing, he became the first freshman to receive honorable mention in a writing competition.

At University of Missouri, Williams joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, but he did not fit in well with his fraternity brothers. After he failed a military training course in his junior year, his father pulled him out of school and put him to work at the International Shoe Company factory. Although Williams hated the monotony, the job forced him out of the gentility of his upbringing. His dislike of his new 9-to-5 routine drove Williams to write prodigiously. He set a goal of writing one story a week. Williams often worked on weekends and late into the night. His mother recalled his intensity:

Tom would go to his room with black coffee and cigarettes and I would hear the typewriter clicking away at night in the silent house. Some mornings when I walked in to wake him for work, I would find him sprawled fully dressed across the bed, too tired to remove his clothes.

Overworked, unhappy, and lacking further success with his writing, by his 24th birthday Williams had suffered a nervous breakdown and left his job. Memories of this period and of a particular factory co-worker would contribute to the character Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. By the mid-1930s his mother separated from his father due to his worsening alcoholism and abusive temper. They agreed to a legal separation in 1946 but never divorced.

In 1936, Williams enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis where he wrote the play &quot;Me, Vashya&quot; (1937). After not winning the school&#x27;s poetry prize, he decided to drop out. In the autumn of 1937, he transferred to the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where he graduated with a B.A. in English in August 1938. He later studied at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York City. Speaking of his early days as a playwright and an early collaborative play called &quot;Cairo, Shanghai, Bombay!&quot;, Williams wrote, &quot;The laughter ... enchanted me. Then and there the theatre and I found each other for better and for worse. I know it&#x27;s the only thing that saved my life.&quot; Around 1939, he adopted Tennessee Williams as his professional name, in acknowledgement of his Southern accent and roots.

===Literary influences===

Williams&#x27;s writings reference some of the poets and writers he most admired in his early years: Hart Crane, Arthur Rimbaud, Anton Chekhov, William Shakespeare, Clarence Darrow, D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, August Strindberg, William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Emily Dickinson, William Inge, James Joyce, and, according to some, Ernest Hemingway.

==Career==
As Williams was struggling to gain production and an audience for his work in the late 1930s, he worked at a string of menial jobs that included a stint as caretaker on a chicken ranch in Laguna Beach, California. In 1939, with the help of his agent Audrey Wood, Williams was awarded a $1,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in recognition of his play &quot;Battle of Angels.&quot; It was produced in Boston, Massachusetts in 1940 and was poorly received.

Using some of the Rockefeller funds, Williams moved to New Orleans in 1939 to write for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federally funded program of the New Deal era. Williams lived for a time in New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter, including 722 Toulouse Street, the setting of his 1977 play &quot;Vieux Carré&quot;. The building is now part of The Historic New Orleans Collection. The Rockefeller grant brought him to the attention of the Hollywood film industry and Williams received a six-month contract as a writer from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, earning $250 weekly.

During the winter of 1944–45, his memory play &quot;The Glass Menagerie,&quot; developed from his 1943 short story &quot;Portrait of a Girl in Glass&quot;, was produced in Chicago and garnered good reviews. It moved to New York where it became an instant hit and enjoyed a long Broadway run. Elia Kazan (who directed many of Williams&#x27;s greatest successes) said of Williams: &quot;Everything in his life is in his plays, and everything in his plays is in his life.&quot; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; won the award for the best play of the season, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award.

The huge success of his next play, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, cemented his reputation as a great playwright in 1947. During the late 1940s and 1950s, Williams began to travel widely with his partner Frank Merlo (1922 – September 21, 1963), often spending summers in Europe. He moved often to stimulate his writing, living in New York, New Orleans, Key West, Rome, Barcelona, and London. Williams wrote, &quot;Only some radical change can divert the downward course of my spirit, some startling new place or people to arrest the drift, the drag.&quot;

Between 1948 and 1959 Williams had seven of his plays produced on Broadway: &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1948), &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1951), &quot;Camino Real&quot; (1953), &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955), &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; (1957), &quot;Garden District&quot; (1958), and &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1959). By 1959, he had earned two Pulitzer Prizes, three New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Awards, three Donaldson Awards, and a Tony Award.

Williams&#x27;s work reached wider audiences in the early 1950s when &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; were adapted into motion pictures. Later plays also adapted for the screen included &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, The Night of the Iguana&quot;, &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, and &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;.

After the extraordinary successes of the 1940s and 1950s, he had more personal turmoil and theatrical failures in the 1960s and 1970s. Although he continued to write every day, the quality of his work suffered from his increasing alcohol and drug consumption, as well as occasional poor choices of collaborators. In 1963, his partner Frank Merlo died.

Consumed by depression over the loss, and in and out of treatment facilities while under the control of his mother and brother Dakin, Williams spiraled downward. His plays &quot;Kingdom of Earth&quot; (1967), &quot;In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel&quot; (1969), &quot;Small Craft Warnings&quot; (1973), &quot;The Two Character Play&quot; (also called &quot;Out Cry&quot;, 1973), &quot;The Red Devil Battery Sign&quot; (1976), &quot;Vieux Carré&quot; (1978), &quot;Clothes for a Summer Hotel&quot; (1980), and others were all box office failures. Negative press notices wore down his spirit. His last play, &quot;A House Not Meant to Stand,&quot; was produced in Chicago in 1982. Despite largely positive reviews, it ran for only 40 performances.

In 1974, Williams received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1979, four years before his death, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

Throughout his life, Williams remained close to his sister, Rose, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young woman. In 1943, as her behavior became increasingly disturbing, she was subjected to a lobotomy, requiring her to be institutionalised for the rest of her life. As soon as he was financially able, Williams moved Rose to a private institution just north of New York City, where he often visited her. He gave her a percentage interest in several of his most successful plays, the royalties from which were applied toward her care. The devastating effects of Rose&#x27;s treatment may have contributed to Williams&#x27;s alcoholism and his dependence on various combinations of amphetamines and barbiturates.

After some early attempts at relationships with women, by the late 1930s, Williams began exploring his homosexuality. In New York City, he joined a gay social circle that included fellow writer and close friend Donald Windham (1920–2010) and Windham&#x27;s then-boyfriend Fred Melton. In the summer of 1940, Williams initiated a relationship with Kip Kiernan (1918–1944), a young dancer he met in Provincetown, Massachusetts. When Kiernan left him to marry a woman, Williams was distraught. Kiernan&#x27;s death four years later at age 26 was another heavy blow.

On a 1945 visit to Taos, New Mexico, Williams met Pancho Rodríguez y González, a hotel clerk of Mexican heritage. Rodríguez was prone to jealous rages and excessive drinking, and their relationship was tempestuous. In February 1946, Rodríguez left New Mexico to join Williams in his New Orleans apartment. They lived and traveled together until late 1947, when Williams ended the relationship. Rodríguez and Williams remained friends, however, and were in contact as late as the 1970s.

Williams spent the spring and summer of 1948 in Rome in the company of a young man named &quot;Rafaello&quot; in Williams&#x27; &quot;Memoirs&quot;. He provided financial assistance to the younger man for several years afterward. Williams drew from this for his first novel, &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot;.
When he returned to New York City, Williams met and fell in love with Frank Merlo (1921–1963). An occasional actor of Sicilian ancestry, he had served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. This was the enduring romantic relationship of Williams&#x27;s life, and it lasted 14 years until infidelities and drug abuse on both sides ended it. Merlo, who had become Williams&#x27;s personal secretary, took on most of the details of their domestic life. He provided a period of happiness and stability, acting as a balance to the playwright&#x27;s frequent bouts with depression. Williams feared that, like his sister Rose, he would fall into insanity. His years with Merlo, in an apartment in Manhattan and a modest house in Key West, Florida were Williams&#x27;s happiest and most productive. Shortly after their breakup, Merlo was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Williams returned to him and cared for him until his death on September 20, 1963.

In the years following Merlo&#x27;s death, Williams descended into a period of nearly catatonic depression and increasing drug use, which resulted in several hospitalizations and commitments to mental health facilities. He submitted to injections by Dr. Max Jacobson, known popularly as Dr. Feelgood, who used increasing amounts of amphetamines to overcome his depression. Jacobson combined these with prescriptions for the sedative Seconal to relieve his insomnia. During this time, influenced by his brother, a Roman Catholic convert, Williams joined the Catholic Church, however he never attributed much significance to religion in his personal life. He was never truly able to recoup his earlier success, or to entirely overcome his dependence on prescription drugs.

As Williams grew older, he felt increasingly alone; he feared old age and losing his sexual appeal to younger gay men. In the 1970s, when he was in his 60s, Williams had a lengthy relationship with Robert Carroll, a Vietnam War veteran and aspiring writer in his 20s. Williams had deep affection for Carroll and respect for what he saw as the younger man&#x27;s talents. Along with Williams&#x27;s sister Rose, Carroll was one of the two people who received a bequest in Williams&#x27;s will. Williams described Carroll&#x27;s behavior as a combination of &quot;sweetness&quot; and &quot;beastliness&quot;. Because Carroll had a drug problem, as did Williams, friends including Maria Britneva saw the relationship as destructive. Williams wrote that Carroll played on his &quot;acute loneliness&quot; as an aging gay man. When the two men broke up in 1979, Williams called Carroll a &quot;twerp&quot;, but they remained friends until Williams died four years later.

==Death==

On February 25, 1983, Williams was found dead at age 71 in his suite at the Hotel Elysée in New York City. Chief Medical Examiner of New York City Elliot M. Gross reported that Williams had choked to death from inhaling the plastic cap of the type used on bottles of nasal spray or eye solution. The report was later corrected on August 14, 1983, to state that Williams had been using the plastic cap found in his mouth to ingest barbiturates and had actually died from a toxic level of Seconal.

He wrote in his will in 1972:

However, his brother Dakin Williams arranged for him to be buried at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, where his mother is buried.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;most of his estate was left to the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., with the bulk of it to remain in trust for his sister during her lifetime.&quot; Rose Williams, Tennessee&#x27;s sister, died in 1996 after many years in a mental institution in New York state; the university subsequently received about $7 million, which supports a creative writing program.

==Posthumous recognition==

From February 1 to July 21, 2011, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, the home of Williams&#x27;s archive, exhibited 250 of his personal items. The exhibit, titled &quot;Becoming Tennessee Williams&quot;, included a collection of Williams manuscripts, correspondence, photographs and artwork. The Ransom Center holds the earliest and largest collections of Williams&#x27;s papers, including all of his earliest manuscripts, the papers of his mother Edwina Williams, and those of his long-time agent Audrey Wood.

In late 2009, Williams was inducted into the Poets&#x27; Corner at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York. Performers and artists who took part in his induction included Vanessa Redgrave, playwright John Guare, Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, Gregory Mosher, and Ben (Griessmeyer) Berry.

The Tennessee Williams Theatre in Key West, Florida, is named for him. The Tennessee Williams Key West Exhibit on Truman Avenue houses rare Williams memorabilia, photographs, and pictures including his famous typewriter.

At the time of his death, Williams had been working on a final play, &quot;In Masks Outrageous and Austere&quot;, which attempted to reconcile certain forces and facts of his own life. This was a continuing theme in his work. As of September 2007, author Gore Vidal was completing the play, and Peter Bogdanovich was slated to direct its Broadway debut. The play received its world premiere in New York City in April 2012, directed by David Schweizer and starring Shirley Knight as Babe.

The rectory of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Columbus, Mississippi, where Williams&#x27;s grandfather Dakin was rector at the time of Williams&#x27;s birth, was moved to another location in 1993 for preservation. It was newly renovated in 2010 for use by the City of Columbus as the Tennessee Williams Welcome Center.

Williams&#x27;s literary legacy is represented by the literary agency headed by Georges Borchardt.

In 1985, French author-composer Michel Berger wrote a song dedicated to Tennessee Williams, &quot;Quelque chose de Tennessee&quot; (Something of Tennessee), for Johnny Hallyday. It became one of the singer&#x27;s more famous songs.

Since 1986, the Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival has been held annually in New Orleans, Louisiana, in commemoration of the playwright. The festival takes place at the end of March to coincide with Williams&#x27;s birthday.

&quot;The Tennessee Williams Songbook&quot; is a one woman show written and directed by David Kaplan, a Williams scholar and curator of Provincetown&#x27;s Tennessee Williams Festival, and starring Tony Award nominated actress Alison Fraser. The show features songs taken from plays of Williams&#x27;s canon, woven together with text to create a new narrative. The show premiered at the Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival. The show was recorded on CD and distributed by Ghostlight Records.

In 2014 Williams was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

In 2015, The Tennessee Williams Theatre Company of New Orleans was founded by Co-Artistic Directors Nick Shackleford and Augustin J Correro. The New Orleans–based non-profit theatre company is the first year-round professional theatre company that focuses exclusively on the works of Williams.
Since 2016, St. Louis, Missouri has held an annual Tennessee Williams Festival, featuring a main production and related events such as literary discussions and new plays inspired by his work. In 2018 the festival produced &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

The U.S. Postal Service honored Williams on a stamp issued on October 13, 1995 as part of its literary arts series.

Williams is honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He is also inducted into the Clarksdale Walk of Fame.

On October 17, 2019, the Mississippi Writers Trail installed a historical marker commemorating William&#x27;s literary contributions during his namesake festival produced by the City of Clarksdale, Mississippi.

==Works==
Characters in his plays are often seen as representations of his family members. Laura Wingfield in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; is thought to be modeled on his sister Rose. Some biographers believed that the character of Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; also is based on her and that the mental deterioration of Blanche&#x27;s character is inspired by Rose&#x27;s mental health struggles.

Amanda Wingfield in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; generally was taken to represent Williams&#x27;s mother Edwina. Characters such as Tom Wingfield in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and Sebastian in &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; were understood to represent Williams himself. In addition, he used a lobotomy as a motif in &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot;.

The Pulitzer Prize for Drama was awarded to &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1948 and to &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; in 1955. These two plays later were adapted as highly successful films by noted directors Elia Kazan (&quot;Streetcar&quot;), with whom Williams developed a very close artistic relationship, and Richard Brooks (&quot;Cat&quot;). Both plays included references to elements of Williams&#x27;s life such as homosexuality, mental instability, and alcoholism.

Although &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; by Clifford Odets was the preferred choice of the Pulitzer Prize jury in 1955, and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; was at first considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees, Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of the Board, had seen &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; and thought it worthy of the drama prize. The Board went along with him after considerable discussion.

Williams wrote &quot;The Parade, or Approaching the End of a Summer&quot; when he was 29, and worked on it sporadically throughout his life. A semi-autobiographical depiction of his 1940 romance with Kip Kiernan in Provincetown, Massachusetts, it was produced for the first time on October 1, 2006, in Provincetown by the Shakespeare on the Cape production company. This was part of the First Annual Provincetown Tennessee Williams Festival. &quot;Something Cloudy, Something Clear&quot; (1981) is also based on his memories of Provincetown in the 1940s.

His last play went through many drafts as he was trying to reconcile what would be the end of his life. There are many versions of it, but it is referred to as &quot;In Masks Outrageous and Austere&quot;.

<doc id="44635" wikidata="Q41254" url="?curid=44635" title="Grammy Awards">
<text>The Grammy Awards, stylized as GRAMMY, and often referred to as The Grammys, are awards presented by the Recording Academy of the United States to recognize outstanding achievements in music. They are regarded by many as the most prestigious and significant awards in the music industry worldwide, and thus the show is frequently called &quot;music&#x27;s biggest night&quot;. The trophy depicts a gilded gramophone, and the original idea was to call them the &quot;Gramophone Awards&quot;.

The Grammys are the first of the Big Three networks&#x27; major music awards held annually, and are considered one of the four major annual American entertainment awards with the Academy Awards (for films), the Emmy Awards (for television), and the Tony Awards (for theater). The first Grammy Awards ceremony was held on May 4, 1959, to honor the musical accomplishments of performers for the year 1958. After the 2011 ceremony, the Recording Academy overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012. The 67th Annual Grammy Awards, featuring a total of 94 categories, were presented on February 2, 2025.

After over fifty years being broadcast on CBS, it was announced on October 30, 2024, that the Grammys would move to ABC, Disney+ and Hulu as part of a ten-year broadcast deal between the Recording Academy and The Walt Disney Company.

==History==
The Grammys had their origin in the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the 1950s. As recording executives on the Walk of Fame committee compiled a list of significant recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized that many leading people in their business would not earn a star on Hollywood Boulevard. They determined to rectify this by creating awards given by their industry similar to the Oscars and the Emmys. After deciding to go forward with such awards, a question remained what to call them. One working title was the &#x27;Eddie&#x27;, to honor Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonograph. Eventually, the name was chosen after a mail-in contest whereby approximately 300 contestants submitted the name &#x27;Grammy&#x27;, with the earliest postmark from contest winner Jay Danna of New Orleans, Louisiana, as an abbreviated reference to Emile Berliner&#x27;s invention, the gramophone. Grammys were first awarded for achievements in 1958.

The first award ceremony was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959, the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City, New York, with 28 Grammys awarded. The number of awards given grew, at one time reaching over 100, and fluctuated over the years with categories added and removed. The second Grammy Awards, also held in 1959, was the first ceremony to be televised, but the ceremony was not aired live until the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971.

===Latin Grammy Awards===
The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music recorded in Spanish or Portuguese began in 1989, as it was deemed too large to fit on the regular Grammys ceremony. The Recording Academy then established the Latin Recording Academy in 1997, and the separate Latin Grammy Awards were first held in 2000. The Latin Grammys honor works recorded in Spanish or Portuguese from anywhere around the world that has been released either in Ibero-America, the Iberian Peninsula, or the United States.

===COVID-19 impact (2021–2022)===
The 63rd Annual Grammy Awards were postponed from its original January 31, 2021, date to March 14, 2021, due to the music industry impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

The 64th Annual Grammy Awards were also postponed from its original January 31, 2022, date to April 3, 2022, due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Delta cron hybrid variant. The ceremony was also moved from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas due to the former having scheduling conflicts with sports games and concerts nearly every night through mid-April.

==Gramophone trophy==

The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a gilded gramophone, are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in Ridgway, Colorado. In 1990, the original Grammy design was reworked, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander. Billings developed Grammium, a zinc alloy which they trademarked. Trophies engraved with each recipient&#x27;s name are not available until after the award announcements, so &quot;stunt&quot; trophies are re-used each year for the ceremony broadcast.

By February 2009, some 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.

==Ceremonies and venues==

Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have been held annually at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with a few exceptions. Before 1971, Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally New York City and Los Angeles were the host cities. Chicago joined as a host city in 1962 and Nashville became a fourth location in 1965.

The 1971 ceremony at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles was the first to take place in one location as it was the first live telecast of the event. In 1972, the ceremony was held at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Felt Forum in New York City. In 1973, it took place at Nashville&#x27;s Tennessee Theatre. From 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in Los Angeles and New York City, including Los Angeles&#x27; Shrine Auditorium, Crypto.com Arena and Hollywood Palladium; and New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall.

In 2000, the Crypto.com Arena (known as the Staples Center from 1999 to 2021) became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. The Grammy Museum was built across the street from the Crypto.com Arena in LA Live to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks on the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to honor each year&#x27;s top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have taken place outside of Los Angeles only three times. New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden hosted the awards in 2003 and in 2018, while the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas hosted in 2022.

The annual awards ceremony at the Crypto.com Arena requires the local sports teams such as the Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Sparks to play an extended length of road games.

==Categories==
The &quot;General Field&quot; are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.

* The Album of the Year award is presented to the performer, featured artists, songwriter(s), and/or production team of a full album if other than the performer.
* The Record of the Year award is presented to the performer or production team of a single song if other than the performer.
* The Song of the Year award is presented to the songwriter(s) of a single song.
* The Best New Artist award is presented to a promising breakthrough performer (or performers) who in the eligibility year releases the first recording that establishes their public identity (which is not necessarily their first proper release).

To date, three artists have won all four awards, two won all four at once: Christopher Cross (1981) and Billie Eilish (2020). Adele won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and her other three awards in 2012 and 2017. At age 18, Eilish is the youngest artist to have won all four awards.

As of 2024, an additional two awards were added to the &quot;General Field&quot;.

* The Producer of the Year, Non-Classical award is presented to a producer for a body of work released during the eligibility period. It was first presented in 1974 and was not previously part of any specific field.
* The Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical award is presented to an individual who works primarily as a songwriter for a body of work released during the eligibility period. It was first presented in 2023 and was not previously part of any specific field.

Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres and for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are also given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.

Because of the large number of award categories (94 as of 2024), and a desire to feature several performances by various artists, only awards with the most popular interest – typically about 10 to 12, including the four general field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e., pop, rock, country, and rap) – are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. Most other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast &quot;Premiere Ceremony&quot; in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.

===2012 category restructuring===

On April 6, 2011, the Recording Academy announced a significant overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012. The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, rhythm and blues [R&amp;B], country, and rap). Additionally, several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued; recordings in these categories now fall under general categories for best solo performances.

In the rock field, the hard rock and metal album categories were combined. The Best Rock Instrumental Performance category was also eliminated.

In R&amp;B, the distinction between best contemporary R&amp;B album and other R&amp;B albums has been eliminated, consolidated into one Best R&amp;B Album category.

In rap, the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new Best Rap Performance category.

The roots category had the most eliminations. Up through 2011, there were separate categories for regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian, Native American, and Zydeco/Cajun music. A consistently low number of entries in these categories led the Recording Academy to combine these music variations into a new Best Regional Roots Music Album, including polka, which had lost its category in 2009.

In same-genre fields, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre due to the number of entries and the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary and traditional blues and folk songs. In the world music field, the traditional and contemporary categories also were merged.

In the classical field, its main category Best Classical Album, was discontinued because most recipients in the category had also won in other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main Album of the Year category.

A few minor name changes were also made to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. The Recording Academy determined that the word &quot;gospel&quot; in the gospel genre field tends to connote images and sounds of traditional soul gospel to the exclusion of Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Therefore, the field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.

===Since 2012===
Since 2012, small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has risen from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 2017. In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, several urban, rap, and Latin music categories were renamed. In 2022, the number of awards was increased from 86 to 91. Performance categories were added for the Americana and alternative music genres alongside new categories for video game score and spoken word poetry albums. A songwriter category (non-classical) and a song for social change category were also added and several categories were adjusted slightly.

In 2023, several key changed were announced for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, set to take place in 2024. Three new categories were announced, bringing the total number to 94, the highest since the peak of 109 in 2010. In addition, both Producer of the Year, Non-Classical and Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical, were moved to the General Field, the first time new categories had been added to this field since the concept of the Big Four was established. The total number of fields was consolidated from 26 to 11 to ensure that all voting members would be able to exercise their allocated ten genre votes, as some members were prevented from doing so previously due to some fields only containing one category.

==Entry process and selection of nominees==
Members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), both media companies and individuals, may nominate recordings for consideration. Entries are made and submitted online. When a work is entered, review sessions are held that involve over 150 recording industry experts, to determine that the work has been entered in the correct category.

The resulting lists of eligible entries are then circulated to voting members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields (Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist) and in up to nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) review committees determine the final five nominees. There may be over five nominees if a tie occurs in the nomination process.

Although members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences generally are invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings, but instead receive access to a private online listening service.

==Final voting==
After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general field and cast ten votes in various genre categories spread to three of the eleven fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the independent accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. After vote tabulation, winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins, and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two [or more] nominees who tie are considered winners). Winners are presented with a Grammy Award; those who do not win receive a medal for their nomination.

In both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote solely based on quality, without consideration for sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. Gifts may not be accepted. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries, they have no vote.

==Certificates==
In many categories, certificates are presented to those ineligible for a Grammy Award but who did contribute to a winning recording. These certificates are known as Participation Certificates or Winners Certificates. Those eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks after the Grammy ceremony.

==Special honors==
===Grammy Legend===
A special Grammy Award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize &quot;ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field&quot;. It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies. fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.

===Salute to Industry Icons Award===
The Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovative contributions to the music industry. Recipients include:

* Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss
* Irving Azoff
* Martin Bandier
* Richard Branson
* Clive Davis
* Prince
* Ahmet Ertegun
* David Geffen
* Berry Gordy
* Lucian Grainge
* Jay-Z
* Debra L. Lee
* Doug Morris
* Mo Ostin
* L.A. Reid
* Sean Diddy Combs
* Julie Greenwald and Craig Kallman
* Rob Stringer
* Jon Platt

==Leading winners==

With 35 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé is the artist with the most Grammy wins. U2, with 22 Grammy Awards, holds the record for most awards won by a group.

==Criticism==
===Commercialism===
When Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band&#x27;s lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this means. I don&#x27;t think it means anything.&quot; In 2008, Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group the Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music &quot;that&#x27;s fully industry based&quot;. He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year&#x27;s ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards. Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band&#x27;s awards, explaining that:

The Grammys have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful ones. In 1991, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor became the first musician to refuse a Grammy, boycotting the ceremony after being nominated for Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance. O&#x27;Connor would go on to win the latter award. She said her reasoning came from the Grammys&#x27; extreme commercialism. In 2024, Rhiannon Giddens described the financial strain of attending the ceremony for middle and working class musicians. She criticized the Recording Academy for introducing a policy of charging nominees $1200 for a plus one, saying the policy &quot;makes it ever more obvious who is valued, and more specifically what (that would be lots of money, for the folks in the back).&quot; A &quot;Billboard&quot; article clarified that the new policy was a tiered system, ranging from $375 to $2000 for a ticket to attend the pre-telecast ceremony.

===Reactions to nominations and awards===
The Grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists. The organization&#x27;s awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by voting members of the Recording Academy and that voting members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process, such as performers, songwriters, producers, and engineers.

Nomination review committees, composed of anonymous industry figures, were established following the 37th Grammy Awards, which attracted criticism for the slate of Album of the Year nominations. The winner, Tony Bennett&#x27;s live album &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, competed against the live classical album &quot;The Three Tenors in Concert 1994&quot;, Seal&#x27;s second eponymous album, and the twelfth albums from Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton, both longtime musical mainstays. Not nominated that year were several albums that would later be recognized as classics, including Nas&#x27;s debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot;, Oasis&#x27;s debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, Hole&#x27;s album &quot;Live Through This&quot;, Jeff Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Grace&quot;, and the debut album from Wu-Tang Clan. The nomination review committees would be disbanded in 2021 following criticism of the lack of nominations for the Weeknd&#x27;s album &quot;After Hours&quot;.

At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, artist Mariah Carey was nominated for six awards for her album &quot;Daydream&quot;, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for her single &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;. Although critics believed Carey would be &quot;cleaning up&quot; that year, Carey ultimately lost in all her nominated categories that night, much to the shock of critics and Carey herself. In 2011, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Randall Roberts criticized the exclusion of Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; from Album of the Year nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards. He described West&#x27;s album as &quot;the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record&quot;. Roberts went on to criticize the Grammy Awards for being &quot;mired in the past&quot; and out of touch with &quot;new media&quot; and trends among music listeners such as music sharing, stating:

In an article for &quot;Time&quot;, journalist Touré also responded to the snub and expressed general displeasure with the awards, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year.&quot; He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to Kremlinology and commented on The Recording Academy&#x27;s exclusion of more &quot;mature&quot; hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate &quot;pop-friendly&quot; hip hop albums instead.

In a 2011 profile for &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the 53rd Grammy Awards, frontman Justin Vernon of indie band Bon Iver was asked about the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded:

He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:

Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards. After winning, Vernon said in his acceptance, &quot;It&#x27;s really hard to accept this award. There&#x27;s so much talent out here [...] and there&#x27;s a lot of talent that&#x27;s not here tonight. It&#x27;s also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I&#x27;m a little bit uncomfortable up here.&quot;

In his article &quot;Everything Old Is Praised Again&quot;, Jon Caramanica of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Grammy voters for being &quot;conservative&quot; and disregarding more &quot;forward-looking&quot; music and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, &quot;for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change.&quot; He cited the Grammy successes of Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998), Norah Jones&#x27; &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; (2003), and Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot; (2011) as examples of &quot;the Grammys drop[ping] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album&quot;. Of Kanye West&#x27;s absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, &quot;He didn&#x27;t even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized.&quot;

In an article for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, music executive and author Steve Stoute criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having &quot;lost touch with contemporary popular culture&quot; and noted &quot;two key sources&quot; for it: &quot;(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic.&quot; Stoute accused the academy of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000) and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot; (2007) in the Album of the Year category. Stoute asserted:

In 2020, Canadian artist Abel Tesfaye, known by his stage name the Weeknd, was shut out from the Grammys when his fourth studio album, &quot;After Hours&quot;, received no nominations at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. This came as a surprise to critics, fans, and Tesfaye himself, who had a successful run in 2020 with the success of both his album and the single &quot;Blinding Lights&quot;. Tesfaye responded by social media calling the Grammys &quot;corrupt&quot;. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance, as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&amp;B, contributed to the snubs. Harvey Mason, Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, responded by saying:

We understand that The Weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated. I was surprised and can empathize with what he&#x27;s feeling. His music this year was excellent, and his contributions to the music community and broader world are worthy of everyone&#x27;s admiration. We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before. Unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists. But as the only peer-voted music award, we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community. To be clear, voting in all categories ended well before The Weeknd&#x27;s performance at the Super Bowl was announced, so in no way could it have affected the nomination process. All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence, and we congratulate them all.

===Formatting===
The Grammys&#x27; eligibility period runs from October 1 of one year until September 30 of the next year. Records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year&#x27;s awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time). This is despite the quarter falling during the Christmas and holiday season, when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving, and when Christmas music is at its natural peak.

Fans unfamiliar with the Grammys voting window perennially hold a mistaken notion that a favorite artist has then been snubbed; for example, Adele&#x27;s album &quot;25&quot; was released in November 2015 and thus was ineligible for nomination for the 2015 awards, despite its massive sales, earning its Grammys (including Album of the Year) instead in 2017. Conversely, the Grammys often recognize work more than a year after it was released. Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;1989&quot; won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album came out in October 2014.

===Accusations of racial bias===
The Grammys have also been accused of a racist bias against black recording artists. In a 2017 interview Canadian artist Drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage. He criticized the snubbing of &quot;One Dance&quot; for the Record of the Year award and the nomination of &quot;Hotline Bling&quot; for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, despite it not being a rap song. &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of &quot;sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one&quot;. Drake did not attend the 2017 awards ceremony where he was nominated. He had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the ceremony. Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album &quot;Blonde&quot; for award consideration as a protest.

The Grammys were also criticized after the 59th Annual Grammy Awards when Adele&#x27;s &quot;25&quot; (as mentioned above, released in late 2015) won Album of the Year over Beyoncé&#x27;s album &quot;Lemonade&quot; (released in April 2016), which many music publications believed should have won the award. Steve Knopper of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and for her pro-Black performance during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. &quot;USA Today&quot; also criticized Beyoncé&#x27;s loss stating that &quot;Black artists have struggled to win album of the year&quot;. They also felt &quot;25&quot; won only due to the album&#x27;s record-breaking sales rather than having cultural significance and the large impact that &quot;Lemonade&quot; had in 2016. Adele also expressed that &quot;Lemonade&quot; should have won over her for Album of the Year, stating in her acceptance speech:

 In 2019, for the first time since Outkast won Album of the Year in 2004, rap artists won major award nominations outside the rap categories when Childish Gambino won the first Song and Record of the Year awards ever for a rap song. Hispanic and Latino Americans (the largest minority in America) are also considered to be under-represented at the Grammy Awards, and their music is prone to be shifted to the categories of the Latin Grammy Awards unless they have a mainstream following.

In April 2022, the late Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar was omitted from the In Memoriam segment, and the nation&#x27;s domestic media criticized the Grammys and Oscars for their Western-centric view of artists receiving attention over those throughout the rest of the world.

===Issues with women===
The Grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically. Notably at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018, New Zealand singer Lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to Tom Petty but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the Album of the Year award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance. Lorde&#x27;s mother Sonja Yelich also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article that only nine percent of the nominees at the previous six Grammy ceremonies were women. After the ceremony, several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist SZA who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories, and to the Best Pop Solo Performance category which included four female nominees but was won by Ed Sheeran. Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, sparked controversy after stating in an interview that female artists needed to &quot;step up&quot; in order to win awards. Portnow&#x27;s comments were criticized by many female musicians including Pink, Katy Perry, Vanessa Carlton, Sheryl Crow, Iggy Azalea, Halsey, and Charli XCX. They also caused the hashtag #GrammysSoMale to trend on social media.

Before the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019, singer Ariana Grande decided not to perform or attend that year&#x27;s ceremony over a disagreement about the song choices for her performance. An anonymous source told &quot;Variety&quot; that Grande felt &quot;insulted&quot; when producers refused to let the singer perform her latest single &quot;7 Rings&quot;. They compromised by having her perform the song as part of a medley, but the condition that the producers choose the second song led Grande to withdraw from the show. The source said that the same stipulations were not imposed on other performers. Grande later accused Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich of lying about why she dropped out of the show. Ehrlich had said that Grande &quot;felt it was too late for her to pull something together&quot;. Grande responded:
Despite the controversy, Grande won for Best Pop Vocal Album and in 2020 performed at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards when nominated for five awards, including Album of the Year, but won none. Despite past controversies, female artists dominated the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, with the big four awards being awarded entirely to women. Several women also broke records at that ceremony.

In May 2018, it was revealed that money intended for the Recording Academy charity MusiCares was siphoned off to pay for the cost overruns of hosting the 60th Annual Grammy Awards at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Concerning the controversies of hosting that year&#x27;s Grammy Awards in New York, Dana Tomarken, the former executive vice president of the MusiCares foundation claimed wrongful termination. She alleges that she was fired for pushing back against the Academy&#x27;s &quot;boys club&quot;. She claimed that by having the MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute to Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall, the event had to forgo its traditional VIP dinner and silent auction. She had already been offered a deal to have the event at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Barclays Center is owned by AEG, which competes directly with The Madison Square Garden Company which owns Madison Square Garden and Radio City. Irving Azoff, who then had a joint venture with the Madison Square Garden Company, told Tomarken that the event can not be held at Barclays and had to be held at Radio City. Oak View Group, which is associated with Azoff, received 300 of the highest price tickets to the MusiCares event at Radio City. Oak View Group was supposed to sell them as a package deal which also included tickets to the Grammy Awards themselves. MusiCares was promised to receive $1.5 million from those tickets according to Tomarken. Those 300 tickets were never sold and were then returned to MusiCares, which resulted in a loss.

In June 2019, rapper Nicki Minaj spoke up against the Grammys for allegedly blackballing her after her controversial performance of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. Minaj claimed that producer Ken Ehrlich, who had previously accepted the performance, wanted her to cancel it last minute due to what he excused as the passing of Whitney Houston. Minaj however refused his request and performed anyway. She accused that shortly after the performance, Ehrlich had snubbed her from winning the Best New Artist category, which was awarded to Bon Iver. In October 2022, Minaj went after the Grammys again for snubbing her song &quot;Super Freaky Girl&quot; from the rap categories at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards and instead placing it in the pop categories. By way of comparison, Minaj mentioned Latto&#x27;s 2021 song &quot;Big Energy&quot; being potentially considered for the rap categories, saying that if Minaj&#x27;s own single is not being qualified as a rap song, neither should be Latto&#x27;s. She also accused the Grammys of purposely placing her in those categories to favor other artists over her, such as Adele and Harry Styles. After Minaj&#x27;s comments, Latto later responded to her in a series of tweets, leading them into a back-and-forth argument. Subsequently, Minaj&#x27;s song was not nominated for any categories for the ceremony, while Latto received nominations for the Best New Artist category as well as the Best Melodic Rap Performance category for the latter song.

Recording Academy CEO Deborah Dugan was placed on leave on January 16, 2020, after a complaint of bullying from a member of staff (according to an anonymous &quot;New York Times&quot; source), ten days before the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. Dugan had complained internally, alleging a broken system of voting that was subject to conflicts of interest and unnecessary spending. On the nominations for the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, she stated that the voting process was an &quot;outrageous conflict of interest&quot; with several nominated artists sitting on the voting boards of their prospective categories. She claimed that &quot;one artist who initially ranked 18 out of 20 in the 2019 &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; category ended up with a nomination&quot;. She also claimed that a few artists like Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande had the votes to be nominated for the category, but were ultimately omitted.

In 2020, comedy star Tiffany Haddish turned down the invitation to host the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards pre-telecast premiere ceremony when they said that she would have to pay her own way. In an exclusive interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Haddish revealed that she was told to cover the cost of hair, makeup, and wardrobe for the three-hour event, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if this might mean I might not get nominated ever again, but I think it&#x27;s disrespectful&quot;. When contacted, the Recording Academy explained that the premiere ceremony is not a CBS program and is hosted by the Academy, a not-for-profit organization, meaning that artists, hosts and performers have to perform free every year. They also noted that the issue would have no impact in Haddish&#x27;s future nomination.

In 2022, the Grammys were criticized for nominating, and subsequently awarding, Louis C.K. a Best Comedy Album prize for his comedy special &quot;Sincerely Louis C.K.&quot; The album made light of, and included jokes about, the multiple sexual misconduct revelations he had admitted to years earlier. In 2023, the Grammys faced significant backlash for debuting a new award called the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, due to the rapper&#x27;s history of violence against women.

==TV broadcasts and ratings==
Before the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on ABC, a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called &quot;The Best on Record&quot; was broadcast on NBC. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot;, which normally was devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two venues. Television producer Pierre Cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast. CBS bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to Nashville, Tennessee; the American Music Awards were created for ABC by the late Dick Clark as a result.

The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract, the network would also air a &quot;nominations concert&quot; special in the last week of November, where nominations would be released during a special exclusive to CBS, rather than at a traditional early-morning press conference to a multi-network press pool. This was ended after the 2016 concert due to low ratings and criticism about the announcement format, and as of the 2017 nominations, they have been revealed in a roundtable conversation with Recording Academy representatives during &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, though since 2020, it has returned to a traditional noontime Eastern press release statement and highlight of in-show award nominees on social media. In 2016, the Grammys became the first awards show to regularly air live annually in all U.S. territories, and for decades, alongside the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Tony Awards, the shows have aired live in over 150 countries worldwide.

From 2004 to 2019, the Grammys were held on the second Sunday of February (the week after the Super Bowl), with two exceptions: if that day was February 14 (Valentine&#x27;s Day), it was moved to the following day; if it was a Winter Olympics year, it was held earlier on the last Sunday of January (the week before the Super Bowl). Starting in 2020, the Academy Awards ceremony would move back to the second Sunday of February, forcing the Grammys to move back to the last Sunday of January to avoid conflict with either the Oscars or the Super Bowl. To allow enough time for preparation, the cutoff date for eligible recordings would move from September 30 to August 31. This change reduced the eligibility period for the 2020 awards to eleven months (October 1, 2018 August 31, 2019), a month shorter than usual.

On October 30, 2024, the Recording Academy announced a ten-year broadcast deal with Disney, which sees the Grammys move to ABC, Disney+, and Hulu starting in 2027; the move ends the Grammys&#x27; 54-year relationship with CBS.

<text>The Grammy Award for Song of the Year is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. The Song of the Year award is one of the four most prestigious categories at the awards (alongside Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Album of the Year), presented annually since the 1st Grammy Awards in 1959. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award is presented: 

If a winning song contains samples or interpolations of existing material, the publisher and songwriter(s) of the original song(s) can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Song of the Year is related to but is conceptually different from Record of the Year or Album of the Year:

* Song of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. &quot;Song&quot; in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.
* Record of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, &quot;record&quot; means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, &quot;album&quot; means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.

==History and description==
The Song of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959. It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both the Record of the Year award and Song of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes only to the composer(s) of the song whereas the Record of the Year award goes to the performer(s) and production team for a particular recording of the song. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award is given to the songwriter(s) of a song that &quot;must contain melody and lyrics and must be either a new song or a song first achieving prominence during the eligibility year. Songs containing prominent samples or interpolations are not eligible&quot;.

The award has not always been restricted to new or newly prominent songs; for instance, in 1992, when the winner was Natalie Cole&#x27;s cover of &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (a song that had first been recorded by Nat King Cole and achieved prominence in the 1950s), the rule was merely that the song had to have been recorded during the eligibility year and not previously nominated for the award.

Since the late 1960s other songwriter&#x27;s awards have been presented for genre-specific categories, including Grammy Award for Best Country Song (since 1965), Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song (since 1969), Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media (since 1988), Grammy Award for Best Rock Song (since 1992), and most recently Grammy Award for Best Rap Song (since 2004), Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song (from 2006 to 2014), Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Song (from 2012 to 2014), Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song (since 2014), Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance/Song (since 2015), and Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song (since 2015).

The category was expanded to include eight nominees in 2019 and 10 nominees in 2022. The number of nominees was reverted to eight starting with the 2024 ceremony.

As of 2023, a distinct category to honor songwriters was established: Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical.

== Achievements ==

In many cases, the songwriters were also the performers (Domenico Modugno, Henry Mancini, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney, Joe South, Paul Simon, Carole King, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Michael McDonald, Christopher Cross, Sting, Michael Jackson &amp; Lionel Richie, Bobby McFerrin, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Seal, Shawn Colvin, Rob Thomas, U2, Alicia Keys, Luther Vandross, John Mayer, Dixie Chicks, Amy Winehouse, Coldplay, Beyoncé, Lady Antebellum, Adele, Fun, Lorde, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Childish Gambino, Billie Eilish, H.E.R., Anderson .Paak, Bonnie Raitt and Kendrick Lamar).

Dernst Emile II is the only songwriter to win Song of the Year in two consecutive years: in 2021 (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Breathe&quot;) and 2022 (&quot;Leave the Door Open&quot;).

Other multiple winners in this category include Henry Mancini (&quot;Moon River&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;); Johnny Mercer (&quot;Moon River&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;); James Horner (&quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;); Will Jennings (&quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;); U2 (&quot;Beautiful Day&quot; and &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;); Adele (&quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;); Christopher Brody Brown (&quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot; and &quot;Leave the Door Open&quot;); Bruno Mars (&quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot; and &quot;Leave the Door Open&quot;); Billie Eilish (&quot;Bad Guy&quot; and &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;); and Finneas O&#x27;Connell (&quot;Bad Guy&quot; and &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;), winning two times each. However, songs written for Andy Williams, Roberta Flack, Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler have received this award twice.

American singer/songwriter Taylor Swift is the most nominated songwriter in this category with eight nominations for &quot;You Belong with Me&quot;, &quot;Shake It Off&quot;, &quot;Blank Space&quot;, &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;Cardigan&quot;, &quot;All Too Well (10 Minute Version)&quot;, &quot;Anti-Hero&quot; and &quot;Fortnight&quot;; although she has yet to win the award. Followed by Jack Antonoff, Beyoncé, Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie with six nominations each.

Johnny Mercer, Jimmy Webb, Bobby Russell, Burt Bacharach, Hal David, Kris Kristofersson, Michael McDonald, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Tim Rice, Brandi Carlile, Dernst Emile II and Jack Antonoff are the only songwriters with multiple nominations in the same year, with Antonoff achieving it twice; while Carlile and Emile achieved it in the same ceremony.

The first woman to win the award was Carole King in 1972, for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. Adele was the first female songwriter to win the award twice, winning for &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;.

Lorde is the youngest songwriter to win in the category, winning for &quot;Royals&quot; in 2014 at the age of 17; while Irving Gordon is the oldest songwriter to win the award, winning for &quot;Unforgettable&quot; in 1992 at age 77.

Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish are the only artists to receive the Grammys for Song of the Year as well as Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Best New Artist in a single ceremony. Adele was the first artist to win the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Best New Artist on separate occasions. Only six artists have won the Song of the Year and Best New Artist awards the same year: Christopher Cross (&quot;Sailing&quot; in 1981), Alicia Keys (&quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot; in 2002), Amy Winehouse (&quot;Rehab&quot; in 2008), Fun (&quot;We Are Young&quot; in 2013), Sam Smith (&quot;Stay with Me (Darkchild Version)&quot; in 2015) and Billie Eilish (&quot;Bad Guy&quot; in 2020); Marvin Hamlisch is the only composer to win the Song of the Year and Best New Artist awards the same year in 1975, for &quot;The Way We Were&quot;.

John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Lionel Richie, Diane Warren, Billie Eilish, H.E.R, Finneas O&#x27;Connell and Taylor Swift are the only songwriters to receive three consecutive nominations for Song of the Year.

The song &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu (Volare)&quot;, winner in 1959, written by Domenico Modugno and performed in Italian, is the only foreign-language song to win this award, although the 1967 winner &quot;Michelle&quot; penned by Lennon–McCartney for The Beatles to perform, has a critical part of its lyrics in French.

The Ernest Gold song &quot;Theme of Exodus&quot;, which won in 1961, is the only instrumental song to ever receive this award.

The first and only tie in this category in Grammy history took place in 1978, when both Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &amp; Paul Williams&#x27; &quot;Evergreen (Love Theme from &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;)&quot; and Joe Brooks&#x27; &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; won the award.

The first time in Grammy history that two different songs with the same title have been nominated in this category happened with &quot;Hello&quot; written by Lionel Richie in 1985 and &quot;Hello&quot; by Adele &amp; Greg Kurstin in 2017.

The song with the most writers to win this award is &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot;, which won in 2018 with eight writers. The song with the most writers nominated in this category is &quot;Peaches&quot;, which had 11 co-writers nominated for the 2022 ceremony.

&quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem was the first rap song to be nominated while &quot;This is America&quot; by Childish Gambino and &quot;Not Like Us&quot; by Kendrick Lamar are the only ones to ever win the award.

Thirty-two of the winning songs have also won the award for Record of the Year.

==Process==
From 1995 to 2018, members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominated their choices for song of the year. A list of the top twenty records was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then selected the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot. The rest of the members then vote a winner from the five nominees. In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated tracks would be increased to eight. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for song of the year would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed &quot;Kiss Me More&quot; by Doja Cat featuring SZA and &quot;Right on Time&quot; by Brandi Carlile to be nominated as they were the songs that received the most votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.
