<text>Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968. They have undergone numerous line-up changes throughout their history; their most notable line-ups include lead singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarists Steve Howe and Trevor Rabin, drummers Bill Bruford and Alan White, and keyboardists Tony Kaye, Rick Wakeman, and Patrick Moraz. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. Since February 2023, the band consists of Howe, keyboardist Geoff Downes, bassist Billy Sherwood, singer Jon Davison, and drummer Jay Schellen.

Founded by Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, and guitarist Peter Banks, Yes began performing a mix of original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as showcased on their first two albums &quot;Yes&quot; (1969) and &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970). A change of direction later in 1970 led to a series of successful progressive rock albums, with four consecutive U.S. platinum or multi-platinum sellers in &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971), &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972) and the live album &quot;Yessongs&quot; (1973). Further albums, &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973), &quot;Relayer&quot; (1974), &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tormato&quot; (1978), were also commercially successful. Yes toured as a major rock act that earned the band a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by Roger Dean. The success of &quot;Roundabout&quot;, the single from &quot;Fragile&quot;, cemented their popularity across the decade and beyond. The early 1970s saw line-up changes, with Banks, Kaye, and Bruford giving way to Howe, Wakeman, and White respectively, while Moraz was with the band for &quot;Relayer&quot; and its subsequent tour. In 1980, growing musical differences led to Anderson and Wakeman&#x27;s simultaneous departure, after which Yes merged with new wave duo the Buggles (singer Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes) for the album &quot;Drama&quot; (1980), before officially disbanding in 1981.

In 1983, Squire, White, Anderson, and Kaye reformed Yes with Rabin joining. Rabin&#x27;s songwriting moved the band toward a more pop-oriented sound, the result of which was &quot;90125&quot; (1983), their highest-selling album, which featured the band&#x27;s only U.S. number-one single, &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;. Its follow-up, &quot;Big Generator&quot; (1987), was also successful. In 1989, Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe formed a separate group and released a self-titled album. At the suggestion of the record company, both groups merged into an eight-piece line-up for &quot;Union&quot; (1991) and its tour. The combined group was short-lived, and from 1994 to 2001, Yes regularly released studio albums with some line-up changes and varying levels of success.

After a second hiatus, Yes once again reformed in 2009, with Benoît David as the new lead singer. David was replaced by Davidson in 2012. Squire died in 2015, leaving the band with no original members, while White&#x27;s death in 2022 left Howe as the only remaining member from the 1970s era. Former members Anderson, Rabin, and Wakeman collaborated from 2016 to 2018, but did not release a studio album. Yes&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Mirror to the Sky&quot;, was released in 2023.

Yes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. With a discography spanning 23 studio albums, they have sold 13.5 million Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified albums in the U.S., as well as more than 30 million albums worldwide. In 1985, they won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance with &quot;Cinema&quot;, and received five Grammy nominations between 1985 and 1992. They were ranked No. 94 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. In April 2017, Yes—specifically Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Wakeman, White, and Rabin—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== History ==
=== 1968–1970: Formation, first album and &quot;Time and a Word&quot; ===
In late 1967, bassist Chris Squire and guitarist Peter Banks, both formerly of the Syn, joined the psychedelic rock band Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop, which had formed in 1966 by Clive Bayley and Robert Hagger. They played at the Marquee Club in Soho, London where Jack Barrie, owner of the nearby La Chasse club, saw them perform. &quot;There was nothing outstanding about them&quot;, he recalled, &quot;the musicianship was very good but it was obvious they weren&#x27;t going anywhere&quot;. Barrie introduced Squire to singer Jon Anderson, a worker at the bar in La Chasse, who found they shared interests in Simon &amp; Garfunkel and harmony singing. That evening at Squire&#x27;s house they wrote &quot;Sweetness&quot; which was included on the first Yes album, and Anderson subsequently joined as lead vocalist. In June 1968, Hagger was replaced by Bill Bruford, who had placed an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, while in July the classically trained organist and pianist Tony Kaye, of Johnny Taylor&#x27;s Star Combo and the Federals, became the keyboardist. This line-up rehearsed in the basement of The Lucky Horseshoe cafe on Shaftesbury Avenue between 10 June and 9 July 1968. Meanwhile, Banks had left Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop to join Neat Change, but he was dismissed by this group on 14 July 1968 and was finally recalled by Squire, replacing Bayley as guitarist. The last gig by Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop was on 27 July, at Newmarket.

Having considered the experience of Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop concluded, the group exchanged ideas for a new name. Anderson suggested Life and Squire thought of World, but the five agreed on Yes, which Banks had thought of a couple of years before. After rehearsals between 31 July and 2 August, the first gig as Yes followed at a youth camp in East Mersea, Essex on 3 August. Early sets were formed of cover songs from artists such as the Beatles, The 5th Dimension and Traffic. On 16 September, Yes performed at Blaise&#x27;s club in London as a substitute for Sly and the Family Stone, who had failed to turn up. They were well received by the audience, including the host Roy Flynn, who became the band&#x27;s manager that night. That month, Bruford decided to quit performing to study at the University of Leeds. His replacement, Tony O&#x27;Reilly of the Koobas, struggled to perform with the rest of the group on stage and former Warriors and future King Crimson drummer Ian Wallace subbed for one gig on 5 November 1968. After Bruford was refused a year&#x27;s sabbatical leave from Leeds, Anderson and Squire convinced him to return for Yes&#x27;s supporting slot for Cream&#x27;s farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 November.

After seeing an early King Crimson gig in 1969, Yes realised that there was suddenly stiff competition on the London gigging circuit, and they needed to be much more technically proficient, starting regular rehearsals. They subsequently signed a deal with Atlantic Records, and, that August, released their debut album &quot;Yes&quot;. Compiled of mostly original material, the record includes renditions of &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;I See You&quot; by The Byrds. Although the album failed to break into the UK album charts, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Lester Bangs complimented the album&#x27;s &quot;sense of style, taste and subtlety&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; columnist Tony Wilson chose Yes and Led Zeppelin as the two bands &quot;most likely to succeed&quot;.

Following a tour of Scandinavia with Faces, Yes performed a solo concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 21 March 1970. The second half consisted of excerpts from their second album &quot;Time and a Word&quot;, accompanied by a 20-piece youth orchestra. Banks left the group on 18 April 1970, just three months before the album&#x27;s release. Having expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of recording with an orchestra as well as the sacking of Flynn earlier in the year, Banks later indicated that he was fired by Anderson and Squire, and that Kaye and Bruford had no prior knowledge that it would be happening. Similar to the first album, &quot;Time and a Word&quot; features original songs and two new covers–&quot;Everydays&quot; by Buffalo Springfield and &quot;No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed&quot; by Richie Havens. The album broke into the UK charts, peaking at number 45. Banks&#x27; replacement was Tomorrow guitarist Steve Howe, who appears in the photograph of the group on the American issue despite not having played on it.

=== 1970–1974: &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; ===
The band retreated to a rented farmhouse in Devon to write and rehearse new songs for their following album. Howe established himself as an integral part of the group&#x27;s sound with his Gibson ES-175 and variety of acoustic guitars. With producer and engineer Eddy Offord, recording sessions lasted as long as 12 hours with each track being assembled from small sections at a time, which were pieced together to form a complete track. The band would then learn to play the song through after the final mix was complete. Released in February 1971, &quot;The Yes Album&quot; peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 40 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts.

Yes embarked on a 28-day tour of Europe with Iron Butterfly in January 1971. The band purchased Iron Butterfly&#x27;s entire public address system, which improved their on-stage performance and sound. Their first date in North America followed on 24 June in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, supporting Jethro Tull. Friction arose between Howe and Kaye on tour; this, along with Kaye&#x27;s reported reluctance to play the Mellotron and the Minimoog synthesizer, preferring to stick exclusively to piano and Hammond organ, led to the keyboardist being fired from the band in the summer of 1971. Anderson recalled in a 2019 interview: &quot;Steve and Chris came over and said, &#x27;Look, Tony Kaye... great guy.&#x27; But, you know, we&#x27;d just seen Rick Wakeman about a month earlier. And I said, &#x27;There&#x27;s that Rick Wakeman guy,&#x27; and we&#x27;ve got to get on with life and move on, you know, rather than keep going on, set in the same circle. And that&#x27;s what happens with a band.&quot; Wakeman, a classically trained player who had left the folk rock group Strawbs earlier in the year, was already a noted studio musician, with credits including T. Rex, David Bowie, Cat Stevens and Elton John. Squire commented that he could play &quot;a grand piano for three bars, a Mellotron for two bars and a Moog for the next one absolutely spot on&quot;, which gave Yes the orchestral and choral textures that befitted their new material.

Released on 12 November 1971, the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Fragile&quot; showcased their growing interest in the structures of classical music, with an excerpt of &quot;The Firebird&quot; by Igor Stravinsky being played at the start of their concerts since the album&#x27;s 1971–1972 tour. Each member performed a solo track on the album, and it marked the start of their long collaboration with artist Roger Dean, who designed the group&#x27;s logo, album art and stage sets. &quot;Fragile&quot; peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 4 in the U.S. after it was released there in January 1972, and was their first record to reach the top ten in North America. A shorter version of the opening track, &quot;Roundabout&quot;, was released as a single that peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

In February 1972, Yes recorded a cover version of &quot;America&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel and released it in July. The single reached number 46 on the U.S. singles chart. The track subsequently appeared on &quot;The New Age of Atlantic&quot;, a 1972 compilation album of several bands signed to Atlantic Records, and again in the 1975 compilation &quot;Yesterdays&quot;.

Released in September 1972, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth album, was their most ambitious work so far. At 19 minutes, the title track took up an entire side on the vinyl record and combined elements of classical music, psychedelic rock, pop and jazz. The album reached number 3 in the U.S. and number 4 on the UK charts. &quot;And You and I&quot; was released as a single that peaked at number 42 in the U.S. The growing critical and commercial success of the band was not enough to retain Bruford, who left Yes in the summer of 1972, before the album&#x27;s release, to join King Crimson. The band considered several possible replacements, including Aynsley Dunbar (who was playing with Frank Zappa at the time), and decided on former Plastic Ono Band drummer Alan White, a friend of Anderson and Offord who had once sat in with the band weeks before Bruford&#x27;s departure. White learned the band&#x27;s repertoire in three days before embarking on their 1972–1973 tour.

By this point, Yes were beginning to enjoy worldwide commercial and critical success. Their early touring with White was featured on &quot;Yessongs&quot;, a triple live album released in May 1973 that documented shows from 1972. The album reached number 7 in the UK and number 12 in the U.S. A concert film of the same name premiered in 1975 that documented their shows at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre in December 1972, with added psychedelic visual images and effects.

&quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; was the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, released on 7 December 1973. It marked a change in their fortunes and polarised fans and critics alike. The double vinyl set was based on Anderson&#x27;s interpretation of the Shastric scriptures from a footnote within Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. The album became the first LP in the UK to ship gold before the record arrived at retailers. It went on to top the UK charts for two weeks while reaching number 6 in the U.S., and became the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive gold album. Wakeman was not pleased with the record and is critical of much of its material. He felt sections were &quot;bled to death&quot; and contained too much musical padding. Wakeman left the band after the 1973–1974 tour; his solo album &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; topped the UK charts in May 1974. The tour included five consecutive sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre, the first time a rock band achieved this.

=== 1974–1980: &quot;Relayer&quot;, &quot;Going for the One&quot;, &quot;Tormato&quot; and the Paris sessions ===
Several musicians were approached to replace Wakeman, including Vangelis Papathanassiou, Eddie Jobson of Roxy Music and former Atlantis/Cat Stevens keyboardist Jean Roussel. Howe says he also asked Keith Emerson, who did not want to leave Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Yes ultimately chose Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz of Refugee, who arrived in August 1974 during the recording sessions for &quot;Relayer&quot;, which took place at Squire&#x27;s home in Virginia Water, Surrey. Released in November that year, &quot;Relayer&quot; showcased a jazz fusion-influenced direction the band were pursuing. The album features the 22-minute track titled &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;, which highlights a battle initially inspired by &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy. Its closing section, &quot;Soon&quot;, was subsequently released as a single. The album reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 5 in the U.S. Yes embarked on their 1974–1975 tour to support &quot;Relayer&quot;. The compilation album &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, released in 1975, contained tracks from Yes&#x27;s first two albums, the B-side track from their &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; single from 1970 titled &quot;Dear Father&quot;, and the original ten-minute version of their cover of &quot;America&quot;.

Between 1975 and 1976, each member of the band released a solo album. Their subsequent 1976 tour of North America with Peter Frampton featured some of the band&#x27;s most-attended shows. The show of 12 June, also supported by Gary Wright and Pousette-Dart Band at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, attracted over 100,000 people. Roger Dean&#x27;s brother Martyn was the main designer behind the tour&#x27;s &quot;Crab Nebula&quot; stage set, while Roger and fabric designer Felicity Youette provided the backgrounds.
In late 1976, the band travelled to Switzerland and started recording for their album &quot;Going for the One&quot; at Mountain Studios, Montreux. It was then that Anderson sent early versions of &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; to Wakeman, who felt he could contribute to such material better than the band&#x27;s past releases. Moraz was let go, after Wakeman was booked initially on a session musician basis, before being convinced by Squire to re-join the band full time. Upon its release in July 1977, &quot;Going for the One&quot; topped the UK album charts for two weeks and reached number 8 in the U.S. &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; and &quot;Going for the One&quot; were released as singles in the UK and reached numbers 7 and 25, respectively. Although the album&#x27;s cover was designed by Hipgnosis, it still features their Roger Dean &quot;bubble&quot; logotype. The band&#x27;s 1977 tour spanned across six months.

&quot;Tormato&quot; was released in September 1978 at the height of punk rock in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes. Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the Birotron, a tape replay keyboard, and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the U.S. charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the RIAA. Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band&#x27;s 1978–1979 tour was a commercial success. Concerts were performed in the round with a £50,000 revolving stage and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Their dates at Madison Square Gardens earned Yes a Golden Ticket Award for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.

In October 1979, the band convened in Paris with producer Roy Thomas Baker. Their diverse approach was now succumbing to division, as Anderson and Wakeman favoured the more fantastical and delicate approach while the rest preferred a heavier rock sound. Howe, Squire and White liked none of the music Anderson was offering at the time as it was too lightweight and lacking in the heaviness that they were generating in their own writing sessions. The Paris sessions abruptly ended in December after White broke his foot while rollerskating in a roller disco.

When the band, minus Wakeman (who had only committed to recording keyboard overdubs once new material would be ready to record), reconvened in February to resume work on the project, their growing musical differences, combined with internal dissension, obstructed progress. Journalist Chris Welch, after attending a rehearsal, noted that Anderson &quot;was singing without his usual conviction and seemed disinclined to talk&quot;. By late March, Howe, Squire and White had begun demoing material as an instrumental trio, increasingly uncertain about Anderson&#x27;s future involvement. Eventually, a serious band dispute over finance saw Anderson leave Yes, with a dispirited Wakeman departing at around the same time.

=== 1980–1981: &quot;Drama&quot; and split ===
In 1980, pop duo The Buggles (singer Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes) secured the services of Brian Lane, who had managed Yes since 1970, as their manager. The Buggles were best known for their 1979 hit single &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; from their album &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;. At this point, the departure of Anderson and Wakeman had been kept secret from everyone outside the Yes inner circle. Seeing an option of continuing the band with new creative input and expertise, Squire revealed the situation to Horn and Downes and suggested that they join Yes as full-time members. Horn and Downes accepted the invitation and the reconfigured band recorded the &quot;Drama&quot; album, which was released in August 1980. The record displayed a heavier, harder sound than the material Yes recorded with Anderson and Wakeman in 1979, opening with the lengthy hard rocker &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;. The album received substantial radio airplay in the late summer–fall of 1980, and peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 18 in the U.S., though it was the first Yes album to not be certified Gold by the RIAA since 1971. Their 1980 tour of North America and the UK received a mixed reaction from audiences. They were well received in the United States and were awarded with a commemorative certificate after they performed a record 16 consecutive sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden since 1974.

After the &quot;Drama&quot; tour, Yes reconvened in England to decide the band&#x27;s next step, beginning by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn was also dismissed, and went on to pursue a career in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980.

&quot;Yesshows&quot;, a live album recorded during 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released in November 1980, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US.

An announcement came from the group&#x27;s management in March 1981 confirming that Yes no longer existed. Downes and Howe soon reunited to form Asia with former King Crimson bassist and vocalist John Wetton, and drummer Carl Palmer from Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Squire and White continued to work together, initially recording sessions with Jimmy Page for a proposed band called XYZ (short for &quot;ex-Yes-and-Zeppelin&quot;) in the spring of 1981. Page&#x27;s former bandmate Robert Plant was also to be involved as the vocalist but he lost enthusiasm, citing his ongoing grieving for recently deceased Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. The short-lived group produced a few demo tracks, elements of which would appear in Page&#x27;s band the Firm and on future Yes tracks &quot;Mind Drive&quot; and &quot;Can You Imagine?&quot;. In late 1981, Squire and White released &quot;Run with the Fox&quot;, a Christmas single with Squire on vocals which received radio airplay through the 1980s and early 1990s during the Christmas periods. A second Yes compilation album, &quot;Classic Yes,&quot; was released in November 1981.

=== 1982–1988: First reformation, &quot;90125&quot; and &quot;Big Generator&quot; ===
At the beginning of 1982, Phil Carson of Atlantic Records introduced Squire and White to guitarist and singer Trevor Rabin, who had initially made his name with the South African supergroup Rabbitt, subsequently releasing three solo albums, working as a record producer and even briefly considered being a member of Asia. The three teamed up in a new band called Cinema, for which Squire also recruited the original Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye. Later in 1982, Cinema entered the studio to record their debut album. Although Rabin and Squire initially shared lead vocals for the project, Trevor Horn was briefly brought into Cinema as a potential singer, but soon opted to become the band&#x27;s producer instead.

Horn worked well with the band. However, his clashes with Tony Kaye (complicated by the fact that Rabin was playing most of the keyboards during the recording sessions) led to Kaye&#x27;s departure during the recording, though some of his playing was kept on the final album and he had returned by the time it was released. Meanwhile, Squire encountered Jon Anderson (who, since leaving Yes, had released two solo albums and had success with the Jon and Vangelis project) at a Los Angeles party and, encouraged by Atlantic Records vice president Phil Carson, played Anderson the Cinema demo tracks. Anderson was then invited into the project as lead singer and joined in April 1983 during the last few weeks of the sessions, having comparatively little creative input beyond adding his lead vocals and re-writing some lyrics.

At the suggestion of Carson and other Atlantic executives, Cinema then changed their name to Yes in June 1983. Rabin initially objected to this, as he now found that he had inadvertently joined a reunited band with a history and expectations, rather than help launch a new group. However, with four of the five members having been members of Yes (with three of them being original members, including the distinctive lead singer) it suggested that the name change was sound commercial strategy. The new album marked a significant change in style as the revived Yes had adopted more of a pop rock sound with few moments that recalled their progressive rock past. This incarnation of the band has sometimes been informally referred to as &quot;Yes-West&quot;, reflecting the band&#x27;s new base in Los Angeles rather than London.
Yes released their comeback album &quot;90125&quot; (named after its catalogue serial number on Atco Records) in November 1983. It became their biggest-selling album, certified by the RIAA at triple-platinum (3 million copies) in sales in the U.S., and introduced the band to younger fans. &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks and went on to reach the number-one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, the only single from Yes to do so, for two weeks in January 1984. Kaye&#x27;s short-term replacement on keyboards, Eddie Jobson, appeared briefly in the original video but was edited out as much as possible once Kaye had been persuaded to return to the band.

In 1984, two further singles from the album &quot;Leave It&quot; and &quot;It Can Happen&quot; reached number 24 and 57, respectively. Yes also earned their only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1985 for the two-minute track &quot;Cinema&quot;. They were also nominated for an award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals with &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, and a Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal award with &quot;90125&quot;. The band&#x27;s 1984–1985 tour was the most lucrative in their history and spawned the home video release &quot;9012Live&quot;, a concert film directed by Steven Soderbergh with added special effects from Charlex that cost $1 million. Issued in 1985, an accompanying live album also appeared that year, &quot;9012Live: The Solos&quot;, which earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for Squire&#x27;s solo track, a rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

Yes began recording for their twelfth album, &quot;Big Generator&quot;, in 1985, initially with Trevor Horn returning as producer. The sessions underwent many starts and stops due to the use of multiple recording locations in Italy, London and Los Angeles, with interpersonal problems leading to Horn leaving the sessions partway through, all of which kept the album from timely completion (the album was intended for a 1986 release, but by the end of that year it was still incomplete). Eventually Rabin took over final production. The album was released in September 1987, and immediately began receiving heavy radio airplay, with sales reaching number 17 in the UK and number 15 in the U.S. &quot;Big Generator&quot; earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988, and was also certified platinum (with 1 million-plus in sales) by the RIAA. The single &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; topped the Mainstream Rock chart, while &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; reached number 2 and &quot;Shoot High Aim Low&quot; number 11. The 1987–1988 tour ended with an appearance at Madison Square Garden on 14 May 1988 as part of the star-studded Atlantic Records 40th anniversary concert.

=== 1988–1995: &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot;, &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Talk&quot; ===
By the end of 1988, Anderson felt creatively sidelined by Rabin and Squire and had grown tired of the musical direction of the &quot;Yes-West&quot; line-up. He took leave of the band, asserting that he would never stay in Yes purely for the money, and started work in Montserrat on a solo project that eventually involved Wakeman, Howe and Bruford. This collaboration led to suggestions that there would be some kind of reformation of the &quot;classic&quot; Yes, although from the start the project had included bass player Tony Levin, whom Bruford had worked with in King Crimson. The project, rather than taking over or otherwise using the Yes name, was called Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH).

Their eponymous album, released in June 1989, featured &quot;Brother of Mine&quot;, which became an MTV hit and went gold in the United States. It later emerged that the four band members had not all recorded together; Anderson and producer Chris Kimsey slotted their parts into place. Howe has stated publicly that he was unhappy with the mix of his guitars on the album, though a version of &quot;Fist of Fire&quot; with more of Howe&#x27;s guitars left intact appeared on the &quot;In a Word: Yes&quot; box set in 2002. ABWH toured in 1989 and 1990 as &quot;An Evening of Yes Music&quot; which featured Levin, keyboardist Julian Colbeck, and guitarist Milton McDonald as support musicians. A live album and home video were recorded and released in 1993, both titled &quot;An Evening of Yes Music Plus&quot; that featured Jeff Berlin on bass due to Levin suffering from illness. The tour was also dogged by legal battles sparked by Atlantic Records due to the band&#x27;s references to Yes in promotional materials and the tour title.

Following the tour, the group returned to the recording studio to produce their second album, tentatively called &quot;Dialogue&quot;. After hearing the tracks, Arista Records refused to release the album as they felt the initial mixes were weak. They encouraged the group to seek outside songwriters, preferably ones who could help them deliver hit singles. Anderson approached Rabin about the situation, and Rabin sent Anderson a demo tape with three songs, indicating that ABWH could have one but had to send the others back. Arista listened to them and wanted all of them, proposing to create a combined album with both Yes factions.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Yes-West&quot; group had been working on a follow-up to &quot;Big Generator&quot; and had been shopping around for a new singer, auditioning Roger Hodgson of Supertramp, Steve Walsh of Kansas, Billy Sherwood of World Trade and solo pop/dance singer Robbie Nevil (who&#x27;d scored a US #2 hit in 1986 with &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;). Walsh only spent one day with the band, but Sherwood and Squire quickly established a rapport and continued with writing sessions, although Sherwood ultimately chose not to formally join the group or become the lead singer. Arista now suggested that the &quot;Yes-West&quot; group, with Anderson on vocals, record the songs from Rabin&#x27;s demo tape and add them to the incomplete ABWH album, which would then be released as a full album under the Yes name.

&quot;Union&quot; was released in April 1991 and is the thirteenth studio album from Yes. Each group played their own songs, with Anderson singing on all tracks. Squire sang background vocals on a few of the ABWH tracks, with Tony Levin playing all the bass on those songs. The album does not feature all eight members playing at once. The track &quot;Masquerade&quot; earned Yes a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1992. Howe described the nomination for a track he had recorded solo at home as &quot;pure justice&quot;, following the difficulties in making the album. &quot;Union&quot; sold approximately 1.5 million copies worldwide, and peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 15 in the U.S. charts. Two singles from the album were released. &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; topped the Mainstream Rock charts in May 1991 for six weeks, while &quot;Saving My Heart&quot; peaked at number 9.

Almost the entire band have openly stated their dislike of &quot;Union&quot;. Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has since referred to the album as &quot;Onion&quot; because it makes him cry when he thinks about it. &quot;Union&quot; co-producer Jonathan Elias later stated publicly in an interview that Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians&#x27; involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished. The 1991–1992 Union tour united all eight members on a revolving circular stage. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion in 1992, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project &quot;Earthworks&quot;. Howe also ceased his involvement with the band at this time. In August 1991, while the &quot;Union&quot; tour was underway, Atlantic released &quot;Yesyears&quot;, a four-CD box set anthology. Two accompanying home videos, &quot;Yesyears&quot; and &quot;Greatest Video Hits&quot;, were also released during 1991.

In 1993, the album &quot;Symphonic Music of Yes&quot; was released, featuring orchestrated Yes tracks arranged by Dee Palmer. Howe, Bruford and Anderson perform on the record, joined by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Community Gospel Choir. Howe and Bruford performed together on television (presented as &quot;Yes&quot;) to promote the album, marking Bruford&#x27;s final performance under the Yes name before retiring from performing.

The next Yes studio album, as with &quot;Union&quot;, was masterminded by a record company, rather than by the band itself. Victory Music approached Rabin with a proposal to produce an album solely with the &quot;90125&quot; line-up. Rabin initially countered by requesting that Wakeman also be included. Rabin began assembling the album at his home, using the then-pioneering concept of a digital home studio, and used material written by himself and Anderson. The new album was well into production in 1993, but Wakeman&#x27;s involvement had finally been cancelled, as his refusal to leave his long-serving management created insuperable legal problems.

&quot;Talk&quot; was released in March 1994 and is the band&#x27;s fourteenth studio release. Its cover was designed by pop artist Peter Max. The record was largely composed and performed by Rabin, with the other band members following Rabin&#x27;s tracks for their respective instrumentation. It was digitally recorded and produced by Rabin with engineer Michael Jay, using 3.4 GB of hard disk storage split among four networked Apple Macintosh computers running Digital Performer. The album blended elements of radio-friendly rock with a more structurally ambitious approach taken from the band&#x27;s progressive blueprint, with the fifteen-minute track &quot;Endless Dream&quot;. The album reached number 20 in the UK and number 33 in the U.S. The track &quot;The Calling&quot; reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and &quot;Walls&quot;, which Rabin had written with former Supertramp songwriter and co-founder Roger Hodgson, peaked at number 24. It also became Yes&#x27;s second-last-charting single. Rabin and Hodgson wrote a lot of material together and became close friends. Yes performed &quot;Walls&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on 20 June 1994.

The 1994 tour (for which the band employed Billy Sherwood as a support musician on additional guitar, bass, vocals and keyboards) used a sound system developed by Rabin named Concertsonics which allowed the audience located in certain seating areas to tune portable FM radios to a specific frequency, so they could hear the concert with headphones.

In early 1995, following the tour, disagreements and dissatisfactions forced another change in the band. 1990s Yes manager Jon Brewer has stated that Squire had not appreciated the &quot;Talk&quot; production process: &quot;(he) didn&#x27;t like that. He didn&#x27;t think it was what Yes was all about; he was very much against a computerised, digital sound at that time. So Trevor and Chris moved away from one another for quite a while.&quot; For his part, Rabin felt that he had achieved his highest ambitions with &quot;Talk&quot; and lamented its disappointing reception, feeling that this was due to the fact that it &quot;just wasn&#x27;t what people wanted to hear at the time.&quot; Having remarked at the conclusion of the tour &quot;I think I&#x27;m done&quot;, Rabin quit the band and returned to Los Angeles, where he shifted his focus to composing for films. Kaye also left Yes to pursue other projects.

=== 1995–2000: &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot;, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Ladder&quot; ===
In November 1995, Anderson, Squire and White resurrected the &quot;classic&quot; 1970s line-up of Yes by inviting Wakeman and Howe back to the band, recording two new lengthy tracks called &quot;Be the One&quot; and &quot;That, That Is&quot;. In March 1996 Yes performed three live shows at the Fremont Theater in San Luis Obispo, California which were recorded and released, along with the new studio tracks, that October on CMC International Records as the &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; album, which peaked at number 48 in the UK and number 99 in the U.S. A same-titled live video of the shows was also released that year.

Yes continued to record new tracks in the studio, drawing some material written around the time of the XYZ project. At one point the new songs were to be released as a studio album, but commercial considerations meant that the new tracks were eventually packaged with the remainder of the 1996 San Luis Obispo shows in November 1997 on &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot;. The record managed to reach number 62 in the UK, but failed to chart in the U.S. Disgruntled at the way a potential studio album had been sacrificed in favour of the &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; releases (as well as the way in which a Yes tour was being arranged without his input or agreement), Wakeman left the group again. (The studio material from both albums would eventually be compiled and re-released without the live tracks onto a single CD, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Keystudio&quot;.)

With Yes in disarray again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band&#x27;s engineer) for help. Both men had been working on a side project called Conspiracy and reworked existing demos and recordings from there to turn them into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe&#x27;s involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place towards the end of the sessions.) Sherwood&#x27;s integral involvement with the writing, production, and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).

The results of the sessions were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood&#x27;s urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: &quot;My goal was to try to break down those partisan walls… For that, I am proud—to have aligned planets for a moment in time.&quot;) However, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single managed to reach number 33 on the mainstream rock chart.

For the 1997/1998 &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; tour, Yes hired Russian keyboard player Igor Khoroshev, who had played on some of the album tracks. Significantly, the tour setlist featured only a few pieces from the new album, and mostly concentrated on earlier material. Anderson and Howe, who had been less involved with the writing and production on &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; than they&#x27;d wished, would express dissatisfaction about the album later.

By the time the band came to record their eighteenth studio album &quot;The Ladder&quot; with producer Bruce Fairbairn, Khoroshev had become a full-time member (with Sherwood now concentrating on songwriting, vocal arrangements and second guitar). With Khoroshev&#x27;s classically influenced keyboard style, and with all members now making more or less equal writing contributions, the band&#x27;s sound found a balance between its eclectic 1970s progressive rock style and the more polished pop sound sought on the previous album. &quot;The Ladder&quot; also featured Latin music ingredients and clear world music influences, mostly brought in by Alan White (although Fairbairn&#x27;s multi-instrumentalist colleague Randy Raine-Reusch made a strong contribution to the album&#x27;s textures). One of the album tracks, &quot;Homeworld (The Ladder)&quot;, was written for Relic Entertainment&#x27;s Homeworld, a real-time strategy computer game, and was used as the credits and outro theme. Pleased with the result of the album&#x27;s creation, the band had been in tentative discussions to continue work with Fairbairn on future projects, but he died suddenly during the final mixing sessions of the album.

&quot;The Ladder&quot; was released in September 1999, peaking at number 36 in the UK and number 99 in the U.S. While on tour in 1999 and early 2000, Yes recorded their performance at the House of Blues in Las Vegas on 31 October 1999, releasing it in September 2000 as a live album and DVD called &quot;House of Yes: Live from House of Blues&quot;. As Sherwood saw his role in Yes as creating and performing new music, and the rest of the band now wished to concentrate on performing the back catalogue, he amicably resigned from Yes at the end of the tour.

In summer 2000, Yes embarked on the three-month Masterworks tour of the United States, on which they performed only material which had been released between 1970 and 1974 (&quot;The Yes Album&quot; through to &quot;Relayer&quot;). While on tour, Khoroshev was involved in a backstage incident of sexual assault with a female security guard at Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia on 23 July 2000 and parted company with the band at the end of the tour.

=== 2001–2004: &quot;Magnification&quot; and 35th anniversary tour ===
Following the departures of Sherwood and Khoroshev and the death of Fairbairn, Yes once again set about reinventing themselves, this time choosing to record without a keyboardist, opting instead to include a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Larry Groupé; the first time the band used an orchestra since &quot;Time and a Word&quot; in 1970. The result was their nineteenth studio album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Magnification&quot;. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the U.S. The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their two shows in Amsterdam, in November, were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release &quot;Symphonic Live&quot;. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time.

Following Wakeman&#x27;s announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their Full Circle Tour in 2002–2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973. The band&#x27;s appearance in Montreux on this tour was documented on the album and DVD &quot;Live at Montreux 2003&quot;, released in 2007. In 2002, Rhino Records issued &quot;In a Word: Yes&quot;, a five CD box set of classic, rare and unreleased tracks from the band&#x27;s history, including some from the 1979 Paris sessions, followed a year later by the compilation album &quot;The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection&quot;, which reached number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the U.S. During 2003 and 2004, Rhino also released remastered editions of all Yes&#x27; studio albums up to, and including, &quot;90125&quot;, all featuring rare and previously unreleased bonus tracks. These editions would be collected in 2013 as &quot;The Studio Albums 1969–1987&quot; box set, with &quot;Big Generator&quot; also receiving the same treatment.

On 26 January 2004, the film &quot;Yesspeak&quot; premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group. Both &quot;Yesspeak&quot; and the acoustic performance, titled &quot;Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss&quot;, were released on DVD later that year. A 35th anniversary tour followed in 2004 which was documented on the DVD &quot;Songs from Tsongas&quot;, released in 2005.

In 2004, Squire, Howe and White reunited for one night only with former members Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin and Geoff Downes during a show celebrating Horn&#x27;s career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name &quot;Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm&quot;. On 18 March 2003, minor planet (7707) Yes was named in honour of the band.

=== 2005–2008: Hiatus, side projects, and 40th anniversary tour ===

After their 35th Anniversary Tour, Yes described themselves as &quot;on hiatus&quot;. Howe recalls this break as very much welcomed by the band due to the heavy touring of the previous year and a half, and in his opinion necessary since the band&#x27;s performance on the later (European) shows of the Full Circle Tour had started to deteriorate as a result of heavier alcohol consumption by Squire and other members in spite of rules the band had agreed on in 2001 barring drinking prior to or during shows.

During this period, Anderson toured both solo and jointly with Wakeman (for concerts focused largely on Yes material); Squire released his long-awaited second solo album, and White launched his own eponymous band White (subsequently joining fellow Yes-men Tony Kaye and Billy Sherwood in Circa). Wakeman also continued to release solo material, as did Howe, who released three solo albums and also reunited to record, release and tour with once-and-future Yes bandmate Geoff Downes in the reunion of the original Asia line-up.

In May 2008, a fortieth-anniversary Close to the Edge and Back Tour—which was to feature Oliver Wakeman on keyboards—was announced. Anderson has said that they had been preparing four new &quot;lengthy, multi-movement compositions&quot; for the tour, but he had expressed disinterest in producing a new studio album after the low sales of &quot;Magnification&quot;, suggesting that recording one was not &quot;logical anymore&quot;. The tour was abruptly cancelled prior to rehearsals, after Anderson suffered an asthma attack and was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, and was advised by doctors to avoid touring for six months.

In September 2008, the remaining three members, eager to resume touring regardless of Anderson&#x27;s availability, announced a tour billed as Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes, with Oliver Wakeman on keyboards and new lead singer Benoît David, a Canadian musician who&#x27;d previously played with Mystery and with Yes tribute band Close to the Edge. Anderson expressed his disappointment that his former bandmates had not waited for his recovery, nor handled the situation &quot;in a more gentlemanly fashion&quot;, and while he wished them well, he referred to their ongoing endeavours as &quot;solo work&quot; and emphasised his view that their band &quot;is not Yes&quot;. Anderson later stated &quot;I didn’t leave the band, they got a new singer… you’ve got to move on, do your own thing, it’s okay. But you’re still a friend of mine because we went through so much together…&quot;

As Anderson was a co-owner of the Yes trademark, the remaining members agreed at the time not to tour with the Yes name. The In the Present Tour started in November 2008, but it was cut short in the following February when Squire required emergency surgery on an aneurysm in his leg. Touring resumed in June 2009, with Asia and Peter Frampton supporting the band at several shows.

=== 2009–2015: Second reformation, &quot;Fly from Here&quot;, &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; and album series tours ===
In October 2009, Squire declared that the new line-up from the &quot;In the Present&quot; Tour &quot;is now Yes&quot;, and the tour, with the band now billed as Yes, continued through 2010. Their 2010 studio sessions would yield material eventually to be released as &quot;From a Page&quot;.

In August 2010, it was announced that new material had been written for &quot;Fly from Here&quot;, Yes&#x27;s twentieth studio album. Yes then signed a deal with Frontiers Records and began recording in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated from a pair of songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the &quot;Drama&quot; album. During the recording sessions, the band thought it would be wise to bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Asserting that all studio recording was to be carried out by &quot;the line-up that actually ... does the work&quot;, Howe dispelled rumours that an invitation to sing on the record had been extended to Anderson, who subsequently announced a new project as an ongoing collaboration with former Yes members Wakeman and Rabin.

Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. &quot;Fly from Here&quot; peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the U.S.

In March 2011 Yes embarked on their Rite of Spring and Fly from Here tours to support &quot;Fly from Here&quot;, with Styx and Procol Harum supporting on select dates. 2011 saw the release of the live Yes album and DVD, &quot;In the Present – Live from Lyon&quot;, taken from the band&#x27;s previous tour. Trevor Rabin joined the band in playing &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; at one show in Los Angeles.
In February 2012, after David contracted a respiratory illness, he was replaced by Glass Hammer singer Jon Davison. Davison was recommended to Squire by their common friend Taylor Hawkins, drummer for the Foo Fighters. Following the announcement Anderson expressed his disappointment that &quot;they had to get yet another singer after the guy who replaced me became ill,&quot; stating that he offered to &quot;get back with them&quot; due to his being &quot;healthy again&quot;, and expressed his view that &quot;they have let a lot of fans down.&quot; Davison would join Yes to complete the band&#x27;s scheduled dates across the year.

On 7 March 2013, founding guitarist Peter Banks died of heart failure.

From March 2013 to June 2014, Yes completed their Three Album Tour where they performed &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Going for the One&quot; in their entirety. During the tour, they led a progressive-rock themed cruise titled &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot;. A second cruise happened in April 2014, and the band headlined the November 2015 edition. The show on 11 May 2014 in Bristol was released as &quot;Like It Is: Yes at the Bristol Hippodrome&quot; in 2014, featuring performances of &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;The Yes Album&quot;.

&quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;, the band&#x27;s twenty-first studio album and first with Davison, was recorded between January and March 2014, at Neptune Studios in Los Angeles with Roy Thomas Baker as producer and former band member Billy Sherwood as engineer on backing vocals and mixer. Squire enjoyed working with Baker again, describing him as a &quot;force in the studio&quot; (Baker had previously worked with the group in the late 70s on a project that had ultimately been scrapped). Howe reflected that he &quot;tried to slow down&quot; the album production in hopes that &quot;maybe we could refine it ...&quot; and compared it to the success of the band&#x27;s classic works in which they &quot;arranged the hell out of&quot; the material. He wrote later that Baker behaved erratically and was difficult to work with, and was dissatisfied with the final mixes of the album.

To promote &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;, Yes resumed touring between July and November 2014 with a world tour covering North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, playing &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; in their entirety with select songs from &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; and encores. The show in Mesa, Arizona was released in 2015 as &quot;Like It Is: Yes at the Mesa Arts Center&quot; which features the performances of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Fragile&quot;.

=== 2015–2018: Squire&#x27;s death, Yes Featuring ARW, and 50th Anniversary Tour ===
In May 2015, news of Squire&#x27;s diagnosis with acute erythroid leukaemia was made public. This resulted in former guitarist Billy Sherwood replacing him for their 2015 summer North American tour with Toto between August–September, and their third annual Cruise to the Edge voyage in November, while Squire was receiving treatment. His condition deteriorated soon after, and he died on 27 June at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. Downes first announced Squire&#x27;s death on Twitter. Squire asked White and Sherwood to continue the legacy of the band, which Sherwood recalled &quot;was paramount in his mind ... so I&#x27;m happy to be doing that.&quot; Yes performed without Squire, for the first time in their 47-year history, on 7 August 2015 in Mashantucket, Connecticut. In November 2015, they completed their annual Cruise to the Edge voyage.

In January 2016, former Yes members Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman announced their new group, Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman (ARW), something that had been in the works for the previous six years. Wakeman stated that Squire&#x27;s passing inspired them to go ahead with the band. Anderson said they had begun writing new material. Their first tour, An Evening of Yes Music and More, began in October 2016 and lasted for one year with drummer Lou Molino III and bassist Lee Pomeroy. Following Yes&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the band renamed themselves Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. After a four-month tour in 2018 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Yes, the group disbanded.

Meanwhile, Howe &amp; White&#x27;s ongoing Yes line-up performed &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Drama&quot; in their entirety on their April–June, 2016 European tour. Trevor Horn was a guest vocalist for two UK shows, singing &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;. For the subsequent North American tour between July and September of that year, the set was changed to include &quot;Drama&quot; and sides one and four of &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;. White missed the latter to recover from back surgery; he was replaced by American drummer Jay Schellen. Dylan Howe, Steve&#x27;s son, had originally been asked to be White&#x27;s standby, but was prevented from being involved by visa problems. White returned on a part-time basis in November for their 2016 Japanese tour; until the following February, Schellen continued to sit in for White on most shows, with White playing on some songs. The live album &quot;Topographic Drama – Live Across America&quot;, recorded on the 2016 tour, was released in late 2017 and marks Yes&#x27;s first not to feature Squire. In February 2017, Yes toured the U.S. which included their headline spot at Cruise to the Edge.
Yes toured the U.S. and Canada with the Yestival Tour from August to September 2017, performing at least one song from each album from &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;Drama&quot;. Dylan Howe joined the band as a second drummer. The tour was cut short following the unexpected death of Howe&#x27;s son and Dylan&#x27;s brother Virgil.

In February 2018, Yes headlined Cruise to the Edge involving original keyboardist Tony Kaye as a special guest, marking his first performances with the band since 1994. This was followed by the band&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Tour with a European leg in March, playing half of &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; and a selection of songs from their history. The two London dates included an anniversary fan convention which coincided with the release of &quot;Fly from Here – Return Trip&quot;, a new version of the album with new lead vocals and mixes by Horn, who also performed as a special guest singer during a few shows on the leg. A U.S. leg in June and July also included guest performances from Kaye, Horn, Tom Brislin and Patrick Moraz, who had last performed with Yes in 1976. The tour culminated with a Japanese leg in February 2019. Schellen continued to play as a second drummer to support White, who had a bacterial infection in his joints from November 2017. The tour was documented with the live album &quot;Yes 50 Live&quot;, released in 2019.

=== 2019–present: &quot;The Quest&quot;, White&#x27;s death, &quot;Mirror to the Sky&quot;, and upcoming 24th album===
In June and July 2019, Yes headlined the Royal Affair Tour across the U.S. with a line-up featuring Asia, John Lodge and Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy with Arthur Brown. This was followed by previously unreleased music, recorded during the &quot;Fly from Here&quot; sessions, released as &quot;From a Page&quot;, a release spearheaded by Oliver Wakeman who wrote most of its material. The CD version includes an expanded edition of &quot;In the Present – Live from Lyon&quot;. A live album from the Royal Affair Tour, entitled &quot;The Royal Affair Tour: Live from Las Vegas&quot;, was released in October 2020. Videos of Dean creating the album cover were streamed live on Facebook. Yes had planned to resume touring in 2020, beginning with a short U.S. leg in March and their appearance on Cruise to the Edge, followed by a European tour that continued their Album Series Tour and featured &quot;Relayer&quot; performed in its entirety. Both tours were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2020, Davison and Sherwood formed Arc of Life, a new group featuring Schellen and keyboardist Dave Kerzner.

Yes worked on new material for their twenty-second studio album &quot;The Quest&quot;, from late 2019 through 2021, with Howe as the sole producer. The lockdowns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in members recording their parts in separate studios and sending them to Howe and engineer Curtis Schwartz in England. In 2021, Howe, Davison and Downes got together and completed the album. &quot;The Quest&quot; was released on 1 October 2021, being the band&#x27;s first new album in seven years, and the opening two tracks, &quot;The Ice Bridge&quot; and &quot;Dare to Know&quot;, were released as digital singles. The album reached No. 20 in the UK. By the time &quot;The Quest&quot; was released, Yes had already discussed plans regarding a follow-up album. In May 2022, Sherwood confirmed that the band had started to record new material.

On 22 May 2022, Yes announced that White would sit out of their upcoming tour due to health issues and that Schellen would handle the drums. White died on 26 May. The band kicked off a tour in June 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. They had originally planned to resume their Album Series Tour with a European leg featuring &quot;Relayer&quot; performed in its entirety, before the dates were rescheduled for 2023 and the program changed. A tribute concert for White was held in Seattle on 2 October, featuring special guests and former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin.

In January 2023, Yes announced that Warner Music Group had acquired the recorded music rights and associated income streams relating to 12 studio albums from 1969 to 1987, and several live and compilation releases. In February, Schellen joined the band as a permanent member.

In 2023, Yes had planned to continue their Album Series Tour with &quot;Relayer&quot; performed in its entirety across Europe and the UK, but it was subsequently delayed to 2024 due to insurance incentives related to COVID-19 and acts of war being withdrawn. The non-cancelled UK dates were later rescheduled for The Classic Tales of Yes Tour 2024. Meanwhile, Anderson toured in Spring 2023 &amp; Spring/Summer 2024 under the title &quot;Yes Epics and Classics&quot; with a setlist primarily devoted to early 70s Yes material. About the tour, which features Anderson backed by The Band Geeks, he tells &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;In my mind… I&#x27;m still in Yes&quot; and expressed his desire at the time for a reunion with Howe, though after recording and releasing &quot;True&quot; later expressed the opposite sentiment, saying &quot;No. Not right now… I’ve got the Yes that I wanted&quot; and called making that album &quot;one of the most wonderful experiences of my life.&quot;

On 10 March 2023, Yes announced that their new studio album, &quot;Mirror to the Sky&quot;, was set for release on 19 May 2023. On the same day the opening track, &quot;Cut from the Stars&quot;, was released as a digital single, followed by the release of &quot;All Connected&quot; a few weeks later. Band members have said that the formation of this album was based on continuing the creative process from &quot;The Quest&quot;, further developing &quot;song sketches, structures, and ideas that were demanding attention&quot;. In January 2024, Billy Sherwood stated in an interview with Rolling Stone that the band have already started working on their follow-up album to &quot;Mirror to the Sky&quot;.

== Style and legacy ==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Yes the &quot;definitive English progressive rock band&quot; and credited the band with bringing the genre to mainstream audiences. He described the band&#x27;s early sound as an algamation of &quot;pastoral folk&quot;, &quot;Baroque classical&quot; and &quot;muscular rock &amp; roll&quot;. He also noted that the band&#x27;s compositions utilized odd time signatures, and were &quot;structured like mini-suites.&quot; He described some of the band&#x27;s later output as &quot;steely, shiny [...] album-oriented rock.&quot;

== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ==
Yes were eligible to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In August 2013, the fan campaign Voices for Yes was launched to get the band inducted. The campaign was headed by two U.S. political operators: John Brabender, senior strategist for Republican Rick Santorum&#x27;s 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore&#x27;s 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former White House Political Director Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes in the future for a &quot;tour everybody dreams of&quot;, and cited Yes&#x27;s nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion.

On 7 April 2017, Yes were inducted into the 2017 class by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in a ceremony held in New York City. The musicians inducted were Anderson, Howe, Rabin, Squire, Wakeman, Kaye, Bruford, and White, the same line-up featured on &quot;Union&quot; and its tour. Having failed to pass the nomination stage twice previously, the announcement of their forthcoming induction was made on 20 December 2016. In the ceremony, Anderson, Howe, Rabin, Wakeman, and White performed &quot;Roundabout&quot; with Lee on bass, followed by &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; with Howe on bass. Bruford attended the ceremony but did not perform, while Kaye did not attend. Dylan Howe (Steve&#x27;s son) described how at the ceremony the two groups—Yes and ARW—were seated at adjacent tables but ignored each other.

<doc id="43977" wikidata="Q2667608" url="?curid=43977" title="Military history of Poland during World War II">
<text>In World War II, the Polish armed forces were the fourth largest Allied forces in Europe, after those of the Soviet Union, United States and Britain. Poles made substantial contributions to the Allied effort throughout the war, fighting on land, sea, and in the air. 

Polish forces in the east, fighting alongside the Red army and under Soviet high command, took part in the Soviet offensives across Belarus and Ukraine into Poland and across the Vistula and Oder Rivers to the Battle of Berlin.

In the west, Polish paratroopers from the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade fought in the Battle of Arnhem / Operation Market Garden; while ground troops were present in the North Africa Campaign (siege of Tobruk); the Italian campaign (including the capture of the monastery hill at the Battle of Monte Cassino); and in battles following the invasion of France (the battle of the Falaise pocket; and an armored division in the Western Allied invasion of Germany).

Particularly well-documented was the service of 145 Polish pilots flying British planes under British Command during the Battle of Britain, 79 in mixed squadrons under the RAF after July 1940, 32 in wholly Polish Squadron 303 after 31 August 1940 and 34 in entirely Polish Squadron 302. Other instances of service flying French planes in the Polish Air Force took place during the Battle of Britain at the same time, and from 1944 the Polish Air Force (also with British planes) was established in Britain. 

Some Polish contributions were less visible, notably the prewar and wartime decrypting of German Enigma-machine ciphers by cryptologists Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski, and Jerzy Różycki. An extensive Polish intelligence network also proved of great value to Allied intelligence.

The European Theatre of World War II opened with the German invasion of Poland on Friday September 1, 1939, followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939. On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered. A Polish Underground State with a government-in-exile that would eventually set up headquarters in London resumed the struggle against the occupying powers. The Polish forces in the West, as well as in the East and an intelligence service were established outside of Poland, and contributed to the Allied effort throughout the war.

==Invasion of Poland==

The invasion of Polish Second Republic by the military forces of Nazi Germany marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Soviets invaded Poland on September 17 German-allied Slovakia invaded also

In keeping with the terms of the of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact Germany informed the Soviet Union that its forces were nearing the Soviet interest zone in Poland and so urged the Soviet Union to move into its zone. The Soviets had been taken by surprise by the speed of the German advance as they had expected to have several weeks to prepare for an invasion rather than merely a few days. They did promise to move as quickly as possible. On September 17 the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, forcing the Polish government and military to abandon their plans for a long-term defense in the Romanian bridgehead area. The last remaining Polish Army units capitulated in early October.

In accordance with their treaty obligations, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on September 3. Hitler had gambled, incorrectly, that France and Britain would allow him to annex parts of Poland without military reaction. The campaign began on September 1, 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact containing a secret protocol for the division of Northern and Central Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. It ended on October 6, 1939, with Germany and the Soviet Union occupying the entirety of Poland.

German losses included about 16,000 killed in action, 28,000 wounded, 3,500 missing, over 200 aircraft, and 30% of their armored vehicles. The Polish casualties were about 66,000 dead and 694,000 captured.

German losses in the Polish campaign amounted to 50% of all casualties they would suffer until their invasion of USSR in 1941; and the campaign that lasted about a month consumed eight months worth of supplies.

==Aid to Jews==


A substantial number of Poles risked their lives in the German occupation to save Jews. German-occupied Poland was the only European territory where the Germans punished any kind of help to Jews with death for the helper and his entire family. Even so, Poland was also the only German-occupied country to establish an organization specifically to aid Jews. Known by the cryptonym &quot;Żegota&quot;, it provided food, shelter, medical care, money, and false documents to Jews. Most of Żegota&#x27;s funds came directly from the Polish Government-in-Exile in Great Britain.

Most Jews who survived the German occupation of Poland were saved by Poles unconnected with Żegota. Estimates of Jewish survivors in Poland range from 40,000 to 50,000 to 100,000–120,000. Scholars estimate that it took the work of ten people to save the life of one Polish Jew. Of the individuals awarded medals of &quot;Righteous among the Nations&quot; (given by the State of Israel to non-Jews who saved Jews from extermination in the Holocaust) those who were Polish citizens number the greatest. There are 6,339 Polish men and women recognized as &quot;Righteous&quot; to this day, amounting to over 25 percent of the total number of 22,765 honorary titles awarded already.

==Polish resistance==

The main resistance force in German-occupied Poland was the Armia Krajowa (&quot;Home Army&quot;; abbreviated &quot;AK&quot;), which numbered some 400,000 fighters at its peak as well as many more sympathizers. Throughout most of the war, AK was one of the three largest resistance movements in the war. The AK coordinated its operations with the exiled Polish Government in London and its activity concentrated on sabotage, diversion and intelligence gathering. Its combat activity was low until 1943 as the army was avoiding suicidal warfare and preserved its very limited resources for later conflicts that sharply increased when the Nazi war machine started to crumble in the wake of the successes of the Red Army in the Eastern Front. Then the AK started a nationwide uprising (Operation Tempest) against Nazi forces. Before that, AK units carried out thousands of raids, intelligence operations, bombed hundreds of railway shipments, participated in many clashes and battles with the German police and Wehrmacht units and conducted tens of thousands of acts of sabotage against German industry The AK also conducted &quot;punitive&quot; operations to assassinate Gestapo officials responsible for Nazi terror. Following the 1941 German attack on the USSR, the AK assisted the Soviet Union&#x27;s war effort by sabotaging the German advance into Soviet territory and provided intelligence on the deployment and movement of German forces. After 1943, its direct combat activity increased sharply. German losses to the Polish partisans averaged 850–1,700 per month in early 1944 compared to about 250–320 per month in 1942.
In addition to the Home Army, there was an underground ultra-nationalist resistance force called &quot;Narodowe Siły Zbrojne&quot; (NSZ or &quot;National Armed Forces&quot;), with a fiercely anti-communist stance. It participated in fighting German units, winning many skirmishes. From 1943 onwards, some units took part in battling the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; and the Polish People&#x27;s Army PAL, both communist resistance movement. From 1944, the advancing Red Army was also seen as a foreign occupation force, prompting skirmishes with the Soviets as well as Soviet-backed partisans. In the later part of the war, when Soviet partisans started attacking Polish partisans, sympathizers and civilians, all non-communist Polish formations were (to an increasing extent) becoming involved in actions against the Soviets.

The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot;, a Soviet proxy fighting force was another resistance group that was unrelated to the Polish Government in Exile, allied instead to the Soviet Union. As of July, 1944 it incorporated a similar organization, the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; and the Polish People&#x27;s Army PAL, and numbered about 6,000 soldiers (although estimates vary).

There were separate resistance groups organized by Polish Jews: the right-wing &quot;Żydowski Związek Walki&quot; (&quot;Jewish Fighting Union&quot;) (ŻZW) and the more Soviet-leaning &quot;Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa&quot; (&quot;Jewish Combat Organization&quot;) (ŻOB). These organisations cooperated little with each other and their relationship with the Polish resistance varied between occasional cooperation (mainly between ZZW and AK) to armed confrontations (mostly between ŻOB and NZS). 

Other notable Polish resistance organizations included the &quot;Bataliony Chłopskie&quot; (BCh), a mostly peasant-based organization allied to the AK. At its height the BCh included 115,543 members (1944; with additional LSB and PKB-AK Guard, for the estimated total of 150,250 men, not confirmed).

Throughout the war the German state was forced to divert a substantial part of its military forces to keep control over Poland:




==Intelligence==


Polish intelligence supplied valuable intelligence to the Allies; 48% of all reports received by the British secret services from continental Europe in between 1939 and 1945 came from Polish sources. The total number of those reports is estimated at 80,000, and 85% of them were deemed high or better quality. Despite Poland becoming occupied, the Polish intelligence network not only survived but grew rapidly, and near the end of the war had over 1,600 registered agents (Another estimate gave about 3,500).

Western Allies had limited intelligence assets in Central and Eastern Europe, and extensive Polish intelligence network in place proved to be a major asset, even described as &quot;the only allied intelligence assets on the Continent&quot; following the French capitulation. According to , for the Western Allies, the intelligence provided by the Home Army was considered to be the best source of information on the Eastern Front.

In a period of more than six and a half years, from late December 1932 to the outbreak of World War II, three mathematician-cryptologists (Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki) at the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau in Warsaw had developed a number of techniques and devices including the &quot;grill&quot; method, Różycki&#x27;s &quot;clock&quot;, Rejewski&#x27;s &quot;cyclometer&quot; and &quot;card catalog&quot;, Zygalski&#x27;s &quot;perforated sheets&quot;, and Rejewski&#x27;s &quot;cryptologic bomb&quot; (in Polish, &quot;&quot;bomba&quot;, precursor to the later British &quot;Bombe&quot;, named after its Polish predecessor) to facilitate decryption of messages produced on the German &quot;Enigma&quot; cipher machine. Just five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, on July 25, 1939, near Pyry in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw, Poland disclosed her achievements to France and the United Kingdom, which had, up to that time, failed in all their own efforts to crack the German military Enigma cipher. Had Poland not shared her Enigma-decryption results at Pyry, the United Kingdom might have been unable to read Enigma ciphers. In the event, intelligence gained from this source, codenamed Ultra, was extremely valuable to the Allied prosecution of the war. While ULTRA&#x27;s precise influence on its course remains a subject of debate, ULTRA undoubtedly altered the course of the war.

As early as 1940, Polish agents (including Witold Pilecki) penetrated German concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and informed the world about Nazi atrocities. Jan Karski is another important Polish resistance fighter who reported to the Polish government in exile and the Western Allies on the situation in German-occupied Poland, especially the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, and the secretive German-Nazi extermination camps.


Polish Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;, &quot;AK&quot;) intelligence was vital to locating and destroying (18 August 1943) the German rocket facility at Peenemünde and to gathering information about Germany&#x27;s V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. The Home Army delivered to the United Kingdom key V-2 parts after a rocket, fired on 30 May 1944, crashed near a German test facility at Sarnaki on the Bug River and was recovered by the Home Army. On the night of 25–26 July 1944 the crucial parts were flown from occupied Poland to the United Kingdom in an RAF plane, along with detailed drawings of parts too large to fit in the plane (see &quot;Home Army and V1 and V2&quot;). Analysis of the German rocket became vital to improving Allied anti-V-2 defenses (see Operation Most III).

Operations of the II Bureau, the intelligence service of the Polish government in exile, extended beyond Poland and even beyond Europe. Polish agents provided reports on German war production, morale and troop movements, including information on German submarine operations. The II Bureau is reported to have had two agents in the upper levels of the German high command. Polish intelligence monitored the French fleet at Toulon. Mieczysław Zygfryd Słowikowski has been described as &quot;the only allied agent with a network in North Africa&quot;. In July 1941 Mieczysław Słowikowski (codenamed &quot;&quot;Rygor&quot;—Polish for &quot;Rigor&quot;) set up &quot;Agency Africa&quot;, one of World War II&#x27;s most successful intelligence organizations. His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki (prewar heads, respectively, of Poland&#x27;s &quot;Biuro Szyfrów&quot;, Cipher Bureau, and of its German section, &quot;B.S.-4&quot;, which broke Germany&#x27;s Enigma ciphers). The information gathered by the Agency was used by the Americans and British in planning the amphibious November 1942 Operation Torch landings in North Africa. These were the first large-scale Allied landings of the war, and their success in turn paved the way for the Allies&#x27; Italian campaign.

Some Poles also served in other Allied intelligence services, including the celebrated Krystyna Skarbek (&quot;Christine Granville&quot;) in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Operations Executive.

The researchers who produced the first Polish-British in-depth monograph on Home Army intelligence &quot;(Intelligence Co-operation Between Poland and Great Britain During World War II: Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee&quot; of 2005) and who described contributions of Polish intelligence to Allied victory as &quot;disproportionally large&quot; have also argued that &quot;the work performed by Home Army intelligence undoubtedly supported the Allied armed effort much more effectively than subversive and guerilla activities.&quot;
==Polish Forces (West)==
===Army===
After the country&#x27;s defeat in the 1939 campaign, the Polish government in exile quickly organized in France a new army of about 75,000 men. In 1940 a Polish Highland Brigade took part in the Battle of Narvik (Norway), and two Polish divisions (First Grenadier Division, and Second Infantry Fusiliers Division) took part in the defense of France, while a Polish motorized brigade and two infantry divisions were in process of forming. A Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade was formed in French Mandate Syria, to which many Polish troops had escaped from Romania. The Polish Air Force in France had 86 aircraft with one and a half of the squadrons fully operational, and the remaining two and a half in various stages of training.

By the fall of France, numerous Polish personnel had died in the fighting (some ) or had been interned in Switzerland (some ). Nevertheless, about 19,000 Polish—about 25% of which were aircrew—were evacuated from France, most alongside other troops transported from western France to the United Kingdom. In 1941, following an agreement between the Polish government in exile and Joseph Stalin, the Soviets released Polish citizens, from whom a 75,000-strong army was formed in the USSR under General Władysław Anders. Without any support from the Soviets to train, equip and maintain this army, the Polish government in exile followed Anders&#x27; advice for a transfer of some (and about civilians), in March and August 1942, across the Caspian Sea to Iran permitting Soviet divisions in occupation there to be released for action. In the Middle East, this &quot;Anders&#x27; Army&quot; joined the British Eighth Army, where it formed Polish II Corps.
The Polish Armed Forces in the West fought under British command and numbered 195,000 in March 1944 and 165,000 at the end of that year, including about 20,000 personnel in the Polish Air Force and 3,000 in the Polish Navy. At the end of World War II, the Polish Armed Forces in the west numbered 195,000 and by July 1945 had increased to 228,000, most of the newcomers being released prisoners of war and ex-labor camp inmates.

===Air force===
The Polish Air Force first fought in the 1939 Invasion of Poland. Significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active up to the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost, to all operational causes, 285 aircraft, with 279 more damaged, while the Poles lost 333 aircraft.

After the fall of Poland many Polish pilots escaped via Hungary to France. The Polish Air Force fought in the Battle of France as one fighter squadron GC 1/145, several small units detached to French squadrons, and numerous flights of industry defence (in total, 133 pilots, who achieved 53–57 victories for a loss of 8 men in combat, what was 7.93% of allied victories).

Later, Polish pilots fought in the Battle of Britain, where the Polish 303 Fighter Squadron claimed the highest number of kills of any Allied squadron. From the very beginning of the war, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had welcomed foreign pilots to supplement the dwindling pool of British pilots. On 11 June 1940, the Polish Government in Exile signed an agreement with the British Government to form a Polish Army and Polish Air Force in the United Kingdom. The first two (of an eventual ten) Polish fighter squadrons went into action in August 1940. Four Polish squadrons eventually took part in the Battle of Britain (300 and 301 Bomber Squadrons; 302 and 303 Fighter Squadrons), with 89 Polish pilots. Together with more than 50 Poles fighting in British squadrons, a total of 145 Polish pilots defended British skies. Polish pilots were among the most experienced in the battle, most of them having already fought in the 1939 September Campaign in Poland and the 1940 Battle of France. Additionally, prewar Poland had set a very high standard of pilot training. The 303 Squadron, named after the Polish–American hero, General Tadeusz Kościuszko, claimed the highest number of kills (126) of all fighter squadrons engaged in the Battle of Britain, even though it only joined the combat on August 30, 1940 These Polish pilots, constituting 5% of the pilots active in the Battle of Britain, were responsible for 12% of total victories in the Battle.

The Polish Air Force also fought in 1943 in Tunisia—the Polish Fighting Team (nicknamed &quot;Skalski&#x27;s Circus&quot;)—and in raids on Germany (1940–45). In the second half of 1941 and early 1942, Polish bomber squadrons formed a sixth of the forces available to RAF Bomber Command but later they suffered heavy losses, with little replenishment possibilities. Polish aircrew losses serving with Bomber Command from 1940 to 1945 were 929 killed.
Ultimately eight Polish fighter squadrons were formed within the RAF and had claimed 629 Axis aircraft destroyed by May 1945. By the end of the war, about 19,400 Poles were serving in the RAF.

===Navy===
Just on the eve of war, three destroyers—representing most of the major Polish Navy ships—had been sent for safety to the United Kingdom (Operation Peking). There they fought alongside the Royal Navy. At various stages of the war, the Polish Navy comprised two cruisers and a large number of smaller ships. The Polish navy was given a number of British ships and submarines which would otherwise have been unused due to the lack of trained British crews. The Polish Navy fought with great distinction alongside the other Allied navies in many important and successful operations, including those conducted against the . In the war the Polish Navy operated a total of 27 ships: 2 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 5 submarines and 11 torpedo boats. They sailed a total of 1.2 million nautical miles, escorted 787 convoys, conducted 1,162 patrols and combat operations, sank 12 enemy ships (including 5 submarines) and 41 merchant vessels, damaged 24 more (including 8 submarines) and shot down 20 aircraft. 450 seamen out of the over 4,000 who served with the Navy lost their lives in action.

This does not include a number of minor ships, transports, merchant-marine auxiliary vessels, and patrol boats. Polish Merchant Navy contributed about 137,000 BRT to Allied shipping; losing 18 ships (with capacity of 76,000 BRT) and over 200 sailors in the war.

==Polish Forces (East)==

After the Polish government-in-exile organized the &quot;Anders Army&quot; in 1941 in the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Operation Barbarossa and evacuated it to the West, Polish communists sought to create a new army, under communist control, out of the many ethnic Poles that remained in the Soviet Union. These were primarily citizens of the prewar Second Polish Republic that had been deported and often imprisoned by the Soviets following the Soviet annexation of Poland&#x27;s eastern territories, as per the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Soviet Union created the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP) in 1943, a communist Polish organization intended to represent the interest of Poles on Soviet soil and organize this new army. The relocated Poles, along with numbers of Byelorussians, Ukrainians, and Polish Jews, were organized into a division, the nucleus of a force known as the Polish People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Ludowe Wojsko Polskie&quot;, LWP) but colloquially known as the &quot;Berling Army&quot; after its first commander, Zygmunt Berling. The division made its combat debut in October 1943 at the Battle of Lenino. Afterwards, it was rapidly expanded into the 1st Polish Corps, which in turn grew by 1944 into the 1st Polish Army. In 1945, 2nd Polish Army was added to the LWP. By the end of the war, the LWP numbered about 200,000 front-line soldiers. The Polish communist guerilla force, the Armia Ludowa, was integrated with the Polish People&#x27;s Army in January 1944.

The Polish First Army was integrated in the 1st Belorussian Front with which it entered Poland from Soviet territory in 1944. In the 1944 Warsaw Uprising it liberated the suburb of Praga, but otherwise sat out most of the battle, aside from a series of unsuccessful crossings of the Vistula in mid-September. It took part in battles for Bydgoszcz (Bromberg), Kolobrzeg (Kolberg), Gdańsk (Danzig) and Gdynia, losing about 17,500 killed in action over the course of the war. In April–May 1945 the 1st Army fought in the final capture of Berlin. The Polish Second Army fought as part of the Soviet 1st Ukrainian Front and took part in the Prague Offensive. In the final operations of the war the casualties of the two armies of the LWP amounted to about 67,000.

==Poles in the German Armed Forces==

Hundreds of thousands of former Polish citizens, particularly residents of parts of Poland annexed to Germany, were conscripted into the German Armed Forces. Also, a number of former Polish citizens, especially members of the prewar German minority in Poland (see &quot;Volksliste&quot;), volunteered for service in the German Armed Forces.
These were mostly members of the German minority in Poland who were considered by the Nazi authorities to be ethnically German (Volksdeutsche). In 1939 in the Invasion of Poland they created the paramilitary organisation Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, and actively supported German forces in occupied Poland.

On the Western Front, German military personnel of Polish ethnicity, held in prisoner-of-war camps, became a substantial source of manpower for the Polish Armed Forces in the West. Nearly 90,000 former German military personnel were eventually recruited into the Polish Armed Forces in the West. By Victory Day (9 May) in 1945, a third of Polish service members in the West were former members of the German Armed Forces.

==Battles==

Major battles and campaigns in which Polish regular forces took part:
==Technology==
* Józef Kosacki invented the Polish mine detector, which would be used by the Allies from 1942.
* The Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV was invented by engineer Rudolf Gundlach and patented in 1936 as the &quot;Gundlach Peryskop obrotowy&quot;. Initially it was mounted in Polish tanks such as the 7TP and TKS. Subsequently, the design patent was sold to the British for a nominal sum and used in most tanks of World War II, including the Soviet T-34, the British Crusader, Churchill, Valentine and Cromwell tanks, and the American M4 Sherman. The main advantage of the periscope was that the tank commander no longer had to turn his head in order to look backwards. The design was also later used extensively by the Germans.
* pistolet wz. 35 Vis, often simply called the &quot;Radom&quot; in English sources, is a 9 mm caliber, single-action, semi-automatic pistol. It was adopted in 1935 as the standard handgun of the Polish Army. The design was appropriated by the Germans and from 1939 to 1945, 312,000–380,000 VIS pistols were produced and used by the German paratroopers and police as the 9 mm &quot;Pistole 35(p)&quot;.
* PZL.37 Łoś was a Polish twin-engine medium bomber designed in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by Jerzy Dąbrowski, and used operationally in the Invasion of Poland in 1939. Thanks to the laminar-flow wing it was one of the most modern bombers in the world before World War II.
* Swiatecki bomb slip, a bomb-release system was invented by Władysław Świątecki in 1925 and patented in the 1926 in Poland and abroad. Some components was used in the pre-war Polish PZL.37 Łoś (&quot;Elk&quot;) bomber. In 1940 Świątecki&#x27;s invention was taken over by the British, who used it in the Avro Lancaster bomber. In 1943, an updated version was created by Jerzy Rudlicki for the American B-17 Flying Fortress.
* Wz. 35 anti-tank rifle, 7.92 mm anti-tank rifle developed in secret and used by the Polish Army in the invasion of Poland invented by Józef Maroszek. The rifle was a development of the Mauser rifle with its own special 7.92 mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of over 1,000 meters per second. With a range of 300 metres it was very effective against all German tanks of the period (the Panzer I, II and III, as well as the Czech-made LT-35 and LT-38 tanks in German service) at 100 meters.
* In World War II, there was an important need to take bearings on the high frequency radio transmissions used by the German Kriegsmarine. The engineering of such high frequency direction finding systems for operation on ships presented severe technical problems, mainly due to the effects of the superstructure on the wavefront of arriving radio signals. However, solutions to these problems were proposed by the Polish engineer Waclaw Struszynski, who also led the team which developed the first practical system at the Admiralty Signal Establishment, England. These systems were installed on convoy escort ships, and were very effective against the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic. The father of Wacław Struszyński was Professor Marceli Struszyński, a member of the Polish resistance, who analysed the fuel used in the V2 rocket, the formula being subsequently sent to England.
* Henryk Magnuski, a Polish engineer working for Motorola, co-designed the SCR-300 radio in 1940. It was the first small radio receiver/transmitter to have manually set frequencies. It was used extensively by the American Army and was nicknamed the &quot;walkie-talkie&quot;.

===Weapons===
Polish engineers who escaped German-occupied Poland contributed to weapon developments during the war. A Polish/Czech/British team brought the 20 mm Polsten to fruition as a simpler and cheaper to produce but as effective derivative of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

The Polish Home Army was probably the only World War II resistance movement to manufacture large quantities of weaponry and munitions. In addition to production of pre-war designs they developed and produced in the war the Błyskawica submachine gun, Bechowiec, KIS and Polski Sten (from the British Sten) machine pistols as well as the filipinka and sidolówka hand grenades. In the Warsaw Uprising Polish engineers built several armoured cars, such as the Kubuś, which also took part in the fighting.
The KIS was designed and made in the Jan Piwnik&#x27;s &quot;Ponury&quot; (&quot;Grim&quot;) guerrilla unit that was operating in Holy Cross Mountains region. It was probably the only kind of modern firearm that could be manufactured in the forest without the need for sophisticated tools and factory equipment in the Second World War.

==Notes==
a Numerous sources state that Polish Army was the fourth biggest Allied fighting contingent. Steven J. Zaloga wrote that &quot;by the war&#x27;s end the Polish Army was the fourth largest contingent of the Allied coalition after the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain.&quot; Jerzy Jan Lerski writes &quot;All in all, the Polish units, although divided and controlled by different political orientation, constituted the fourth largest Allied force, after the American, British and Soviet Armies.&quot; M. K. Dziewanowski has noted that &quot;if Polish forces fighting in the east and west were added to the resistance fighters, Poland had the fourth largest Allied army in the war (after the USSR, the U.S. and Britain)&quot;.

b Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement in World War II. As the war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger—and others diminished. Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944–1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces in Poland (although the cursed soldiers continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish Armia Krajowa was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. For example, Norman Davies wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance&quot;; Gregor Dallas wrote &quot;Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered about 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe&quot;; Mark Wyman wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe&quot;. Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance until the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. After that point, the numbers of Soviet partisans and Yugoslav partisans grew rapidly. The number of Soviet partisans quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance. The number of Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav partisans were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).

<text>Tórshavn (; ; Danish: &quot;Thorshavn&quot;), usually locally referred to as simply Havn, is the capital and largest city of the Faroe Islands. It is located in the southern part on the east coast of Streymoy. To the northwest of the city lies the mountain Húsareyn, and to the southwest, the Kirkjubøreyn. They are separated by the Sandá River. The city itself has a population of 14,099 (2024), and the greater urban area has a population of 23,194, including the suburbs of Hoyv%C3%ADk and Argir.

The Norse (Scandinavians) established their parliament on the Tinganes peninsula in AD 850. Tórshavn thus became the capital of the Faroe Islands and has remained so ever since. Early on, Tórshavn became the centre of the islands&#x27; trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

It is not known whether the site of Tórshavn was of interest to the Irish monks who were probably the first settlers in the Faroes. The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called &quot;tings&quot;, in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the &quot;ting&quot; at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage. According to romantics, the main &quot;ting&quot; for the islands was convoked in Tórshavn in 825, on Tinganes, the peninsula that divides the harbour into two parts: &quot;Eystaravág&quot; and &quot;Vestaravág&quot;.

The settlers would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The Færeyinga Saga says: &quot;the place of the &quot;ting&quot; of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called Tórshavn&quot;. The Viking age ended in 1035. The &quot;ting&quot; was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area.

All through the Middle Ages, the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of Tórshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, Tórshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in Bergen.

In 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in Tórshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to Tórshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. Tórshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than the other villages did. Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made Tórshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that Tórshavn was the seat of the &quot;ting&quot; of the islands, influenced the town&#x27;s development.

=== 1500–1800 ===

Sources do not mention a built-up area in Tórshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In a small fort, Skansin, was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader Magnus Heinason at the north end of the harbour. Later, small fortifications were built at Tinganes.

In 1584, Tórshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless proletariat from the villages that during this period came to Tórshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers.

In 1655, king Frederick III of Denmark granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman Kristoffer Gabel; the rule of the von Gabel Family (lasting between 1655 and 1709), is known as &quot;Gablatíðin&quot;. It is the darkest chapter in the history of Tórshavn. Gabel&#x27;s administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family&#x27;s hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time, imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands&#x27; inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in Tórshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the bailiff and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel&#x27;s documents.

Conditions improved in Tórshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The Danish royal trade monopoly was supplied with goods from Copenhagen three times a year. However, Tórshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox in 1709, killing nearly the entire population. The town had dissipated reached a population of 300 before the outbreak; 250 of the inhabitants died from the disease. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that Tórshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 (and during the next 20 years onwards) Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to England. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In Tórshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened.

Tórshavn Cathedral was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the Church of the Faroe Islands).

=== 1800–present ===

On 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish Gunboat War, the entered Tórshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The &quot;Clio&quot;″s men spiked the fort&#x27;s eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May, a German privateer who had assumed the name &quot;Baron von Hompesch&quot; plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize.

In 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with Tórshavn at its centre. 

In 1866, Tórshavn&#x27;s town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, Tórshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns. In 1913, the Danish Folketing granted DKK 810,000 to construction of a harbour in Tórshavn. Local waves are , the waters are ice free and have a tidal variation of , and storms from the west are mitigated by the gentle eastwards slope of the mountains. Other harbours were also benefitted with an 80% grant to a total build cost of DKK 1.6 million. In 1927, Tórshavn had a modern harbour built. This made it possible for larger ships to berth.

During the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II, Skansin was used as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Command, and two 5.5-inch guns used aboard before World War II were deployed.

In 1974, the neighbouring villages Hoyvík and Hvítanes were made part of the town area. Later, even more municipalities joined the Tórshavn municipality. In 1978 Kaldbak, in 1997 Argir, in 2001 Kollafjørður, and finally in 2005, Kirkjubøur, Hestur, and Nólsoy.

== Climate ==
Tórshavn features a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), with strong moderation from the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Norwegian Current. In winter, Tórshavn tends to be under direct influence of the Icelandic Low, which usually brings overcast and stormy weather to the Faroe Islands. Because of its cloudiness and the ice-free water surrounding Tórshavn, its winter temperatures are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location, with winter daytime temperatures usually oscillating around . However, summer temperatures are much lower than those found in Scandinavia on similar latitudes, and barely exceed daily highs in the warmest month. The moderation also causes the extremes amplitude to be very low: in the period from 1961 to 2021, there was a mere difference between the absolute warmest and coldest temperatures. Temperatures below freezing may occur in any non-summer month, but even in winter, the average daily lows stay well above .

Average monthly precipitation is highest in autumn and winter, peaking in January, due to the activity of the Icelandic Low. May, June and July, on the other hand, are markedly drier but still receive substantial rainfall.


== Politics and government ==

Tórshavn is the capital of the Faroe Islands, and as such is the seat of the Faroes’ self rule government. The government holds the executive power in local government affairs. Today a part of the government is located on the Tinganes peninsula of Tórshavn. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office is there and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was also there until it was closed in 2013. The other ministries are located in other office buildings in various places in Tórshavn, i.e. the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Affairs are located near the Hospital of the Faroes in Eirargarður, and the Ministry of Finance is located in Argir in a building called Albert Hall on the street Kvíggjartún. The parliament, the Løgting, which was originally located on Tinganes, was relocated to the town square, Vaglið, in 1856.

== Sport ==

Tórshavn, as the capital city, is the centre of sport in the islands; the largest sports centre is located in the Gundadalur district of Tórshavn. Also, the largest football stadium, Tórsvøllur, is located here, seating 6,000 spectators. The stadium serves as home to the Faroe Islands national football team. Around the city there are also two other football pitches, indoor tennis courts, badminton courts and a swimming pool.

The city has several football clubs, including three Premier League teams: HB Tórshavn, B36 Tórshavn and Argja Bóltfelag. Other football clubs with connections to the city are FF Giza (Nólsoy), FC Hoyvík and Undrið FF. Handball is the second most popular sport in Tórshavn. The city&#x27;s handball teams are Kyndil, Neistin and Ítróttafelagið H71 and the Faroe Island&#x27;s national handball team practice in the city. Tórshavn city has several popular rowing clubs, including, Havnar Róðrarfelag and Róðrarfelagið Knørrur.

Every year in July the Tour of Faroe Islands, which is a road bicycle race, is held around the islands. The race, called &quot;Kring Føroyar&quot; (Tour de Faroe / Around the Faroes), starts in Klaksvík and ends in Tórshavn.

== Music ==
The Tórshavn Jazz Festival has been held annually since 1983. It attracts musicians from all over North America and Europe and has become a popular tourist event.

== Transport ==

The harbour is served by the Smyril Line international ferry service to Denmark and Iceland. The harbour is also used by domestic ferry services of Strandfaraskip Landsins within the Faroe Islands, chiefly on the route to Tvøroyri.

The town is served by Bussleiðin – a network of local buses, with the service identified by its red livery. Bussleiðin has five routes and is operated under contract by Gundurs Bussar P/F. Buses within Tórshavn have been completely free of charge since 2007. In addition, there is a helipad by the coast.

<text>Reading ( ) is a town and borough in Berkshire, England, and the county town of Berkshire. Most of its built-up area lies within the Borough of Reading, although some outer suburbs are parts of neighbouring local authority areas. It is located in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the rivers Thames and Kennet.

Reading is a major commercial centre, especially for information technology and insurance. It is also a regional retail centre, serving a large area of the Thames Valley with its shopping centres, including the Oracle, the Broad Street Mall, and the pedestrianised area around Broad Street. It is home to the University of Reading. Every year it hosts the Reading Festival, one of England&#x27;s biggest music festivals. Reading has a professional association football team, Reading F.C., and participates in many other sports.

Reading dates from the 8th century. It was a trading and ecclesiastical centre in the Middle Ages, the site of Reading Abbey, one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tenth in England for taxable wealth. The town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, but played a pivotal role in the Glorious Revolution, whose only significant military action was fought on its streets. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major ironworks in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town&#x27;s brewing, baking and seed-growing businesses, and the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.

==Etymology==
The earliest known name for Reading is &quot;Readingas&quot;, from the 8th century. The name probably comes from the &quot;Readingas&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose name means &quot;Reada&#x27;s People&quot; in Old English (the Anglo-Saxons often had the same name for a place and its inhabitants).

The demonym for a person from Reading is &quot;Redingensian&quot;, giving the name of the local rugby team Redingensians, based in Sonning, and of former members of Reading School.

==History==

===Origins===
Occupation at the site of Reading may date back to the Roman period, possibly in the form of a trading port for Calleva Atrebatum. However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town came to be known as &quot;Readingas&quot;. In late 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the first Battle of Reading, King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes&#x27; defences. The battle is described in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.

After the Battle of Hastings and the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of Battle Abbey. In its 1086 Domesday Book listing, the town was explicitly described as a borough. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey. Reading Abbey was founded in 1121 by Henry I, who is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands in Reading, along with land at Cholsey.

The town grew around a crossing of the River Kennet, about upstream from its confluence with the River Thames. In 1312, King Edward II directed that its bridges should be kept in good order. It is not known how badly Reading was affected by the Black Death that swept through England in the 14th century, but it is known that the abbot, Henry of Appleford, was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby Henley lost 60% of its population. The Abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church.

By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire and the tenth largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth reported in tax returns. By 1611, it had a population of over 5,000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant John Kendrick. Reading played a role during the English Civil War. Despite its fortifications, it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent Siege of Reading by Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643. The town&#x27;s cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town&#x27;s economy did not fully recover until the 20th century. Reading played a significant role during the Glorious Revolution: the second Battle of Reading was the only substantial military action of the campaign.

The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. Reading&#x27;s trade benefited from better designed turnpike roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to Oxford and the West Country. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town. After the opening of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810, one could go by barge from Reading to the Bristol Channel. From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of county town of Berkshire was shared between Reading and Abingdon. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was one of the southern termini of the Hatfield and Reading Turnpike that allowed travellers from the north to continue their journey to the west without going through the congestion of London.

During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. The Great Western Railway arrived in 1841, followed by the South Eastern Railway in 1849 and the London and South Western Railway in 1856. After the Summer Assizes (courts of assize) were moved from Abingdon to Reading in 1867, the privy council made Reading the sole county town of Berkshire in 1869. The town became county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the town&#x27;s three largest industries were known as the &quot;Three Bs&quot;: beer (1785–2010, H &amp; G Simonds), bulbs (1837–1974, Suttons Seeds), and biscuits (1822–1976, Huntley and Palmers).

===20th century===
The town continued to expand in the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911, as well as most of Tilehurst to the west at the same time. Reading suffered much less physical damage than many other English towns and cities during the two world wars of the 20th century, although many citizens were killed or injured. In one significant air raid on 10 February 1943 a single Luftwaffe plane strafed and bombed the town centre, causing 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.

The Lower Earley development, begun in 1977, was one of the largest private housing developments in Europe, extending the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 Motorway. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th-century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied a small part of the site. It provides three storeys of shopping space and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs.

===21st century===
As one of the largest urban areas in the United Kingdom without city status, Reading has unsuccessfully bid for city status four times – in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium; in 2002 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II; in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee; and in 2022 to mark the Platinum Jubilee.

==Governance==
Local government for the borough is provided by Reading Borough Council, which has been a unitary authority providing all local government functions since 1998. There are no civil parishes in the borough. Some of the built-up area&#x27;s outer suburbs are outside the borough boundaries in West Berkshire and Wokingham. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status.

Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Since the 2024 general election, the borough of Reading has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading Central, Reading West and Mid Berkshire (which also covers part of West Berkshire), and Earley and Woodley (which also covers part of the borough of Wokingham).

Reading is the site of venues for both the Crown Court, administering criminal justice, and the County Court, responsible for civil cases. Lesser matters are dealt with in a local magistrates&#x27; court.

===Administrative history===

Reading was an ancient borough, being described as a borough by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. The borough was initially controlled by Reading Abbey as its manorial owner. The town gradually gained a degree of independence from the abbey from the 13th century onwards, particularly after the town&#x27;s merchant guild was granted a royal charter in 1253. Following the dissolution of the abbey in 1538 the borough was granted a new charter in 1542. The borough boundaries were then set out in a subsequent charter from Elizabeth I in 1560. The borough covered the whole of the parish of St Laurence and parts of the parishes of St Giles and St Mary. The part of St Giles&#x27; parish outside the borough was known as the hamlet of Whitley, and the part of St Mary&#x27;s parish outside the borough was known as the tithing of Southcote.

The borough was reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The borough boundaries, which had not been changed since 1560, were enlarged in 1887 to take in Southcote, Whitley, the north-western parts of Earley, and the eastern end of the parish of Tilehurst. When elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, Reading was considered large enough for its existing borough council to provide county-level services, and so Reading was made a county borough, independent from Berkshire County Council.

The borough boundaries were enlarged again in 1911 to take in Caversham on the north bank of the Thames from Oxfordshire (except the Caversham Park area, which was transferred to the parish of Eye and Dunsden), and most of the parish of Tilehurst (including the main village at Tilehurst Triangle and the area around the parish church at Churchend) to the west.

Local government was reformed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which saw Reading redesignated as a non-metropolitan district, with Berkshire County Council providing county-level services in the borough for the first time. Ahead of those reforms, the borough council campaigned to have Reading&#x27;s boundaries enlarged to take in Earley, Woodley, Purley on Thames, the residual Tilehurst parish (covering the parts of Tilehurst which had not been transferred into the borough in 1911), and the eastern part of the parish of Theale. The government decided to make no change to Reading&#x27;s boundaries, leaving them as they had been since last reviewed in 1911. Shortly after the 1974 reforms came into effect, a more limited review of the borough&#x27;s boundaries north of the Thames was carried out, which saw the Caversham Park area and part of the parish of Mapledurham on the western side of Caversham transferred into the borough of Reading in 1977.

The borough council became a unitary authority in 1998, when the county council was abolished under the Banham Review, which saw the borough council take over county-level functions, effectively restoring the council to the powers it had held when Reading was a county borough prior to 1974. As part of those reforms, the Local Government Commission had initially recommended expanding Reading&#x27;s boundaries to include Earley, Tilehurst parish, Purley on Thames and the parts of the parishes of Shinfield, Burghfield and Theale north of the M4 motorway, but it was ultimately decided to leave Reading&#x27;s boundaries unchanged.

Reading&#x27;s boundaries south of the Thames therefore have not changed since 1911, despite the urban area having now expanded well beyond the borough boundaries. Cross-boundary working between the borough council and the neighbouring councils which cover the suburban and adjoining rural areas is sometimes criticised, particularly over matters such as transport and school catchment areas.
Prior to the 16th century, civic administration for the town of Reading was situated in the &quot;Yield Hall&quot;, a guild hall situated by the River Kennet near today&#x27;s Yield Hall Lane. After a brief stay in what later became Greyfriars Church, the town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium of Reading Abbey. For some 400 years up to the 1970s, this was to remain the site of Reading&#x27;s civic administration through the successive rebuilds that eventually created today&#x27;s Town Hall. In 1976, Reading Borough Council moved to the new Civic Centre. In 2014, they moved again to civic offices in a refurbished existing office building on Bridge Street, in order to facilitate the demolition and redevelopment of the previous site.

==Geography==

Reading is north of the English south coast. The centre of Reading is on a low ridge between the River Thames and River Kennet, close to their confluence, reflecting the town&#x27;s history as a river port. Just above the confluence, the Kennet cuts through a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. The Kennet, which naturally divided into multiple shallow streams through the centre of Reading, was embanked as part of the construction of the Kennet and Avon Canal in the 18th century, allowing the development of wharves. The floodplains adjoining Reading&#x27;s two rivers are subject to occasional flooding.

As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to the west between the two rivers into the foothills of the Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and south-east on the south side of the River Kennet as far as Whitley Wood and Lower Earley and as far north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet flood plain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area.

===Climate===
Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a maritime climate, with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official Met Office weather station is located at the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory on the Whiteknights Campus, which has recorded atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970. The local absolute maximum temperature of was recorded on 19 July 2022 and the local absolute minimum temperature of was recorded in January 1982.


==Demography==
In mid-2018, the area covered by the Borough of Reading had inhabitants and a population density of . Meanwhile, the wider urban area had a population of 318,014 in the 2011 census, ranking 23rd in the United Kingdom. This grew to an estimated 337,108 by mid-2018. According to the 2011 census, 74.8% of the borough&#x27;s population were described as White (65.3% White British), 9.1% as South Asian, 6.7% as Black, 3.9% Mixed, 4.5% as Chinese and 0.9% as other ethnic group. In 2010, it was reported that Reading had 150 different spoken languages within its population. Reading has a large Polish community, which dates back over 30 years, and in October 2006 the &quot;Reading Chronicle&quot; printed 5,000 copies of a Polish edition called the &quot;Kronika Reading&quot;.

==Economy==

Reading is a commercial centre in the Thames Valley and Southern England. The town hosts the headquarters of several British companies and the United Kingdom offices of foreign multinationals, as well as being a major retail centre. Whilst located close enough to London to be sometimes regarded as part of the London commuter belt, Reading is a net inward destination for commuters. During the morning peak period, there are some 30,000 inward arrivals in the town, compared to 24,000 departures. Major companies Microsoft, Oracle and Hibu (formerly Yell Group) have their headquarters in the Reading area. The insurance company Prudential has an administration centre in the town. PepsiCo and Wrigley have offices.

Global pharmaceutical giant Bayer Life Sciences relocated to Reading&#x27;s Green Park Business Park in 2016. Reading has a significant historical involvement in the information technology industry, largely as a result of the early presence in the town of sites of International Computers Limited and Digital Equipment Corporation. Other technology companies with a significant presence in the town include Huawei Technologies, Pegasystems, Access IS, CGI Inc., Agilent Technologies, Cisco, Ericsson, Symantec, Verizon Business, and Commvault. These companies are distributed around Reading or just outside the borough boundary, some in business parks including Thames Valley Park in nearby Earley, Green Park Business Park and Arlington Business Park.

Reading town centre is a major shopping centre. In 2007, an independent poll placed Reading 16th in a league table of best performing retail centres in the United Kingdom. The main shopping street is Broad Street, which runs between The Oracle in the east and Broad Street Mall in the west and was pedestrianised in 1995. The smaller Friars Walk in Friar Street is closed and will be demolished if the proposed Station Hill redevelopment project goes ahead. There are three major department stores in Reading: John Lewis &amp; Partners (known as &quot;Heelas&quot; until 2001), Debenhams (now closed down), and House of Fraser. The Broad Street branch of bookseller Waterstone&#x27;s is a conversion of a nonconformist chapel dating from 1707. Besides the two major shopping malls, Reading has three smaller shopping arcades, the Bristol and West Arcade, Harris Arcade and The Walk, which contain smaller specialist stores. An older form of retail facility is represented by Union Street, popularly known as &quot;Smelly Alley&quot;. Reading has no indoor market, but there is a street market in Hosier Street. A farmers&#x27; market operates on two Saturdays a month. The old Victorian Corn Exchange now provides an alternative access to a shopping centre.

===Festivals===

Every year Reading hosts the Reading Festival, which has been running since 1971. The festival takes place on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend and is the largest of its kind in the United Kingdom aside from the Glastonbury Festival. Reading Festival takes place at Little Johns Farm in Reading, Richfield Avenue. For some twenty years until 2006, Reading was also known for its WOMAD Festival until it moved to Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. 

The Reading Beer Festival was first held in 1994 and has now grown to one of the largest beer festivals in the United Kingdom. It is held at King&#x27;s Meadow for the five days immediately preceding the May Day bank holiday every year. Reading also holds Reading Pride, an annual LGBT festival in Kings Meadow.

===Venues===
The Frank Matcham-designed Royal County Theatre, built in 1895, was located on the south side of Friar Street. It burned down in 1937.

===Cultural references===

Jane Austen attended Reading Ladies Boarding School, based in the Abbey Gateway, in 1784–1786. Mary Russell Mitford lived in Reading for a number of years and then spent the rest of her life just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. The fictional &quot;Belford Regis&quot; of her eponymous novel, first published in 1835, is largely based on Reading. Described with topographical accuracy, it is still possible to follow the steps of the novel&#x27;s characters in present-day Reading. Reading also appears in the works of Thomas Hardy where it is called &#x27;Aldbrickham&#x27;. It features most heavily in his final novel, Jude the Obscure, as the temporary home of Jude Fawley and Sue Bridehead.

Oscar Wilde was imprisoned in Reading Gaol from 1895 to 1897. While there, he wrote his letter &quot;De Profundis&quot;. After his release, he lived in exile in France and wrote &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, based on his experience of the execution of Charles Wooldridge, carried out in Reading Gaol whilst he was imprisoned there. In March 2021, street artist Banksy claimed responsibility for a painting on the wall of the jail. It depicted an inmate escaping with bedsheets and a typewriter, said to resemble Oscar Wilde.

Reading was the location of the world&#x27;s first commercial studio for photograph printing, which was set up by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1844. 

Ricky Gervais, who is from Reading, made the film &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot;, which, although filmed elsewhere in the United Kingdom, is set in 1970s Reading and is named after a busy junction in East Reading. Jasper Fforde&#x27;s Nursery Crimes Division novels, &quot;The Big Over Easy&quot; and &quot;The Fourth Bear&quot;, are also placed in Reading. The BBC Two sitcom &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, based on the memoirs of Simon Doonan, is set in Reading in the late 1990s.

===Landmarks===

The &quot;Maiwand Lion&quot; in Forbury Gardens, an unofficial symbol of Reading, commemorates the 328 officers of the Royal Berkshire Regiment who died in the Battle of Maiwand in 1880. There are a number of other works of public art in Reading. The Blade, a fourteen-storey building completed in 2009, is tall and can be seen from the surrounding area. Jacksons Corner with its prominent sign, former home of Jacksons department store, occupies the corner of Kings Road and High Street, just south of the Market Place. 

Reading has two scheduled monuments, six Grade I, 22 Grade II* and 853 Grade II listed buildings, in a wide variety of architectural styles that range from the medieval to the 21st century. The scheduled monuments are Reading Abbey and High Bridge, whilst the Grade I listed buildings are Reading Abbey, the Abbey Gateway, Greyfriars Church, St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Reading Minster, and the barn at Chazey Farmhouse on the Warren.

===Media===
Reading has a local newspaper, the &quot;Reading Chronicle&quot;, published on Thursdays. The town&#x27;s other local newspaper, the &quot;Reading Post&quot;, ceased publication on paper in December 2014, in order to transition to an online only format under the title &quot;getreading&quot;. As of 2018, &quot;getreading&quot; joined the InYourArea local news network. A local publishing company, the Two Rivers Press, has published over 70 book titles, many on the topic of local history and art. Three local radio stations broadcast from Reading: BBC Radio Berkshire, Heart South and Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire and North Hampshire. Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian, BBC London &amp; ITV London can also be received. Reading has one local television station, That&#x27;s Thames Valley, which broadcasts local news throughout the Greater Reading area.

==Public services==
===Parks and open spaces===
Reading has over 100 parks and playgrounds, including of riverside paths. In the town centre is Forbury Gardens, a public park built on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey. The largest public park in Reading is Prospect Park, an estate in west Reading previously owned by Frances Kendrick but acquired by Reading Corporation in 1901. This is complemented by Palmer Park, a purpose built public park in east Reading gifted to the town by the proprietors of Huntley &amp; Palmers in 1889.

A string of open spaces stretch along one or other side of the River Thames throughout its passage through Reading. From west to east these are Thameside Promenade, Caversham Court, Christchurch Meadows, Hills Meadow, View Island and King&#x27;s Meadow. Reading also has five local nature reserves: Clayfield Copse in Caversham, with the other four McIlroy Park, Blundells Copse, Lousehill Copse and Round Copse all in Tilehurst

===Healthcare===
The principal National Health Service (NHS) hospital in Reading is the Royal Berkshire Hospital, founded in 1839 and much enlarged and rebuilt since. A second major NHS general hospital, the Battle Hospital, closed in 2005. Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust runs a NHS hospital, Prospect Park Hospital, which specialises in the provision of care for people with mental health and learning disabilities. Reading has three private hospitals: the Berkshire Independent Hospital in Coley Park, the Dunedin Hospital situated on the main A4 Bath Road, and the Circle Hospital at Kennet Island.

===Utilities===
Mains water and sewerage services are provided by Thames Water Utilities Limited, a private sector water supply company, whilst water abstraction and disposal is regulated by the Environment Agency. Reading&#x27;s water supply is largely derived from underground aquifers, and as a consequence the water is hard.

The commercial energy supplier for electricity and gas is at the consumer&#x27;s choice. SSEN runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure is the presence of a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, with the potential to produce 2.7 million kWh of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes. Additionally, Reading Hydro runs a micro hydroelectric power station on the Thames. Reading had its own power station in Vastern Road from 1895 to the 1960s. The power station was initially owned and operated by the Reading Electric Supply Company Limited, then from 1933 by the Reading Corporation until the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948.

The dialling code for fixed-line telephones in Reading is 0118. BT provides fixed-line telephone coverage throughout the town and ADSL broadband internet connection to most areas. Parts of Reading are cabled by Virgin Media, supplying cable television, telephone and broadband internet connections. Hyperoptic also has a presence in the town, supplying Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) broadband internet connections at speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s.

===Education===

Reading School (a state grammar school), founded in 1125, is the 16th oldest school in England. There are six other state secondary schools and 38 state primary schools within the borough, together with a number of private schools and nurseries. Alfred Sutton Boys&#x27; School closed in the mid-1980s. Reading College has provided further education in Reading since 1955, with over 8,500 local learners on over 900 courses. English language schools in Reading include Gateway Languages, the English Language Centre, ELC London Street and Eurospeak Language School.

The University of Reading was established in 1892 as an affiliate of Oxford University. It moved to its London Road Campus in 1904 and to its new Whiteknights Campus in 1947. It took over the Bulmershe College of Higher Education, a teacher training college, in 1989, becoming Bulmershe Court Campus. The Henley Management College, situated in Buckinghamshire and about from Reading, was taken over in 2008, becoming Greenlands Campus. The University of West London maintains a presence in the town for its higher education students, principally in nursing, but has now divested itself of its previous ownership of Reading College and its further education students.

===Libraries and museums===
The Reading Borough Libraries service dates back to 1877. Initially housed in Reading Town Hall, the central branch of the library was relocated to a new building on King&#x27;s Road in 1985.

The Reading Museum opened in 1883 in the town&#x27;s municipal buildings. It contains galleries relating to the history of Reading and to the excavations of Calleva Atrebatum, together with a full-size bowdlerised replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, an art collection, and galleries relating to Huntley and Palmers. The Museum of English Rural Life, in East Reading, is a museum dedicated to recording the changing face of farming and the countryside in England. It houses designated collections of national importance. It is owned and run by the University of Reading, as are the Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology, the Cole Museum of Zoology and the Harris Botanic Gardens, all of which can be found on the university&#x27;s Whiteknights Campus. The small Riverside Museum at Blake&#x27;s Lock tells the story of Reading&#x27;s two rivers. The Museum of Berkshire Aviation has a collection of aircraft and other artefacts relating to the aircraft industry in the town.

==Transport==


Reading&#x27;s location in the Thames Valley to the west of London has made the town a significant element in the nation&#x27;s transport system.

===River===
The town grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Thames and the River Kennet. Both of these rivers are navigable, and Caversham Lock, Blake&#x27;s Lock, County Lock, Fobney Lock and Southcote Lock are all within the borough. Today, navigation is predominantly for purposes of leisure: private and hire boats dominate traffic, while scheduled boat services operate on the Thames from wharves on the Reading side of the river near Caversham Bridge.

===Road===
Reading was a major staging point on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been replaced for long-distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving one of which is High Bridge.

Reading has two operational park and ride sites. Mereoak, a short distance south of Junction 11 of the M4, is also a stop for National Express Coaches between London and the West. A site outside the Winnersh Triangle railway station opened in 2015 and is easily accessed from the junction where the A329(M) becomes the A3290.

===Rail===
Reading is a major junction point of the National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped at a cost of £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Reading Green Park, Tilehurst and Earley. 

Reading is a western terminus of the Elizabeth line, which provides stopping services to London Paddington, and means Reading is featured on the London Tube map. Cross-London connections are possible from Reading to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east.

===Air===
There have been two airfields in or near Reading, one at Coley Park and one at Woodley, but they have both closed. The nearest international airport is London Heathrow, away. An express bus service named RailAir links Reading with Heathrow, or the airport can be accessed by rail by taking the Elizabeth line to Hayes &amp; Harlington and changing for a connecting service to Heathrow. This journey takes around 45 minutes by rail. London City Airport can be reached via a direct train to Custom House on the Elizabeth line followed by a short bus connection. Gatwick Airport can be accessed via a direct local train operating via Guildford, and Luton and Stansted airports can be accessed with one change in Central London. Further afield, Southampton Airport can be accessed directly by rail in around 50-70 minutes depending on the service, or reached by road in approximately the same timeframe.

===Public transport===
Today local public transport is largely by road, which is often affected by peak hour congestion in the borough. A frequent local bus network within the borough, and a less frequent network in the surrounding area, are provided by Reading Buses - one of the few remaining municipal bus companies in the country - and its subsidiaries Newbury &amp; District and Thames Valley Buses. Other bus operators serving Reading include Carousel Buses, Thames Travel and RedRose. ReadiBus provides an on-demand transport service for people with restricted mobility in the area.
===Bike sharing===
In March 2011, Reading Borough Council approved a bike sharing scheme similar to London Cycle Hire Scheme, with 1,000 bicycles available at up to 150 docking stations across Reading. However this scheme came to an end in March 2019, with the operator unable to cover the operational costs or find a sponsor to do so.

==Religion==
Reading Minster (the Minster Church of St Mary the Virgin) is Reading&#x27;s oldest ecclesiastical foundation, known to have been founded by the 9th century and possibly earlier. Although eclipsed in importance by the later abbey, Reading Minster has regained its importance since the destruction of the abbey. Reading Abbey was founded by Henry I in 1121. He was buried there, as were parts of his daughter Empress Matilda, William of Poitiers, Constance of York, and Princess Isabella of Cornwall, among others. The abbey was one of the pilgrimage centres of medieval England; it held over 230 relics including the hand of St. James. Today all that remains of the abbey are the inner rubble cores of the walls of many of the major buildings of the abbey, together with a much restored inner gateway and the intact hospitium.

The medieval borough of Reading was served by three parish churches: Reading Minster, St Giles&#x27; Church, and St Laurence&#x27;s Church. All are still in use by the Church of England. The Franciscan friars built a friary in the town in 1311. After the friars were expelled in 1538, the building was used as a hospital, a poorhouse, and a jail, before being restored as the Church of England parish church of Greyfriars Church in 1863. The Bishop of Reading is a suffragan bishop within the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of Oxford. The bishop is based in Reading, and is responsible for the archdeaconry of Berkshire. There are a total of 18 Church of England parish churches in Reading.

St James&#x27;s Church was built on a portion of the site of the abbey between 1837 and 1840, and marked the return of the Roman Catholic faith to Reading. Reading was also the site of the death of Blessed Dominic Barberi, the Catholic missionary to England in the 19th century who received John Henry Newman into the Catholic faith. There are now eight Roman Catholic parish churches in Reading. Kings Road Baptist Church was founded in Reading in 1640 or 1641. In addition to Catholicism and the Church of England, the Seventh-Day Adventist denomination is also represented in the town, particularly by Reading West SDA Church on Loverock Road, Reading Central SDA Church on Tilehurst Road, and various other churches around Reading.

Reading has had an organised Jewish community since 1886. At least one Jewish family living in the area has been traced back as far as 1842. The group grew to 13 families, who in 1886 declared themselves a community and commenced building a synagogue. On 31 October 1900, Reading Hebrew Congregation officially opened in a solemn public ceremony, packed to capacity with dignitaries, led by the Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler. Reading Hebrew Congregation, which still stands on its original site at the junction of Goldsmid Road and Clifton Street near the town centre, is a Grade II-listed building, built to a traditional design in the Moorish style. The community is affiliated with the Orthodox United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. Reading also has a Liberal Jewish community which convenes in the Reading Quaker Meeting House, a Modern Orthodox Judaism community, an active Jewish Society for students at the university, as well as being served by a Reform Jewish community which convenes in nearby Maidenhead Synagogue.

There are presently three mosques in Reading, initially just having the Central Reading Mosque on Waylen Street. The £3–4m Abu Bakr Islamic Centre, on Oxford Road in West Reading, was granted planning permission in 2002. The community-funded project began construction in 2007, and opened its doors in July 2013 - the holy month of Ramadan for this year. A second Islamic centre in eastern Reading has also been granted planning permission. This £4m project has garnered some controversy. Reading also has places of worship of other religions: the Shantideva Mahayana Buddhist centre, a Hindu temple, a Sikh gurdwara, a Salvation Army citadel, a Quaker meeting house, and a Christadelphian Hall.

==Sport==


Reading is the home of Reading Football Club, an association football club nicknamed &quot;The Royals&quot;, formed in 1871. Formerly nicknamed &#x27;The Biscuitmen&#x27; and based at Elm Park, the club plays at the 24,161 capacity Select Car Leasing Stadium, first named after chairman Sir John Madejski which opened in 1998, and later renamed &quot;Select Car Leasing Stadium&quot; in 2021, after a sponsor. After winning the 2005–06 Football League Championship with a record of 106 points, Reading spent two seasons in the Premier League before being relegated to The Championship. For the 2012–2013 season, the club again competed in the Premier League, after securing first place in the Championship in the 2011–2012 season, but were relegated back down to the Championship at season&#x27;s end. Reading Town Football Club, formed in 1966, played at Scours Lane and were playing in the Hellenic League Premier Division but were dissolved in 2016, while fellow non-league football club Reading City Football Club now play at Scours Lane after moving from Palmer Park Stadium at the end of the 2015–16 season. Scours Lane was also renamed to Rivermoor Stadium in 2016.

Reading is home to three senior semi-professional rugby clubs: Reading Abbey RFC, Rams RFC and Reading RFC. The Reading Rockets are the town&#x27;s semi-professional basketball team. They compete in the second tier English Basketball League Division 1, though they have tried several times in recent years to move up to the top tier British Basketball League. They play home games at the Rivermead Leisure Complex, and are coached by Manuel Peña Garces. In 2016–17 the club embarked on an 18-game winning streak. The town hosts Australian Rules football team Reading Kangaroos and American football team Berkshire Renegades. Palmer Park Stadium has a velodrome and athletics track. It is used by Reading Athletic Club and the Berkshire Renegades for training. Reading Hockey Club enter teams in both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s England Hockey Leagues.

Rowing is pursued by the Reading Rowing Club and the Reading University Boat Club, both next to Caversham Bridge, whilst Reading Blue Coat School trains at Sonning adjacent to the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake in Caversham, which provides training facilities for the Great Britain National Squad. However, almost all club rowing is done on the River Thames. The annual Reading Town Regatta takes place near Thames Valley Park, with the Reading Amateur Regatta taking place in June, usually two weeks before the Henley Royal Regatta. The town was home to a motorcycle speedway team, Reading Racers. Speedway came to Reading in 1968 at Tilehurst Stadium, until the team moved to Smallmead Stadium in Whitley, which was demolished at the end of 2008. The team is inactive pending the building of a new stadium, which was once hoped to be completed in 2012. The Reading Racers reformed in 2016 and joined the new Southern Developmental League upon its formation in 2017 winning its inaugural season undefeated. The team started back up in Eastbourne and currently races in Swindon awaiting return to a track in Reading.

The Reading Half Marathon is held on the streets of Reading in March of each year, with 16,000 competitors from elite to fun runners. It was first run in 1983 and has taken place in every subsequent year except 2001, when it was cancelled because of concerns over that year&#x27;s outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, 2018, when it was cancelled on the morning of the race due to heavy overnight snowfall, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The British Triathlon Association was formed at the town&#x27;s former &quot;Mall&quot; health club on 11 December 1982. Britain&#x27;s first ever triathlon took place just outside Reading at Kirtons&#x27;s Farm in Pingewood in 1983 and was revived 10 years&#x27; later by Banana Leisure with one of the original organisers as Event Director. Thames Valley Triathletes, based in the town, is Britain&#x27;s oldest triathlon club, having its origins in the 1984 event at nearby Heckfield, when a relay team raced under the name &quot;Reading Triathlon Club&quot;. The Hexagon was home to snooker&#x27;s Grand Prix tournament, one of the sport&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot;, from 1984 to 1994.

<text>Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids. Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications. The word derives from the Latin for lead, &quot;plumbum&quot;, as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.

In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to public health and sanitation.

Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers although they work with piping as part of their trade and their work can include some plumbing.

== History ==

Plumbing originated during ancient civilizations, as they developed public baths and needed to provide potable water and wastewater removal for larger numbers of people.

The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, used to remove wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city of Uruk contains the oldest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, . Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa. They had easily detachable and replaceable segments, and allowed for cleaning.

Standardized earthen plumbing pipes with broad flanges making use of asphalt for preventing leakages appeared in the urban settlements of the Indus Valley civilization by 2700 BC.

Copper piping appeared in Egypt by 2400 BCE, with the Pyramid of Sahure and adjoining temple complex at Abusir, found to be connected by a copper waste pipe.

The word &quot;plumber&quot; dates from the Roman Empire. The Latin for lead is &quot;&quot;. Roman roofs used lead in conduits and drain pipes and some were also covered with lead. Lead was also used for piping and for making baths.

Plumbing reached its early apex in ancient Rome, which saw the introduction of expansive systems of aqueducts, tile wastewater removal, and widespread use of lead pipes. The Romans used lead pipe inscriptions to prevent water theft. With the Fall of Rome both water supply and sanitation stagnated—or regressed—for well over 1,000 years. Improvement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, public health authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control epidemics of disease. Earlier, the waste disposal system had consisted of collecting waste and dumping it on the ground or into a river. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and cesspools.

In post-classical Kilwa the wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes.

Most large cities today pipe solid wastes to sewage treatment plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, galvanized iron piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing using soldered fittings.

The use of lead for potable water declined sharply after World War II because of increased awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning. At this time, copper piping was introduced as a better and safer alternative to lead pipes.

== Systems ==

The major categories of plumbing systems or subsystems are:
* potable cold and hot tap water supply
* plumbing drainage venting
* sewage systems and septic systems with or without hot water heat recycling and graywater recovery and treatment systems
* Rainwater, surface, and subsurface water drainage
* fuel gas piping
* hydronics, i.e. heating and cooling systems using water to transport thermal energy, as in district heating systems, like for example the New York City steam system.

==Water pipes==

A &quot;water pipe&quot; is a pipe or tube, frequently made of plastic or metal, that carries pressurized and treated fresh water to a building (as part of a municipal water system), as well as inside the building.

===History===

Lead was the favoured material for water pipes for many centuries because its malleability made it practical to work into the desired shape. Such use was so common that the word &quot;plumbing&quot; derives from &quot;plumbum&quot;, the Latin word for lead. This was a source of lead-related health problems in the years before the health hazards of ingesting lead were fully understood; among these were stillbirths and high rates of infant mortality. Lead water pipes were still widely used in the early 20th century and remain in many households. Lead-tin alloy solder was commonly used to join copper pipes, but modern practice uses tin-antimony alloy solder instead in order to eliminate lead hazards.

Despite the Romans&#x27; common use of lead pipes, their aqueducts rarely poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water, an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink (for example as a preservative in wine). Roman lead pipe inscriptions provided information on the owner to prevent water theft.

Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the US during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.

Cast iron and ductile iron pipe was long a lower-cost alternative to copper before the advent of durable plastic materials but special non-conductive fittings must be used where transitions are to be made to other metallic pipes (except for terminal fittings) in order to avoid corrosion owing to electrochemical reactions between dissimilar metals (see galvanic cell).

Bronze fittings and short pipe segments are commonly used in combination with various materials.

==Difference between pipes and tubes==

The difference between pipes and tubes is a matter of sizing. For instance, PVC pipe for plumbing applications and galvanized steel pipe are measured in iron pipe size (IPS). Copper tube, CPVC, PeX and other tubing is measured nominally, basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2&quot; PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2&quot; copper tubing. 1/2&quot; PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2&quot; tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them. When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form &quot;pipe&quot; is often used as a plural.

Pipe is available in rigid &quot;joints&quot;, which come in various lengths depending on the material. Tubing, in particular copper, comes in rigid hard tempered joints or soft tempered (annealed) rolls. PeX and CPVC tubing also comes in rigid joints or flexible rolls. The temper of the copper, whether it is a rigid joint or flexible roll, does not affect the sizing.

The thicknesses of the water pipe and tube walls can vary. Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the Standard Dimension Ratio (SDR), defined as the ratio of the pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type &#x27;M&#x27; (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type &#x27;L&#x27; (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type &#x27;K&#x27; (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter).

Wall thickness does not affect pipe or tubing size. 1/2&quot; L copper has the same outer diameter as 1/2&quot; K or M copper. The same applies to pipe schedules. As a result, a slight increase in pressure losses is realized due to a decrease in flowpath as wall thickness is increased. In other words, 1 foot of 1/2&quot; L copper has slightly less volume than 1 foot of 1/2 M copper.

=== Materials ===
Water systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s. Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as &quot;soil&quot;) out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.

The straight sections of plumbing systems are called &quot;pipes&quot; or &quot;tubes&quot;. A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding, whereas a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing, compression fitting, crimping, or for plastics, solvent welding. These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the piping and plumbing fittings article.

==== Steel ====

Galvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from to . It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as &quot;galv&quot; or &quot;iron&quot; in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader. It remains in common use for repair of existing &quot;galv&quot; systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.

Most typical single family home systems will not require supply piping larger than due to expense as well as steel piping&#x27;s tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.

==== Copper ====
Copper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including PEX and stainless steel.

==== Plastic ====
Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include:
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.
* PVC/CPVC – rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.
* PP – The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment, but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water. PP pipes are heat fused, being unsuitable for the use of glues, solvents, or mechanical fittings. PP pipe is often used in green building projects.
* PBT – flexible (usually gray or black) plastic pipe which is attached to barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system. However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for &quot;exposed locations&quot; such as risers.
* PEX – cross-linked polyethylene system with mechanically joined fittings employing barbs, and crimped steel or copper rings.
* Polytanks – plastic polyethylene cisterns, underground water tanks, above ground water tanks, are usually made of linear polyethylene suitable as a potable water storage tank, provided in white, black or green.
* Aqua – known as PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, consisting of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass compression fittings. In 2005, many of these fittings were recalled.

Present-day water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes in buildings are now made of copper, brass, plastic (particularly cross-linked polyethylene called PEX, which is estimated to be used in 60% of single-family homes), or other nontoxic material. Due to its toxicity, most cities moved away from lead water-supply piping by the 1920s in the United States, although lead pipes were approved by national plumbing codes into the 1980s, and lead was used in plumbing solder for drinking water until it was banned in 1986. Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast iron, or lead.

== Components ==
In addition to lengths of pipe or tubing, pipe fittings such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions. are used in plumbing systems. Pipe and fittings are held in place with pipe hangers and strapping.

Plumbing fixtures are exchangeable devices that use water and can be connected to a building&#x27;s plumbing system. They are considered to be &quot;fixtures&quot;, in that they are semi-permanent parts of buildings, not usually owned or maintained separately. Plumbing fixtures are seen by and designed for the end-users. Some examples of fixtures include water closets (also known as toilets), urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility and kitchen sinks, drinking fountains, ice makers, humidifiers, air washers, fountains, and eye wash stations.

=== Sealants ===
Threaded pipe joints are sealed with thread seal tape or pipe dope. Many plumbing fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with plumber&#x27;s putty.

== Equipment and tools ==

Plumbing equipment includes devices often behind walls or in utility spaces which are not seen by the general public. It includes water meters, pumps, expansion tanks, back flow preventers, water filters, UV sterilization lights, water softeners, water heaters, heat exchangers, gauges, and control systems.

There are many tools a plumber needs to do a good plumbing job. While many simple plumbing tasks can be completed with a few common hand held tools, other more complex jobs require specialised tools, designed specifically to make the job easier.

Specialized plumbing tools include pipe wrenches, flaring pliers, pipe vise, pipe bending machine, pipe cutter, dies, and joining tools such as soldering torches and crimp tools. New tools have been developed to help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or other problems; they also use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.

Flooding from excessive rain or clogged sewers may require specialized equipment, such as a heavy duty pumper truck designed to vacuum raw sewage.

== Problems ==
Bacteria have been shown to live in &quot;premises plumbing systems&quot;. The latter refers to the &quot;pipes and fixtures within a building that transport water to taps after it is delivered by the utility&quot;. Community water systems have been known for centuries to spread waterborne diseases like typhoid and cholera. However, &quot;opportunistic premises plumbing pathogens&quot; have been recognized only more recently: Legionella pneumophila, discovered in 1976, Mycobacterium avium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most commonly tracked bacteria, which people with depressed immunity can inhale or ingest and may become infected with.
Some of the locations where these opportunistic pathogens can grow include faucets, shower heads, water heaters and along pipe walls. Reasons that favor their growth are &quot;high surface-to-volume ratio, intermittent stagnation, low disinfectant residual, and warming cycles&quot;. A high surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. a relatively large surface area allows the bacteria to form a biofilm, which protects them from disinfection.

== Regulation ==

Much of the plumbing work in populated areas is regulated by government or quasi-government agencies due to the direct impact on the public&#x27;s health, safety, and welfare. Plumbing installation and repair work on residences and other buildings generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the inhabitants of the buildings and to ensure safe, quality construction to future buyers. If permits are required for work, plumbing contractors typically secure them from the authorities on behalf of home or building owners.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the national governing body for plumbing regulation is the Australian Building Codes Board. They are responsible for the creation of the National Construction Code (NCC), Volume 3 of which, the Plumbing Regulations 2008 and the Plumbing Code of Australia, pertains to plumbing.

Each Government at the state level has their own Authority and regulations in place for licensing plumbers. They are also responsible for the interpretation, administration and enforcement of the regulations outlined in the NCC. These Authorities are usually established for the sole purpose of regulating plumbing activities in their respective states/territories. However, several state level regulation acts are quite outdated, with some still operating on local policies introduced more than a decade ago. This has led to an increase in plumbing regulatory issues not covered under current policy, and as such, many policies are currently being updated to cover these more modern issues. The updates include changed to the minimum experience and training requirements for licensing, additional work standards for new and more specific kinds of plumbing, as well as adopting the Plumbing Code of Australia into state regulations in an effort to standardise plumbing regulations across the country.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, new domestic plumbing installed since 1997 has had to satisfy the requirement that it should be easily accessible for replacement after installation. This has led to the development of the pipe-in-pipe system as a de facto requirement for domestic plumbing.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom the professional body is the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (educational charity status) and it is true that the trade still remains virtually ungoverned; there are no systems in place to monitor or control the activities of unqualified plumbers or those home owners who choose to undertake installation and maintenance works themselves, despite the health and safety issues which arise from such works when they are undertaken incorrectly; see &quot;Health Aspects of Plumbing (HAP)&quot; published jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Plumbing Council (WPC). WPC has subsequently appointed a representative to the World Health Organization to take forward various projects related to Health Aspects of Plumbing.

=== United States ===
In the United States, plumbing codes and licensing are generally controlled by state and local governments. At the national level, the Environmental Protection Agency has set guidelines about what constitutes lead-free plumbing fittings and pipes, in order to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Some widely used Standards in the United States are:
* ASME A112.6.3 – Floor and Trench Drains
* ASME A112.6.4 – Roof, Deck, and Balcony Drains
* ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1 – Plumbing Supply Fittings
* ASME A112.19.1/CSA B45.2 – Enameled Cast Iron and Enameled Steel Plumbing Fixtures
* ASME A112.19.2/CSA B45.1 – Ceramic Plumbing Fixtures

=== Canada ===
In Canada, plumbing is a regulated trade requiring specific technical training and certification. Standards and regulations for plumbing are overseen at the provincial and territorial level, each having its distinct governing body:

* Governing Bodies: Each province or territory possesses its regulatory authority overseeing the licensing and regulation of plumbers. For instance, in Ontario, the Ontario College of Trades handles the certification and regulation of tradespeople, whereas in British Columbia, the Industry Training Authority (ITA) undertakes this function.

* Certification: To achieve certified plumber status in Canada, individuals typically complete an apprenticeship program encompassing both classroom instruction and hands-on experience. Upon completion, candidates undergo an examination for their certification.

* Building Codes: Plumbing installations and repairs must adhere to building codes specified by individual provinces or territories. The National Building Code of Canada acts as a model code, with provinces and territories having the discretion to adopt or modify to their specific needs.

* Safety and Health: Given its direct correlation with health and sanitation, plumbing work is of paramount importance in Canada. Regulations ensure uncontaminated drinking water and proper wastewater treatment, underscoring the vital role of certified plumbers for public health.

* Environmental Considerations: Reflecting Canada&#x27;s commitment to environmental conservation, there is an increasing emphasis on sustainable plumbing practices. Regulations advocate water conservation and the deployment of eco-friendly materials.

* Standards: The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) determines standards for diverse plumbing products, ensuring their safety, quality, and efficiency. Items such as faucets and toilets frequently come with a CSA certification, indicating adherence to required standards.

<text>Yitzhak Rabin (; , ; 1 March 1922 – 4 November 1995) was an Israeli politician, statesman and general. He was the fifth prime minister of Israel, serving two terms in office, 1974–1977, and from 1992 until his assassination in 1995.

Rabin was born in Jerusalem to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and was raised in a Labor Zionist household. He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student. As a teenager, he joined the Palmach, the commando force of the Yishuv. He eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In late 1948, he joined the newly formed Israel Defense Forces and continued to rise as a promising officer, with a 27-year career as a professional soldier. He ultimately attained the rank of Rav Aluf, the most senior rank in the Israeli Defense Force (often translated as lieutenant general). In the 1950s, Rabin helped shape the training doctrine of the IDF and he led its Operations Directorate from 1959 to 1963. He was appointed chief of the general staff in 1964 and oversaw Israel&#x27;s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War.

Rabin served as Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, during a period of deepening U.S.–Israel ties. He was appointed Prime Minister of Israel in 1974 after the resignation of Golda Meir. In his first term, Rabin signed the Sinai Interim Agreement and ordered the Entebbe raid. He resigned in 1977 in the wake of a financial scandal. Rabin was Israel&#x27;s minister of defense for much of the 1980s, including during the outbreak of the First Intifada.

In 1992, Rabin was re-elected as prime minister on a platform embracing the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership as part of the Oslo Accords. In 1994, Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize together with long-time political rival Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by Yigal Amir, an extremist who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Amir was convicted of Rabin&#x27;s murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Rabin was the first native-born prime minister of Israel, the only prime minister to be assassinated, and the second to die in office after Levi Eshkol. Rabin has become a symbol of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.

==Personal life==
===Family background===
Rabin was born at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem on 1 March 1922, Mandatory Palestine, to Nehemiah (1886 – 1 December 1971) and Rosa (née Cohen; 1890 – 12 November 1937) Rabin, immigrants of the Third Aliyah, the third wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine from Europe. Nehemiah was born Nehemiah Rubitzov in the shtetl Sydorovychi near Ivankiv in the southern Pale of Settlement (present-day Ukraine). His father Menachem died when he was a boy, and Nehemiah worked to support his family from an early age. At the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, where he joined the Poale Zion party and changed his surname to Rabin. In 1917, Nehemiah Rabin went to Mandatory Palestine with a group of volunteers from the Jewish Legion.

Yitzhak&#x27;s mother, Rosa Cohen, was born in 1890 in Mogilev in Belarus. Her father, a rabbi, opposed the Zionist movement and sent Rosa to a Christian high school for girls in Gomel, which gave her a broad general education. Early on, Rosa took an interest in political and social causes. In 1919, she traveled to Palestine on the steamship &quot;Ruslan&quot;. After working on a kibbutz on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, she moved to Jerusalem.

Rabin&#x27;s parents met in Jerusalem during the 1920 Nebi Musa riots. They moved to Tel Aviv&#x27;s Chlenov Street near Jaffa in 1923. Nehemiah became a worker for the Palestine Electric Corporation and Rosa was an accountant and local activist. She became a member of the Tel Aviv City Council. The family moved again in 1931 to a two-room apartment on Hamagid Street in Tel Aviv.

===Early life and education===
Yitzhak (Isaac) Rabin grew up in Tel Aviv, where the family relocated when he was one year old. He enrolled in the Tel Aviv Beit Hinuch Leyaldei Ovdim (בית חינוך לילדי עובדים, &quot;School House for Workers&#x27; Children&quot;) in 1928 and completed his studies there in 1935. The school taught the children agriculture as well as Zionism. Rabin mostly received good marks in school, but he was so shy that few people knew he was intelligent.

In 1935, Rabin enrolled at an agricultural school on kibbutz Givat Hashlosha that his mother founded. It was here in 1936 at the age of 14 that Rabin joined the Haganah and received his first military training, learning how to use a pistol and stand guard. He joined a socialist-Zionist youth movement, HaNoar HaOved.

In 1937, he enrolled at the two-year Kadoorie Agricultural High School. He excelled in a number of agriculture-related subjects but disliked studying English language—the language of the British &quot;enemy.&quot; He originally aspired to be an irrigation engineer, but his interest in military affairs intensified in 1938, when the ongoing Arab revolt worsened. A young Haganah sergeant named Yigal Allon, later a general in the IDF and prominent politician, trained Rabin and others at Kadoorie. Rabin finished at Kadoorie in August 1940. For part of 1939, the British closed Kadoorie, and Rabin joined Allon as a security guard at Kibbutz Ginosar until the school re-opened. When he finished school, Rabin considered studying irrigation engineering on scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley, although he ultimately decided to stay and fight in Palestine.

==Marriage and family==
Rabin married Leah Schlossberg during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Leah Rabin was working at the time as a reporter for a Palmach newspaper. They had two children, Dalia (born 19 March 1950) and Yuval (born 18 June 1955). Similar to the entire Israeli elite of the time, Rabin adhered to a secular-national understanding of Jewish identity, and was non-religious. American diplomat Dennis Ross described him as &quot;the most secular Jew he had met in Israel&quot;.

==Military career==
===Palmach===

In 1941, during his practical training at kibbutz Ramat Yohanan, Rabin joined the newly formed Palmach section of the Haganah, under the influence of Yigal Allon. Rabin could not yet operate a machine gun, drive a car, or ride a motorcycle, but Moshe Dayan accepted the new recruit. The first operation he participated in was assisting the allied invasion of Lebanon, then held by Vichy French forces (the same operation in which Dayan lost his eye) in June–July 1941. Allon continued to train the young Palmach forces.

As a Palmachnik, Rabin and his men had to lie low to avoid arousing inquiry from the British administration. They spent most of their time farming, training secretly part-time. They wore no uniforms and received no public recognition during this time. In 1943, Rabin took command of a platoon at Kfar Giladi. He trained his men in modern tactics and how to conduct lightning attacks.

After the end of the war the relationship between the Palmach and the British authorities became strained, especially with respect to the treatment of Jewish immigration. In October 1945 Rabin planned a Palmach raid on the Atlit detainee camp in which 208 Jewish illegal immigrants who had been interned there were freed. In the Black Shabbat, a massive British operation against the leaders of the Jewish Establishment in the British Mandate of Palestine and the Palmach, Rabin was arrested and detained for five months. After his release he became the commander of the second Palmach battalion and rose to the position of Chief Operations Officer of the Palmach in October 1947.

===IDF service===

During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Rabin directed Israeli operations in Jerusalem and fought the Egyptian army in the Negev. During the beginning of the war he was the commander of the Harel Brigade, which fought on the road to Jerusalem from the coastal plain, including the Israeli &quot;Burma Road&quot;, as well as many battles in Jerusalem, such as securing the southern side of the city by recapturing kibbutz Ramat Rachel.
During the first truce Rabin commanded IDF forces on the beach of Tel Aviv confronting the Irgun during the tragic Altalena Affair. The Altalena ship carried about 1,000 American MAHAL volunteers for the War of Independence and large amount of weapons and ammunition for the war. It was organized by Hillel Kook of the Irgun. The day after much of the contents was offloaded at Kfar Vitkin the ship was attacked at Ben Gurion&#x27;s orders off the Tel Aviv shore, set on fire, later towed out to sea and sunk. Large number of volunteers were killed on board and after jumping in the sea. Rabin called the gun on shore &quot;The Holy Gun&quot;. &quot;Despite the tension and bloodshed, Begin went on the radio calling on members of the Irgun not to fight the IDF: &quot;Do not raise a hand against a brother, not even today. It is forbidden for a Hebrew weapon to be used against Hebrew fighters.&quot;&quot; This probably prevented the likelihood of civil war.

In the following period he was the deputy commander of Operation Danny, the largest scale operation to that point, which involved four IDF brigades. The cities of Ramle and Lydda were captured, as well as the major airport in Lydda, as part of the operation. Following the capture of the two towns there was an expulsion of their Arab population. Rabin signed the expulsion order, which included the following:

... 1. The inhabitants of Lydda must be expelled quickly without attention to age. ... 2. Implement immediately.
Later, Rabin was chief of operations for the Southern Front and participated in the major battles ending the fighting there, including Operation Yoav and Operation Horev.

In the beginning of 1949 he was a member of the Israeli delegation to the armistice talks with Egypt that were held on the island of Rhodes. The result of the negotiations were the 1949 Armistice Agreements, which ended the official hostilities of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Following the demobilization at the end of the war he was the most senior (former) member of the Palmach that remained in the IDF.

Like many Palmach leaders, Rabin was politically aligned with the left wing pro-Soviet Ahdut HaAvoda party and later Mapam. These officers were distrusted by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and several resigned from the army in 1953 after a series of confrontations. Those members of Mapam who remained, such as Rabin, Haim Bar-Lev and David Elazar, had to endure several years in staff or training posts before resuming their careers.

Rabin headed Israel&#x27;s Northern Command from 1956 to 1959. In 1964 he was appointed chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) by Levi Eshkol, who had replaced David Ben-Gurion as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Since Eshkol did not have much military experience and trusted Rabin&#x27;s judgement, he had a very free hand. According to the memoirs of Eshkol&#x27;s military secretary, Eshkol followed Rabin &quot;with closed eyes&quot;.

Under his command, the IDF achieved victory over Egypt, Syria and Jordan in the Six-Day War in 1967. After the Old City of Jerusalem was captured by the IDF, Rabin was among the first to visit the Old City, and delivered a famous speech on Mount Scopus, at the Hebrew University. In the days leading up to the war, it was reported that Rabin suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to function. After this short hiatus, he resumed full command over the IDF.

==Ambassador to the United States (1968–1973)==

Following his retirement from the IDF he became ambassador to the United States beginning in 1968, serving for five years. In this period the US became the major weapon supplier of Israel and in particular he managed to get the embargo on the F-4 Phantom fighter jets lifted. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War he served in no official capacity.

==Minister of Labour==
In the elections held at the end of 1973, Rabin was elected to the Knesset as a member of the Alignment. He was appointed Israeli Minister of Labour in March 1974 in the short-lived Golda Meir-led 16th government.

==First term as Prime Minister (1974–1977)==
Following Golda Meir&#x27;s resignation in April 1974, Rabin was elected party leader, after he defeated Shimon Peres. The rivalry between these two Labour leaders remained fierce and they competed several times in the next two decades for the leadership role, and even for who deserved credit for government achievements. Rabin succeeded Golda Meir as Prime Minister of Israel on 3 June 1974. This was a coalition government, including Ratz, the Independent Liberals, Progress and Development and the Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers. This arrangement, with a bare parliamentary majority, held for a few months and was one of the few periods in Israel&#x27;s history where the religious parties were not part of the coalition. The National Religious Party joined the coalition on 30 October 1974 and Ratz left on 6 November.

In foreign policy, the major development at the beginning of Rabin&#x27;s term was the Sinai Interim Agreement between Israel and Egypt, signed on 1 September 1975. Both countries declared that the conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means. This agreement followed Henry Kissinger&#x27;s shuttle diplomacy and a threatened &quot;reassessment&quot; of the United States&#x27; regional policy and its relations with Israel. Rabin notes it was &quot;an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American–Israeli relations.&quot; But the agreement was an important step towards the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the peace treaty with Egypt signed in 1979.

Operation Entebbe was perhaps the most dramatic event during Rabin&#x27;s first term of office. On his orders, the IDF performed a long-range undercover raid to rescue passengers of an airliner hijacked by militants belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&#x27;s Wadie Haddad faction and the German Revolutionary Cells (RZ), who had been brought to Idi Amin&#x27;s Uganda. The operation was generally considered a tremendous success, and its spectacular character has made it the subject of much continued comment and study.

Towards the end of 1976 his coalition government with the religious parties suffered a crisis: A motion of no confidence had been brought by Agudat Yisrael over a breach of the Sabbath on an Israeli Air Force base when four F-15 jets were delivered from the US and the National Religious Party had abstained. Rabin dissolved his government and decided on new elections, which were to be held in May 1977.

Rabin was narrowly reelected as party leader over Shimon Peres in February 1977.

Following the March 1977 meeting between Rabin and U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Rabin publicly announced that the U.S. supported the Israeli idea of defensible borders; Carter then issued a clarification. A &quot;fallout&quot; in U.S./Israeli relations ensued. It is thought that the fallout contributed to the Israeli Labor Party&#x27;s defeat in the May 1977 elections. On 15 March 1977, &quot;Haaretz&quot; journalist Dan Margalit revealed that a joint dollar account in the names of Yitzhak and Leah Rabin, opened in a Washington, D.C., bank during Rabin&#x27;s term of office as Israel ambassador (1968–73), was still open, in breach of Israeli law. According to Israeli currency regulations at the time, it was illegal for citizens to maintain foreign bank accounts without prior authorization. Rabin resigned on 7 April 1977, following the revelation by &quot;Maariv&quot; journalist S. Isaac Mekel that the Rabins held two accounts in Washington, not one, containing $10,000, and that a Finance Ministry administrative penalty committee fined them IL150,000. Rabin withdrew from the party leadership and candidacy for prime minister.

==Opposition Knesset member (1977–1984)==
Following Labour Party&#x27;s defeat in the 1977 election, Likud&#x27;s Menachem Begin became prime minister, and Labor (which was part of the Alignment alliance) entered the opposition. Until 1984 Rabin, as a member of Knesset, sat on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

Rabin unsuccessfully challenged Shimon Peres for Israeli Labor Party leadership in the 1980 Israeli Labor Party leadership election.

==Minister of Defense (1984–1990)==
From 1984 until 1990, Labor was in government as part of the coalitions which formed the 21st and 22nd governments during the 11th Knesset and the 23rd government during the first portion of the 10th Knesset.

From 1984 to 1990, Rabin served as Minister of Defense in several national unity governments led by prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres. When Rabin came to office, Israeli troops were still deep in Lebanon. Rabin ordered their withdrawal to a &quot;Security Zone&quot; on the Lebanese side of the border. The South Lebanon Army was active in this zone, along with the Israeli Defence Forces.

On 4 August 1985 Minister of Defence Rabin introduced an Iron Fist policy in the West Bank, reviving the use of British Mandate era legislation to detain people without trial, demolish houses, close newspapers and institutions as well as deporting activists. The change in policy came after a sustained public campaign demanding a tougher policy following the May 1985 prisoner exchange in which 1,150 Palestinians had been released.

When the first Intifada broke out, Rabin adopted harsh measures to stop the violent riots, even authorizing the use of &quot;Force, might and beatings,&quot; on the rioters. The derogative term the &quot;bone breaker&quot; was used as a critical International slogan. The combination of the failure of the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; policy, Israel&#x27;s deteriorating international image, and Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the West Bank with the U.S.&#x27;s recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence through negotiation and dialogue with the PLO.

In 1988 Rabin was responsible for the assassination of Abu Jihad in Tunis and two weeks later he personally supervised the destruction of the Hizbullah stronghold in Meidoun during Operation Law and Order, in which the IDF claimed 40–50 Hizbullah fighters were killed. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and seventeen wounded.

Minister of Defence Rabin planned and executed the 27 July 1989 abduction of the Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid and two of his aides from Jibchit in South Lebanon. Hizbullah responded by announcing the execution of Colonel Higgins, a senior American officer working with UNIFIL who had been kidnapped in February 1988.

==Opposition Knesset member (1990–1992)==
In &quot;the dirty trick&quot;, the Labor Party left the coalition of the 23rd government in an effort to form a new coalition to be led by Peres. This failed as Yitzhak Shamir formed the 24th government with Labor in the opposition for the remainder of the 10th Knesset.

From 1990 to 1992, Rabin again sat on the Knesset&#x27;s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

Following the backfiring of &quot;the dirty trick&quot; on Peres and the Labor Party, Rabin unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the party to schedule a leadership election in 1990. A prospective leadership race in 1990 had looked promising to Rabin. Peres was weakened from the backfiring of &quot;the dirty trick&quot;, and polling showed Rabin to be the nation&#x27;s most popular politician. Additionally, many of Peres&#x27; longtime backers in the party had begun shifting their support to Rabin. In July 1990, the Labor Party&#x27;s 120 member Leadership Bureau voted to recommend that the party hold an immediate leadership election. However, one week later, on 22 July 1990, the 1,400 member Labor Party Central Committee voted 54 to 46% against holding an immediate leadership contest. This set the party up to not hold a leadership election until at least following year, unless the next Knesset election were to have been scheduled earlier than the anticipated 1992. The committee&#x27;s vote to reject Rabin&#x27;s push for a 1990 leadership contest was regarded as an upset result.

===Return to party leadership===
In its 1992 leadership election, Rabin was elected as chairman of the Labor Party, unseating Shimon Peres.

==Second term as Prime Minister==


In the 1992 Israeli legislative election, the Labor Party, led by Rabin, strongly focused on his popularity. The party managed to win a clear victory over the Likud of incumbent Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. However, the left-wing bloc in the Knesset only won an overall narrow majority, facilitated by the failure of small nationalist parties to pass the electoral threshold. Rabin formed the first Labor-led government in fifteen years, supported by a coalition with Meretz, a left wing party, and Shas, a Mizrahi ultra-orthodox religious party.

On 25 July 1993, after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel, Rabin authorized a week-long military operation in Lebanon. Rabin played a leading role in the signing of the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian National Authority and granted it partial control over parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Prior to the signing of the accords, Rabin received a letter from PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel, and on the same day, 9 September 1993, Rabin sent Arafat a letter officially recognizing the PLO. Two days earlier, Rabin explained that his main motive for negotiating with Palestinians was that, &quot;The Palestinians will be better at it than we were, ... because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court
and will prevent the Israeli Association of Civil Rights from criticizing the conditions there by denying it access to the area. They will rule by their own methods, freeing, and this is most important, the Israeli army soldiers from having to do what they will do.&quot; 

After the announcement of the Oslo Accords there were many protest demonstrations in Israel objecting to the Accords. As these protests dragged on, Rabin insisted that as long as he had a majority in the Knesset he would ignore the protests and the protesters. In this context he said, &quot;they (the protesters) can spin around and around like propellers&quot; but he would continue on the path of the Oslo Accords. Rabin&#x27;s parliamentary majority rested on non-coalition member Arab support. Rabin also denied the right of American Jews to object to his plan for peace, calling any such dissent &quot;chutzpah&quot;. The Oslo agreement was also opposed by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, which launched suicide bombings at Israel.

After the historical handshake with Yasser Arafat, Rabin said, on behalf of the Israeli people, 

&quot;We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice; Enough of blood and tears. Enough!&quot;

During this term of office, Rabin also oversaw the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994.

===Economic and social reforms===
Rabin significantly reformed Israel&#x27;s economy, as well as its education and healthcare systems. His government significantly expanded the privatization of business, moving away from the country&#x27;s traditionally socialized economy. The scheme was described by Moshe Arens as a &quot;privatization frenzy&quot;. In 1993, his government set up the &quot;Yozma&quot; program, under which attractive tax incentives were offered to foreign venture capital funds that invested in Israel and promised to double any investment with government funding. As a result, foreign venture capital funds invested heavily in the growing Israeli high-tech industry, contributing to Israel&#x27;s economic growth and status as a world leader in high-tech. In 1995, the National Health Insurance Law was passed. The law created Israel&#x27;s universal health care system, moving away from the traditionally Histadrut-dominated health insurance system. Doctors&#x27; wages were also raised by 50%. Education spending was raised by 70%, with new colleges being built in Israel&#x27;s peripheral areas, and teachers&#x27; wages rising by one-fifth. His government also launched new public works projects such as the Cross-Israel Highway and an expansion of Ben Gurion Airport.

===Nobel Peace Prize===


For his role in the creation of the Oslo Accords, Rabin was awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres. &quot;[M]any Palestinians viewed the peace treaty with Israel as a temporary measure only&quot;.

Military cemeteries in every corner of the world are silent testimony to the failure of national leaders to sanctify human life.
:— Yitzhak Rabin, 1994 Nobel Peace Prize lecture

==Assassination and aftermath==

On the evening of 4 November 1995 (12th of Heshvan on the Hebrew calendar), Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a law student and right-wing extremist who opposed the signing of the Oslo Accords. Rabin had been attending a mass rally at the Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv, held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards the open door of his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin&#x27;s bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital, where he died on the operating table of blood loss and two punctured lungs. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin&#x27;s bodyguards and police. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel&#x27;s foreign minister, Shimon Peres, was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.

Rabin&#x27;s assassination shocked the Israeli public and much of the rest of the world. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered at the square where Rabin was assassinated to mourn his death. Young people, in particular, turned out in large numbers, lighting memorial candles and singing peace songs. On 6 November 1995, he was buried on Mount Herzl. Rabin&#x27;s funeral was attended by many world leaders, among them U.S. president Bill Clinton, Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, and King Hussein of Jordan. Clinton delivered a eulogy whose final words were in Hebrew – &quot;Shalom, haver&quot; ().

The square where he was assassinated, &quot;Kikar Malkhei Yisrael&quot; (Kings of Israel Square), was renamed Rabin Square in his honor. Many other streets and public institutions in Israel have also subsequently been named after him. After his assassination, Rabin was hailed as a national symbol and came to embody the ethos of the &quot;Israeli peace camp,&quot; despite his military career and hawkish views earlier in life. In November 2000, his wife Leah died and was buried alongside him.

After the murder, it was revealed that Avishai Raviv, a well-known right-wing extremist at the time, was a Shin Bet agent-informer codenamed Champagne. Raviv was later acquitted in court of charges that he failed to prevent the assassination. The court ruled there was no evidence that Raviv knew Amir was plotting to kill Rabin. After Rabin&#x27;s assassination, his daughter Dalia Rabin-Pelossof entered politics and was elected to the Knesset in 1999 as part of the Center Party. In 2001, she served as Israel&#x27;s deputy minister of defense.

==Commemoration==
* The Knesset has set the 12th of Cheshvan, the murder date according to the Hebrew calendar, as the official memorial day of Rabin.
* In 1995 the Israeli Postal Authority issued a commemorative Rabin stamp.
* In 1996 Israeli songwriter Naomi Shemer translated Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot; to Hebrew and wrote music for it to mark the anniversary of Rabin&#x27;s assassination. The song is since commonly performed or played in Yitzhak Rabin memorial day services.
* The Yitzhak Rabin Centre was founded in 1997 by an act of the Knesset, to create &quot;[a] Memorial Centre for Perpetuating the Memory of Yitzhak Rabin.&quot; It carries out extensive commemorative and educational activities emphasising the ways and means of democracy and peace.
* Mechinat Rabin, an Israeli pre-army preparatory program for training recent high school graduates in leadership prior to their IDF service, was established in 1998.
* In 2005 Rabin received the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award endowed by Alexandra Hildebrandt. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, non-violent commitment to human rights.
* Many cities and towns in Israel have named streets, neighbourhoods, schools, bridges and parks after Rabin. The country&#x27;s largest power station, Orot Rabin, two government office complexes (at the HaKirya in Tel Aviv and the Sail Tower in Haifa), the Israeli terminal of the Arava/Araba border crossing with Jordan, and two synagogues are also named after him. Outside Israel, there are streets and squares named after him in Bonn, Berlin, Chicago, Madrid, Miami, New York City, and Odesa and parks in Montreal, Paris, Rome and Lima. The community Jewish high school in Ottawa is also named after him.
* The Cambridge University Israel Society hosts its annual academic lecture in honour of Yitzhak Rabin.

<text>Lensgreve Johann Friedrich Struensee (5 August 1737 – 28 April 1772) was a German-Danish physician, philosopher and statesman. He became royal physician to the mentally ill King Christian VII of Denmark and a minister in the Danish government. He rose in power to a position of &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the country, and he tried to carry out widespread reforms. His affair with Queen Caroline Matilda (&quot;Caroline Mathilde&quot;) caused a scandal, especially after the birth of a daughter, Princess Louise Augusta, and was the catalyst for the intrigues and power play that caused his downfall and dramatic death.

== Upbringing and early career ==
Born at Halle an der Saale and baptized at St. Moritz on 7 August 1737, Struensee was the third child of six born to Pietist theologian and minister Adam Struensee (baptized in Neuruppin on 8 September 1708 – Rendsburg, 20 June 1791) and his wife Maria Dorothea Carl (Berleburg, 31 July 1716 – Schleswig, 31 December 1792). The elder Struensee attended the University of Halle and served in a number of pastoral postings before being appointed Royal General Superintendent of Schleswig and Holstein between 1760 and 1791. The Struensees were a respectable middle-class family that believed in religious tolerance. Three of the Struensee sons went to University, but none became theologians like their father; two of the daughters married ministers.

Johann Friedrich entered the University of Halle on 5 August 1752 at the age of fifteen where he studied medicine, and graduated as a Doctor in Medicine (&quot;Dr. Med.&quot;) on 12 December 1757. The university exposed him to Age of Enlightenment ideals, and social and political critique and reform. He supported these new ideas, becoming a proponent of atheism, the writings of Claude Adrien Helvétius, and other French materialists.

When Adam and Maria Dorothea Struensee moved to Altona in 1758, where the elder Struensee became pastor of Trinitatiskirche (Trinity&#x27;s Church), Johann Friedrich moved with them. He was soon employed as a public doctor in Altona, in the estate of Count Rantzau, and in the Pinneberg District. His wages were meager and he expected to supplement them with private practice.

His parents moved to Rendsburg in 1760 where Adam Struensee became first superintendent (comparable to bishop) for the duchy, and subsequently superintendent-general of Schleswig-Holstein. Struensee, now 23 years old, had to set up his own household for the first time. His lifestyle expectations were not matched by his economics. His perceived intelligence and manner, however, soon made him fashionable in the better circles, and he entertained his contemporaries with his controversial opinions.
Struensee was ambitious and petitioned the Danish government through Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff for funds. He tried his hand at writing Enlightenment treatises and published many of them in his journal &quot;Zum Nutzen und Vergnügen&quot; (&quot;For benefit and enjoyment&quot;).

== Physician to King Christian VII ==
During Struensee&#x27;s near ten-year residence in Altona he came into contact with a circle of aristocrats who had been sent away from the royal court in Copenhagen. Among them were Enevold Brandt and Count Schack Carl Rantzau, who were supporters of the Enlightenment. Rantzau recommended Struensee to the court as a physician to attend King Christian VII on his forthcoming tour to princely and royal courts in western Germany, the Netherlands, England, and France.

Struensee received the appointment in April 1768. The king and his entourage set forth on 6 May. While in England Struensee received the honorary degree of Doctor in Medicine from the University of Cambridge.

During the eight-month tour, he gained the king&#x27;s confidence and affection. The king&#x27;s ministers, Bernstorff and Finance Minister H.C. Schimmelmann, were pleased with Struensee&#x27;s influence on the king, who began making fewer embarrassing &quot;scenes&quot;. Upon the court&#x27;s return to Copenhagen in January 1769, Struensee was appointed personal physician to the king. In May, he was given the honorary title of State Councillor, which advanced him to the class of the third rank at court. Struensee wrote an important report on the mental health of the King.

== Rise to power ==

First he reconciled the king and queen. At first Caroline Matilda disliked Struensee, but she was unhappy in her marriage, neglected and spurned by the king, and affected by his illness. However, Struensee was one of the few people who paid attention to the lonely queen, and he seemed to do his best to alleviate her troubles. Over time her affection for the young doctor grew and by spring 1770 he became her lover; a successful vaccination of the baby crown prince in May still further increased his influence.

Struensee was very involved with the upbringing of the Crown Prince Frederick VI along the principles of Enlightenment, such as outlined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s challenge to return to nature. However, he had his own interpretation of Rousseau&#x27;s ideas and preferred isolating the child and encouraging him to manage things largely on his own. He also took Rousseau&#x27;s advice about cold being beneficial for children literally, and the Crown Prince was thus only sparsely clothed even during wintertime.

== In control of the government ==

Struensee was named royal adviser (forelæser) and konferensråd on 5 May 1770. As in the course of the year the king sank into a condition of mental torpor, Struensee&#x27;s authority became paramount. On 15 September the 16-month period generally referred to as the &quot;Time of Struensee&quot; began.

At first, Struensee kept a low profile as he began to control the political machine. However, as the royal court and government spent the summer of 1770 in Schleswig-Holstein (Gottorp, Traventhal, and Ascheberg) his power grew. In December 1770, he grew impatient and on the 10th of that month, he abolished the council of state. A week later, he appointed himself &quot;maître des requêtes&quot;. It became his official duty to present reports from the various departments of state to the king. Because King Christian was scarcely responsible for his actions, Struensee dictated whatever answers he pleased. Next, he dismissed all department heads, and abolished the Norwegian viceroyship. Henceforth, the cabinet with himself as its motive power became the one supreme authority in the state. Struensee held absolute sway for almost thirteen months, between 18 December 1770 and 16 January 1772. During that time, he issued no fewer than 1,069 cabinet orders, or more than three a day.

Reforms initiated by Struensee included:
*abolition of torture
*abolition of unfree labor (corvée)
*abolition of the censorship of the press
*abolition of the practice of preferring nobles for state offices
*abolition of noble privileges
*abolition of &quot;undeserved&quot; revenues for nobles
*abolition of the &quot;etiquette&quot; rules at the Royal Court
*abolition of the Royal Court&#x27;s aristocracy
*abolition of state funding of unproductive manufacturers
*abolition of several holidays
*introduction of a tax on gambling and luxury horses to fund nursing of foundlings
*ban of slave trade in the Danish colonies
*rewarding only actual achievements with feudal titles and decorations
*criminalization and punishment of bribery
*re-organization of the judicial institutions to minimize corruption
*introduction of state-owned grain storages to balance out the grain price
*assignment of farmland to peasants
*re-organization and reduction of the army
*university reforms
*reform of the state-owned medical institutions

Other reforms included the abolition of capital punishment for theft; the doing away with such demoralizing abuses as perquisites; and of &quot;lackey-ism&quot;, the appointment of powerful men&#x27;s domestic staff to lucrative public posts.

Critics of Struensee thought that he did not respect native Danish and Norwegian customs, saw them as prejudices and wanted to eliminate them in favour of abstract principles. He also did not speak Danish and conducted his business in German. To ensure obedience, he dismissed entire staffs of public departments, without pensions or compensation, and substituted with nominees of his own. The new officials were in many cases inexperienced men who knew little or nothing of the country that they were supposed to govern.

Initially, the Danish people favored his reforms, but they began to turn against him. When Struensee abolished all censorship of the press, it mostly resulted in a flood of anti-Struensee pamphlets.

During the initial months of his rule, middle-class opinion was in his favour. What incensed the people most against him was the way in which he put the king completely on one side, and the feeling was all the stronger as, outside a very narrow court circle, nobody seems to have believed that Christian VII was really mad, but only that his will had been weakened by habitual ill usage. That opinion was confirmed by the publication of the cabinet order of 14 July 1771, which appointed Struensee &quot;gehejme kabinetsminister&quot; or &quot;Geheimekabinetsminister&quot;, with authority to issue cabinet orders which were to have the force of royal ordinances, even if unprovided with the royal sign manual.

Struensee&#x27;s relations with the queen were offensive to a nation which had a traditional veneration for the royal House of Oldenburg, and Caroline Matilda&#x27;s conduct in public scandalized the populace. The society which daily gathered round the king and queen excited the derision of the foreign ambassadors. The unhappy king was little more than the butt of his environment, but occasionally, the king would put up a show of obstinacy and refuse to carry out Brandt&#x27;s or Struensee&#x27;s orders. Once, when he threatened his keeper, Brandt, with a flogging for some impertinence, Brandt ended up in a struggle with the King and he struck the King in the face.

== Arrest and execution ==

Struensee&#x27;s dismissal of many government officials and officers brought him numerous political enemies. On 30 November 1771, he declared himself and Brandt counts. Those actions stirred feelings of unease and dissatisfaction in the populace of Denmark and Norway.

Christian VII along with his queen, Struensee, Brandt, and members of the royal court, spent the summer of 1771 at Hirschholm Palace north of Copenhagen. They stayed there until late in the autumn. On 7 July, the queen gave birth to a daughter, Louise Augusta. The court moved to Frederiksberg Palace just west of Copenhagen on 19 November.

The general ill will against Struensee, which had been smouldering all through the autumn of 1771, found expression in a conspiracy against him, headed by Schack Carl Rantzau and others, in the name of the Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, to wrest power away from the king, and secure her and her son&#x27;s positions of power.

The court returned to Christiansborg Palace on 8 January 1772. The season&#x27;s first masquerade ball was held at the Court Theatre on 16 January.

A palace coup took place in the early morning of 17 January 1772, Struensee, Brandt and Queen Caroline Matilda were arrested in their respective bedrooms, and the perceived liberation of the king, who was driven round Copenhagen by his deliverers in a gold carriage, was received with universal rejoicing. The chief charge against Struensee was that he had usurped the royal authority in contravention of the Royal Law (&quot;Kongelov&quot;). He defended himself with considerable ability and, at first, confident that the prosecution would not dare to lay hands on the queen, he denied that their liaison had ever been criminal. The queen was taken as prisoner of state to Kronborg Castle.

On 27 April/28 April, Struensee and Brandt were condemned first to lose their right hands and then to be beheaded. Their bodies were afterwards to be drawn and quartered. The &quot;Kongelov&quot; had no provisions for a mentally-ill ruler who was unfit to govern. However, as a commoner who had imposed himself in the circles of nobility, Struensee was condemned as being guilty of &quot;lèse majesté&quot; and usurpation of the royal authority, both of which were capital offences according to Paragraphs 2 and 26 of the &quot;Kongelov&quot;.

Struensee awaited his execution at Kastellet, Copenhagen. The sentences were carried out on 28 April 1772, with Brandt being executed first.

The king himself considered Struensee a great man, even after his death. Written in German on a drawing the king made in 1775, three years after Struensee&#x27;s execution, was the following: &quot;Ich hätte gern beide gerettet&quot; (&quot;I would have liked to have saved them both&quot;), referring to Struensee and Brandt.

<text>The &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech was a speech delivered by US President Ronald Reagan to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983, at the height of the Cold War and the Soviet–Afghan War. In that speech, Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as an &quot;evil empire&quot; and as &quot;the focus of evil in the modern world&quot;. Reagan explicitly rejected the notion that the United States and the Soviet Union were equally responsible for the Cold War and the ongoing nuclear arms race between the two nations; rather, he asserted that the conflict was a battle between good and evil.

==Background==
Reagan&#x27;s chief speechwriter at the time, Anthony R. Dolan, coined the phrase &quot;evil empire&quot; for Reagan&#x27;s use. Dolan included similar language in a draft for Reagan&#x27;s June 1982 speech before the British House of Commons in London, but reviewers flagged and struck the phrasing. Dolan included the phrase &quot;evil empire&quot; in drafts for Reagan&#x27;s speech at the National Association of Evangelicals&#x27; 41st annual convention. White House staffers who saw drafts of the speech, including David Gergen, repeatedly struck the &quot;evil empire&quot; portion; the speech eventually reached Reagan with the &quot;evil empire&quot; portion included, staffer critics concluding the event would be minor and unlikely to attract attention.

When Reagan reviewed and edited the draft himself, he extended the material on domestic matters. Dolan had included a reference to &quot;abortion on demand&quot; as a &quot;great moral evil&quot;; Reagan cut the line and added a remark asserting that &quot;until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity&quot; its &quot;right to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness must be protected&quot;. Reagan left the &quot;evil empire&quot; phrase and did not substantially alter the draft&#x27;s strongly anti-communist tone.

==Speech==
Reagan spoke at the 41st annual convention of the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983, in the Citrus Crown Ballroom of the Sheraton Twin Towers Hotel in Orlando, Florida. The speech, marking his first recorded use of the phrase &quot;evil empire&quot; to refer to the Soviet Union, has become known as the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech. In that speech, Reagan said:

Yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness—pray they will discover the joy of knowing God. But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the State, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world ...
So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride—the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an &quot;evil empire&quot;, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.

The audience applauded Reagan&#x27;s speech. A band played him off with the song &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;.

==Reception==
Contemporaneous press criticized the speech as inflammatory, and critics worried the speech portended negatively for arms negotiations with the Soviet Union. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; argued that Reagan&#x27;s rhetoric would encourage an arms race and &quot;would some day, in logic, point toward war&quot;. During a 1984 presidential debate, Reagan reiterated his assessment of the Soviet Union, saying he &quot;believe[d] that many of the things that they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have&quot;, while also emphasizing pragmatism, adding, &quot;I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other&quot;.

The Soviet Union, for its part, alleged that the United States was an imperialist superpower seeking to dominate the entire world, and that the Soviet Union was fighting against it &quot;in the name of humanity&quot;. In Moscow, the Soviet state-run press agency TASS said the &quot;evil empire&quot; words demonstrated that the Reagan administration &quot;can think only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism&quot;.

During his second term in office, in May–June 1988, more than five years after using the term &quot;evil empire&quot;, Reagan visited Mikhail Gorbachev, at the time General Secretary of the Soviet Union and a reformist, in Moscow. When asked by a reporter whether he still thought the Soviet Union was an evil empire, Reagan responded that he no longer did, and that when he used the term it was &quot;another time, another era&quot;. In a speech, Gorbachev said of Reagan&#x27;s statement that the Soviet Union &quot;t[ook] note of that&quot;; journalist Lou Cannon concluded that Gorbachev &quot;listened carefully to the message of peace that Reagan had brought with him to Moscow&quot;.

== Interpretation ==
G. Thomas Goodnight characterized the &quot;evil empire&quot; speech, along with the &quot;Zero Option&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; speeches, as part of the rhetorical side of the Cold War and reshaped public perceptions of nuclear warfare. In the former, Reagan depicted nuclear warfare as an extension of an &quot;age old struggle between good and evil&quot;. By characterizing the Soviet Union as an &quot;evil empire&quot; and therefore irrational and untrustworthy, the speech justified demurrals on peace proposals. Historian John Lewis Gaddis called the speech the &quot;complet[ion of] a rhetorical offensive designed to expose what Reagan saw as the central error of détente: the idea that the Soviet Union had earned geopolitical, ideological, economic, and moral legitimacy&quot; and argued that it &quot;could not have been better calculated to feed the anxieties&quot; afflicting Soviet leadership at the time. According to literature professor Leerom Medovoi, on top of opposing the Soviet Union, the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech directed the Evangelical audience&#x27;s attention to domestic policy and characterized American liberals as being additional enemies in a culture war that Reagan called &quot;a test of moral will and faith&quot;.

<text>The Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG; known as the Old Royal Observatory from 1957 to 1998, when the working Royal Greenwich Observatory, RGO, temporarily moved south from Greenwich to Herstmonceux) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park in south east London, overlooking the River Thames to the north. It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and because the Prime Meridian passed through it, it gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time, the precursor to today&#x27;s Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list. ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen&#x27;s House and the clipper ship &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich.

The observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II, with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August. The old hilltop site of Greenwich Castle was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren, a former Savilian Professor of Astronomy; as Greenwich Park was a royal estate, no new land needed to be bought. At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal, to serve as the director of the observatory and to &quot;apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.&quot; He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. The building was completed in the summer of 1676. The building was often called &quot;Flamsteed House&quot;, in reference to its first occupant.

The scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century, and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum, although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018.

==History==
===Chronology===

*1675 – 22 June, Royal Observatory founded by King Charles II.
*1675 – 10 August, construction began.
*1714 Longitude Act established the Board of Longitude and Longitude rewards. The Astronomer Royal was, until the Board was dissolved in 1828, always an ex officio Commissioner of Longitude.
*1767 The fifth Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne began publication of &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;, based on observations made at the Observatory.
*1818 Oversight of the Royal Observatory was transferred from the Board of Ordnance to the Board of Admiralty; at that time the observatory was charged with maintaining the Royal Navy&#x27;s marine chronometers.
*1833 Daily time signals began, marked by dropping a time ball.
*1838 – Sheepshanks equatorial, a aperture refracting telescope installed. 
*1852 Time signals were distributed through telegraph lines.
*1884 The International Meridian Conference in Washington D.C. decides that the Greenwich Prime Meridian should be the Prime meridian for the whole world, which it remains for a century.

*2011 The Greenwich museums, including the ROG, became collectively the Royal Museums Greenwich.

===Site===

There had been significant buildings on this land since the reign of William I. Greenwich Palace, on the site of the present-day National Maritime Museum, was the birthplace of both Henry VIII and his daughters Mary I and Elizabeth I; the Tudors used Greenwich Castle, which stood on the hilltop that the Observatory presently occupies, as a hunting lodge. Greenwich Castle was reportedly a favourite place for Henry VIII to house his mistresses, so that he could easily travel from the Palace to see them.

In 1676 the main building of the observatory, now known as Flamsteed House, was completed on Greenwich hill.

===Establishment===
The establishment of a Royal Observatory was proposed in 1674 by Sir Jonas Moore who, in his role as Surveyor-General of the Ordnance, persuaded King Charles II to create the observatory, with John Flamsteed installed as its director. The Ordnance Office was given responsibility for building the Observatory, with Moore providing the key instruments and equipment for the observatory at his own personal cost. Flamsteed House, the original part of the Observatory, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, probably assisted by Robert Hooke, and was the first purpose-built scientific research facility in Britain. It was built for a cost of £520 (£20 over budget; ) out of largely recycled materials on the foundations of Duke Humphrey&#x27;s Tower, the forerunner of Greenwich Castle, which resulted in the alignment being 13 degrees away from true North, somewhat to Flamsteed&#x27;s chagrin.

Moore donated two clocks, built by Thomas Tompion, which were installed in the 20 foot high Octagon Room, the principal room of the building. They were of unusual design, each with a pendulum in length mounted above the clock face, giving a period of four seconds and an accuracy, then unparalleled, of seven seconds per day.

The original observatory housed the astronomer royal, his assistant and his family as well as the scientific instruments to be used by Flamsteed in his work on stellar tables. Over time the institution became a more established institution, thanks to its links to long-lasting government boards (the Board of Ordnance and Board of Longitude) and oversight by a Board of Visitors, founded in 1710 and made up of the President and Members of the council of the Royal Society. By the later 18th century it incorporated additional responsibilities such as publishing the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;, advising government on technical matters, disseminating time, making meteorological and magnetic observations and undertaking astrophotography and spectroscopy. The physical site and the numbers of staff increased over time as a result.

=== Positional astronomy and star charts ===

When the observatory was founded in 1675, one of the best star catalogues was Tycho Brahe&#x27;s 1000-star catalogue from 1598. However, this catalogue was not accurate enough to determine longitudes. One of Flamsteed&#x27;s first orders of business was creating more accurate charts suitable for this purpose.

One of the noted charts made at Greenwich was by the Astronomer Royal James Bradley, who between 1750 and 1762 charted sixty thousand stars, so accurately his catalogues were used even in the 1940s. Bradley was the third Astronomer Royal, and his tenure started in 1742.

In the early 19th century, the main positional devices were the Troughton Transit instrument and a mural circle, but after George Biddell Airy took over as Astronomer Royal in 1835, he embarked on a plan to have better instruments at Greenwich observatory.

Positional astronomy was one of the primary functions of Greenwich for the Admiralty. The Astronomer Royal Airy was an advocate of this and the transit circle instrument he had installed in 1851 was used for a century for positional astronomy. One of the difficulties with positional astronomy, is accounting for the refraction of light through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Sources of error include the precision of the instrumentation, and then there has to be accounting for precession, nutation, and aberration. Sources of error in the instrument have to be tracked down and accounted for to produce more accurate results.

The transit circle makes two measurements; along with a clock, the time a star passed a certain point in the sky as the Earth rotates, and the vertical angle of the location of the star. The instrument can be used to plot the locations of stars, or alternately, with an accurate star chart, the time at the location of the instrument.

===1832 transit of Mercury===
The Shuckburgh telescope of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was used for the 1832 transit of Mercury. It was equipped with a filar micrometer by Peter Dollond and was used to provide a report of the events as seen through the small refractor. By observing the transit in combination with timing it and taking measures, a diameter for the planet was taken. They also reported the peculiar effects that they compared to pressing a coin into the Sun. The observer remarked:

===Greenwich Meridian===

British astronomers have long used the Royal Observatory as a basis for measurement. Four separate meridians have passed through the buildings, defined by successive instruments. The basis of longitude, the meridian that passes through the Airy transit circle, first used in 1851, was adopted as the world&#x27;s Prime Meridian at the International Meridian Conference at Washington, DC, on 22 October 1884 (voting took place on 13 October). Subsequently, nations across the world used it as their standard for mapping and timekeeping. The Prime Meridian was marked by a brass (later replaced by stainless steel) strip in the Observatory&#x27;s courtyard once the buildings became a museum in 1960, and, since 16 December 1999, has been marked by a powerful green laser shining north across the London night sky.

Since the first triangulation of Great Britain in the period 1783–1853, Ordnance Survey maps have been based on an earlier version of the Greenwich meridian, defined by the transit instrument of James Bradley. When the Airy circle (5.79 m to the east) became the reference for the meridian, the difference resulting from the change was considered small enough to be neglected. When a new triangulation was done between 1936 and 1962, scientists determined that in the Ordnance Survey system the longitude of the international Greenwich meridian was not 0° but 0°00&#x27;00.417&quot; (about 8 m) east. Besides the change of the reference line, imperfections of the surveying system added another discrepancy to the definition of the origin, so that the Bradley line itself is now 0°00&#x27;00.12&quot; east of the Ordnance Survey Zero Meridian (about 2.3 m).

This old astronomical prime meridian has been replaced by a more precise prime meridian. When Greenwich was an active observatory, geographical coordinates were referred to a local oblate spheroid called a datum known as a geoid, whose surface closely matched local mean sea level. Several datums were in use around the world, all using different spheroids, because mean sea level undulates by as much as 100 metres worldwide. Modern geodetic reference systems, such as the World Geodetic System and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame, use a single oblate spheroid, fixed to the Earth&#x27;s gravitational centre. The shift from several local spheroids to one worldwide spheroid caused all geographical coordinates to shift by many metres, sometimes as much as several hundred metres. The Prime Meridian of these modern reference systems is the IERS Reference Meridian, in full the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service Reference Meridian (in short called the IRM), which is 102.5 metres east of the Airy Greenwich astronomical meridian represented by the stainless steel strip, which is now 5.31 arcseconds west. The modern location of the Airy Transit is as the IRM is at 0 degree in longitude nowadays.

International time from the end of the 19th century until UT1 was based on Simon Newcomb&#x27;s equations, giving a mean sun about 0.18 seconds behind UT1 (the equivalent of 2.7 arcseconds) as of 2013; it coincided in 2013 with a meridian halfway between Airy&#x27;s circle and the IERS origin: .

===Greenwich Mean Time===

A key instrument for determining time was the Airy Transit Circle (ATC), which was used primarily from 1851 to 1938. It was agreed that the (Prime) &quot;meridian line marked by the cross-hairs in the Airy Transit Circle eyepiece would indicate 0° longitude and the start of the Universal Day&quot;. (Note, however, that this Prime Meridian is obsolete; the ITRF Zero Meridian, which is more than 100 meters east, is the modern standard defining longitude.) The time was determined by marking the time a star of known location would pass through the aimpoint of the telescope. In a reverse case, this type of instrument was also used for making star charts. The stars whose position was known precisely enough for being used for time determination, were called &quot;clock stars&quot;.

By 1925, confusion about whether GMT was reckoned from noon or from midnight led (in 1928) to the IAU retiring GMT for astronomical and chronological purposes, replacing it with Universal Time (UT). In 1929, UT was redefined as a statistical combination of multiple observatories. In 1948, the Office of the Astronomer Royal was moved to Herstmonceux in East Sussex and in 1957, the observatory closed, ceasing time measurement operations.

The term &quot;GMT&quot; continues to be promoted by the Observatory and the UK in general, despite no longer being measured in any way. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) forms the basis of modern civil time, and is based on the best attributes of UT1 (the modern form of UT, now measured from extra-galactic radio sources) and International Atomic Time (TAI, time kept by accurate clocks).

===Greenwich Time Ball===

The red time ball of Greenwich was established in 1833, and is noted as a public time signal. The time ball in modern times is normally in a lowered position, then starting at 12:55pm, the ball begins to rise, then at 12:58 it reaches the top; at 1pm the ball drops.

To help mariners at the port and others in line of sight of the observatory to synchronise their clocks to GMT, Astronomer Royal John Pond installed a very visible time ball that drops precisely at 1pm (13:00) every day atop the observatory in 1833. Initially it was dropped by an operator; from 1852 it was released automatically via an electric impulse from the Shepherd Master Clock. The ball is still dropped daily at 13:00 (GMT in winter, BST in summer).

The original time ball system was built by Messrs Maudslay and Field, and cost £180. The five-foot diameter ball was made of wood and leather. In the original ball system, it was hoisted by a rope up from the Octagon room, and there was a catch at the top to hold it. This could then be triggered by hand, while observing the time on an astronomical month clock, that was regulated to the mean solar time.

By dropping the ball, the public, mariners, and clock makers could then get a time signal by viewing it from afar. The ball drop would be repeated at 2pm also if possible.

The reason why 12 noon was not chosen was because astronomers at the observatory would record when the Sun crossed the meridian at that time on that day.

In rare occasions where the ball could get stuck due to icing or snow, and if the wind was too high it would not be dropped. In 1852, it was established to distribute a time signal by the telegraph wires also.

The time ball was extremely popular with the public, chronometers, railways, mariners, and there was a petition to have another time ball established in Southampton also.

=== 1890s ===

The 1890s marked the addition of a new larger refractor, the 28-inch Grubb in the Great Equatorial Dome. Because the new telescope was longer than the old Great refractor, the new dome had to be bigger; thus the famous &quot;onion dome&quot; that expands beyond the diameter of the turret was established. For the tricentennial, it was revitalized with a fibre-glass dome; the old one made of papier-mâché and iron had been taken down.

The telescope was installed by 1893, with 28-inch diameter glass doublet lens made by Grubb from Chance of Birmingham glass. The new dome was made by T. Cooke and Sons. This replaced a smaller drum-shaped dome.

The Lassell two-foot reflector was a famous metal-mirror telescope that had been used to discover the Moons Triton (orbiting Neptune) and Hyperion (orbiting Saturn). It was donated to the observatory in the 1880s, but was taken down in the 1890s.

The 1890s also saw the construction of the Altazimuth Pavilion, completed in 1896 and designed by William Crisp.
In 1898 the Christie Enclosure was established to house sensitive magnetic instruments that had been disrupted by the use of iron at the main facility.

The Observatory underwent an attempted bombing on 15 February 1894. This was possibly the first &quot;international terrorist&quot; incident in Britain. The bomb was accidentally detonated while being held by 26-year-old French anarchist Martial Bourdin in Greenwich Park, near the Observatory building. Bourdin died about 30 minutes later. It is not known why he chose the observatory, or whether the detonation was intended to occur elsewhere. The novelist Joseph Conrad used the incident in his 1907 novel &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;.

===Early 20th century===
For major parts of the twentieth century, the Royal Greenwich Observatory was not at Greenwich, because it moved to Herstmonceux in East Sussex in 1957. The last time that all departments were in Greenwich was 1924: in that year electrification of the railways affected the readings of the Magnetic and Meteorological Departments, and the Magnetic Observatory moved to Abinger in Surrey. Prior to this, the observatory had had to insist that the electric trams in the vicinity could not use an earth return for the traction current.

After the onset of World War II in 1939, many departments were temporarily evacuated out of range of German bombers, to Abinger, Bradford on Avon, Bristol, and Bath, and activities in Greenwich were reduced to the bare minimum.

On 15 October 1940, during the Blitz, the Courtyard gates were destroyed by a direct bomb hit. The wall above the Gate Clock collapsed, and the clock&#x27;s dial was damaged. The damage was repaired after the war.

===The Royal Observatory at Herstmonceux===

After the Second World War, in 1947, the decision was made to move the Royal Observatory to Herstmonceux Castle and 320 adjacent acres (1.3 km2), 70 km south-southeast of Greenwich near Hailsham in East Sussex, due to light pollution in London. The Observatory was officially known as the &quot;Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux&quot;. Although the Astronomer Royal Harold Spencer Jones moved to the castle in 1948, the scientific staff did not move until the observatory buildings were completed, in 1957. Shortly thereafter, other previously dispersed departments were reintegrated at Herstmonceux, such as the Nautical Almanac Office, Chronometer Department, the library, and observing equipment.

The largest telescope at Greenwich at that time, the Yapp telescope 36-inch reflector, was moved out to Herstmonceux in 1958. There it was reconstructed in Dome B of the facility. There it was used for astronomy in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. It was left behind at Herstmonceux in 1990 in its dome when the organization moved once again.

The tricentennial of Sir Isaac Newton had passed during the Second World War, delaying festivities. One of the ground-swells was to build a &#x27;big better&#x27; telescope in honour of the celebrated inventor of the Newtonian reflecting telescope. Some two decades of development led to the commissioning of the Isaac Newton Telescope at Herstmonceux. It proved so successful that the cloudy weather was felt to be a bottleneck to its productivity, and plans were made to get it to a higher spot with better weather.

On 1 December 1967, the Isaac Newton Telescope of the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II. The telescope was the biggest telescope by aperture in the British Isles. It was moved to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands in 1979. In 1990 the RGO moved to Cambridge. At Herstmonceux, the castle grounds became the home of the International Study Centre of Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Canada, and The Observatory Science Centre, which is operated by an educational charity Science Project.

The Observatory Science Centre opened in April 1995. Some of the remaining telescopes, which were left behind in the move, have public observation events as part of operations of the centre. The centre has established itself as a noted tourist and education attraction in its own right, featuring many old observatory items as exhibits. It was getting 60,000 visitors per year in the early 21st century.

===The Royal Observatory at Cambridge===

In 1990 the Royal Observatory moved from Herstmonceux to a new site at Cambridge, adjacent to the University&#x27;s Institute of Astronomy, where it occupied Greenwich House just to the north of the Cambridge Observatory. By now, the RGO&#x27;s focus had moved from carrying out observations from the British Isles to providing technical support, acting as a conduit between scientists in British universities and the powerful British-owned telescopes (such as the Isaac Newton Telescope, the Anglo-Dutch Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, and the William Herschel Telescope) on the Canary Islands and Hawaii.

After abandoning a plan to privatise the RGO and the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) as the RGO&#x27;s funding body made the decision to close the institution and the Cambridge site by 1998. When the RGO was closed as an institution, the HM Nautical Almanac Office transferred to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Chilton, Oxfordshire), while other work went to the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh. The old observatory site at Greenwich returned to its original name – the Royal Observatory, Greenwich – and was made part of the National Maritime Museum.

In 2002 the UK joined the European Southern Observatory, building the VISTA infrared telescope at the Paranal Observatory as an in-kind contribution.

The Astronomer Royal Martin Rees called PPARC &quot;irresponsible&quot; for how it handled the RGO.

===Greenwich site returns to active use===
In 2018 the Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (AMAT) was installed at the ROG in Greenwich. AMAT is a cluster of four separate instruments, to be used for astronomical research; it had achieved first light by June 2018, and contains:

* A 14-inch reflector that can take high-resolution images of the sun, moon and planets.
* An instrument dedicated to observing the sun.
* An instrument with interchangeable filters to view distant nebulae at different optical wavelengths.
* A general-purpose telescope.

The telescopes and the works at the site required to operate them cost about £150,000, from grants, museum members and patrons, and public donations.

The telescope was installed in the Altazimuth Pavilion, from which the multi-purpose telescope is controlled by a computer system.

== Magnetic observations ==

The first magnetic observation was taken in 1680 by the first Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, using a magnetic needle from the Royal Society. The second and third Astronomers Royal, Edmond Halley and then James Bradley, also took some magnetic measurements during their tenure.

In the 19th century George Airy established the Magnetical and Meteorological Department.

The first Magnetic House was built next to the observatory but by 1900 a second, about 300–400 metres from the main observatory, was built to reduce magnetic interference. Both houses were made of non-magnetic materials. The older building was called the Magnet House, but iron added to buildings in the 1890s at the observatory was throwing off measurements, so the instruments were moved to the Magnetic Pavilion. A new Magnetograph House was also completed by 1914.

One of the special events that occurred in the study of magnetism was when François Arago and Alexander von Humboldt took magnetic observations at Greenwich in 1822. In 1825 Arago won the Copley Gold Medal for this research (see also Arago&#x27;s rotations).

==Observatory museum==
The observatory buildings at Greenwich became a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, which is part of the Royal Museums Greenwich. Notable exhibits include John Harrison&#x27;s pioneering chronometer, known as H4, for which he received a large reward from the Board of Longitude, and his three earlier marine timekeepers; all four are the property of the Ministry of Defence. Many additional horological artefacts are displayed, documenting the history of precision timekeeping for navigational and astronomical purposes, including the mid-20th-century Russian-made F.M. Fedchenko clock (the most accurate pendulum clock ever built in multiple copies). It also houses the astronomical instruments used to make meridian observations and the 28-inch equatorial Grubb refracting telescope of 1893, the largest of its kind in the UK. The Shepherd Clock outside the observatory gate is an early example of an electric slave clock.

In 1997 the observatory site was getting 400,000 visitors per year.

In February 2005 a £16 million redevelopment comprising a new planetarium and additional display galleries and educational facilities was started; the ROG reopened on 25 May 2007 with the new 120-seat Peter Harrison Planetarium.

For a year between 2016 and 2017 the Museum reported 2.41 million visitors.

<text>Charing Cross Road is a street in central London running immediately north of St Martin-in-the-Fields to St Giles Circus (the intersection with Oxford Street), which then merges into Tottenham Court Road. It leads from the north in the direction of Charing Cross at the south side of Trafalgar Square. It connects via St Martin&#x27;s Place and the motorised east side of the square.

== History ==

Charing Cross road was originally two narrow streets in the West End, Crown Street and Castle Street. The development of Regent Street (parallel to the west) in the mid-18th century coincided with not only the building up of great fields west of the area but also Westminster Bridge which was built as central London and the wider estuary&#x27;s second bridge after more than a century of pressure, in 1750.

These pressures therefore congested the north–south axis of the inner West End almost as much as the relieved London Bridge area. Specifically a major increase in traffic occurred around Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross and Oxford Street, much of it destined from/to Tottenham Court Road, Bloomsbury and nearby routes to all northerly directions.

Charing Cross Road was therefore developed, in conjunction with Shaftesbury Avenue, by the Metropolitan Board of Works under an 1877 Act of Parliament. The Act&#x27;s total costs, including demolition and rebuilding of many rows of buildings across London was £778,238. The two streets and others such as the Thames Embankment, Northumberland Avenue and the Kingsway-Aldwych superstructure were built to improve traffic flow through central London. The scheme abolished some of the worst slums in London which delayed progress in construction while the inhabitants were rehoused.

== Bookshops ==
Charing Cross Road is renowned for its specialist and second-hand bookshops. The section from Leicester Square Underground station to Cambridge Circus is home to specialist bookshops, and more general second-hand and antiquarian shops such as Quinto Bookshop, Henry Pordes and Any Amount of Books. Zwemmer&#x27;s Bookshop, an arts bookshop founded in 1922, was present at 79 Charing Cross Road until 2002. Smaller second-hand and specialist antiquarian bookshops can be found on the adjoining Cecil Court.

The northern section between Cambridge Circus and Oxford Street includes more generalist bookshops such as the venerable Foyles. A long-standing correspondence between New York City-based author Helene Hanff and the staff of a bookshop on the street, Marks &amp; Co., was the inspiration for the book &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot; (1970). The book was made into a 1987 film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins and also into a play and a BBC radio drama. the building is a restaurant at street level, entered around the corner in Cambridge Circus, but its upper levels of the building remain as originally constructed. A brass plaque on the stone pilaster facing Charing Cross Road commemorates the former bookshop and Hanff&#x27;s book.

== Features ==

The music venue the Astoria was located here, as is one of the sites of St Martin&#x27;s Arts College, opening in 1939. To the northeast of Charing Cross Road are the music shops on Denmark Street (known as Britain&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley).

A number of theatres are on or near Charing Cross Road, such as the Phoenix Theatre (which has its entrance on the adjoining Phoenix Street), the Garrick Theatre and Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre.

Beneath the grille in the traffic island between Charing Cross Road&#x27;s junction with Old Compton Street, in the middle of the road, a road sign reading Little Compton Street can be seen, which was a historic name for the eastern end of Old Compton Street beyond its junction with Greek Street.

On the east side of the road&#x27;s southern end, at the joining of St Martins Lane, is a statue of Edith Cavell. Towards the north end is the Phoenix Garden, an environmental garden run by local residents.

== In popular culture ==
In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, the Leaky Cauldron pub is located on Charing Cross Road. Author J.K. Rowling chose this road because &quot;it is famous for its bookshops, both modern and antiquarian. This is why I wanted it to be the place where those in the know go to enter a different world.&quot;

<text>The United States secretary of defense (acronym: SecDef) is the head of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), the executive department of the U.S. Armed Forces, and is a high-ranking member of the federal cabinet. The secretary of defense&#x27;s position of command and authority over the military is second only to that of the president of the United States, who is the commander-in-chief. This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries. The president appoints the secretary of defense with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council.

To ensure civilian control of the military, U.S. law provides that the secretary of defense cannot have served as an active-duty commissioned officer in the military in the preceding seven years except for generals and admirals, who cannot have served on active duty within the previous ten years. Congress can legislatively waive this restriction and has done so three times, for George C. Marshall, James N. Mattis, and Lloyd J. Austin III.

Subject only to the orders of the president, the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control, for both operational and administrative purposes, over all DoD-administered service branches the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Forceas well as the Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense. Only the secretary of defense (or the president or Congress) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments (Department of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force) and the eleven Unified Combatant Commands. Because the secretary of defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer, and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy, its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as &quot;deputy commander-in-chief&quot;. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president; while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions, the chairman is not in the chain of command.

The secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of defense, and the attorney general are generally regarded as the four most important (and are officially the four most senior and oldest) cabinet officials because of the size and importance of their respective departments.

The current secretary of defense is Pete Hegseth, who was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump and was confirmed by the Senate on January 25, 2025.

== History ==

An Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were established in 1775, in concurrence with the American Revolution. The War Department, headed by the secretary of war, was created by Act of Congress in 1789 and was responsible for both the Army and Navy until the founding of a separate Department of the Navy in 1798.

Based on the experiences of World War II, proposals were soon made on how to more effectively manage the large combined military establishment. The Army generally favored centralization while the Navy had institutional preferences for decentralization and the status quo. The resulting National Security Act of 1947 was largely a compromise between these divergent viewpoints. It renamed the Department of War the Department of the Army, and added both it and the Department of the Navy to a newly established National Military Establishment (NME). The Act also separated the Army Air Forces from the Army to become its own branch of service, the United States Air Force.

A new title was coined by the Act for the head of the NME: Secretary of Defense. At first, each of the service secretaries maintained cabinet status. The first secretary of defense, James Forrestal, who in his previous capacity as the secretary of the Navy had opposed the creation of the new position, found it difficult to exercise authority over the other branches with the limited powers his office had at the time. To address this and other problems, the National Security Act was amended in 1949 to further consolidate the national defense structure in order to reduce interservice rivalry, directly subordinate the secretaries of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to the secretary of defense in the chain of command, and rename the National Military Establishment as the Department of Defense, making it one Executive Department. The position of the deputy secretary of defense, the number two position in the department, was also created at this time.

The general trend since 1949 has been to further centralize management in the Department of Defense, elevating the status and authorities of civilian OSD appointees and defense-wide organizations at the expense of the military departments and the services within them. The last major revision of the statutory framework concerning the position was done in the Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. In particular, it elevated the status of joint service for commissioned officers, making it in practice a requirement before appointments to general officer and flag officer grades could be made.

As the secretary of defense is a civilian position intended to be independent of the active-duty leadership, a secretary is required to have been retired from service for at least seven (originally ten) years unless a waiver is approved by Congress. Since the creation of the position in 1947, such a waiver has been approved only three times, for Army general George Marshall in 1950, Marine Corps General Jim Mattis in 2017, and retired Army general Lloyd Austin in 2021.

== Powers and functions ==


The secretary of defense, appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, is by federal law () the head of the Department of Defense, &quot;the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to Department of Defense&quot;, and has &quot;authority, direction and control over the Department of Defense&quot;. Because the Constitution vests all military authority in Congress and the president, the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the secretary of defense and the secretary&#x27;s subordinate officials generally exercise military authority.

As the head of DoD, all officials, employees and service members are &quot;under&quot; the secretary of defense. Some of those high-ranking officials, civil and military (outside of OSD and the Joint Staff) are: the secretary of the Army, secretary of the Navy, and secretary of the Air Force, Army chief of staff, commandant of the Marine Corps, chief of naval operations, Air Force chief of staff, chief of space operations, and chief of the National Guard Bureau and the combatant commanders of the Combatant Commands. All these high-ranking positions, civil and military, require Senate confirmation.

The Department of Defense is composed of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the Joint Staff (JS), Office of the Inspector General (DODIG), the Combatant Commands, the Military Departments (Department of the Army (DA), Department of the Navy (DON) &amp; Department of the Air Force (DAF)), the Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the secretary of defense.

Department of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the department and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the department. The latest version, signed by former secretary of defense Robert Gates in December 2010, is the first major re-write since 1987.

=== Office of the Secretary of Defense ===

The secretary&#x27;s principally civilian staff element is called the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and is composed of the deputy secretary of defense (DEPSECDEF) and six under secretaries of defense in the fields of acquisition &amp; sustainment, research &amp; engineering, comptroller/chief financial officer, intelligence, personnel &amp; readiness, and policy; several assistant secretaries of defense; other directors and the staffs under them.

The name of the principally military staff organization, organized under the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is the Joint Staff (JS).

=== Awards and decorations ===
The Defense Distinguished Service Medal (DDSM), the Defense Superior Service Medal (DSSM), the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (DMSM), the Joint Service Commendation Medal (JSCM) and the Joint Service Achievement Medal (JSAM) are awarded, to military personnel for service in joint duty assignments, in the name of the secretary of defense. In addition, there is the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA), which is the only ribbon (as in non-medal) and unit award issued to joint DoD activities, also issued in the name of the secretary of defense.

The DDSM is analogous to the distinguished services medals issued by the military departments (i.e. Army Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Distinguished Service Medal &amp; Air Force Distinguished Service Medal), the DSSM corresponds to the Legion of Merit, the DMSM to the Meritorious Service Medal, the JSCM to the service commendation medals, and the JSAM to the achievement medals issued by the services. While the approval authority for DSSM, DMSM, JSCM, JSAM and JMUA is delegated to inferior DoD officials: the DDSM can be awarded only by the secretary of defense.

Recommendations for the Medal of Honor (MOH), formally endorsed in writing by the secretary of the military department concerned and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are processed through the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, and such recommendations be must approved by the secretary of defense before it can be handed over to the president, who is the final approval authority for the MOH, although it is awarded in the name of Congress.

The secretary of defense, with the concurrence of the secretary of state, is the approval authority for the acceptance and wear of NATO medals issued by the secretary general of NATO and offered to the U.S. permanent representative to NATO in recognition of U.S. servicemembers who meet the eligibility criteria specified by NATO.

=== Congressional committees ===
As the head of the department, the secretary of defense is the chief witness for the congressional committees with oversight responsibilities over the Department of Defense. The most important committees, with respect to the entire department, are the two authorizing committees, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), and the two appropriations committees, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House Appropriations Committee.

For the DoD intelligence programs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have the principal oversight role.

=== National Security Council ===
The secretary of defense is a statutory member of the National Security Council. As one of the principals, the secretary along with the vice president, secretary of state and the assistant to the president for national security affairs participates in biweekly Principals Committee (PC) meetings, preparing and coordinating issues before they are brought before full NSC sessions chaired by the president.

=== Role in the military justice system ===
The secretary is one of only five or six civiliansthe others being the president, the three &quot;service secretaries&quot; (the secretary of the Army, secretary of the Navy, and secretary of the Air Force), and the secretary of homeland security (when the United States Coast Guard is under the United States Department of Homeland Security and has not been transferred to the Department of the Navy under the Department of Defense)authorized to act as convening authority in the military justice system for General Courts-Martial (: article 22, UCMJ), Special Courts-Martial (: article 23, UCMJ), and Summary Courts-Martial (: article 24 UCMJ).

== Salary ==
The secretary of defense is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule, thus earning a salary of US$246,400, as of October 2024.

== List of secretaries of defense ==
The longest-serving secretary of defense is Robert McNamara, who served for a total of 7years, 39 days. Combining his two non-sequential services as the secretary of defense, the second-longest serving is Donald Rumsfeld, who served just ten days fewer than McNamara. The second-longest unbroken tenure was Caspar Weinberger&#x27;s, at 6years, 306 days.

The shortest-serving secretary of defense is Elliot Richardson, who served 114 days and then was appointed U.S. attorney general amid the resignations of the Watergate Scandal. (This is not counting deputy secretaries of defense William P. Clements and William Howard Taft IV, who each served a few weeks as temporary/acting secretary of defense).

For precursors to this position prior to the establishment of the Department of Defense, see the lists of secretaries of the Navy and secretaries of war prior to 1947.

<text>The secretary of war was a member of the U.S. president&#x27;s Cabinet, beginning with George Washington&#x27;s administration. A similar position, called either &quot;Secretary at War&quot; or &quot;Secretary of War&quot;, had been appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789. Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first President under the Constitution, he appointed Knox to continue serving as Secretary of War.

The secretary of war was the head of the War Department. At first, he was responsible for all military affairs, including naval affairs. In 1798, the secretary of the Navy was created by statute, and the scope of responsibility for this office was reduced to the affairs of the United States Army. From 1886 onward, the secretary of war was in the line of succession to the presidency, after the vice president of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the president pro tempore of the Senate and the secretary of state.

In 1947, with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the secretary of war was replaced by the secretary of the Army and the secretary of the Air Force, which, along with the secretary of the Navy, have since 1949 been non-Cabinet subordinates under the secretary of defense. The secretary of the Army&#x27;s office is generally considered the direct successor to the secretary of war&#x27;s office although the secretary of defense took the secretary of war&#x27;s position in the Cabinet, and the line of succession to the presidency.

==List of secretaries==
===Secretary at War (1781–1789)===
The office of Secretary at War was modeled upon Great Britain&#x27;s secretary at war, who was William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington, at the time of the American Revolution. The office of Secretary at War was meant to replace both the commander-in-chief and the Board of War, and like the president of the board, the secretary wore no special insignia. The inspector general, quartermaster general, commissary general, and adjutant general served on the secretary&#x27;s staff. However, the Army itself under Secretary Henry Knox only consisted of 700 men.

<text>The secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) is a statutory officer () and the head (chief executive officer) of the Department of the Navy, a military department within the United States Department of Defense.

By law, the secretary of the Navy must be a civilian at least five years removed from active military service. The secretary is appointed by the president and requires confirmation by the Senate.

The secretary of the Navy was, from its creation in 1798, a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet until 1949, when the secretary of the Navy (and the secretaries of the Army and Air Force) were by amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 made subordinate to the secretary of defense.

On August 7, 2021, Carlos Del Toro was confirmed as secretary of the Navy.

From 2001 to 2019, proposals to rename the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps, which would have also renamed the secretary of the Navy to the secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, were introduced with wide support in the United States Congress, but failed due to the opposition of Senator and retired U.S. Navy officer John McCain.

==Responsibilities==
The Department of the Navy (DoN) consists of two uniformed services: the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. The secretary of the Navy is responsible for, and has statutory authority () to &quot;conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Navy&quot;, i.e. as its chief executive officer, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the president and the secretary of defense. In effect, all authority within the Navy and Marine Corps, unless specifically exempted by law, is derivative of the authority vested in the secretary of the Navy.

Specifically enumerated responsibilities of the SECNAV in the aforementioned section are: recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training, mobilizing, and demobilizing. The secretary also oversees the construction, outfitting, and repair of naval ships, equipment, and facilities. SECNAV is responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies and programs that are consistent with the national security policies and objectives established by the president or the secretary of defense.

The secretary of the Navy is a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. Furthermore, the secretary has several statutory responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with respect to the administration of the military justice system for the Navy &amp; the Marine Corps, including the authority to convene general courts-martial and to commute sentences.

The principal military advisers to the SECNAV are the two service chiefs of the naval services: for matters regarding the Navy the chief of naval operations (CNO), and for matters regarding the Marine Corps the commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC). The CNO and the Commandant act as the principal executive agents of the SECNAV within their respective services to implement the orders of the secretary.

===Navy Regulations===
The United States Navy Regulations is the principal regulatory document of the Department of the Navy, and all changes to it must be approved by the secretary of the Navy.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
Whenever the United States Coast Guard operates as a service within the Department of the Navy, the secretary of the Navy has the same powers and duties with respect to the Coast Guard as the secretary of homeland security when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy.

==The Navy Secretariat==
The Office of the Secretary of the Navy, also known within DoD as the &quot;Navy Secretariat&quot; or simply just as the &quot;Secretariat&quot; in a DoN setting, is the immediate headquarters staff that supports the secretary in discharging his duties. The principal officials of the Secretariat include the under secretary of the Navy (the secretary&#x27;s principal civilian deputy), the assistant secretaries of the Navy (ASN), the general counsel of the Navy, the judge advocate general of the Navy (JAG), the Naval inspector general (NIG), the chief of Legislative Affairs, and the chief of naval research. The Office of the Secretary of the Navy has sole responsibility within the Department of the Navy for acquisition, auditing, financial and information management, legislative affairs, and public affairs.

Pursuant to SecNavInst 5090.5F, the Department of the Navy &quot;Environmental Programs Manual&quot;, the secretary of the Navy and chief of naval operations recognize a number of commands annually for achievements in such areas as environmental quality, environmental cleanup, natural resources conservation, cultural resources management, pollution prevention, and recycling. 

The chief of naval operations and the commandant of the Marine Corps have their own separate staffs, the &quot;Office of the Chief of Naval Operations&quot; (also known by its acronym OPNAV) and &quot;Headquarters Marine Corps&quot;.

==Secretaries of the Navy==
===Continental Congress===
&quot;(Post of Secretary of Marine created but remained vacant)&quot;

<text>The United States attorney general is the head of the United States Department of Justice and serves as the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government. The attorney general acts as the principal legal advisor to the president of the United States on all legal matters. The attorney general is also a statutory member of the Cabinet of the United States and a member of the United States National Security Council. Additionally, the attorney general is seventh in the presidential line of succession.

Under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, the officeholder is nominated by the president of the United States, and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, will take office if confirmed by the majority of the full United States Senate. The attorney general is supported by the Office of the Attorney General, which includes executive staff and several deputy attorneys general.

The attorney general is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level: $250,600, as of January 2025.

== Name ==
The title, &quot;Attorney General&quot; is an example of a noun (&quot;attorney&quot;) followed by a postpositive adjective (&quot;general&quot;). &quot;General&quot; is a description of the type of attorney, not a title or rank in itself (as it would be in the military). Even though the attorney general (and the similarly titled solicitor general) is occasionally referred to as &quot;General&quot; or &quot;General [last name]&quot; by senior government officials, this is considered incorrect in standard American English usage. For the same reason, the correct American English plural form is &quot;attorneys general&quot; rather than &quot;attorney generals&quot;.

==History==

Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789 which, among other things, established the Office of the Attorney General. The original duties of this officer were &quot;to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments&quot;. Some of these duties have since been transferred to the United States solicitor general and the White House counsel.

The Department of Justice was established in 1870 to support the attorneys general in the discharge of their responsibilities.

The secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of defense, and the attorney general are regarded as the four most important Cabinet officials in the United States because of the size and importance of their respective departments.

The attorney general is a LevelI position in the Executive Schedule, thus earning a salary of US$221,400, as of January 2021.

== Duties and Responsibilities ==
The attorney general&#x27;s duties and responsibilities as the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government include overseeing the United States Department of Justice, enforcing federal laws, and providing both formal and informal legal advice and opinions to the president of the United States, the cabinet, and the heads of executive departments and agencies. The attorney general represents the federal government in legal matters and supervises the administration and operation of the Department of Justice, which includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Attorneys, and the United States Marshals Service.

Additionally, the attorney general advises the president of the United States on appointments to federal judicial positions and Department of Justice roles, including U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals. While the attorney general may represent the United States in the Supreme Court and other courts, this is typically handled by the solicitor general. The attorney general also performs or supervises other duties as required by statute or executive order.

The attorney general manages legal issues involving public safety, civil rights, and national security. The attorney general also communicates legal concerns to Congress and ensures compliance with federal laws across states. The attorney general&#x27;s role occasionally evolves through congressional legislation. For example, in 2001, the PATRIOT Act expanded the department&#x27;s surveillance and investigative authority in matters of terrorism and national security, significantly impacting the scope of the attorney general’s responsibilities. Additional duties include supervising federal penitentiaries and administering the United States Federal Witness Protection Program.

==Presidential transition==
It is the practice for the attorney general, along with the other Cabinet secretaries and high-level political appointees of the president, to tender a resignation with effect on the Inauguration Day (January 20) of a new president. The deputy attorney general is also expected to tender a resignation, but is commonly requested to stay on and act as the attorney general pending the confirmation by the Senate of the new attorney general.

For example, upon the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch left her position, so then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who had also tendered her resignation, was asked to stay on to serve as the acting attorney general until the confirmation of the new attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had been nominated for the office in November 2016 by then-President-elect Donald Trump.

<doc id="44003" wikidata="Q844782" url="?curid=44003" title="Dysphemism">
<text>A dysphemism is an expression with connotations that are derogatory either about the subject matter or to the audience. Dysphemisms contrast with neutral or euphemistic expressions. Dysphemism may be motivated by fear, distaste, hatred, contempt, or humour.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dysphemism&quot; was composed from the Greek elements &quot;dys&quot; δύς &quot;mis-&quot; and &quot;pheme&quot; φήμη &quot;speech, voice, reputation&quot; in the late 19th century. Related terms include &quot;malphemism&quot; (from the Latin &quot;malus&quot; &quot;bad&quot;), and &quot;cacophemism&quot; (from the Greek &quot;kakos&quot; κακός &quot;bad&quot;).

== Usage ==
A dysphemism is a marked form (standing out as unusual or divergent) which expresses a speaker&#x27;s view or attitude towards the listener or group.

== Types ==

=== Dysphemistic epithets ===
Animal names are frequently used as dysphemistic epithets. By using one, the speaker attempts to offend or antagonize the listener by targeting their humanity. Examples include &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;swine&quot;, &quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;weasel&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;, and &quot;jackass&quot;.

=== Name dysphemism ===
When a person uses another&#x27;s name rather than an appropriate kinship term or title of address. The speaker uses a more casual or lower style than is appropriate given the social context.
* &quot;Peter, what are you doing?&quot; (rather than &quot;Dad&quot;/&quot;Father&quot;)
* &quot;How are you doing, Bill?&quot; (rather than &quot;Uncle Bill&quot;)

Many languages, to a greater extent than in English, indicate respect with verb tenses and thus provide more scope for such dysphemism and require care by non-native speakers to avoid causing offence by unintentional dysphemism.

This use of language may not constitute dysphemism if the choice of words used by the speaker is welcomed by the listener, such as a father who prefers being called by his given name as opposed to &quot;Dad&quot;/&quot;Father&quot;. In that case it would appeal to the listener&#x27;s positive face rather than damage it and would thus not be a dysphemism.

Similarly, being more formal with someone than expected may be a type of dysphemism. For example, if a child usually calls their father &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;papa&quot;, calling him &quot;father&quot; may be a way of offending or antagonizing him, through coldness or distance (in other words, one might formally refer to one&#x27;s father as &quot;father,&quot; but when speaking to him one would use a particularly endearing term,) or that he is merely his role, if a child usually called &quot;Billy&quot; is addressed by a parent as &quot;William&quot;.

Dysphemism may also be indicated by the disuse or substitution of someone&#x27;s name or title. For instance, someone named Teresa who made overstated claims for a company-paid trip could be described as &quot;the little witch who charmed the boss into approving that phony expense report&quot;.

Anger or dissatisfaction with the listener (or group of people) may compel a speaker to use a name dysphemism or term of address dysphemism.

=== Cross-cultural dysphemism ===
Various slang terms that are dysphemistic in one culture may not be if they hold a different meaning in another culture. For instance, the word &quot;fag&quot; when used in American English is typically a slur against gay men. However, in British English, the word &quot;fag&quot; can be an inoffensive term used to refer to a cigarette, or, previously, a junior boy who serves a senior boy in a British public school. Likewise, the word &quot;fanny&quot; when used in American English is a euphemism for one&#x27;s buttocks, so benign that children use it. However, in British, Australian, New Zealand, and South African English, the word &quot;fanny&quot; is slang for vulva and is considered to be vulgar.

== Context and drift ==
Some phrases that are euphemisms in certain contexts can be considered dysphemistic in others. These are often referred to as X-phemisms: whether the utterance is dysphemistic or not depends on the context of the utterance. For example, many X-phemisms regarding sexual intercourse could be considered euphemistic within peer groups yet dysphemistic in certain audiences. One might be more likely to say that one &quot;got laid&quot; to a friend than to one&#x27;s grandparents.

There may also be instances in which conflicting definitions of the same word may lead to unintentional dysphemism. The pejorative use of the word terrorist is a salient example, as definitions of the word terrorist may vary across cultures and even among individuals in the same culture. Typically, the word &quot;terrorist&quot; refers to one who uses violence and fear as a means to pursue political, religious or ideological aims. This definition is ambiguous, and many groups that refer to themselves as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;liberators&quot; are referred to as &quot;terrorists&quot; by dissenting parties. Labeling groups as terrorist draws associations with other groups labeled as such even when no direct connection might be present. In 2003, the Philippine government&#x27;s intention to label the Moro Islamic Liberation Front as a terrorist organization was indicated by the organization to be an escalation of hostilities. It was their belief that by calling their organization a terrorist organization they were being directly compared to Al-Qaeda, with whom they claim no connection. Naming groups in this way has been described, &quot;A name will place emphasis on certain aspects and characteristics of an object, while neglecting or omitting other key areas&quot;.

The interpretation and the production of a text (whether it be written, verbal, or multi-modal) depends on the previous knowledge and experience of the interpreter or producer. The individual compares matching features with representations stored in their long-term memory. Certain lexical items can be used to activate these representations, conjuring stereotypical images which then become the prototype in the listener&#x27;s mind. Dysphemic terms activate negative stereotypes present in the listener&#x27;s memory and affect their interpretation of the given text.

=== Move from euphemism to dysphemism ===

The process of pejoration leads to words that were once considered euphemisms to now be considered dysphemisms. In American culture, words like &quot;colored&quot; were once considered euphemisms, but have since been replaced by terms like &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;African American&quot;. Sometimes slight modifications of dysphemisms can make them acceptable: while &quot;colored people&quot; is considered dysphemistic, &quot;people of color&quot; does not carry the same connotations. The words &quot;idiot&quot; and &quot;moron&quot; were once polite terms to refer to people with mental disabilities, but they are now rarely used without dysphemism. Likewise, the word &quot;retarded&quot; was introduced as a new polite form once the previous terms became dysphemistic; since then, &quot;retarded&quot; has itself become dysphemistic. Often a word with both euphemistic and dysphemistic uses becomes restricted to the dysphemistic use alone. The term &quot;euphemism treadmill&quot;, coined by Steven Pinker, describes this process, in which terms with an emotionally charged referent that were once euphemisms become dysphemistic by association with the referent.

=== Reclamation of dysphemisms ===

&quot;Nigger&quot; would typically be dysphemistic; however, if used between African Americans it may be seen as neutral (although extremely casual) by the listener, depending on their social distance from the speaker and perceived status relative to the other party; see &quot;nigga&quot;.

Reclamations of dysphemistic terms have been both successful and unsuccessful. The term &quot;chicano&quot; was a derogatory term and has been successfully reclaimed. Some terms like &quot;Yankee&quot; (for an American) or &quot;punk&quot; (for a late 1970s rocker), began as derogatory but were not considered such and adopted proudly by the named group. There have also been movements to reclaim words for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and otherwise non-heterosexual people, such as &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;dyke&quot;.

Other historic examples of dysphemism reclamation include the term Impressionism, which originated as a critical remark that &quot;Monet&#x27;s &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; was not art, it was an impression&quot;, but was adopted to be the formal name of the style and was accepted by the artists themselves.

== Taboo terms ==
Taboo terms are used as insults, epithets, and expletives because they damage the listener&#x27;s face, which might destroy social harmony—especially if the speaker and listener are socially distant from each other. For this reason, terms of insult are socially taboo and dysphemistic. Breaking a social taboo can act as an emotional release, with the illocutionary act of expressing a feeling or attitude.

Bad or taboo words for many things far outnumber the &quot;good&quot; words. Hugh Rawson notices in his book &quot;Wicked Words&quot; that when looking at Roget&#x27;s International Thesaurus, there are &quot;89 synonyms for drunk, compared to 16 for sober, and 206 for bad person compared to 82 for good person. The synonyms for unchastity in the Thesaurus fill 140 lines, occupying exactly four times as much space as those for chastity. For unchaste woman, 34 synonyms are listed; for unchaste man, 24. No synonyms at all are given for chaste woman and chaste man.&quot;

References to bodily excretions are often used in dysphemisms. Many communities historically believed that bodily effluvia such as feces, spittle, blood, nail-parings, and hair-clippings were cursed. Such revulsion is apparently learned: children and animals are not put off by bodily effluvia (unless they have a foul smell). In a study done at Monash and La Trobe Universities in Melbourne, Australia, subjects rated bodily effluvia according to how revolting they found them. Feces, vomit, semen and menstrual blood were rated as most revolting while nail parings, breath, blood from a wound, hair clippings, and breast milk were rated as least revolting. This continuum of the level of revulsion is apparent in certain dysphemism such as &quot;shitter&quot; for &quot;toilet&quot;, &quot;to come&quot; for &quot;to ejaculate&quot;, and &quot;puke hole&quot; for &quot;tavern&quot; or &quot;toilet&quot;.

<doc id="44005" wikidata="Q1292533" url="?curid=44005" title="The English Patient">
<text>The English Patient is a 1992 novel by Michael Ondaatje. The book follows four dissimilar people brought together at an Italian villa during the Italian Campaign of the Second World War. The four main characters consist of: an unrecognizably burned man — the eponymous patient who is presumed to be English; his Canadian Army nurse; a Sikh British Army sapper; and a Canadian self described as a thief. The story is set during the North African Campaign and centers on the incremental revelations of the patient&#x27;s actions prior to his injuries, and the emotional effects of these revelations on the other characters. The story is told through the characters&#x27; perspectives and &quot;authors&quot; of books the characters are reading.

The book is a sequel to the 1987 novel &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;, which continues the story of characters of his stories of Hana and Caravaggio; as well as revealing the fate of the latter&#x27;s main character, Patrick Lewis. It won the 1992 Booker Prize, the 1992 Governor General&#x27;s Award and the 2018 Golden Man Booker.

The book was adapted into a 1996 film with the same title. It was in early development in August 2021 for a new BBC television series, co-produced by Miramax Television and Paramount Television Studios.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot synopsis==

The novel&#x27;s historical backdrop is the North African and Italian Campaigns of the Second World War. The story is told out of sequence, moving back and forth between the severely burned &quot;English&quot; patient&#x27;s memories from before his accident and current events at the bomb-damaged Villa San Girolamo (in Fiesole), an Italian monastery, where he is being cared for by Hana, a troubled young Canadian Army nurse. A few chapters are also devoted to Kip, an Indian Sikh, during his time in England training and working as a sapper on unexploded ordnance.

The English patient&#x27;s only possession is a well-worn and heavily annotated copy of Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;The Histories&quot; that has survived the fiery parachute drop. Hearing the book constantly being read aloud to him brings about detailed recollections of his desert explorations, yet he is unable to recall his own name. Instead, he chooses to believe the assumption by others that he is an Englishman based on the sound of his voice. The patient is in fact László de Almásy, a Hungarian Count and desert explorer, one of many members of a British cartography group.

Caravaggio, an Italian-Canadian in the British foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, is a friend of Hana and Patrick, her mother&#x27;s lover. He had remained in North Africa to spy when the German forces gain control and then transfers to Italy. He is eventually caught, interrogated, and tortured, resulting in his thumbs being cut off. He is prematurely released and is standing on the Ponte Santa Trinita bridge when it is destroyed. He recovers at a hospital for over four months before he accidentally overhears about the patient and Hana. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars from his painful war experience.

During a thunderstorm, Kip and another British soldier arrive at the villa while Hana is playing on the piano. Kip decides to stay at the villa to attempt to clear it of unexploded ordnance. Kip and the English patient become friends due to the latter&#x27;s extensive knowledge on both Allied and enemy weaponry and a detailed topography of Tuscany. At one point, Hana risks her life while Kip is defusing a bomb telling him later that she had hoped both of them had died. Shortly after, Kip and Hana develop feelings for one another and begin a relationship.

The English patient, sedated by morphine, begins to reveal everything: he fell in love with the Englishwoman Katharine Clifton who, with her husband Geoffrey, accompanied Almásy&#x27;s desert exploration team. Almásy was mesmerised by Katharine&#x27;s voice as she read Herodotus&#x27; tale of Candaules aloud by the campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but she cut it short, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he were to discover them.

Geoffrey offers to return Almásy to Cairo on his plane since the expedition will break camp with the coming of war. Almásy is unaware that Katharine is aboard the plane as it flies low over him and then crashes. Geoffrey is killed outright. Katharine is injured internally and Almásy leaves her in the Cave of Swimmers. Caravaggio tells Almásy that British Intelligence knew about the affair. Almásy makes a three-day trek to British-controlled El Taj for help. When he arrives, he is detained as a spy because of his name, despite telling them about Katharine&#x27;s predicament. He later guides German spies across the desert to Cairo. Almásy returns to the cave where he finds Katherine has died years earlier. He retrieves her body from the Cave and, while flying back, the decrepit plane leaks oil onto him and both of them catch fire. He parachutes from the plane and is found severely burned by the Bedouin.

Towards the end of the novel, Kip learns through his headset that the US has bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a situation develops where he nearly shoots the English patient. Hana calms him down and Caravaggio reflects that they would not have dropped that kind of bomb on a white nation. Kip departs from the villa, estranged from his white companions, and returns to India. He marries and has two children though he still thinks of Hana.

==Characters==

===Almásy===
Count Ladislaus de Almásy is the titular character who comes under Hana&#x27;s care in Italy after being burned unrecognisably in Africa. Although Hungarian by birth, because he has lived without government identification or many verifiable long-term interactions, his accent prompts the authorities around him to perceive an English affiliation and to refer to him as the English Patient. Almásy serves as a blank canvas onto which the other characters project their experience during this time in Italy. For example, Hana treats him tenderly to redeem herself for not being by the side of her father when he was engulfed in flames and died. She provides comfort to the English Patient that she could not provide to her own father.

The rejection of a nationalistic identity enables Almásy to rationalise his duplicitous actions with his associates. He socialises with, and is a mapmaker for, the British before the war, then uses that information to smuggle German spies across northern Africa. Almásy is portrayed in a sympathetic light, partly because he tells his own story, but also because he always adheres to his own moral code.

Almásy is also at the centre of one of the novel&#x27;s love stories. He is involved in an adulterous relationship with Katharine Clifton, which eventually leads to her death and the death of her husband, Geoffrey Clifton. Katharine is the figure who leads Almásy to sensuality. He falls in love with her voice as she reads Herodotus. Sensuality, both sexual and observational, is a major theme in the novel.

The character is loosely based on László Almásy, a well-known desert explorer in 1930s Egypt, who helped the German side in the Second World War. Almásy did not suffer burns or die in Italy, but survived the war and lived until 1951.

===Hana===
Hana is a twenty-year-old Canadian Army nurse torn between her youth and her maturity. Being a good nurse, she quickly learns that she cannot become emotionally attached to her patients. She calls them all &quot;buddy,&quot; and forgets them immediately once they die. Her lover, a Canadian officer, is killed and because of this, Hana comes to believe that she is cursed and that all those around her are doomed to die.

In contrast, upon hearing of her father&#x27;s death Hana has an emotional breakdown. She then puts all of her energy into caring for the English Patient. She washes his wounds, reads to him and provides him with morphine. When the hospital is abandoned, Hana refuses to leave, staying with her patient. She sees Almásy as saint-like and falls in love with his pure nature.

In addition to her relationship with Almásy, Hana also forms a strong relationship with Kip during his stay at the villa.

Hana seems to not be able to acknowledge or even come to terms with her father&#x27;s death. As she almost sees no reason in returning home and her excuse to stay in the now abandoned hospital is to take proper care of the English patient, due to Almasy not being able to move because of how severe his burns are externally and internally as well. On top of this Hana fails to reply or write back her step-mother, whom she loves and is the only living family she has left. Clara writes to Hana for a year whilst she is in Italy; Hana keeps every letter, but fails to write back even with such woe and guilt filling her heart.

Hana seems to be putting off her life as a young adult and at times shows her immaturity throughout the novel in ignoring Caravaggio&#x27;s advice or suggestions or simply not facing the reality that awaits her back home. She seems as if escaping reality and being completely isolated from the rest of society is better than growing up. Hana escapes reality simply by stalling in taking care of the patient, rearranging her set up inside the deteriorating villa, listening to what Almásy has to say or the stories he tells, and by reading books to him over and over again.

Hana claims to have changed and grown up mentally throughout being a nurse during the war, as one would expect, but her &quot;growing up&quot; seems to be much more of building up a wall and being stuck in this continuous process of trying to heal an already dead body.

===Kip===

Kirpal (Kip) Singh is an Indian Sikh who has volunteered with the British military for sapper bomb disposal training under Lord Suffolk. This act of patriotism is not shared by his Indian nationalist brother; the scepticism of his unit&#x27;s white peers discourages a sense of community for Kip.

Lord Suffolk, an eccentric English nobleman, has developed techniques to dismantle complicated, unexploded bombs in what is a very dangerous occupation. Kip feels a sense of belonging in a community when he is welcomed into the Suffolk household and regards Lord Suffolk as a father figure. Lord Suffolk and his sapper team are killed while attempting to dismantle a new type of bomb. Their deaths cause Kip&#x27;s emotional withdrawal to become more pronounced. Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk, was a real person who did dismantle bombs and was killed while attempting to dismantle one.

Kip is transferred to another unit in Italy where he and his partner hear a piano playing. As they enter the villa, they come across Hana while she is playing on a piano during a thunderstorm. Kip stays on at the villa to clear any remaining unexploded bombs, mines, or other booby-traps. Kip feels a sense of community and confidence when he becomes Hana&#x27;s lover. Kip sees the interactions of the Westerners at the villa as those of a group that disregards nationality. They get together and celebrate Hana&#x27;s twenty-first birthday, a symbol of their friendship and Kip&#x27;s acceptance. However, when he learns of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima Kip is thoroughly shocked. He leaves immediately while Caravaggio reflects that Westerners would never use such a weapon on their own race. Kip goes back to India and never returns, he marries and has two children though he never stops recalling the effect of Hana in his life.

===David Caravaggio===
David Caravaggio is a Canadian thief whose profession is legitimised by the war, as the Allies needed crafty people to steal Axis documents. He is a long-time friend of Hana&#x27;s father and becomes known as &quot;the man with bandaged hands&quot; when he arrives at the villa; the bandages cover his severed thumbs, the result of an interrogation by the Italians in Florence. He recalls that Ranuccio Tommasoni ordered the interrogation tactic. This is a reference to a man by the same name who was murdered by the historical Caravaggio in 1606.
The mental and physical outcome of the torture is that Caravaggio has &quot;lost his nerve&quot; and ability to steal. Hana remembers him as a very human thief. He would always be distracted by the human element while doing a job. For instance, if an advent calendar was on the wrong day, he would fix it. She also has deep feelings of love for Caravaggio. At times, Caravaggio seems to display a romantic love towards Hana, but also at one point wishes she would marry Kip. Caravaggio and Almásy share a morphine addiction. Caravaggio works this to his advantage to confirm his suspicion that Almásy is not English.

===Katharine Clifton===
Katharine is the childhood friend and newly-wed wife of Geoffrey Clifton, whom she marries after their days at Oxford University. The day after their wedding, she and Geoffrey fly to join Almásy&#x27;s expedition. She entertains the camp in the evening by reading aloud from Almásy&#x27;s copy of Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, after which she and Almásy begin an affair. At one point Katharine stabs and punches Almásy repeatedly because she is angry that he doesn&#x27;t want to change. Geoffrey discovers the affair after she has ended it, and she is wracked with guilt. Geoffrey attempts to kill all three of them by crashing his plane while they are flying. After Geoffrey is killed in the crash, Katharine admits that she always loved Almásy.

===Geoffrey Clifton===
Geoffrey is Katharine&#x27;s husband, on a secret mission for the British government to make detailed aerial maps of North Africa; his joining the Almásy expedition is only a ruse. The plane he claims to be his own was appropriated by the Crown, and he leaves his wife with the other expedition members while on his mission, leading to her infidelity.

==Analysis==

Christopher McVey has discussed the nature of Ondaatje&#x27;s use of metaphysical aspects of body, history and nation in the novel. Amy Novak and Mirja Lobnik have separately analysed aspects of the treatment of memory in the novel. Thomas Harrison and Rachel Friedman have each examined the references and use of Herodotus in the novel. Madhumalati Adhikari has critiqued the treatment of the Second World War and its effects on the characters of the novel.

A major symbol of the novel is the desert. It serves as a representation of the characters&#x27; war experiences and how they came to gather in the villa. A passage in the novel notes &quot;The desert could not be claimed or owned.&quot; Caravaggio had stepped away from the war for a brief time when he drifted into the villa and encountered an old flame, Hana. Kip elects to stay in the villa, a straggler from his unit, to continue searching for explosives. He also finds there is a serene sense of acceptance in the villa and that the people need him. Hana is devoted to her patients, to the very last. Thus, she stays behind in the villa hospital when numerous others abandon it. Almásy himself is forced into the villa, essentially because the desert took him when his plane was shot down.

A psychoanalytic analysis of &quot;The English Patient&quot; helps us to understand the meaning of Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s emphasis on his characters&#x27; differences and appearances. He may have been thinking about how melting pot civilisations begin by different cultures working together in spite of each other&#x27;s background. Note how each central character living in the reconstructed villa is almost as opposite of each other in appearance as they could be. Hana was young, healthy, and capable of caring for more than one person at a time, but she mainly attended to the English patient. In contrast to Hana, the English patient was handicapped and on his death bed. But little did Hana know, in the English patient&#x27;s past, he had worked with the Germans on other desert expeditions way before their paths had crossed. However, his amnesia could not allow him to remember such things at the moment. In other words, Hana was caring for someone who was partly responsible for her village&#x27;s demise. The moral of this is that Hana, the English patient, Kip and Caravaggio had fewer physical resemblances to each other than they had had of humanistic desires. Thus, Michael Ondaatje may have wanted us to see that what&#x27;s on the outside does not matter as much as what&#x27;s on the inside when rebuilding a village, city or country.

The emotional heart of this novel is found at the core of the character&#x27;s want and need to survive, which in turn is the eternal damnation they find by everything seeming so bleak. Within this, the desert is a large symbol. As the Villa San Girolamo is an abandoned, war ridden place, it is also a place that seems like a cage, with no chance at happiness in sight. The war may be over, but the characters feel trapped in a sense. The desert within the novel is a place of freedom, a place that cannot be claimed or owned by any one person. The desert is everlasting, and can never be wavered. This is unlike the war that these characters had become extremely traumatised from. It is a vast nothingness that will always remain nation-less. A place that these characters can seek out in their minds, when there is nowhere else to turn for hope.

==Awards==
The novel won the 1992 Booker Prize, the 1992 Governor General&#x27;s Award and the 2018 Golden Man Booker award.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted into the 1996 film with the same title by Anthony Minghella, starring Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Willem Dafoe, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews and Juliette Binoche. The film received nine Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Director—at the 69th Academy Awards.

==Canceled television adaptation==
A television adaptation of the book is planned by the BBC. The project will be written by Emily Ballou and co-producing between Miramax Television and Paramount Television Studios. However, in March 2023, it was reported that it was no longer moving forward.

<doc id="44008" wikidata="Q300036" url="?curid=44008" title="ATRAC">
<text>Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding (ATRAC) is a family of proprietary audio compression algorithms developed by Sony. MiniDisc was the first commercial product to incorporate ATRAC, in 1992. ATRAC allowed a relatively small disc like MiniDisc to have the same running time as CD while storing audio information with minimal perceptible loss in quality. Improvements to the codec in the form of ATRAC3, ATRAC3plus, and ATRAC Advanced Lossless followed in 1999, 2002, and 2006 respectively.

Files in ATRAC3 format originally had the extension; however, in most cases, the files would be stored in an OpenMG Audio container using the extension . Previously, files that were encrypted with OpenMG had the extension, which was replaced by starting in SonicStage v2.1. Encryption is no longer compulsory as of v3.2.

Other MiniDisc manufacturers such as Sharp and Panasonic also implemented their own versions of the ATRAC codec.

==History==
ATRAC was developed for Sony&#x27;s MiniDisc format. ATRAC was updated with version 2, then version 3, version 4, version 4.5, and Type R and Type S.

The first major update was ATRAC3 (not to be confused with version 3 of original ATRAC) in 1999. ATRAC3 was used on MiniDisc as well as the Network Walkman and Vaio Music Clip. ATRAC3plus launched in 2003 for Hi-MD, but was also compatible with some PlayStation, VAIO and Xplod devices.

On 31 March 2008 Sony all but dropped the ATRAC-related codecs in the United States and Europe, and in their SonicStage powered Connect Music Store (Sony&#x27;s equivalent of iTunes and iTunes Music Store). This was partly due to low adoption of the format, with a source claiming that 90% of European Walkman users did not use ATRAC. Walkman digital players outside Japan no longer worked with ATRAC after September 2007.

Until 1 October 2012, ATRAC was the only codec available to download music from mora until they transitioned to a DRM free model and began offering FLAC files the next year.

ATRAC9 was designed for PlayStation audio and debuted with the PlayStation Vita.

== Bitrate quality ==
ATRAC&#x27;s 292 kbit/s bitrate used on the original MiniDiscs was designed to be near to CD audio quality. Years later ATRAC was improved over earlier versions at similar bitrates. For comparison, CDs are encoded at 1411.2 kbit/s, and lossless encoders can encode most CDs below 1000 kbit/s, with further bitrate reduction for easier-to-encode content such as voice.

== Performance ==
ATRAC algorithms were developed in close cooperation with LSI integrated circuit development engineers within Sony in order to deliver a product that could encode at high speeds and with minimal power consumption. This contrasts with other codecs developed on computers without regard for the constraints of portable hardware. This is reflected in the design of the ATRAC codecs, which emphasize processing smaller groups of samples at a time to save memory at the cost of compression efficiency and additional multiplies. These trade-offs are logical for DSP systems, where memory was often at a premium compared to multiplier performance.

Sony Walkmans offer better battery life when playing ATRAC files than when playing MP3 files. However, as Sony only pushed ATRAC compatibility in Sony Ericsson Walkman series phones in the Japanese market, it is not supported in GSM/UMTS market phones. Sony&#x27;s Xplod series of car audio CD players support ATRAC CDs. Minidiscs with ATRAC format songs have, in the past, been supported on Eclipse brand car stereos.

== Formats ==
=== ATRAC (1) (versions 1.0–4.5, Type R/S) ===
ATRAC1 was first used in Sony&#x27;s own theater format SDDS system in the 1990s, and in this context is a direct competitor to Dolby Digital (AC3) and DTS. SDDS uses ATRAC1 with 8 channel encoding, and with a total encoding rate over all the channels of 1168 kbit/s.

Two stacked quadrature mirror filters split the signal into 3 parts:
* 0 to 5.5125 kHz
* 5.5125 to 11.025 kHz
* 11.025 to 22.05 kHz

Full stereo (i.e., independent channel) encoding with a data rate of 292 kbit/s.

High-frequency lowpass depends on the complexity of the material; some encodings have content clear up to 22.05 kHz.

ATRAC1 can also be used in mono (one channel) mode, doubling recording time.

FFmpeg has an implementation of an ATRAC1 decoder.

=== ATRAC3 (LP2 and LP4 Modes) ===
Like ATRAC1 and MP3, ATRAC3 is also a hybrid subband-MDCT encoder, but with several differences.

In ATRAC3, Three stacked QMF split the signal into 4 parts:
* 0 to 2.75625 kHz (DC to &quot;f&quot;/16)
* 2.75625 to 5.5125 kHz (&quot;f&quot;/16 to &quot;f&quot;/8)
* 5.5125 to 11.025 kHz (&quot;f&quot;/8 to &quot;f&quot;/4)
* 11.025 to 22.05 kHz (&quot;f&quot;/4 to &quot;f&quot;/2)

The four subbands are then MDCT encoded using a fixed-length transform. Unlike nearly all modern formats, the transform length cannot be varied to optimize coding transients. Instead, a simpler transient encoding technique called gain control is used, in which the gain of different subbands is varied during a transient prior to MDCT and then restored during decoding after the inverse MDCT to try to smooth over transients. Additionally, prior to quantization, tonal components are subtracted from the signal and independently quantized. During decoding, they are separately reconstructed and added back to reform the original MDCT coefficients.

Sony claims the major advantage of ATRAC3 is its coding efficiency, which was tuned for portable DSP which provides less computing power and battery life. However, as ATRAC is a hybrid subband-MDCT codec that is algorithmically very similar to MP3, any advantage is probably exaggerated. Compared to newer formats such as Ogg Vorbis which use a simple MDCT rather than a hybrid, ATRAC3 must perform an additional computationally expensive inverse-QMF, although the hybrid system significantly reduces memory usage, which was likely a factor given the limited memory available when ATRAC was first developed.

;LP2 Mode
This uses a 132 kbit/s data rate, the quality of which is advertised to be similar to that of MP3 encoded at a similar bit rate.
However, in an independent double-blind test (2004/05) without format encoding parameters reference against Ogg Vorbis, AAC, and LAME VBR MP3, ATRAC3 came last. 

;LP4 Mode

This reduces the data rate to 66 kbit/s (half that of LP2), partly by using joint stereo coding and a lowpass filter around 13.5 kHz. It allows 324 minutes to be recorded on an 80-minute MiniDisc, with the same padding required as LP2.

;Notes

FFmpeg has an implementation of an ATRAC3 decoder, which was converted to fixed precision and implemented in the Rockbox series of firmware for ARM, Coldfire and MIPS processors. RealAudio8 is a high-bitrate implementation of ATRAC3 (up to 352.8kbit/s). Atracdenc is an open source implementation of ATRAC3 compatible encoder which also can use RealAudio container.

The PlayStation 3 video game &quot;Race Driver: Grid&quot; uses 224 simultaneous streams of ATRAC3 compressed audio, with between one and eight channels per stream at sample rates between 24 and 48 kHz, each filtered using 512 frequency bands of adaptive equalisation, routed via six reverb units running on the same SPU co-processor (one of eight on the PS3&#x27;s Cell chip), alongside 7.1 channel hybrid third-order Ambisonic mixing.

=== ATRAC3plus ===

This codec is used in Sony Hi-MD Walkman devices (e.g., &quot;Hi-LP and Hi-SP&quot;), Network Walkman players, Memory Stick players, VAIO Pocket, PS3 and PSP console, and ATRAC CD players. It is a hybrid subband/MDCT codec based on a 16 channel QMF followed by a 128-point MDCT. Prior to MDCT coding, Generalized Harmonic Analysis (GHA) is used to extract tonal components, an improved version of the process used in ATRAC3. As in previous ATRAC versions, gain control is used to control preecho rather than variable sized transforms, although different MDCT windows are apparently possible.
SonicStage version 3.4, released in February 2006, introduced ripping CDs in bitrates 320 and 352. The available bitrates are: 48, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320 and 352 kbit/s. The newer bitrates are not always compatible with all older hardware decoders, however, some of the older hardware has been found to be compatible with certain newer ATRAC3plus bitrates.

MiniDiscs recorded in this format are incompatible with older players.

In a test conducted by an independent firm, but financed by Sony, it was concluded that ATRAC3plus at 64 kbit/s is equal in subjective sound quality to an obsolete MP3 encoder at 128 kbit/s. Performance against modern high quality MP3 encoders was not evaluated.

=== ATRAC Advanced Lossless ===

ATRAC Advanced Lossless is a &quot;scalable&quot; lossless audio codec that records a lossy ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus stream, and supplements it with a stream of correction information stored within the file itself that allows the original signal to be reproduced, if desired. A player/decoder can extract and use just the ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus data, or it can combine that with the correction stream to perfectly reproduce the original audio information. This allows the file to be decoded as either lossless or lossy. It is implemented in such a way that allows the file size to be smaller than uncompressed or compressed versions of the same file. Compression is approximately 30–80% of the original file. Benefits of scalable compression include providing backward compatibility, such that older devices that are not AAL-aware can still have the ATRAC3 stream available for playback without understanding the AAL format, and faster transfer speed between portable audio devices and PC.

ATRAC Advanced Lossless is widely supported in older Walkman players and SonicStage version 4 or later. SonicStage 4 allows download of ATRAC Advanced Lossless to MiniDisc Players, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 3. Recent Walkman players do not support ATRAC Advanced Lossless/ATRAC.

AAL&#x27;s use of a &quot;core&quot; (lossy) and &quot;residual&quot; (correction) stream is similar to the idea behind Opus, MPEG-4 SLS, DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD and Ogg Vorbis bitrate peeling. In fact, AAL was the first to be released in the commercial market with this scheme for backward compatibility.

WavPack hybrid mode and OptimFROG DualStream are in the same category, but store the correction stream in a separate file.

=== ATRAC9 ===
According to Sony ATRAC9 is a high-compression audio codec optimized for games, offering low delay (granularity) and low CPU and memory usage.
It is used in the PS5, PS4 and PS Vita consoles. Audio middleware such as FMOD and Audiokinetic Wwise supports it.

FFmpeg has an implementation of an ATRAC9 decoder.

<text>MiniDisc (MD) is an erasable magneto-optical disc-based data storage format offering a capacity of 60, 74, and later, 80 minutes of digitized audio.

Sony announced the MiniDisc in September 1992 and released it in November of that year for sale in Japan and in December in Europe, North America, and other countries. The music format was based on ATRAC audio data compression, Sony&#x27;s own proprietary compression code. Its successor, Hi-MD, would later introduce the option of linear PCM digital recording to meet audio quality comparable to that of a compact disc. MiniDiscs were very popular in Japan and found moderate success in Europe. Although it was designed to succeed the cassette tape, it did not manage to supplant it globally.

By March 2011 Sony had sold 22 million MD players, but halted further development. Sony ceased manufacturing and sold the last of the players by March 2013. On January 23, 2025, Sony announced they would end the production of recordable MD media in February 2025.

== Market history ==
In 1983, just a year after the introduction of the compact disc, Kees Schouhamer Immink and Joseph Braat presented the first experiments with erasable magneto-optical compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention in Eindhoven. It took almost 10 years, however, before their idea was commercialized.

Sony&#x27;s MiniDisc was one of two rival digital systems introduced in 1992 that were intended to replace the Philips Compact Cassette analog audio tape system: the other was the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), created by Philips and Matsushita (now Panasonic). Sony had originally intended the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to be the dominant home digital audio recording format, replacing the analog cassette. Because of technical delays, the DAT was not launched until 1989, and by then the U.S. dollar had fallen so far against the yen that the introductory DAT machine Sony had intended to market for about $400 in the late 1980s then had to retail for $800 or even $1,000 to break even, putting it out of reach of most users.

Relegating DAT to professional use, Sony set to work to come up with a simpler, more economical digital home format. By the time Sony came up with the MiniDisc in late 1992, Philips had introduced a competing system, DCC, on a magnetic tape cassette. This created marketing confusion very similar to the videocassette format war of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sony licensed MD technology to other manufacturers, with JVC, Sharp, Pioneer, Panasonic and others producing their own MD products. However, non-Sony machines were not widely available in North America, and companies such as Technics and Radio Shack tended to promote DCC instead.

Despite having a loyal customer base largely of musicians and audio enthusiasts, the MiniDisc met with only limited success in the United States. It was very popular in Japan and parts of Asia, and relatively so in Europe during the 1990s and into the 2000s, but did not enjoy comparable sales success in other markets. Since then, recordable CDs, flash memory and HDD and solid-state-based digital audio players such as iPods have become increasingly popular as playback devices.

The slow uptake of MiniDisc was attributed to the small number of pre-recorded albums available on MD, because relatively few record labels embraced the format. The initial high cost of equipment and blank media was also a factor. Additionally, home MiniDisc decks were less widely available, with most consumers instead connecting a portable MD device to their hi-fi system in order to record.

MiniDisc technology was faced with new competition from the recordable compact disc (CD-R) when it became more affordable to consumers beginning around 1996. Initially, Sony believed that it would take around a decade for CD-R prices to become affordable – the cost of a typical blank CD-R disc was around $12 in 1994 – but CD-R prices fell much more rapidly than envisioned, to the point where CD-R blanks sank below $1 per disc by the late 1990s, compared to at least $2 for the cheapest 80-minute MiniDisc blanks.

The biggest competition for MiniDisc came with the emergence of MP3 players. With the Diamond Rio player in 1998 and the Apple iPod in 2001, the mass market began to eschew physical media in favor of more convenient file-based systems.
By 2007, because of the waning popularity of the format and the increasing popularity of solid-state MP3 players, Sony was producing only one model, the Hi-MD MZ-RH1, available as the MZ-M200 in North America packaged with a Sony microphone and limited macOS software support.

The MZ-RH1 allowed users to freely move uncompressed digital recordings back and forth from the MiniDisc to a computer without the copyright protection limitations previously imposed upon the NetMD series. This allowed the MiniDisc to better compete with HD recorders and MP3 players. However, most pro users like broadcasters and news reporters had already abandoned MiniDisc in favor of solid-state recorders, because of their extended recording time, open digital content sharing, high-quality digital recording capabilities and reliable, lightweight design.

On 7 July 2011, Sony announced that it would no longer ship MiniDisc Walkman products as of September 2011, effectively killing the format.

On 1 February 2013, Sony issued a press release on the Nikkei stock exchange that it would cease shipment of all MD devices, with last of the players to be sold in March 2013. However, it would continue to sell blank discs and offer repair services. Other manufacturers continued to release MiniDisc players long after Sony stopped, with TEAC &amp; TASCAM producing new decks up until 2020 when both its consumer and professional products, TEAC MD-70CD and TASCAM MD-CD1MKIII, were discontinued. In January 2025 Sony announced, that production of blank MiniDiscs (together BD-R and MiniDV) will be discontinued.

== Design ==

=== Physical characteristics ===
The disc is fixed in a cartridge (68×72×5 mm) with a sliding door, similar to the casing of a 3.5&quot; floppy disk. This shutter is opened automatically when inserted into a drive. MiniDiscs can either be blank or prerecorded. Recordable MiniDiscs use a magneto-optical system to write data: a laser below the disc heats a spot to its Curie point, making the material in the disc susceptible to a magnetic field. A magnetic head above the disc then alters the polarity of the heated area, recording the digital data onto the disk. Playback is accomplished with the laser alone: taking advantage of the magneto-optic Kerr effect, the player senses the polarization of the reflected light as a 1 or a 0. Recordable MDs can be rerecorded repeatedly, with Sony claiming up to one million times. By May 2005, there were 60-minute, 74-minute and 80-minute discs available. 60-minute blanks, which were widely available in the early years of the format&#x27;s introduction, were phased out.

MiniDiscs use a mastering process and optical playback system that is very similar to CDs. The recorded signal of the premastered pits and of the recordable MD are also very similar. Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM) and a modification of CD&#x27;s CIRC code, called Advanced Cross Interleaved Reed-Solomon Code (ACIRC) are employed.

=== Differences from cassette and CDs ===

MiniDiscs use rewritable magneto-optical storage to store data. Unlike DCC or the analog Compact Cassette, MiniDisc is a random-access medium, making seek time very fast. MiniDiscs can be edited very quickly even on portable machines. Tracks can be split, combined, moved or deleted with ease either on the player or uploaded to a PC with Sony&#x27;s SonicStage V4.3 software and edited there. Transferring data from an MD unit to a non-Windows PC can only be done in real time, preferably via optical I/O, by connecting the audio out port of the MD to an available audio in port of the computer. With the release of the Hi-MD format, Sony began to use Mac OS X-compatible software. However, the Mac OS X-compatible software was still not compatible with legacy MD formats (SP, LP2, LP4). This means that an MD recorded on a legacy unit or in a legacy format still requires a Windows PC for faster than real-time transfers.

The beginning of the disc has a table of contents (TOC, the System File area), which stores the start positions of the various tracks, as well as metadata (title, artist) and free blocks. Unlike a conventional cassette, a recorded song does not need to be stored as one piece on the disc, it can be scattered in fragments, similar to a hard drive. Early MiniDisc equipment had a fragment granularity of 4 seconds of audio. Fragments smaller than the granularity are not monitored, which may lead to the usable capacity of a disc shrinking over time. No means of defragmenting the disc is provided in consumer-grade equipment.

All consumer-grade MiniDisc devices have a copy-protection scheme called the Serial Copy Management System. An unprotected disc or song can be copied without limit, but the copies can no longer be digitally copied. However, as a concession, the last Hi-MD players can upload to PC a digitally recorded file which can be resaved as a WAV (PCM) file and thus replicated.

=== Audio data compression ===
The digitally encoded audio signal on a MiniDisc has traditionally been data-compressed using the ATRAC (Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding) format.

ATRAC was devised to allow MiniDisc to have the same runtime as a CD. ATRAC reduces the 1.4 Mbit/s of a CD to a 292 kbit/s data stream, roughly a 5:1 reduction. ATRAC was also used on nearly all flash memory Walkman devices until the 8 series.

The ATRAC codec differs from uncompressed PCM in that it is a psychoacoustic lossy audio data reduction scheme. Like other lossy audio compression formats, it is intended to be acoustically transparent, but some listeners claim to be able to hear audible artifacts.

There have been four versions of ATRAC, each claimed by Sony to more accurately reflect the original audio. Early players are guaranteed to play later version ATRAC audio. Version 1 could only be copied on consumer equipment three or four times before artifacts became objectionable, as the ATRAC on the recorder attempted to compress the already compressed data. By version 4, the potential number of generations of copy had increased to around 15 to 20 depending on audio content.

The latest versions of Sony&#x27;s ATRAC are ATRAC3 and ATRAC3plus. Original ATRAC3 at 132 kbit/s (also known as ATRAC-LP2 mode) was the format that was used by Sony&#x27;s defunct Connect audio download store. ATRAC3plus was not used in order to retain backwards compatibility with earlier NetMD players.

In the MiniDisc&#x27;s final iteration, Hi-MD, uncompressed CD-quality linear PCM audio recording and playback is offered, placing Hi-MD on par with CD-quality audio. Hi-MD also supports both ATRAC3 and ATRAC3plus at various bitrates, but not the original ATRAC (except for playback only).

=== Anti-skip ===
MiniDisc has a feature that prevents disc skipping under all but the most extreme conditions. Older CD players had been a source of annoyance to users as they were prone to mistracking from vibration and shock. MiniDisc solved this problem by reading the data into a memory buffer at a higher speed than was required before being read out to the digital-to-analog converter at the standard rate of the format. The size of the buffer varies by model.

If a MiniDisc player is bumped, playback continues unimpeded while the laser repositions itself to continue reading data from the disc. This feature allows the player to stop the spindle motor for significant periods, increasing battery life.

A buffer of at least six seconds is required on all MiniDisc players, whether portable or full-sized units. This ensures uninterrupted playback in the presence of file fragmentation.

=== Operation ===

The data structure and operation of a MiniDisc is similar to that of a computer&#x27;s hard disk drive. The bulk of the disc contains audio data, and a small section contains the table of contents (TOC), providing the playback device with vital information about the number and location of tracks on the disc. Tracks and discs can be named. Tracks may easily be added, erased, combined and divided, and their preferred order of playback modified. Erased tracks are not physically erased, but are only marked as deleted. When a disc becomes full, the recorder can simply direct the data into sections where erased tracks reside. This can lead to fragmentation but unless many erasures and replacements are performed, the only likely problem is excessive searching, reducing battery life.

The data structure of the MiniDisc, where music is recorded in a single stream of bytes while the TOC contains pointers to track positions, allows for gapless playback of music, something which competing portable players such as most MP3 players, fail to implement properly. Notable exceptions are CD players, as well as all recent iPods.

At the end of recording, after the &quot;Stop&quot; button has been pressed, the MiniDisc may continue to write music data for a few seconds from its memory buffers. During this time, it may display a message (&quot;Data Save&quot;, on at least some models) and the case will not open. After the audio data is written out, the final step is to write the TOC track denoting the start and endpoints of the recorded data. Sony points out in the manual that the power should not be interrupted or the unit exposed to undue physical shock during this time.

=== Copy protection ===
All MiniDisc recorders use the SCMS copy protection system which uses two bits in the S/PDIF digital audio stream and on disc to differentiate between &quot;protected&quot; vs. &quot;unprotected&quot; audio, and between &quot;original&quot; vs. &quot;copy&quot;:
* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;original&quot; (produced by a prerecorded MD or an MD that recorded an analogue input) was allowed, but the recorder would change the &quot;original&quot; bit to the &quot;copy&quot; state on the disc to prevent further copying of the copy. A CD imported via a digital connection does not have the SCMS bits (as the CD format predates SCMS), but the recording MD recorder treats any signal where the SCMS bits are missing as protected and original. The MD copy, therefore, cannot be further copied digitally.
* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; was not allowed: an error message would be shown on the display.
* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;unprotected&quot; was also allowed; the &quot;original/copy&quot; marker was ignored and left unchanged.

Recording from an analogue source resulted in a disc marked &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;original&quot; allowing one further copy to be made (this contrasts with the SCMS on the Digital Compact Cassette where analogue recording was marked as &quot;unprotected&quot;).

In recorders that could be connected to a PC via USB, it was possible to transfer audio from the PC to the MiniDisc recorder, but for many years it was not possible to transfer audio in the other direction. This restriction existed in both the SonicStage software and in the MiniDisc player itself. SonicStage V3.4 was the first version of the software where this restriction was removed, but it still required a MiniDisc recorder/player that also had the restriction removed. The Hi-MD model MZ-RH1 was the only such player available.

== Format extensions ==
=== MD Data ===
MD Data, a format for storing computer data, was announced by Sony in 1993. Its media were generally incompatible with standard audio MiniDiscs. MD Data can not write to audio MDs, but only the considerably more expensive data blanks. It did see some success in a small number of multi-track recorders such as Sony&#x27;s MDM-X4, Tascam&#x27;s 564 (which could also record using standard audio MD discs, albeit only two tracks), and Yamaha&#x27;s MD8, MD4, &amp; MD4S.

=== MD Data2 ===
In 1997, MD Data2 blanks were introduced with 650 MB. They were only implemented in Sony&#x27;s short-lived MD-based camcorder, the DCM-M1.

=== MDLP ===
In 2000, Sony announced MDLP (MiniDisc Long Play), which added new recording modes based on the new codec ATRAC3. In addition to the standard, high-quality mode, now called SP, MDLP adds LP2 mode, which doubles the recording time – 160 minutes on an 80-minute disc – of good-quality stereo sound, and LP4, which allows four times more recording time – 320 minutes on an 80-minute disc – of medium-quality stereo sound.

The bitrate of the standard SP mode is 292 kbit/s, and it uses separate stereo coding with discrete left and right channels. LP2 mode uses a bitrate of 132 kbit/s and also uses separate stereo coding. The third mode, LP4, has a bitrate of 66 kbit/s and uses joint stereo coding. The sound quality is noticeably degraded compared to the other two modes, but is sufficient for many uses.

Tracks recorded in LP2 or LP4 mode play back as silence on non-MDLP players.

=== NetMD ===

Debuting in late 2001, NetMD recorders allow music files to be transferred from a computer to a recorder (but not in the other direction) over a USB connection. In LP4 mode, speeds of up to 32× real-time are possible and three Sony NetMD recorders (MZ-N10, MZ-N910, and MZ-N920) are capable of speeds up to 64× real-time. NetMD recorders all support MDLP.

When transferring music in SP mode using NetMD with SonicStage, what is transferred is actually padded LP2. That is to say that the quality of the music is that of LP2 but recorded as SP.

NetMD is a proprietary protocol that initially required proprietary software such as SonicStage. A free *nix based implementation, libnetmd, has been developed. The library allows the user to upload SP files in full quality. In 2019, a programmer named Stefano Brilli compiled the linux-minidisc CLI into a web browser-based application, allowing users to transfer music via USB on modern devices.

=== Hi-MD ===

Hi-MD is a further development of the MiniDisc format. Hi-MD media will not play on non-Hi-MD equipment, including NetMD players. The Hi-MD format, introduced in 2004, marked a return to the data storage arena with its 1 GB discs and ability to act as a USB drive. Hi-MD units allow the recording and playback of audio and data on the same disc, and can write both audio and data to standard MiniDisc media – an 80-minute MiniDisc blank could be formatted to store 305 MB of data.

== Recording and transfer modes ==
Modes marked in green are available for recordings made on the player, while those marked in red are available for music transferred from a PC. Capacities are official Sony figures; real world figures are usually slightly higher. Native MP3 support was added in second-generation Hi-MD players in the spring of 2005. SonicStage version 3.4, released in Feb 2006, introduced ripping CDs in bitrates 320 and 352 and added track transfer in ATRAC 192 kbit/s to Hi-MD devices.

<text>Joseph Anton Bruckner (; ; 4 September 182411 October 1896) was an Austrian composer and organist best known for his symphonies and sacred music, which includes Masses, Te Deum and motets. The symphonies are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner&#x27;s compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies.

Unlike other musical radicals such as Richard Wagner and Hugo Wolf, Bruckner showed respect, even humility, before other famous musicians, Wagner in particular. This apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music. Hans von Bülow described him as &quot;half genius, half simpleton&quot;. Bruckner was critical of his own work and often reworked his compositions. There are several versions of many of his works.

His works, the symphonies in particular, had detractors, most notably the influential Austrian critic Eduard Hanslick and other supporters of Johannes Brahms, who pointed to their large size and use of repetition, as well as to Bruckner&#x27;s propensity for revising many of his works, often with the assistance of colleagues, and his apparent indecision about which versions he preferred. On the other hand, Bruckner was greatly admired by subsequent composers, including his friend Gustav Mahler.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===

Anton Bruckner was born in Ansfelden (then a village, now almost a suburb of Linz) on 4 September 1824. The ancestors of Bruckner&#x27;s family were farmers and craftsmen; their history can be traced as far back as the 16th century. They lived near a bridge south of Sindelburg, which led to their being called &quot;Bruckhner an der Bruckhen&quot; (bridgers on the bridge). Bruckner&#x27;s grandfather was appointed schoolmaster in Ansfelden in 1776; this position was inherited by Bruckner&#x27;s father, Anton Bruckner Sr., in 1823. It was a poorly paid but well-respected position in the rural environment. Bruckner Sr. married , and they had eleven children, Anton Bruckner being the eldest.

Music was a part of the school curriculum, and Bruckner&#x27;s father was his first music teacher. Bruckner learned to play the organ early as a child. He was very dedicated to the instrument just as he was later in life in composing, often practising for 12 hours a day. He entered school when he was six, proved to be a hard-working student, and was promoted to upper class early. While studying, Bruckner also helped his father in teaching the other children. After Bruckner received his confirmation in 1833, Bruckner&#x27;s father sent him to another school in Hörsching. The schoolmaster, Johann Baptist Weiß, was a music enthusiast and respected organist. Here, Bruckner completed his school education and refined his skills as an organist. Around 1835 Bruckner wrote his first composition, a &quot;Pange lingua&quot; – one of the compositions which he revised at the end of his life. When his father became ill, Anton returned to Ansfelden to help him in his work.

=== Teacher&#x27;s education ===

Bruckner&#x27;s father died in 1837, when Bruckner was 13 years old. The teacher&#x27;s position and house were given to a successor, and Bruckner was sent to the Augustinian monastery in Sankt Florian to become a choirboy. In addition to choir practice, his education included violin and organ lessons. Bruckner was in awe of the monastery&#x27;s great organ, which was built during the late baroque era and rebuilt in 1837, and he sometimes played it during church services. From October 1840 to July 1841, Bruckner undertook further training at the teacher-training school in Linz. His teacher of harmony and choral singing was August Durrnberger, who became a friend and would later persuade Bruckner to take up the role of a cathedral organist.

After completing the seminar with an excellent grade, Bruckner was sent as an assistant teacher to a school in Windhaag. The living standards and pay were appalling and Bruckner was constantly humiliated by his superior, teacher Franz Fuchs. Despite the difficult situation, Bruckner never complained or rebelled; a belief in his own inferiority was to remain one of Bruckner&#x27;s main personal traits during his whole life. He stayed at Windhaag from age 17 to 19, teaching general subjects.

Prelate noticed Bruckner&#x27;s bad situation in Windhaag and awarded him an assistant teacher position in the vicinity of the monastic town of Sankt Florian, sending him to Kronstorf an der Enns for two years. Here he would be able to have more of a part in musical activity. The time in Kronstorf was a much happier one for Bruckner. Between 1843 and 1845, Bruckner was the pupil of Leopold von Zenetti in Enns. Compared to the few works he wrote in Windhaag, the Kronstorf compositions from 1843 to 1845 show a significantly improved artistic ability, and finally the beginnings of what could be called &quot;the Bruckner style&quot;. Among the Kronstorf works is the vocal piece &quot;Asperges me&quot; (WAB 4), which the young assistant teacher, out of line given his position, signed with &quot;Anton Bruckner m.p.ria. Comp[onist]&quot;. This has been interpreted as a lone early sign of Bruckner&#x27;s artistic ambitions. Otherwise, little is known of Bruckner&#x27;s life plans and intentions.

=== Organist in Sankt Florian ===

After the Kronstorf period, Bruckner returned to Sankt Florian in 1845 where, for the next 10 years, he would work as a teacher and an organist. In May 1845, Bruckner passed an examination, which allowed him to begin work as an assistant teacher in one of the village schools of Sankt Florian. He continued to improve his education by taking further courses, passing an examination giving him permission to also teach in higher education institutes, receiving the grade &quot;very good&quot; in all disciplines. In 1848 Bruckner was appointed an organist in Sankt Florian and in 1851 this was made a regular position. In Sankt Florian, most of the repertoire consisted of the music of Michael Haydn, Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and Franz Joseph Aumann. During his stay in Sankt Florian, Bruckner continued to work with Zenetti.

=== Study period ===
In 1855, Bruckner, aspiring to become a student of the famous Vienna music theorist Simon Sechter, showed the master his &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; (WAB 29), written a year earlier, and was accepted. The education, which included skills in music theory and counterpoint among others, took place mostly via correspondence, but also included long in-person sessions in Vienna. Sechter&#x27;s teaching would have a profound influence on Bruckner. Later, when Bruckner began teaching music himself, he would base his curriculum on Sechter&#x27;s book &quot;Die Grundsätze der musikalischen Komposition&quot; (Leipzig 1853/54).
Largely self-taught as a composer, Bruckner only started composing seriously at age 37 in 1861. Bruckner studied further with Otto Kitzler, who was nine years younger than him and who introduced him to the music of Richard Wagner, which Bruckner studied extensively from 1863 onwards. Bruckner considered the earliest orchestral works (the &quot;study&quot; Symphony in F minor, the three orchestral pieces, the March in D minor and the Overture in G minor, which he composed in 1862–1863), mere school exercises, done under the supervision of Otto Kitzler. He continued his studies to the age of 40. Broad fame and acceptance did not come until he was over 60 (after the premiere of his Seventh Symphony in 1884). In 1861, he had already made the acquaintance of Franz Liszt, whom Bruckner idolised. Like Bruckner, Liszt was of the Catholic faith and a harmonic innovator, and, alongside Wagner, he initiated the New German School. In May 1861 he made his concert debut, as both composer and conductor of his &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, set in seven parts. Soon after Bruckner had ended his studies under Sechter and Kitzler, he wrote his Mass in D Minor. From 1861 to 1868, he alternated his time between Vienna and Sankt Florian. He wished to ensure he knew how to make his music modern, but he also wanted to spend time in a more religious setting.

=== The Vienna period ===
In 1868, after Sechter had died, Bruckner hesitantly accepted Sechter&#x27;s post as a teacher of music theory at the Vienna Conservatory, during which time he concentrated most of his energy on writing symphonies. These symphonies were poorly received, at times considered &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot;. His students at the Conservatory included Richard Robert, Hans Rott, Felix Mottl, Heinrich Schenker, Mathilde Kralik, Franz Schalk, Joseph Schalk, and Ferdinand Löwe. His student Friedrich Klose wrote a book about his impressions of Bruckner as a composer and a teacher.

He later accepted a post at the Vienna University in 1875, where he tried to make music theory a part of the curriculum. Overall, he was unhappy in Vienna, which was musically dominated by the critic Eduard Hanslick. At the time, there was a feud between advocates of the music of Wagner and Brahms; by aligning himself with Wagner, Bruckner made an unintentional enemy out of Hanslick. He was not without supporters, though. &quot;Deutsche Zeitung&quot; music critic Theodor Helm, and famous conductors such as Arthur Nikisch and Franz Schalk constantly tried to bring his music to the public, and for this purpose proposed &quot;improvements&quot; for making Bruckner&#x27;s music more acceptable to the public. Bruckner bequeathed his original scores to the Austrian National Library in Vienna.

In addition to his symphonies, Bruckner wrote Masses, motets and other sacred choral works, and a few chamber works, including a string quintet. Unlike his romantic symphonies, some of Bruckner&#x27;s choral works are often conservative and contrapuntal in style; however, the Te Deum, Helgoland, Psalm 150 and at least one Mass demonstrate innovative and radical uses of chromaticism.

Biographers generally characterize Bruckner as a &quot;simple&quot; provincial man, and many biographers have complained that there is huge discrepancy between Bruckner&#x27;s life and his work. For example, Karl Grebe said: &quot;his life doesn&#x27;t tell anything about his work, and his work doesn&#x27;t tell anything about his life, that&#x27;s the uncomfortable fact any biography must start from.&quot; Anecdotes abound as to Bruckner&#x27;s dogged pursuit of his chosen craft and his humble acceptance of the fame that eventually came his way. Once, after a rehearsal of his Fourth Symphony in 1881, the well-meaning Bruckner tipped the conductor Hans Richter: &quot;When the symphony was over&quot;, Richter related, &quot;Bruckner came to me, his face beaming with enthusiasm and joy. I felt him press a coin into my hand. &#x27;Take this&#x27; he said, &#x27;and drink a glass of beer to my health.&#x27;&quot; Richter, of course, accepted the coin, a Maria Theresa thaler, and wore it on his watch-chain ever after.

Bruckner was a renowned organist in his day, impressing audiences in France in 1869, and the United Kingdom in 1871, giving six recitals on a new Henry Willis organ at Royal Albert Hall in London and five more at the Crystal Palace. Though he wrote no major works for the organ, his improvisation sessions sometimes yielded ideas for the symphonies. He taught organ performance at the Conservatory; among his students were Hans Rott and Franz Schmidt. Gustav Mahler, who called Bruckner his &quot;forerunner&quot;, attended the conservatory at this time.

Bruckner was a lifelong bachelor who made numerous unsuccessful marriage proposals to teenage girls. One such was the daughter of a friend, called Louise; in his grief he is believed to have written the cantata &quot;Entsagen&quot; (Renunciation). His affection for teenage girls led to an accusation of impropriety where he taught music, and while he was exonerated, he decided to concentrate on teaching boys afterwards. His calendar for 1874 details the names of girls who appealed to him, and the list of such girls in all his diaries was very long. In 1880 he fell for a 17-year-old peasant girl in the cast of the Oberammergau Passion Play. His unsuccessful proposals to teenagers continued when he was past his 70th birthday; one prospect, Berlin hotel chambermaid Ida Buhz, came near to marrying him but broke off the engagement when she refused to convert to Catholicism. He suffered from periodic attacks of depression, with his numerous failed attempts to find a female companion only adding to his unhappiness.
In July 1886, the Emperor decorated him with the Order of Franz Joseph. He most likely retired from his position at the University of Vienna in 1892, at the age of 68. He wrote a great deal of music that he used to help teach his students.

Bruckner died in Vienna in 1896 at the age of 72. He is buried in the crypt of the monastery church at Sankt Florian, immediately below his favorite organ. He had always had a fascination with death and dead bodies, and left explicit instructions regarding the embalming of his corpse.

The Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance, an institution of higher education in Linz, close to his native Ansfelden, was named after him in 1932 (as the &quot;Bruckner Conservatory Linz&quot; until 2004). The Bruckner Orchestra Linz was also named in his honor.

== Compositions ==

Sometimes Bruckner&#x27;s works are referred to by WAB numbers, from the &quot;Werkverzeichnis Anton Bruckner&quot;, a catalogue of Bruckner&#x27;s works edited by .
The revision issue has generated controversy. A common explanation for the multiple versions is that Bruckner was willing to revise his work on the basis of harsh, uninformed criticism from his colleagues. &quot;The result of such advice was to awaken immediately all the insecurity in the non-musical part of Bruckner&#x27;s personality&quot;, musicologist Deryck Cooke writes. &quot;Lacking all self-assurance in such matters, he felt obliged to bow to the opinions of his friends, &#x27;the experts,&#x27; to permit ... revisions and even to help make them in some cases.&quot; This explanation was widely accepted when it was championed by Bruckner scholar Robert Haas, who was the chief editor of the first critical editions of Bruckner&#x27;s works published by the International Bruckner Society; it continues to be found in the majority of program notes and biographical sketches concerning Bruckner. Haas&#x27;s work was endorsed by the Nazis and so fell out of favour after the war as the Allies enforced denazification.
Haas&#x27;s rival Leopold Nowak was appointed to produce a whole new critical edition of Bruckner&#x27;s works. He and others such as and conductor Leon Botstein argued that Haas&#x27;s explanation is at best idle speculation, at worst a shady justification of Haas&#x27;s own editorial decisions. Also, it has been pointed out that Bruckner often started work on a symphony just days after finishing the one before. As Deryck Cooke writes, &quot;In spite of continued opposition and criticism, and many well-meaning exhortations to caution from his friends, he looked neither to right nor left, but simply got down to work on the next symphony.&quot;

=== Symphonies ===
&quot;Bruckner expanded the concept of the symphonic form in ways that have never been witnessed before or since. ... When listening to a Bruckner symphony, one encounters some of the most complex symphonic writing ever created. As scholars study Bruckner&#x27;s scores they continue to revel in the complexity of Bruckner&#x27;s creative logic.&quot;

Bruckner composed eleven symphonies, the first, the Study Symphony in F minor in 1863, the last, the unfinished Symphony No. 9 in D minor in 1887–96. With the exception of Symphony No. 4 (&quot;Romantic&quot;), none of Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies originally had a subtitle and in the case of those that now do, the nicknames or subtitles did not originate with the composer.

==== Style ====
Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies are scored for a fairly standard orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, two or three trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, but not by much. Notable is the use of Wagner tubas in his last three symphonies. Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani in all versions. (The Seventh, in some versions, features a single cymbal crash alongside a triangle roll at the climax of the second movement). Bruckner&#x27;s style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries (Eduard Hanslick and his circle), but by the middle of the twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, &quot;i.e.&quot;, alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.

==== Structure ====
The structure of Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies is in a way an extension of that of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies. Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies are in four movements.
* The first movement, in  or , is, from Symphony No. 2 on, an allegro in modified sonata form with three thematic groups. The first group is mostly displayed in piano or pianissimo on a tremolo of the string instruments and is, after a long crescendo, repeated in tutti. The second group, melodious and in ABA&#x27; lied form, is mostly of contrapuntal structure. The third group, mostly rhythmical and often in unison, is sometimes a variant of the first group, as in Symphony No. 4. The often extensive development is followed by a modified and somewhat shortened reprise and a powerful coda.
* The second movement, mostly an adagio in , is generally in ABA′B′A″ lied form. The first thematic group, sometime rhythmical, is developed and magnified in the third and fifth parts. The second group is mostly a melody in cantilena form. The adagio is put in third position in the first version of Symphony No. 2, and in Symphony No. 8 and Symphony No. 9.
* The scherzo in  and in minor mode is often fiery. The, sometimes very short, trio is more melodious and often in Ländler form. The &quot;da capo&quot; reprise, in Bruckner&#x27;s early symphonies, ends with a short, powerful coda. The revised version of the Symphony No. 4 features a scherzo – the &quot;Hunt scherzo&quot; – in which the outer sections are in and in major mode.
* The Finale, in or , is, as the first movement, an allegro in modified sonata form with three thematic groups. The first group, often a kind of introduction, is followed by a second, melodious and often contrapuntal group, and a third, rhythmical and often in unison, group, which is sometimes a variant of the first group, as in Symphony No. 2. The development, often of dramatic character, is followed by a less formal reprise, which is sometimes inverted (C′B′A&#x27;) as in Symphony No. 7, and a coda in which the first thematic group of the first movement is magnified. In the coda of Symphony No. 8, the first thematic group of all four movements are magnified.

Nicholas Temperley writes in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1980) that Bruckner

Deryck Cooke adds, also in the &quot;New Grove&quot;,

In a concert review, Bernard Holland described parts of the first movements of Bruckner&#x27;s sixth and seventh symphonies as follows: &quot;There is the same slow, broad introduction, the drawn-out climaxes that grow, pull back and then grow some more – a sort of musical coitus interruptus.&quot;

In the 2001 second edition of the &quot;New Grove&quot;, called the Bruckner symphonies &quot;monumental in scope and design, combining lyricism with an inherently polyphonic design... Bruckner favored an approach to large-scale form that relied more on large-scale thematic and harmonic juxtaposition. Over the course of his output, one senses an ever-increasing interest in cyclic integration that culminates in his masterpiece, the Symphony No. 8 in C minor, a work whose final page integrates the main themes of all four movements simultaneously.&quot;
In 1990, the American artist Jack Ox gave a paper called &quot;The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Eighth Symphony into a series of Thirteen Paintings&quot; at the Bruckner Symposium in Linz Austria; here she structurally analyzed all of the Eighth Symphony&#x27;s themes. She then proceeded to show how she mapped this musical data into a series of twelve large, painted visualizations. The conference report was published in 1993.

==== The Bruckner Problem ====
&quot;The Bruckner Problem&quot; refers to the difficulties and complications resulting from the numerous contrasting versions and editions that exist for most of the symphonies. The term gained currency following the publication (in 1969) of an article dealing with the subject, &quot;The Bruckner Problem Simplified&quot; by musicologist Deryck Cooke, which brought the issue to the attention of English-speaking musicians.

The first versions of Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies often presented an instrumental, contrapuntal and rhythmic complexity (Brucknerian rhythm &quot;2 + 3&quot;, use of quintuplets), the originality of which has not been understood and which were considered unperformable by the musicians. In order to make them &quot;performable&quot;, the symphonies, except Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, have been revised several times. Consequently, there are several versions and editions, mainly of Symphonies 3, 4 and 8, which have been deeply emended by Bruckner&#x27;s friends and associates, and it is not always possible to tell whether the emendations had Bruckner&#x27;s direct authorization.

Looking for authentic versions of the symphonies, Robert Haas produced during the 1930s a first critical edition of Bruckner&#x27;s works based on the original scores. After World War II other scholars (Leopold Nowak, William Carragan, Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs &quot;et al.&quot;) carried on with this work.

=== Sacred choral works ===

Bruckner was a devoutly religious man, and composed numerous sacred works. He wrote a Te Deum, five psalm settings (including Psalm 150 in the 1890s), a Festive cantata, a Magnificat, about forty motets (among them eight settings of &quot;Tantum ergo&quot;, and three settings of both &quot;Christus factus est&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;), and at least seven Masses.

The three early Masses (&quot;Windhaager Messe&quot;, &quot;Kronstorfer Messe&quot; and &quot;Messe für den Gründonnerstag&quot;), composed between 1842 and 1844, were short Austrian &quot;Landmessen&quot; for use in local churches and did not always set all the numbers of the ordinary. His Requiem in D minor of 1849 is . It shows the clear influence of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem (also in D minor) and similar works of Michael Haydn. The seldom performed &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, composed in 1854 for Friedrich Mayer&#x27;s installation, was the last major work Bruckner composed before he started to study with Simon Sechter, with the possible exception of Psalm 146, a large work, for SATB soloists, double choir and orchestra.

The three Masses which Bruckner wrote in the 1860s and revised later on in his life are more often performed. The Masses numbered 1 in D minor and 3 in F minor are for solo singers, mixed choir, organ &quot;ad libitum&quot; and orchestra, while No. 2 in E minor is for mixed choir and a small group of wind instruments, and was written in an attempt to meet the Cecilians halfway. The Cecilians wanted to rid church music of instruments entirely. No. 3 was clearly meant for concert, rather than liturgical performance, and it is the only one of his Masses in which he set the first line of the Gloria, &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, and of the Credo, &quot;Credo in unum Deum&quot;, to music. In concert performances of the other Masses, these lines are intoned by a tenor soloist in the way a priest would, with a line of plainsong.

=== Secular vocal works ===
As a young man Bruckner sang in men&#x27;s choirs and wrote music for them. Bruckner&#x27;s secular choral music was mostly written for choral societies. The texts are always in German. Some of these works were written specifically for private occasions such as weddings, funerals, birthdays or name-days, many of these being dedicated to friends and acquaintances of the composer. This music is rarely performed. Biographer Derek Watson characterizes the pieces for men&#x27;s choir as being &quot;of little concern to the non-German listener&quot;. Of about 30 such pieces, a most unusual and evocative composition is the song &quot;Abendzauber&quot; (1878) for men&#x27;s choir, man soloist, yodelers and four horns.

Bruckner also composed 20 Lieder, of which only a few have been published. The Lieder that Bruckner composed in 1861–1862 during his tuition by Otto Kitzler have not been WAB classified. In 2013 the Austrian National Library was able to acquire a facsimile of the &quot;Kitzler-Studienbuch&quot;, the autograph manuscript hitherto unavailable to the public. The facsimile is edited by and in Band XXV of Bruckner&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Bruckner composed also five name-day cantatas, as well as two patriotic cantatas, &quot;Germanenzug&quot; and &quot;Helgoland&quot;, on texts by August Silberstein. &quot;Germanenzug&quot; (WAB 70), composed in 1863–1864, was Bruckner&#x27;s first published work. &quot;Helgoland&quot; (WAB 71), for TTBB men&#x27;s choir and large orchestra, was composed in 1893 and was Bruckner&#x27;s last completed composition and the only secular vocal work that he thought worthy enough to bequeath to the Austrian National Library.

=== Other works ===
During his apprenticeship with Otto Kitzler, Bruckner composed three short orchestral pieces and a March in D minor as orchestration exercises. At that time he also wrote an Overture in G minor. These works, which are occasionally included in recordings of the symphonies, show already hints of Bruckner&#x27;s emerging style.

A String Quartet in C minor and the additional Rondo in C minor, also composed in 1862, were discovered decades after Bruckner&#x27;s death. The later String Quintet in F Major of 1879, contemporaneous with the Fifth and Sixth symphonies, has been frequently performed. The Intermezzo in D minor, which was intended to replace its scherzo, is not frequently performed.

A &quot;Symphonisches Präludium&quot; (Symphonic Prelude) in C minor was discovered by Mahler scholar Paul Banks in the Austrian National Library in 1974 in a piano duet transcription. Banks ascribed it to Gustav Mahler, and had it orchestrated by Albrecht Gürsching. In 1985 Wolfgang Hiltl, who had retrieved the original score by Rudolf Krzyzanowski, had it published by Doblinger (issued in 2002). According to scholar Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs, the stylistic examination of this &quot;prelude&quot; shows that it is all Bruckner&#x27;s. Possibly Bruckner had given a draft-score to his pupil Krzyzanowski, which already contained the string parts and some important lines for woodwind and brass, as an exercise in instrumentation.

Bruckner&#x27;s Two Aequali of 1847 for three trombones are solemn, brief works. The Military march of 1865 is an occasional work as a gesture of appreciation for the &quot;Militär-Kapelle der Jäger-Truppe&quot; of Linz. &quot;Abendklänge&quot; of 1866 is a short character piece for violin and piano.

Bruckner also wrote a Lancer-Quadrille () and a few other small works for piano. Most of this music was written for teaching purposes. Sixteen other pieces for piano, which Bruckner composed in 1862 during his tuition by Kitzler, have not been WAB classified. A facsimile of these pieces is found in the &quot;Kitzler-Studienbuch&quot;.

Bruckner was a renowned organist at the St Florian&#x27;s Priory, where he improvised frequently. Those improvisations were usually not transcribed, so that only a few of his works for organ has survived. The five Preludes in E-flat major (1836–1837), classified WAB 127 and WAB 128, as well as a few other WAB-unclassified works, which have been found in Bruckner&#x27;s &quot;Präludienbuch&quot;, are probably not by Bruckner.

Bruckner never wrote an opera, and as much as he was a fan of Wagner&#x27;s music dramas, he was uninterested in drama. In 1893 he thought about writing an opera called &quot;Astra&quot; based on a novel by Gertrud Bollé-Hellmund. Although he attended performances of Wagner&#x27;s operas, he was much more interested in the music than the plot. After seeing Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, he asked: &quot;Tell me, why did they burn the woman at the end?&quot; Nor did Bruckner ever write an oratorio.

=== &quot;Bruckner Gesamtausgabe&quot; ===
Published by in Vienna, the &quot;&quot; (Bruckner&#x27;s Critical Complete Edition) comprises three successive editions.
* The first edition (1934–1944, Editorial Head: Robert Haas) included &#x27;hybrid&#x27; scores for Symphonies 2 and 8 and other similar conflations for some other revised works.
* In the second edition (1951–1989, Editorial Head: Leopold Nowak) Nowak &quot;et al.&quot; went about publishing several versions of some works, in the process correcting some mistakes of Haas. After Nowak&#x27;s resignation, (1990 onwards, Editorial Head: Herbert Vogg) William Carragan, Paul Hawkshaw, Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs &quot;et al.&quot; are in the process of reviewing and further correcting the work of Haas and Nowak.
* In 2011 it was decided to issue a new edition (editorial board: Paul Hawkshaw, Thomas Leibnitz, Andreas Lindner, Angela Pachovsky, Thomas Röder), which will include the content of the current edition and integrate it with sources that had been retrieved since its publication.

== Reception in the 20th century ==
Because of the long duration and vast orchestral canvas of much of his music, Bruckner&#x27;s popularity has greatly benefited from the introduction of long-playing media and from improvements in recording technology.

Decades after his death, the Nazis strongly approved of Bruckner&#x27;s music because they saw it as expressing the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of the German &quot;volk&quot;, and Hitler even consecrated a bust of Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in 1937 at Regensburg&#x27;s Walhalla temple. Bruckner&#x27;s music was among the most popular in Nazi Germany.

Near the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler became enamored with the music of Bruckner, and, as a result, planned to convert the monastery of St. Florian in Linz – where Bruckner had played the organ, and where he was buried – into a repository of Bruckner&#x27;s manuscripts. Hitler evicted the monks from the building and personally paid for the restoration of the organ and the institution of a Bruckner study center there. He also paid for the Haas collection of Bruckner&#x27;s works to be published, and himself purchased material for the proposed library. Additionally, Hitler caused the founding of the Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, which began presenting concerts in Fall 1943. His plan for one of the bell towers in Linz to play a theme from Bruckner&#x27;s Fourth Symphony never came to pass. The Adagio from Bruckner&#x27;s Seventh Symphony was broadcast by German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) when it announced the news of Hitler&#x27;s death on 1 May 1945.

Today the Brucknerhaus in Linz, which opened in 1974, is named after him.

The approval by Hitler and the Nazis of his music did not hurt Bruckner&#x27;s standing in the postwar media, and several movies and TV productions in Europe and the United States have used excerpts from his music ever since the 1950s, as they already did in the 1930s. Nor did the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ever ban Bruckner&#x27;s music as they have Wagner&#x27;s, even recording the Eighth Symphony with Zubin Mehta.

Bruckner&#x27;s symphonic works, much maligned in Vienna in his lifetime, now have an important place in the tradition and musical repertoire of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

===In popular culture===
The life of Bruckner was portrayed in Jan Schmidt-Garre&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Bruckner&#x27;s Decision&quot;, which focuses on his recovery in an Austrian spa. Ken Russell&#x27;s TV movie &quot;The Strange Affliction of Anton Bruckner&quot;, starring Peter Mackriel, also fictionalizes Bruckner&#x27;s real-life stay at a sanatorium because of obsessive–compulsive disorder (or &#x27;numeromania&#x27; as it was then described).

In addition, Visconti used the music of Bruckner for his &quot;Senso&quot; (1954), its plot concerned with the war Italy waged against Austria in 1866. The score by Carl Davis for the restoration of the 1925 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; takes &quot;inspiration from Bruckner to achieve reverence in biblical scenes.&quot;

<doc id="44014" wikidata="Q179167" url="?curid=44014" title="Henry Hudson">
<text>Henry Hudson ( 1565 – disappeared 23 June 1611) was an English sea explorer and navigator during the early 17th century, best known for his explorations of present-day Canada and parts of the Northeastern United States.

In 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumoured Northeast Passage to Cathay via a route above the Arctic Circle. In 1609, he landed in North America on behalf of the Dutch East India Company and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area. Looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia on his ship &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (&quot;Half Moon&quot;), he sailed up the Hudson River, which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region. His contributions to the exploration of the New World were significant and lasting. His voyages helped to establish European contact with the native peoples of North America and contributed to the development of trade and commerce. 

On his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage, Hudson became the first European to see Hudson Strait and the immense Hudson Bay. In 1611, after wintering on the shore of James Bay, Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast Hudson, his son, and six others adrift; what then happened to the Hudsons and their companions is unknown.

== Early life ==
Virtually nothing of Hudson&#x27;s early life is known for certain. His year of birth is variously estimated between 1560 and 1570. He may have been born in London and it is possible that his father was an alderman of that city. When Hudson first entered the historical record in 1607, he was already an experienced mariner with sufficient credentials to be commissioned the leader of an expedition charged with a search for a trade route across the North Pole.

== Exploration ==

=== Expeditions of 1607 and 1608 ===
In 1607, the Muscovy Company of England hired Hudson to find a northerly route to the Pacific coast of Asia. At the time, the English were engaged in an economic battle with the Dutch for control of northwest routes. It was thought that, because the sun shone for three months in the northern latitudes in the summer, the ice would melt, and a ship could make it across the &quot;top of the world&quot;.

On 1 May 1607, Hudson sailed with a crew of ten men and a boy on the 80-ton &quot;Hopewell&quot;. They reached the east coast of Greenland on 13 May, coasting northward until 22 May. Here the party named a headland &quot;Young&#x27;s Cape&quot;, a &quot;very high mount, like a round castle&quot; near it &quot;Mount of God&#x27;s Mercy&quot; and land at 73° north latitude &quot;Hold with Hope&quot;. After turning east, they sighted &quot;Newland&quot; (Spitsbergen) on 27 May near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the &quot;Great Indraught&quot; (Isfjorden).

On 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80° 23′ N, but had more likely only reached 79° 23′ N. The following day they entered what Hudson later in the voyage named &quot;Whales Bay&quot; (Krossfjorden and Kongsfjorden), naming its northwestern point &quot;Collins Cape&quot; (Kapp Mitra) after his boatswain, William Collins. They sailed north the following two days. On 16 July, they reached as far north as Hakluyt&#x27;s Headland (which Thomas Edge says Hudson named on this voyage) at 79° 49′ N, thinking they saw the land continue to 82° N (Svalbard&#x27;s northernmost point is 80° 49′ N) when really it trended to the east. Encountering ice packed along the north coast, they were forced to turn back south. Hudson wanted to make his return &quot;by the north of Greenland to Davis his Streights (Davis Strait), and so for Kingdom of England&quot;, but ice conditions would have made this impossible. The expedition returned to Tilbury Hope on the River Thames on 15 September.

Hudson reported large numbers of whales in Spitsbergen waters during this voyage. Many authors credit his reports as the catalyst for several nations sending whaling expeditions to the islands. This claim is contentious; others have pointed to strong evidence that it was Jonas Poole&#x27;s reports in 1610, that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of Nicholas Woodcock and Willem Cornelisz van Muyden in 1612, which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling. The whaling industry was built by neither Hudson nor Poole—both were dead by 1612.

In 1608, English merchants of the East India and Muscovy Companies again sent Hudson in the &quot;Hopewell&quot; to attempt to locate a passage to the Indies, this time to the east around northern Russia. Leaving London on 22 April, the ship travelled almost , making it to Novaya Zemlya well above the Arctic Circle in July, but even in the summer they found the ice impenetrable and turned back, arriving at Gravesend on 26 August.

According to Thomas Edge, &quot;William Hudson&quot; in 1608 discovered an island he named &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Tutches&quot; (Touches) at 71° N, the latitude of Jan Mayen. However, records of Hudson&#x27;s voyages suggest that he could only have come across Jan Mayen in 1607 by making an illogical detour, and historians have pointed out that Hudson himself made no mention of it in his journal. There is also no cartographical proof of this supposed discovery.

Jonas Poole in 1611 and Robert Fotherby in 1615 both had possession of Hudson&#x27;s journal while searching for his elusive Hold-with-Hope—which is now believed to have been on the east coast of Greenland—but neither had any knowledge of any discovery of Jan Mayen, an achievement which was only later attributed to Hudson. Fotherby eventually stumbled across Jan Mayen, thinking it a new discovery and naming it &quot;Sir Thomas Smith&#x27;s Island&quot;, though the first verifiable records of the discovery of the island had been made a year earlier, in 1614.

=== Expedition of 1609 ===

In 1609, Hudson was chosen by merchants of the Dutch East India Company in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia. While awaiting orders and supplies in Amsterdam, he heard rumours of a northwest route to the Pacific through North America. Hudson had been told to sail through the Arctic Ocean north of Russia, into the Pacific and so to the Far East. Hudson departed Amsterdam on 4 April, in command of the Dutch ship (English: Half Moon). He could not complete the specified (eastward) route because ice blocked the passage, as with all previous such voyages, and he turned the ship around in mid-May while somewhere east of Norway&#x27;s North Cape. At that point, acting outside his instructions, Hudson pointed the ship west and decided to try to seek a westerly passage through North America.

They reached the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on 2 July, and in mid-July made landfall near the LaHave area of Nova Scotia. Here they encountered Indigenous people who were accustomed to trading with the French; they were willing to trade beaver pelts, but apparently no trades occurred. The ship stayed in the area about ten days, the crew replacing a broken mast and fishing for food. On the 25 July, a dozen men from the &quot;Halve Maen&quot;, using muskets and small cannon, went ashore and assaulted the village near their anchorage. They drove the people from the settlement and took their boat and other property—probably pelts and trade goods.
On 4 August, the ship was at Cape Cod, from which Hudson sailed south to the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay. Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding Delaware Bay but continuing on north. On 3 September, he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the &quot;North River&quot; or &quot;Mauritius&quot; and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524.

On 6 September 1609, John Colman of his crew was killed by natives with an arrow to his neck. Hudson sailed into the Upper New York Bay on 11 September, and the following day encountered a group of 28 Lenape canoes, buying oysters and beans from the Native Americans, and then began a journey up what is now known as the Hudson River. Over the next ten days his ship ascended the river, reaching a point near Stuyvesant Landing (Old Kinderhook), and the ship&#x27;s boat with five crew members ventured to the vicinity of present-day Albany.

On 23 September, Hudson decided to return to Europe. He put in at Dartmouth, England on 7 November, and was detained by authorities who wanted access to his log. He managed to pass the log to the Dutch ambassador to England, who sent it, along with his report, to Amsterdam.

While exploring the river, Hudson had traded with several native groups, mainly obtaining furs. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the fur trade that prospered there when a trading post was established at Albany in 1614. New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island became the capital of New Netherland in 1625.

=== Expedition of 1610–1611 ===
In 1610, Hudson obtained backing for another voyage, this time under the English flag. The funding came from the Virginia Company and the British East India Company. At the helm of his new ship, the , he stayed to the north (some claim he had deliberately stayed too far south on his Dutch-funded voyage), reached Iceland on 11 May, the south of Greenland on 4 June, and rounded the southern tip of Greenland.

On 25 June, the explorers reached what is now the Hudson Strait at the northern tip of Labrador. Following the southern coast of the strait on 2 August, the ship entered Hudson Bay. Excitement was very high due to the expectation that the ship had finally found the Northwest Passage through the continent. Hudson spent the following months mapping and exploring its eastern shores, but he and his crew did not find a passage to Asia. In November, the ship became trapped in the ice in James Bay, and the crew moved ashore for the winter.

==== Mutiny ====
When the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson planned to use his &quot;Discovery&quot; to further explore Hudson Bay with the continuing goal of discovering the Passage; however, most of the members of his crew ardently desired to return home. Matters came to a head and much of the crew mutinied in June. Descriptions of the successful mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who went along with the mutiny.

In the latter class was ship&#x27;s navigator, Abacuk Pricket, a survivor who kept a journal that was to become one of the sources for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. The latter, a navigator, had accompanied Hudson on the 1609 expedition, and his account is said to be &quot;the best contemporary record of the voyage&quot;. Pricket&#x27;s narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen—men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson—adrift from the &quot;Discovery&quot; in a small shallop, an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items. 

==== Disappearance ====

After the mutiny, Hudson&#x27;s shallop broke out oars and tried to keep pace with the &quot;Discovery&quot; for some time. Pricket recalled that the mutineers finally tired of the David–Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the &quot;Discovery&quot;, enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen by Europeans again. Despite subsequent searches, including those conducted by Thomas Button in 1612 and by Zachariah Gillam in 1668–1670, their fate is unknown.

====Pricket&#x27;s reliability====
While Pricket&#x27;s account is one of the few surviving records of the voyage, its reliability has been questioned by some historians. Pricket&#x27;s journal and testimony have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, prior to the mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England (Juet, who had been the navigator on the return journey, died of starvation a few days before the company reached Ireland). Pricket knew he and the other survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for piracy, and it would have been in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.

The Pricket narrative became the controlling story of the expedition&#x27;s disastrous end. Only eight of the thirteen mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information to execute, as they had travelled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions.

====Later developments====
In 1612, Nicolas de Vignau claimed he saw wreckage of an English ship on the shores of James Bay, located on the southern end of Hudson Bay—while this was discounted at the time by Samuel de Champlain, historians believe it may have credence.

British-born Canadian author Dorothy Harley Eber (1925–2022) collected Inuit testimonies that she thought made reference to Hudson and his son after the mutiny. According to these, an old man with a long white beard and a young boy arrived in a small wooden boat. The Inuit had never seen a white person before, but they took them to an encampment and fed them. After the old man died, the Inuit tethered the boy to one of their houses so he would not run away. Despite the long time passed, the story might be given some credence after long-ignored Inuit testimonies proved reliable enough to lead to the discovery of the wrecks of the two ships of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition of 1845, and , in the 2010s. Charles Francis Hall, who searched for Franklin in the mid-19th century, also collected Inuit stories that he interpreted as references to the even earlier expedition of Martin Frobisher, who explored the area and mined fool&#x27;s gold in 1578.

In the late 1950s, a stone near Deep River, Ontario, which is approximately south of James Bay, was found to have carving on it with Hudson&#x27;s initials (H. H.), the year 1612, and the word &quot;captive&quot;. While lettering on the stone was consistent with English maps of the 17th century, the Geological Survey of Canada was unable to determine when the carving was made.

== Legacy ==
The bay visited by and named after Hudson is three times the size of the Baltic Sea, and its many large estuaries afford access to otherwise landlocked parts of Western Canada and the Arctic. This allowed the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to exploit a lucrative fur trade along its shores for more than two centuries, growing powerful enough to influence the history and present international boundaries of western North America.

Along with Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait in Canada, many other topographical features and landmarks are named for Hudson. The Hudson River in New York and New Jersey is named after him, as are Hudson County, New Jersey, the Henry Hudson Bridge, the Henry Hudson Parkway, and the city of Hudson, New York.

<text>A candle is an ignitable wick embedded in wax, or another flammable solid substance such as tallow, that provides light, and in some cases, a fragrance. A candle can also provide heat or a method of keeping time. Candles have been used for over two millennia around the world, and were a significant form of indoor lighting until the invention of other types of light sources. Although electric light has largely made candle use nonessential for illumination, candles are still commonly used for functional, symbolic and aesthetic purposes and in specific cultural and religious settings.

Early candles may be made of beeswax, but these candles were expensive and their use was limited to the elite and the churches. Tallow was a cheaper but a less aesthetically pleasing alternative. A variety of different materials have been developed in the modern era for making candles, including paraffin wax, which together with efficient production techniques, made candles affordable for the masses. Various devices can be used to hold candles, such as candlesticks, or candelabras, chandeliers, lanterns and sconces. A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a chandler.

The combustion of the candle proceeds in self-sustaining manner. As the wick of candle is lit, the heat melts and ignites a small amount of solid fuel (the wax), which vaporizes and combines with oxygen in the air to form a flame. The flame then melts the top of the mass of solid fuel, which moves upward through the wick via capillary action to be continually burnt, thereby maintaining a constant flame. The candle shortens as the solid fuel is consumed, so does the wick. Wicks of pre-19th century candles required regular trimming with scissors or &quot;snuffers&quot; to promote steady burning and prevent smoking. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns, and the end of the wick gets trimmed by itself through incineration by fire.

==Etymology==
The word candle comes from Middle English , from Old English and from Anglo-Norman , both from Latin , from &#x27;to shine&#x27;.

==History==
Prior to the invention of candles, ancient people used open fire, torches, splinters of resinous wood, and lamps to provide artificial illumination at night. Primitive oil lamps in which a lit wick rested in a pool of oil or fat were used from the Paleolithic period, and pottery and stone lamps from the Neolithic period have been found. Because candle making requires a reliable supply of animal or vegetable fats, it is certain that candles could not have developed before the early Bronze Age; however, it is unclear when and where candles were first used. Objects that could be candlesticks have been found in Babylonian and middle Minoan cultures, as well in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The &quot;candles&quot; used in these early periods would not have resembled the current forms; more likely they were made of plant materials dipped in animal fat.

Early evidence of candle use may be found in Italy, where depiction of a candlestick exists in an Etruscan tomb at Orvieto, and the earliest excavated Etruscan candlestick dates from the 7th century BC. Candles may have evolved from with wick of oakum and other plant fibre soaked in fat, pitch or oil and burned in lamps or pots. Candles of antiquity were made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax, and Romans made true dipped candles from tallow and beeswax. Beeswax candles were expensive and their use was limited to the wealthy, instead oil lamps were the more commonly used lighting devices in Roman times. Ancient Greece used torches and oil lamps, and likely adopted candle use in a later period from Rome. Early record in China suggests that candle was used in the Qin dynasty before 200 BC. These early Chinese candles may have been made from whale fat.

In Christianity, candles gained significance in their decorative, symbolic and ceremonial uses in churches. Wax candles, or &quot;candela cerea&quot; recorded at the end of the 3rd century, were documented as Easter candles in Spain and Italy in the fourth century, the Christian festival Candlemas was named after it, and Pope Sergius I instituted the procession of lighted candles. Papal bulls decreed that tallow be excluded for use in altar candles, and a high beeswax content is necessary for candles of the high altar.

In medieval Europe, candles were initially used primarily in Christian churches. Its use spread later to the households of the wealthy as a luxury item. In northern Europe, rushlight made of greased rushes were commonly used especially in England, but tallow candles were used during the Middle Ages, with a mention of tallow candles in English appearing in 1154. Beeswax was widely used in church ceremonies, and compared to animal-based tallow, it burns cleanly without smoky flame, and does not release an unpleasant smell like tallow. Beeswax candles were expensive, and relatively few people could afford to burn them in their homes in medieval Europe.
The candles were produced using a number of methods: dipping the wick in molten fat or wax, rolling the candle by hand around a wick, or pouring fat or wax onto a wick to build up the candle. In the 14th century Sieur de Brez introduced the technique of using a mould, but real improvement for the efficient production of candles with mould was only achieved in the 19th century. Wax and tallow candles were made in monasteries in the medieval period, and in rural households, tallow candles may be made at home. By the 13th century, candle making had become a guild craft in England and France, with a French guild documented as early as 1061. The candle makers (chandlers) went from house to house making candles from the kitchen fats saved for that purpose, or made and sold their own candles from small candle shops.

By the 16th century, beeswax candles were appearing as luxury household items among the wealthy. Candles were widely used in the 17th and 18th centuries, and a party in Dresden was said to have been lit by 14,000 candles in 1779.

In the Middle East, during the Abbasid and Fatimid Caliphates, beeswax was the dominant material used for candle making. Beeswax was often imported from long distances; for example, candle makers from Egypt used beeswax from Tunis. As in Europe, these candles were expensive and limited to the elite, and most commoners used oil lamps instead. According to legend, the practice of using lamps and candles in mosque started with Tamim al-Dari who lit a lamp he brought from Syria in the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina. The Umayyad caliph Al-Walid II was known to have used candles in the court in Damascus, while the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil was said to have spent 1.2 million silver dirhams annually on candles for his royal palaces.

In early modern Syria, candles were in high demand by all socioeconomic classes because they were customarily lit during marriage ceremonies. There were candle makers&#x27; guilds in the Safavid capital of Isfahan during the 1500s and 1600s. However, candle makers had a relatively low social position in Safavid Iran, comparable to barbers, bathhouse workers, fortune tellers, bricklayers, and porters.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, spermaceti, a waxy substance produced by the sperm whale, was used to produce a superior candle that burned longer, brighter and gave off no offensive smell. Later in the 18th century, colza oil and rapeseed oil came into use as much cheaper substitutes.

===Modern era===
A number of improvements were made to candle in the 19th century. In older candles, the wick of a burning candle was not in direct contact with air, so it charred instead of being burnt. The charred wick inhibited further burning and produced black smoke, so the wick needed to be constantly trimmed or &quot;snuffed&quot;. In 1825, a French man M. Cambacérès introduced the plaited wick soaked with mineral salts, which when burnt, curled towards the outer edge of the flame and become incinerated by it, thereby trimming itself. These are referred to as &quot;self-trimming&quot; or &quot;self-consuming&quot; wicks. In 1823, Michel Eugène Chevreul and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac separate out stearin in animal fats, and obtained a patent in 1825 to produce candles that are harder and can burn brighter.

The manufacture of candles became an industrialized mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan, a pewterer from Manchester, England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour. This allowed candles to be an affordable commodity for the masses.

In the mid-1850s, James Young succeeded in distilling paraffin wax from coal and oil shales at Bathgate in West Lothian and developed a commercially viable method of production. Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, which burned cleanly and left no unpleasant odor, unlike tallow candles. By the end of the 19th century, candles were made from paraffin wax and stearic acid.

By the late 19th century, Price&#x27;s Candles, based in London, was the largest candle manufacturer in the world. Founded by William Wilson in 1830, the company pioneered the implementation of the technique of steam distillation, and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including kerosene and lamps and the 1879 invention of the incandescent light bulb. From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item.

==Use==

Before the invention of electric lighting, candles and oil lamps were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely. Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, oil lamps predominated.
In the developed world today, candles are used mainly for their aesthetic value and scent, particularly to set a soft, warm, or romantic ambiance, for emergency lighting during electrical power failures. Candles, however, are still commonly used in religious and ceremonial contexts. Examples include votive candles, Paschal candles and yahrzeit candles. In the days leading to Christmas, some people burn a candle a set amount to represent each day, as marked on the candle. The type of candle used in this way is called the &quot;Advent candle&quot;, although this term is also used to refer to a candle that are used in an Advent wreath. 

Symbolic use of candles has extended from the religious to the secular, for example, a candlelight vigil may be held in remembrance for a person, for a cause or an event, or as a form of political action or protest. In a social setting, candles are commonly used on birthday cakes.

In the 21st century, there has been a huge spike in sales of scented candles in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns led to a dramatic increase in the sales of scented candles, diffusers and room sprays.

===Other uses===

With the fairly consistent and measurable burning of a candle, a common use of candles was to tell the time. The candle designed for this purpose might have time measurements, usually in hours, marked along the wax. The Song dynasty in China (960–1279) used candle clocks.

By the 18th century, candle clocks were being made with weights set into the sides of the candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.

==Components==

===Wax===
For most of recorded history candles were made from tallow (rendered from beef or mutton-fat) or beeswax. From the mid-1800s, they were also made from spermaceti, a waxy substance derived from the Sperm whale, which in turn spurred demand for the substance. Candles were also made from stearin (initially manufactured from animal fats but now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes). Today, most candles are made from paraffin wax, a byproduct of petroleum refining.
Candles can also be made from microcrystalline wax, beeswax (a byproduct of honey collection), gel (a mixture of polymer and mineral oil), or some plant waxes (generally palm, carnauba, bayberry, or soybean wax).

The size of the flame and corresponding rate of burning is controlled largely by the candle wick. The kind of wax also affects the burn rate, with beeswax and coconut wax burning longer than paraffin or soy wax.

Production methods utilize extrusion moulding. More traditional production methods entail melting the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. The liquid is then poured into a mould, or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped tapered candle. Often fragrance oils, essential oils or aniline-based dye is added.

===Wick===

A candle wick works by capillary action, drawing (&quot;wicking&quot;) the melted wax or fuel up to the flame. When the liquid fuel reaches the flame, it vaporizes and combusts. The candle wick influences how the candle burns. Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, fire resistance, and tethering.

A candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle. Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton. The wick&#x27;s capillarity determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame. If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle. Wicks are often infused with a variety of chemicals to modify their burning characteristics. For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished. Typical agents are ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate.

==Characteristics==
===Light===
Based on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1 g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80 W. The light produced is about 13 lumens, for a luminous efficacy of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) – almost a hundred times lower than an incandescent light bulb. If a 1 candela source emitted uniformly in all directions, the total radiant flux would be only about 18.40 mW.

The luminous intensity of a typical candle is approximately one candela. The SI unit, candela, was in fact based on an older unit called the &quot;candlepower&quot;, which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a &quot;standard candle&quot;). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle&#x27;s luminous intensity is still about one candela.

===Temperature===
The hottest part of a candle flame is just above the very dull blue part to one side of the flame, at the base. At this point, the flame is about . However, this part of the flame is very small and releases little heat energy. The blue color is due to chemiluminescence, while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot soot particles. The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed. The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about . The color temperature is approximately 1,000 K.

===Combustion===

For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a match or lighter) is used to light the candle&#x27;s wick, which melts and vaporizes a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant flame. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via capillary action; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle&#x27;s flame.

As the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. The end of the plaited wick bends and get consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Pre-19th century wicks required regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7 cm), to promote steady burning and to prevent it from releasing black smoke. Special candle scissors called &quot;snuffers&quot; were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is made in such a way that it curves over as it burns, which ensures that the end of the wick gets incinerated by fire, thereby trimming itself.

===Candle flame===
A candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning. A candle flame is widely recognized as having between three and five regions or &quot;zones&quot;:
* Zone I – this is the non-luminous, lowest, and coolest part of the candle flame. It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn. Temperatures are around .
* Zone II – this is the &quot;blue zone&quot;, which surrounds the base of the flame. Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue. It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around .
* Zone III – the &quot;dark zone&quot; is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax. Pyrolysis takes place here. Temperature is around .
*Zone IV – the &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;luminous zone&quot; is yellow/white and is located above the dark zone. It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest. It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it, resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around .
* Zone V – The non-luminous &quot;outer zone&quot; or &quot;veil&quot; surrounds Zone IV. Here, the flame is at its hottest, at around , and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color, though most of it is invisible.

The main determinant of the height of a candle flame is the diameter of the wick. This is evidenced in tealights where the wick is very thin and the flame is very small. Candles whose main purpose is illumination use a much thicker wick.

===History of study===
One of Michael Faraday&#x27;s significant works was &quot;The Chemical History of a Candle&quot;, where he gives an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary development, workings and science of candles.

==Hazards==
According to the National Fire Protection Association, candles are a leading source of residential fires in the United States with almost 10% of civilian injuries and 6% of fatalities from fire attributed to candles.

A candle flame that is longer than its laminar smoke point will emit soot. Proper wick trimming will reduce soot emissions from most candles.

The liquid wax is hot and can cause skin burns, but the amount and temperature are generally rather limited and the burns are seldom serious. The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a candle snuffer instead of blowing directly on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available. Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.

Glass candleholders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers and discontinue use once a half inch or less of wax remains.

A former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a lead core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors – a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use zinc or a zinc alloy, which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.

Candles emit volatile organic compounds into the environment, which releases carbon into the air. The combustion process of lighting a candle includes the release of light, heat, carbon dioxide and water vapor, to fuel the flame. Candle use can be unsafe if fragrances are inhaled at high doses Non-toxic candles have been created as an alternative to prevent these volatile organic compounds from being released into the environment. Candle companies such as &quot;The Plant Project&quot; have created candles that are more environmentally sustainable and better for lung health. These alternatives include non-toxic wax blends, safe fragrances and eco-friendly packaging. Safer candles include candles made from coconut, soy, vegetable, and beeswax.

Users who seek the aesthetics of a candle sometimes install an electric flameless candle to avoid the hazards.

==Regulation==
International markets have developed a range of standards and regulations to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving safety, including:
* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, REACH, RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175
* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326 (all are federal and applies in all 50 states), California Proposition 65 (California only), CONEG (New England and New York states only)
* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle

==Accessories==
===Candle holders===

Decorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called candlesticks; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term &quot;candelabra&quot; is also used. The root form of &quot;chandelier&quot; is from the word for candle, but now often refers to an electric fixture. The word &quot;chandelier&quot; is used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple lights. Other forms of candle holders include the wall-mounted sconces, lanterns, and girandoles.
Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but international trade has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction-tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. 

For tea light candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for votives. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.

A bobèche is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bobèches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bobèches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts or festivals.

===Candle snuffers===
Candle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an &quot;extinguisher&quot; or &quot;douter&quot;.

===Candle followers===
These are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:
* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.
* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.
* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.

Candle followers are often found in churches on altar candles.

<text>Utopian and dystopian fiction are subgenres of speculative fiction that explore extreme forms of social and political structures. Utopian fiction portrays a setting that agrees with the author&#x27;s ethos, having various attributes of another reality intended to appeal to readers. Dystopian fiction offers the opposite: the portrayal of a setting that completely disagrees with the author&#x27;s ethos. Some novels combine both genres, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take depending on its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other types of speculative fiction.

More than 400 utopian works in the English language were published prior to the year 1900, with more than a thousand others appearing during the 20th century. This increase is partially associated with the rise in popularity of science fiction and young adult fiction more generally, but also larger scale social change that brought awareness of larger societal or global issues, such as technology, climate change, and growing human population. Some of these trends have created distinct subgenres such as ecotopian fiction, climate fiction, young adult dystopian novels, and feminist dystopian novels.

==Subgenres==

===Utopian fiction===
The word &quot;utopia&quot; was first used in direct context by Thomas More in his 1516 work &quot;Utopia&quot;. The word
&quot;utopia&quot; resembles both the Greek words &quot;outopos&quot; (&quot;no place&quot;), and &quot;eutopos&quot; (&quot;good place&quot;). More&#x27;s book, written in Latin, sets out a vision of an ideal society. As the title suggests, the work presents an ambiguous and ironic projection of the ideal state. The whimsical nature of the text can be confirmed by the narrator of &quot;Utopia&quot;&#x27;s second book, Raphael Hythloday. The Greek root of the name &quot;Hythloday&quot; suggests an &#x27;expert in nonsense&#x27;.

An earlier example of a Utopian work from classical antiquity is Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, in which he outlines what he sees as the ideal society and its political system. Later, Tommaso Campanella was influenced by Plato&#x27;s work and wrote &quot;The City of the Sun&quot; (1623), which describes a modern utopian society built on equality. Other examples include Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia&quot; (1759) and Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;Erewhon&quot; (1872), which uses an anagram of &quot;nowhere&quot; as its title. This, like much of utopian literature, can be seen as satire; Butler inverts illness and crime, with punishment for the former and treatment for the latter.

One example of the utopian genre&#x27;s meaning and purpose is described in Fredric Jameson&#x27;s &quot;Archeologies of the Future&quot; (2005)&quot;,&quot; which addresses many utopian varieties defined by their program or impulse.

===Dystopian fiction===

A dystopia is a society characterized by a focus on that which is contrary to the author&#x27;s ethos, such as mass poverty, public mistrust and suspicion, a police state or oppression. Most authors of dystopian fiction explore at least one reason why things are that way, often as an analogy for similar issues in the real world. Dystopian literature serves to &quot;provide fresh perspectives on problematic social and political practices that might otherwise be taken for granted or considered natural and inevitable&quot;.
Some dystopias claim to be utopias. Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;Erewhon&quot; can be seen as a dystopia because of the way sick people are punished as criminals while thieves are &quot;cured&quot; in hospitals, which the inhabitants of Erewhon see as natural and right, i.e., utopian (as mocked in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;).

Dystopias usually extrapolate elements of contemporary society, and thus can be read as political warnings.

Eschatological literature may portray dystopias.

==== Examples ====
The 1921 novel &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamyatin portrays a post-apocalyptic future in which society is entirely based on logic and modeled after mechanical systems. George Orwell was influenced by &quot;We&quot; when he wrote &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (published in 1949), a novel about Oceania, a state at perpetual war, its population controlled through propaganda. Big Brother and the daily Two Minutes Hate set the tone for an all-pervasive self-censorship. Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; started as a parody of utopian fiction, and projected into the year 2540 industrial and social changes he perceived in 1931, leading to industrial success by a coercively persuaded population divided into five castes. Karin Boye&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Kallocain&quot; is set in a totalitarian world state where a drug is used to control the individual&#x27;s thoughts.

Anthony Burgess&#x27; 1962 novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is set in a future England that has a subculture of extreme youth violence, and details the protagonist&#x27;s experiences with the state intent on changing his character at their whim. Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985) describes a future United States governed by a totalitarian theocracy, where women have no rights, and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (1979) describes a similar totalitarian scenario, but depicting the participation of teenage boys in a deadly contest. Examples of young-adult dystopian fiction include (notably all published after 2000) &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; series by Suzanne Collins, the &quot;Divergent&quot; series by Veronica Roth, &quot;The Power of Five&quot; series by Anthony Horowitz, &quot;The Maze Runner&quot; series by James Dashner, and the &quot;Uglies&quot; series by Scott Westerfeld. Video games often include dystopias as well; notable examples include the &quot;Fallout&quot; series, &quot;BioShock&quot;, and the later games of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series.

==History of dystopian fiction==
The history of dystopian literature can be traced back to the reaction to the French Revolution of 1789 and the prospect that mob rule would produce dictatorship. Until the late 20th century, it was usually anti-collectivist. Dystopian fiction emerged as a response to the utopian. Its early history is traced in Gregory Claeys&#x27; &quot;Dystopia: A Natural History&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2017).

The beginning of technological dystopian fiction can be traced back to E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; (1909). M Keith Booker states that &quot;The Machine Stops,&quot; &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; are &quot;the great defining texts of the genre of dystopian fiction, both in [the] vividness of their engagement with real-world social and political issues and in the scope of their critique of the societies on which they focus.&quot;

Another important figure in dystopian literature is H. G. Wells, whose work &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895) is also widely seen as a prototype of dystopian literature. Wells&#x27; work draws on the social structure of the 19th century, providing a critique of the British class structure at the time. Post World War II, even more dystopian fiction was produced. These works of fiction were interwoven with political commentary: the end of World War II brought about fears of an impending Third World War and a consequent apocalypse.

Modern dystopian fiction draws not only on topics such as totalitarian governments and anarchism, but also pollution, global warming, climate change, health, the economy and technology. Modern dystopian themes are common in the young adult (YA) genre of literature.

===Combinations===
Many works combine elements of both utopias and dystopias. Typically, an observer from our world will journey to another place or time and see one society the author considers ideal and another representing the worst possible outcome. Usually, the point is that our choices may lead to a better or worse potential future world. Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; fulfills this model, as does Marge Piercy&#x27;s &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot;. In Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot; there is no time-travelling observer. However, her ideal society is invaded by a neighbouring power embodying evil repression. In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Island&quot;, in many ways a counterpoint to his better-known &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the fusion of the best parts of Buddhist philosophy and Western technology is threatened by the &quot;invasion&quot; of oil companies. As another example, in the &quot;Unwanteds&quot; series by Lisa McMann, a paradox occurs where the outcasts from a complete dystopia are treated to absolute utopia. They believe that those who were privileged in said dystopia were the unlucky ones.

In another literary model, the imagined society journeys between elements of utopia and dystopia over the course of the novel or film. At the beginning of &quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry, the world is described as a utopia. However, as the book progresses, the world&#x27;s dystopian aspects are revealed.

Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; is also sometimes linked with both utopian and dystopian literatures, because it shares the general preoccupation with ideas of good and bad societies. Of the countries Lemuel Gulliver visits, Brobdingnag and Country of the Houyhnhnms approach a utopia; the others have significant dystopian aspects.

===Ecotopian fiction===
In &quot;ecotopian fiction&quot;, the author posits either a utopian or dystopian world revolving around environmental conservation or destruction. Danny Bloom coined the term &quot;cli-fi&quot; in 2006, with a Twitter boost from Margaret Atwood in 2011, to cover climate change-related fiction, but the theme has existed for decades. Novels dealing with overpopulation, such as Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (made into movie &quot;Soylent Green&quot;), were popular in the 1970s, reflecting the widespread concern with the effects of overpopulation on the environment. The novel &quot;Nature&#x27;s End&quot; by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka (1986) posits a future in which overpopulation, pollution, climate change, and resulting superstorms, have led to a popular mass-suicide political movement. Some other examples of ecological dystopias are depictions of Earth in the films &quot;Wall-E&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;.

While eco-dystopias are more common, a small number of works depicting what might be called eco-utopia, or eco-utopian trends, have also been influential. These include Ernest Callenbach&#x27;s &quot;Ecotopia&quot;, an important 20th century example of this genre. Kim Stanley Robinson has written several books dealing with environmental themes, including the Mars trilogy. Most notably, however, his &quot;Three Californias Trilogy&quot; contrasted an eco-dystopia with an eco-utopia and a sort of middling-future. Robinson has also edited an anthology of short ecotopian fiction, called &quot;Future Primitive: The New Ecotopias&quot;. Another impactful piece of Robinson&#x27;s is &quot;New York 2140&quot; which focuses on the aftermath of society after a major flooding event, and can be seen through both a utopian and dystopian lens.

There are a few dystopias that have an &quot;anti-ecological&quot; theme. These are often characterized by a government that is overprotective of nature or a society that has lost most modern technology and struggles for survival. A fine example of this is the novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;.

===Feminist utopias===

Another subgenre is &quot;feminist utopias&quot; and the overlapping category of feminist science fiction. According to the author Sally Miller Gearhart, &quot;A feminist utopian novel is one which &quot;a.&quot; contrasts the present with an envisioned idealized society (separated from the present by time or space), &quot;b.&quot; offers a comprehensive critique of present values/conditions, &quot;c.&quot; sees men or male institutions as a major cause of present social ills, &quot;d.&quot; presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions.&quot;

Utopias have explored the ramification of gender being either a societal construct or a hard-wired imperative. In Mary Gentle&#x27;s &quot;Golden Witchbreed&quot;, gender is not chosen until maturity, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, Doris Lessing&#x27;s &quot;The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five&quot; (1980) suggests that men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In &quot;My Own Utopia&quot; (1961) by Elisabeth Mann Borgese, gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex — genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men. Marge Piercy&#x27;s novel &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot; keeps human biology, but removes pregnancy and childbirth from the gender equation by resorting to assisted reproductive technology while allowing both women and men the nurturing experience of breastfeeding.

Utopic single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences. One solution to gender oppression or social issues in feminist utopian fiction is to remove men, either showing isolated all-female societies as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Herland&quot;, or societies where men have died out or been replaced, as in Joanna Russ&#x27;s &quot;A Few Things I Know About Whileaway&quot;, where &quot;the poisonous binary gender&quot; has died off. In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of a technological or mystical method that allows female parthenogenetic reproduction. The resulting society is often shown to be utopian by feminist writers. Many influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ&#x27;s &quot;The Female Man and&quot; Suzy McKee Charnas&#x27;s &quot;The Holdfast Chronicles&quot;. Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from patriarchy. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all — &quot;Herland&quot; (1915) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a famous early example of a sexless society. Charlene Ball writes in &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies Encyclopedia&quot; that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles has been more common in the United States than in Europe and elsewhere.

Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes rather than separation.

==Cultural impact==
Étienne Cabet&#x27;s work &quot;Travels in Icaria&quot; caused a group of followers, the Icarians, to leave France in 1848, and travel to the United States to start a series of utopian settlements in Texas, Illinois, Iowa, California, and elsewhere. These groups lived in communal settings and lasted until 1898.

Among the first decades of the 20th century in Russia, utopian science fiction literature popularity rose extremely due to the fact that the citizens wanted to fantasize about the future instead of just the fact that it was a new, up and coming genre of literature. During the Cold War, however, utopian science fiction became exceptionally prominent among Soviet leaders. Many citizens of the Soviet Russia became dependent on this type of literature because it represented an escape from the real world which was not ideal at the time. Utopian science fiction allowed them to fantasize about how satisfactory it would be to live in a &quot;perfect&quot; world.

<text>The United States National Security Council (NSC) is the national security council used by the president of the United States for consideration of national security, military, and foreign policy matters. Based in the White House, it is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and composed of senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials.

Since its inception in 1947 by President Harry S. Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the president on national security and foreign policies. It also serves as the president&#x27;s principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has subsequently played a key role in most major events in U.S. foreign policy, from the Korean War to the War on Terror.

The NSC has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations.

==History==
The immediate predecessor to the National Security Council was the National Intelligence Authority (NIA), which was established by President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Executive Letter of January 22, 1946, to oversee the Central Intelligence Group, the CIA&#x27;s predecessor. The NIA was composed of the secretary of state, the secretary of war, the secretary of the navy, and the chief of staff to the commander in chief.
The National Security Council was created in 1947 by the National Security Act. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the Soviet Union in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and other instruments of national security policy such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also created in the National Security Act. In 2004, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, taking over the responsibilities previously held by the head of the CIA, the director of central intelligence, as a cabinet-level position to oversee and coordinate activities of the Intelligence Community
On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama merged the White House staff supporting the Homeland Security Council (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the president. The name of the staff organization was changed back to National Security Council Staff in 2014.

The Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense was formed in 2016 under the Obama administration, disbanded in 2018 under the Trump Administration, and reinstated in January 2021 during the presidency of Joe Biden.

On January 29, 2017, President Donald Trump restructured the Principals Committee (a subset of the full National Security Council), while at the same time altering the attendance of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of national intelligence.

According to &quot;National Security Presidential Memorandum 2&quot;, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of national intelligence were to only sit on the Principals Committee as and when matters pertaining to them arise, but will remain part of the full National Security Council. However, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus clarified the next day that they still are invited to attend meetings. With &quot;National Security Presidential Memorandum 4&quot; in April 2017, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff &quot;shall&quot; attend Principals Committee meetings and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency was included as a regular attendee. The reorganization also placed the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development as a permanent member of the Deputies Committee, while the White House chief strategist was removed.

==Authority and powers==
The National Security Council was established by the National Security Act of 1947 (PL 235 – 61 Stat. 496; U.S.C. 402), amended by the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 579; 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). Later in 1949, as part of the Reorganization Plan, the Council was placed in the Executive Office of the President.

The High Value Detainee Interrogation Group also reports to the NSC.

===Kill authorizations===

One of the tasks of the National Security Council is to determine and identify people, including United States citizens who are deemed to be threats to national security and add them to a &quot;kill list&quot;. In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available. The panel&#x27;s actions are justified by &quot;two principal legal theories&quot;: They &quot;were permitted by Congress when it authorized the use of military forces against militants in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001; and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself.&quot;

Homeland Security Advisor John O. Brennan, who helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the Disposition Matrix database, has described the Obama Administration targeted killing policy by stating that &quot;in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes&quot;.

Reuters reported that Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly.

On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice memo providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa&#x27;ida or associated forces.

==Membership==
The National Security Council, and as per statute and National Security Memorandum–2, is chaired by the president. Its members are the vice president (statutory), the secretary of state (statutory), the secretary of the treasury (statutory), the secretary of defense (statutory), the secretary of energy (statutory), the assistant to the president for national security affairs (non-statutory), the assistant to the president and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (non-statutory), the attorney general (non-statutory), the secretary of homeland security (non-statutory), and the representative of the United States to the United Nations (non-statutory).

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the military advisor to the Council, the director of national intelligence is the intelligence advisor, and the director of national drug control policy is the drug control policy advisor. The chief of staff to the president, White House counsel, and the assistant to the president for economic policy are also regularly invited to attend NSC meetings. The attorney general, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency are invited to attend meetings pertaining to their responsibilities. The heads of other executive departments and agencies, as well as other senior officials, are invited to attend meetings of the NSC when appropriate.

===Principals Committee===
The Principals Committee of the National Security Council is the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for consideration of national security policy issues. The Principals Committee is convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor. The regular attendees of the Principals Committee are the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the White House Chief of Staff, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.

The White House Counsel, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the NSC Executive Secretary may also attend all meetings of the Principals Committee. When considering international economic issues, the Principals Committee&#x27;s regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

===Deputies Committee===
The National Security Council Deputies Committee is the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of national security policy issues. The Deputies Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the interagency national security process including for establishing and directing the Policy Coordination Committees. The Deputies Committee is convened and chaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor or the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor.

Regular members of the Deputies Committee are the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the Deputy Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Invitations to participate in or attend specific meetings are extended to Deputy or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies and to other senior officials when relevant issues are discussed. The Executive Secretary and the Deputy White House Counsel also attend. The relevant Senior Director on the National Security Council staff is also invited to attend when relevant.

===Policy Coordination Committees===
The Policy Coordination Committees of the National Security Council, established and directed by the Deputies Committee, are responsible for the management of the development and implementation of national security policies through interagency coordination. Policy Coordination Committees are the main day-to-day for interagency coordination of national security policy development, implementation and analysis in aide of the Deputies Committee and the Principals Committee. Policy Coordination Committees are chaired by Senior Directors on the National Security Council staff, or sometimes National Economic Council staff, with Assistant Secretary-level officials from the relevant executive department or agency acting as co-chairs.

===Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense===
The Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense was created by Barack Obama in 2016 in response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Its goal was &quot;to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.&quot; The directorate was disbanded when a May 2018 change in organizational structure by John Bolton, Trump&#x27;s recently appointed head of the National Security Council, resulted in the effective elimination of the office then led by Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, Sr. Director for Global Health Security and Biothreats. Remaining staff were moved to other NSC departments, prompting Ziemer&#x27;s resignation, thus completing the elimination of the office.

The responsibilities that formerly belonged to the directorate, along with those of arms control and nonproliferation, and of weapons of mass destruction terrorism, were absorbed into a single new directorate, counterproliferation and biodefense, and assigned to Tim Morrison in July 2018 as director. Morrison characterized the consolidation as part of an overall NSC &quot;reduction of force&quot; and called it &quot;specious&quot; to say the office was &quot;dissolved&quot;, describing the previous size of the organization as &quot;bloat&quot;, and stating &quot;That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017.&quot; Trump defended the 2018 cuts, describing the financial motivation, when questioned in a February 2020 press conference, suggesting that people on a pandemic response team are unnecessary between pandemics, saying &quot;Some of the people we cut, they haven&#x27;t been used for many, many years.&quot; No source of information could be found to support the president&#x27;s statement, likely because the team was created in 2016 and disbanded in 2018. He continued: &quot;And rather than spending the money—and I&#x27;m a business person—I don&#x27;t like having thousands of people around when you don&#x27;t need them.&quot; The size of the team before cuts was estimated at 430 people, but the &quot;thousands&quot; referenced by the president also included reduction in the staff numbers of the CDC.

In January 2021, the directorate was reinstated by President Joe Biden, who appointed Elizabeth Cameron as Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense, a position she had previously held under the Obama administration and briefly under the Trump administration.

=== New members ===
During his presidential transition, President-elect Joe Biden announced the creation of the position of U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, the occupant of which will be a member of the National Security Council.

<text>In mathematics, a permutation of a set can mean one of two different things:
* an arrangement of its members in a sequence or linear order, or
* the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.

An example of the first meaning is the six permutations (orderings) of the set {1, 2, 3}: written as tuples, they are (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). Anagrams of a word whose letters are all different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram reorders them. The study of permutations of finite sets is an important topic in combinatorics and group theory.

Permutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics and in many other fields of science. In computer science, they are used for analyzing sorting algorithms; in quantum physics, for describing states of particles; and in biology, for describing RNA sequences.

The number of permutations of distinct objects is  factorial, usually written as , which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to .

According to the second meaning, a permutation of a set is defined as a bijection from to itself. That is, it is a function from to for which every element occurs exactly once as an image value. Such a function formula_1 is equivalent to the rearrangement of the elements of in which each element &quot;i&quot; is replaced by the corresponding formula_2. For example, the permutation (3, 1, 2) is described by the function formula_3 defined as

: formula_4.

The collection of all permutations of a set form a group called the symmetric group of the set. The group operation is the composition of functions (performing one rearrangement after the other), which results in another function (rearrangement). The properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the elements being permuted, only on their number, so one often considers the standard set formula_5.

In elementary combinatorics, the -permutations, or partial permutations, are the ordered arrangements of distinct elements selected from a set. When is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations in the previous sense.

==History==
Permutation-like objects called hexagrams were used in China in the I Ching (Pinyin: Yi Jing) as early as 1000 BC.

In Greece, Plutarch wrote that Xenocrates of Chalcedon (396–314 BC) discovered the number of different syllables possible in the Greek language. This would have been the first attempt on record to solve a difficult problem in permutations and combinations.

Al-Khalil (717–786), an Arab mathematician and cryptographer, wrote the &quot;Book of Cryptographic Messages&quot;. It contains the first use of permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.

The rule to determine the number of permutations of &quot;n&quot; objects was known in Indian culture around 1150 AD. The &quot;Lilavati&quot; by the Indian mathematician Bhāskara II contains a passage that translates as follows:

The product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.
In 1677, Fabian Stedman described factorials when explaining the number of permutations of bells in change ringing. Starting from two bells: &quot;first, &quot;two&quot; must be admitted to be varied in two ways&quot;, which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1. He then explains that with three bells there are &quot;three times two figures to be produced out of three&quot; which again is illustrated. His explanation involves &quot;cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain&quot;. He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three. Effectively, this is a recursive process. He continues with five bells using the &quot;casting away&quot; method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations. At this point he gives up and remarks:

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;

Stedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.

A first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when Joseph Louis Lagrange, in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the roots of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of Évariste Galois, in Galois theory, which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics, there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.

The study of permutations as substitutions on n elements led to the notion of group as algebraic structure, through the works of Cauchy (1815 memoir).

Permutations played an important role in the cryptanalysis of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used by Nazi Germany during World War II. In particular, one important property of permutations, namely, that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same cycle type, was used by cryptologist Marian Rejewski to break the German Enigma cipher in turn of years 1932-1933.

==Definition==

In mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either formula_6 or formula_7 are used.

A permutation can be defined as a bijection (an invertible mapping, a one-to-one and onto function) from a set to itself: formula_8 The identity permutation is defined by formula_9 for all elements formula_10, and can be denoted by the number formula_11, by formula_12, or by a single 1-cycle (x).

The set of all permutations of a set with &quot;n&quot; elements forms the symmetric group formula_13, where the group operation is composition of functions. Thus for two permutations formula_3 and formula_15 in the group formula_13, their product formula_17 is defined by: formula_18 Composition is usually written without a dot or other sign. In general, composition of two permutations is not commutative: formula_19

As a bijection from a set to itself, a permutation is a function that &quot;performs&quot; a rearrangement of a set, termed an &quot;active permutation&quot; or &quot;substitution&quot;. An older viewpoint sees a permutation as an ordered arrangement or list of all the elements of &quot;S&quot;, called a &quot;passive permutation&quot;. According to this definition, all permutations in are passive. This meaning is subtly distinct from how passive (i.e. &quot;alias&quot;) is used in Active and passive transformation and elsewhere, which would consider all permutations open to passive interpretation (regardless of whether they are in one-line notation, two-line notation, etc.).

A permutation formula_3 can be decomposed into one or more disjoint &quot;cycles&quot; which are the orbits of the cyclic group formula_21 acting on the set &quot;S&quot;. A cycle is found by repeatedly applying the permutation to an element: formula_22, where we assume formula_23 . A cycle consisting of &quot;k&quot; elements is called a &quot;k&quot;-cycle. (See below.)

A fixed point of a permutation formula_3 is an element &quot;x&quot; which is taken to itself, that is formula_25, forming a 1-cycle formula_26. A permutation with no fixed points is called a derangement. A permutation exchanging two elements (a single 2-cycle) and leaving the others fixed is called a transposition.

==Notations==
 Several notations are widely used to represent permutations conveniently. &quot;Cycle notation&quot; is a popular choice, as it is compact and shows the permutation&#x27;s structure clearly. This article will use cycle notation unless otherwise specified.

===Two-line notation===
Cauchy&#x27;s &quot;two-line notation&quot; lists the elements of &quot;S&quot; in the first row, and the image of each element below it in the second row. For example, the permutation of &quot;S&quot; = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} given by the functionformula_27can be written as
: formula_28
The elements of &quot;S&quot; may appear in any order in the first row, so this permutation could also be written:
: formula_29

===One-line notation===
If there is a &quot;natural&quot; order for the elements of &quot;S&quot;, say formula_30, then one uses this for the first row of the two-line notation:
: formula_31

Under this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in &quot;one-line notation&quot; as
: formula_32,
that is, as an ordered arrangement of the elements of &quot;S&quot;. Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the cycle notation described below: a common usage is to omit parentheses or other enclosing marks for one-line notation, while using parentheses for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the &quot;word representation&quot;.

The example above would then be:formula_33 (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.)

This compact form is common in elementary combinatorics and computer science. It is especially useful in applications where the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller using lexicographic order.

===Cycle notation===
Cycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set &quot;S&quot;, with an orbit being called a &quot;cycle&quot;. The permutation is written as a list of cycles; since distinct cycles involve disjoint sets of elements, this is referred to as &quot;decomposition into disjoint cycles&quot;.

To write down the permutation formula_3 in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:

# Write an opening bracket followed by an arbitrary element &quot;x&quot; of formula_35: formula_36
# Trace the orbit of &quot;x&quot;, writing down the values under successive applications of formula_3: formula_38
# Repeat until the value returns to &quot;x,&quot; and close the parenthesis without repeating &quot;x&quot;: formula_39
# Continue with an element &quot;y&quot; of &quot;S&quot; which was not yet written, and repeat the above process: formula_40
# Repeat until all elements of &quot;S&quot; are written in cycles.

Also, it is common to omit 1-cycles, since these can be inferred: for any element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot; not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes formula_41.

Following the convention of omitting 1-cycles, one may interpret an individual cycle as a permutation which fixes all the elements not in the cycle (a cyclic permutation having only one cycle of length greater than 1). Then the list of disjoint cycles can be seen as the composition of these cyclic permutations. For example, the one-line permutation formula_42 can be written in cycle notation as:formula_43This may be seen as the composition formula_44 of cyclic permutations:formula_45 While permutations in general do not commute, disjoint cycles do; for example:formula_46Also, each cycle can be rewritten from a different starting point; for example,formula_47Thus one may write the disjoint cycles of a given permutation in many different ways.

A convenient feature of cycle notation is that inverting the permutation is given by reversing the order of the elements in each cycle. For example, formula_48

=== Canonical cycle notation ===
In some combinatorial contexts it is useful to fix a certain order for the elements in the cycles and of the (disjoint) cycles themselves. Miklós Bóna calls the following ordering choices the &quot;canonical cycle notation:&quot;
* in each cycle the &quot;largest&quot; element is listed first
* the cycles are sorted in &quot;increasing&quot; order of their first element, not omitting 1-cycles

For example, formula_49 is a permutation of formula_50 in canonical cycle notation.

Richard Stanley calls this the &quot;standard representation&quot; of a permutation, and Martin Aigner uses &quot;standard form&quot;. Sergey Kitaev also uses the &quot;standard form&quot; terminology, but reverses both choices; that is, each cycle lists its minimal element first, and the cycles are sorted in decreasing order of their minimal elements.

===Composition of permutations===
There are two ways to denote the composition of two permutations. In the most common notation, formula_51 is the function that maps any element &quot;x&quot; to formula_52. The rightmost permutation is applied to the argument first,
because the argument is written to the right of the function.

A &quot;different&quot; rule for multiplying permutations comes from writing the argument to the left of the function, so that the leftmost permutation acts first.
In this notation, the permutation is often written as an exponent, so &quot;σ&quot; acting on &quot;x&quot; is written &quot;x&quot;&quot;σ&quot;; then the product is defined by formula_53. This article uses the first definition, where the rightmost permutation is applied first.

The function composition operation satisfies the axioms of a group. It is associative, meaning formula_54, and products of more than two permutations are usually written without parentheses. The composition operation also has an identity element (the identity permutation formula_55), and each permutation formula_3 has an inverse formula_57 (its inverse function) with formula_58.

==Other uses of the term &quot;permutation&quot;==
The concept of a permutation as an ordered arrangement admits several generalizations that have been called &quot;permutations&quot;, especially in older literature.

===&quot;k&quot;-permutations of &quot;n&quot;===
In older literature and elementary textbooks, a k&quot;-permutation of &quot;n (sometimes called a partial permutation, sequence without repetition, variation, or arrangement) means an ordered arrangement (list) of a &quot;k&quot;-element subset of an &quot;n&quot;-set. The number of such &quot;k&quot;-permutations (&quot;k&quot;-arrangements) of formula_59 is denoted variously by such symbols as formula_60, formula_61, formula_62, formula_63, formula_64, or formula_65, computed by the formula:
: formula_66,

which is 0 when , and otherwise is equal to
: formula_67

The product is well defined without the assumption that formula_59 is a non-negative integer, and is of importance outside combinatorics as well; it is known as the Pochhammer symbol formula_69 or as the formula_70-th falling factorial power formula_71:formula_72This usage of the term &quot;permutation&quot; is closely associated with the term &quot;combination&quot; to mean a subset. A &quot;k-combination&quot; of a set &quot;S&quot; is a &quot;k-&quot;element subset of &quot;S&quot;: the elements of a combination are not ordered. Ordering the &quot;k&quot;-combinations of &quot;S&quot; in all possible ways produces the &quot;k&quot;-permutations of &quot;S&quot;. The number of &quot;k&quot;-combinations of an &quot;n&quot;-set, &quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;), is therefore related to the number of &quot;k&quot;-permutations of &quot;n&quot; by:
: formula_73

These numbers are also known as binomial coefficients, usually denoted formula_74:formula_75

===Permutations with repetition===
Ordered arrangements of &quot;k&quot; elements of a set &quot;S&quot;, where repetition is allowed, are called &quot;k&quot;-tuples. They have sometimes been referred to as permutations with repetition, although they are not permutations in the usual sense. They are also called words or strings over the alphabet &quot;S&quot;. If the set &quot;S&quot; has &quot;n&quot; elements, the number of &quot;k&quot;-tuples over &quot;S&quot; is formula_76

===Permutations of multisets===
If &quot;M&quot; is a finite multiset, then a multiset permutation is an ordered arrangement of elements of &quot;M&quot; in which each element appears a number of times equal exactly to its multiplicity in &quot;M&quot;. An anagram of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation. If the multiplicities of the elements of &quot;M&quot; (taken in some order) are formula_77, formula_78, ..., formula_79 and their sum (that is, the size of &quot;M&quot;) is &quot;n&quot;, then the number of multiset permutations of &quot;M&quot; is given by the multinomial coefficient,
:formula_80

For example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:
:formula_81.

A &quot;k&quot;-permutation of a multiset &quot;M&quot; is a sequence of &quot;k&quot; elements of &quot;M&quot; in which each element appears &quot;a number of times less than or equal to&quot; its multiplicity in &quot;M&quot; (an element&#x27;s &quot;repetition number&quot;).

===Circular permutations===

Permutations, when considered as arrangements, are sometimes referred to as &quot;linearly ordered&quot; arrangements. If, however, the objects are arranged in a circular manner this distinguished ordering is weakened: there is no &quot;first element&quot; in the arrangement, as any element can be considered as the start. An arrangement of distinct objects in a circular manner is called a circular permutation. These can be formally defined as equivalence classes of ordinary permutations of these objects, for the equivalence relation generated by moving the final element of the linear arrangement to its front.

Two circular permutations are equivalent if one can be rotated into the other. The following four circular permutations on four letters are considered to be the same.

The circular arrangements are to be read counter-clockwise, so the following two are not equivalent since no rotation can bring one to the other.
There are (&quot;n&quot; – 1)! circular permutations of a set with &quot;n&quot; elements.

==Properties==
The number of permutations of distinct objects is !.

The number of -permutations with disjoint cycles is the signless Stirling number of the first kind, denoted formula_82 or formula_83.

===Cycle type===

The cycles (including the fixed points) of a permutation formula_3 of a set with elements partition that set; so the lengths of these cycles form an integer partition of , which is called the cycle type (or sometimes cycle structure or cycle shape) of formula_3. There is a &quot;1&quot; in the cycle type for every fixed point of formula_3, a &quot;2&quot; for every transposition, and so on. The cycle type of formula_87 is formula_88

This may also be written in a more compact form as .
More precisely, the general form is formula_89, where formula_90 are the numbers of cycles of respective length. The number of permutations of a given cycle type is
: formula_91.

The number of cycle types of a set with elements equals the value of the partition function formula_92.

Polya&#x27;s cycle index polynomial is a generating function which counts permutations by their cycle type.

===Conjugating permutations===
In general, composing permutations written in cycle notation follows no easily described pattern – the cycles of the composition can be different from those being composed. However the cycle type is preserved in the special case of conjugating a permutation formula_3 by another permutation formula_94, which means forming the product formula_95. Here, formula_95 is the &quot;conjugate&quot; of formula_3 by formula_94 and its cycle notation can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for formula_3 and applying formula_94 to all the entries in it. It follows that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same cycle type.

===Order of a permutation===
The order of a permutation formula_3 is the smallest positive integer &quot;m&quot; so that formula_102. It is the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles. For example, the order of formula_103 is formula_104.

===Parity of a permutation===
Every permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of transpositions.
Although many such expressions for a given permutation may exist, either they all contain an even number of transpositions or they all contain an odd number of transpositions. Thus all permutations can be classified as even or odd depending on this number.

This result can be extended so as to assign a &quot;sign&quot;, written formula_105, to each permutation. formula_106 if formula_3 is even and formula_108 if formula_3 is odd. Then for two permutations formula_3 and formula_94

: formula_112

It follows that formula_113

The sign of a permutation is equal to the determinant of its permutation matrix (below).

===Matrix representation===
A &quot;permutation matrix&quot; is an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix that has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and all other entries are 0. There are several ways to assign a permutation matrix to a permutation of {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;}. One natural approach is to define formula_114 to be the linear transformation of formula_115 which permutes the standard basis formula_116 by formula_117, and define formula_118 to be its matrix. That is, formula_118 has its &quot;j&quot;th column equal to the n × 1 column vector formula_120: its (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) entry is to 1 if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;j&quot;), and 0 otherwise. Since composition of linear mappings is described by matrix multiplication, it follows that this construction is compatible with composition of permutations:formula_121. For example, the one-line permutations formula_122 have product formula_123, and the corresponding matrices are:formula_124
It is also common in the literature to find the inverse convention, where a permutation &quot;σ&quot; is associated to the matrix formula_125 whose (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) entry is 1 if &quot;j&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) and is 0 otherwise. In this convention, permutation matrices multiply in the opposite order from permutations, that is, formula_126. In this correspondence, permutation matrices act on the right side of the standard formula_127 row vectors formula_128: formula_129.

The Cayley table on the right shows these matrices for permutations of 3 elements.

==Permutations of totally ordered sets==
In some applications, the elements of the set being permuted will be compared with each other. This requires that the set &quot;S&quot; has a total order so that any two elements can be compared. The set {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} with the usual ≤ relation is the most frequently used set in these applications.

A number of properties of a permutation are directly related to the total ordering of &quot;S,&quot; considering the permutation written in one-line notation as a sequence formula_130.

===Ascents, descents, runs, exceedances, records===

An &quot;ascent&quot; of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; of &quot;n&quot; is any position &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; where the following value is bigger than the current one. That is, &quot;i&quot; is an ascent if formula_131. For example, the permutation 3452167 has ascents (at positions) 1, 2, 5, and 6.

Similarly, a &quot;descent&quot; is a position &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; with formula_132, so every &quot;i&quot; with formula_133 is either an ascent or a descent.

An &quot;ascending run&quot; of a permutation is a nonempty increasing contiguous subsequence that cannot be extended at either end; it corresponds to a maximal sequence of successive ascents (the latter may be empty: between two successive descents there is still an ascending run of length 1). By contrast an &quot;increasing subsequence&quot; of a permutation is not necessarily contiguous: it is an increasing sequence obtained by omitting some of the values of the one-line notation.
For example, the permutation 2453167 has the ascending runs 245, 3, and 167, while it has an increasing subsequence 2367.

If a permutation has &quot;k&quot; − 1 descents, then it must be the union of &quot;k&quot; ascending runs.

The number of permutations of &quot;n&quot; with &quot;k&quot; ascents is (by definition) the Eulerian number formula_134; this is also the number of permutations of &quot;n&quot; with &quot;k&quot; descents. Some authors however define the Eulerian number formula_134 as the number of permutations with &quot;k&quot; ascending runs, which corresponds to descents.

An exceedance of a permutation &quot;σ&quot;1&quot;σ&quot;2...&quot;σ&quot;&quot;n&quot; is an index &quot;j&quot; such that . If the inequality is not strict (that is, ), then &quot;j&quot; is called a &quot;weak exceedance&quot;. The number of &quot;n&quot;-permutations with &quot;k&quot; exceedances coincides with the number of &quot;n&quot;-permutations with &quot;k&quot; descents.

A &quot;record&quot; or &quot;left-to-right maximum&quot; of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; is an element &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) &lt; &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) for all &quot;j &lt; i&quot;.

=== Foata&#x27;s transition lemma ===
Foata&#x27;s &quot;fundamental bijection&quot; transforms a permutation with a given canonical cycle form into the permutation formula_136 whose one-line notation has the same sequence of elements with parentheses removed. For example:
formula_137

formula_138

Here the first element in each canonical cycle of becomes a record (left-to-right maximum) of formula_139. Given formula_139, one may find its records and insert parentheses to construct the inverse transformation formula_141. Underlining the records in the above example: formula_142, which allows the reconstruction of the cycles of .

The following table shows formula_143 and for the six permutations of &quot;S&quot; = {1, 2, 3}, with the bold text on each side showing the notation used in the bijection: one-line notation for formula_143 and canonical cycle notation for .

formula_145
As a first corollary, the number of &quot;n&quot;-permutations with exactly &quot;k&quot; records is equal to the number of &quot;n&quot;-permutations with exactly &quot;k&quot; cycles: this last number is the signless Stirling number of the first kind, formula_146. Furthermore, Foata&#x27;s mapping takes an &quot;n&quot;-permutation with &quot;k&quot; weak exceedances to an &quot;n&quot;-permutation with ascents. For example, (2)(31) = 321 has &quot;k =&quot; 2 weak exceedances (at index 1 and 2), whereas has ascent (at index 1; that is, from 2 to 3).

===Inversions===

An &quot;inversion&quot; of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; is a pair of positions where the entries of a permutation are in the opposite order: formula_147 and formula_148. Thus a descent is an inversion at two adjacent positions. For example, has (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) = (1, 3), (2, 3), and (4, 5), where (&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;), &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;j&quot;)) = (2, 1), (3, 1), and (5, 4).

Sometimes an inversion is defined as the pair of values (&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;), &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;j&quot;)); this makes no difference for the &quot;number&quot; of inversions, and the reverse pair (&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;j&quot;), &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)) is an inversion in the above sense for the inverse permutation &quot;σ&quot;−1.

The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree to which the entries of a permutation are out of order; it is the same for &quot;σ&quot; and for &quot;σ&quot;−1. To bring a permutation with &quot;k&quot; inversions into order (that is, transform it into the identity permutation), by successively applying (right-multiplication by) adjacent transpositions, is always possible and requires a sequence of &quot;k&quot; such operations. Moreover, any reasonable choice for the adjacent transpositions will work: it suffices to choose at each step a transposition of &quot;i&quot; and where &quot;i&quot; is a descent of the permutation as modified so far (so that the transposition will remove this particular descent, although it might create other descents). This is so because applying such a transposition reduces the number of inversions by 1; as long as this number is not zero, the permutation is not the identity, so it has at least one descent. Bubble sort and insertion sort can be interpreted as particular instances of this procedure to put a sequence into order. Incidentally this procedure proves that any permutation &quot;σ&quot; can be written as a product of adjacent transpositions; for this one may simply reverse any sequence of such transpositions that transforms &quot;σ&quot; into the identity. In fact, by enumerating all sequences of adjacent transpositions that would transform &quot;σ&quot; into the identity, one obtains (after reversal) a &quot;complete&quot; list of all expressions of minimal length writing &quot;σ&quot; as a product of adjacent transpositions.

The number of permutations of &quot;n&quot; with &quot;k&quot; inversions is expressed by a Mahonian number. This is the coefficient of formula_149 in the expansion of the product

formula_150

The notation formula_151 denotes the q-factorial. This expansion commonly appears in the study of necklaces.

==Permutations in computing==
===Numbering permutations===

One way to represent permutations of &quot;n&quot; things is by an integer &quot;N&quot; with 0 ≤ &quot;N&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;!, provided convenient methods are given to convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when &quot;n&quot; is small enough that &quot;N&quot; can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means &quot;n&quot; ≤ 12, and for 64-bit words this means &quot;n&quot; ≤ 20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, ..., &quot;d&quot;2, &quot;d&quot;1, where &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a non-negative integer less than &quot;i&quot; (one may omit &quot;d&quot;1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express &quot;N&quot; in the &quot;factorial number system&quot;, which is just a particular mixed radix representation, where, for numbers less than &quot;n&quot;!, the bases (place values or multiplication factors) for successive digits are , , ..., 2!, 1!. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.
In the Lehmer code for a permutation &quot;σ&quot;, the number &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; represents the choice made for the first term &quot;σ&quot;1, the number &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 represents the choice made for the second term
&quot;σ&quot;2 among the remaining elements of the set, and so forth. More precisely, each &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;i&quot; gives the number of &quot;remaining&quot; elements strictly less than the term &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Since those remaining elements are bound to turn up as some later term &quot;σ&quot;&quot;j&quot;, the digit &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;i&quot; counts the &quot;inversions&quot; (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) involving &quot;i&quot; as smaller index (the number of values &quot;j&quot; for which &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;σ&quot;&quot;j&quot;). The inversion table for &quot;σ&quot; is quite similar, but here &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;k&quot; counts the number of inversions (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) where &quot;k&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;&quot;j&quot; occurs as the smaller of the two values appearing in inverted order.

Both encodings can be visualized by an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; Rothe diagram (named after Heinrich August Rothe) in which dots at (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;) mark the entries of the permutation, and a cross at (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;&quot;j&quot;) marks the inversion (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;); by the definition of inversions a cross appears in any square that comes both before the dot (&quot;j&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;&quot;j&quot;) in its column, and before the dot (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;) in its row. The Lehmer code lists the numbers of crosses in successive rows, while the inversion table lists the numbers of crosses in successive columns; it is just the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation, and vice versa.

To effectively convert a Lehmer code &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, ..., &quot;d&quot;2, &quot;d&quot;1 into a permutation of an ordered set &quot;S&quot;, one can start with a list of the elements of &quot;S&quot; in increasing order, and for &quot;i&quot; increasing from 1 to &quot;n&quot; set &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot; to the element in the list that is preceded by &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;i&quot; other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, ..., &quot;d&quot;2, &quot;d&quot;1 into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from &quot;d&quot;1 to &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; while inserting the elements of &quot;S&quot; from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number &quot;d&quot; from the inversion table, the element from &quot;S&quot; inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by &quot;d&quot; elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of &quot;S&quot; both in the opposite order, starting with a row of &quot;n&quot; empty slots, and at each step place the element from &quot;S&quot; into the empty slot that is preceded by &quot;d&quot; other empty slots.

Converting successive natural numbers to the factorial number system produces those sequences in lexicographic order (as is the case with any mixed radix number system), and further converting them to permutations preserves the lexicographic ordering, provided the Lehmer code interpretation is used (using inversion tables, one gets a different ordering, where one starts by comparing permutations by the &quot;place&quot; of their entries 1 rather than by the value of their first entries). The sum of the numbers in the factorial number system representation gives the number of inversions of the permutation, and the parity of that sum gives the signature of the permutation. Moreover, the positions of the zeroes in the inversion table give the values of left-to-right maxima of the permutation (in the example 6, 8, 9) while the positions of the zeroes in the Lehmer code are the positions of the right-to-left minima (in the example positions the 4, 8, 9 of the values 1, 2, 5); this allows computing the distribution of such extrema among all permutations. A permutation with Lehmer code &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, ..., &quot;d&quot;2, &quot;d&quot;1 has an ascent if and only if .

===Algorithms to generate permutations===
In computing it may be required to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.

An obvious way to generate permutations of &quot;n&quot; is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to &quot;n&quot;!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires &quot;n&quot; operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about &quot;n&quot;2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With &quot;n&quot; likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time.

====Random generation of permutations====

For generating random permutations of a given sequence of &quot;n&quot; values, it makes no difference whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of &quot;n&quot; to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of &quot;n&quot; that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large &quot;n&quot; due to the growth of the number &quot;n&quot;!, there is no reason to assume that &quot;n&quot; will be small for random generation.

The basic idea to generate a random permutation is to generate at random one of the &quot;n&quot;! sequences of integers &quot;d&quot;1,&quot;d&quot;2...,&quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; satisfying (since &quot;d&quot;1 is always zero it may be omitted) and to convert it to a permutation through a bijective correspondence. For the latter correspondence one could interpret the (reverse) sequence as a Lehmer code, and this gives a generation method first published in 1938 by Ronald Fisher and Frank Yates.
While at the time computer implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; to select an element among &quot;i&quot; remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of &quot;i&quot;), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one swaps the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, even though they may not occur in the same order as they did in the original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate induction. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.

The resulting algorithm for generating a random permutation of codice_1 can be described as follows in pseudocode:

 for &quot;i&quot; from &quot;n&quot; downto 2 do
 &quot;di&quot; ← random element of { 0, ..., &quot;i&quot; − 1 }
 swap &quot;a&quot;[&quot;di&quot;] and &quot;a&quot;[&quot;i&quot; − 1]

This can be combined with the initialization of the array codice_2 as follows

 for &quot;i&quot; from 0 to &quot;n&quot;−1 do
 &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 ← random element of { 0, ..., &quot;i&quot; }
 &quot;a&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] ← &quot;a&quot;[&quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1]
 &quot;a&quot;[&quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1] ← &quot;i&quot;

If &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 = &quot;i&quot;, the first assignment will copy an uninitialized value, but the second will overwrite it with the correct value &quot;i&quot;.

However, Fisher-Yates is not the fastest algorithm for generating a permutation, because Fisher-Yates is essentially a sequential algorithm and &quot;divide and conquer&quot; procedures can achieve the same result in parallel.

====Generation in lexicographic order====
There are many ways to systematically generate all permutations of a given sequence.
One classic, simple, and flexible algorithm is based upon finding the next permutation in lexicographic ordering, if it exists. It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates each distinct multiset permutation once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the factorial number system) and converting those to permutations. It begins by sorting the sequence in (weakly) increasing order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found. The method goes back to Narayana Pandita in 14th century India, and has been rediscovered frequently.

The following algorithm generates the next permutation lexicographically after a given permutation. It changes the given permutation in-place.

# Find the largest index &quot;k&quot; such that . If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.
# Find the largest index &quot;l&quot; greater than &quot;k&quot; such that .
# Swap the value of &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] with that of &quot;a&quot;[&quot;l&quot;].
# Reverse the sequence from &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + 1] up to and including the final element &quot;a&quot;[&quot;n&quot;].
For example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that the index is zero-based, the steps are as follows:
# Index &quot;k&quot; = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + 1] which is 4.
# Index &quot;l&quot; = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in order to satisfy the condition &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] &lt; &quot;a&quot;[&quot;l&quot;].
# The values of &quot;a&quot;[2] and &quot;a&quot;[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1, 2, 4, 3].
# The sequence after &quot;k&quot;-index &quot;a&quot;[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1, 2, 4, 3].
Following this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be [1, 3, 2, 4], and the 24th permutation will be [4, 3, 2, 1] at which point &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] &lt; &quot;a&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + 1] does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.

This method uses about 3 comparisons and 1.5 swaps per permutation, amortized over the whole sequence, not counting the initial sort.

====Generation with minimal changes====

An alternative to the above algorithm, the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm, generates an ordering on all the permutations of a given sequence with the property that any two consecutive permutations in its output differ by swapping two adjacent values. This ordering on the permutations was known to 17th-century English bell ringers, among whom it was known as &quot;plain changes&quot;. One advantage of this method is that the small amount of change from one permutation to the next allows the method to be implemented in constant time per permutation. The same can also easily generate the subset of even permutations, again in constant time per permutation, by skipping every other output permutation.

An alternative to Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter is Heap&#x27;s algorithm, said by Robert Sedgewick in 1977 to be the fastest algorithm of generating permutations in applications.

The following figure shows the output of all three aforementioned algorithms for generating all permutations of length formula_159, and of six additional algorithms described in the literature.
# Lexicographic ordering;
# Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm;
# Heap&#x27;s algorithm;
# Ehrlich&#x27;s star-transposition algorithm: in each step, the first entry of the permutation is exchanged with a later entry;
# Zaks&#x27; prefix reversal algorithm: in each step, a prefix of the current permutation is reversed to obtain the next permutation;
# Sawada-Williams&#x27; algorithm: each permutation differs from the previous one either by a cyclic left-shift by one position, or an exchange of the first two entries;
# Corbett&#x27;s algorithm: each permutation differs from the previous one by a cyclic left-shift of some prefix by one position;
# Single-track ordering: each column is a cyclic shift of the other columns;
# Single-track Gray code: each column is a cyclic shift of the other columns, plus any two consecutive permutations differ only in one or two transpositions.
# Nested swaps generating algorithm in steps connected to the nested subgroups formula_160. Each permutation is obtained from the previous by a transposition multiplication to the left. Algorithm is connected to the Factorial_number_system of the index.

====Generation of permutations in nested swap steps====
Explicit sequence of swaps (transpositions, 2-cycles formula_161), is described here, each swap applied (on the left) to the previous chain providing a new permutation, such that all the permutations can be retrieved, each only once. This counting/generating procedure has an additional structure (call it nested), as it is given in steps: after completely retrieving formula_162, continue retrieving formula_163 by cosets formula_164 of formula_162 in formula_166, by appropriately choosing the coset representatives formula_167 to be described below. Since each formula_168 is sequentially generated, there is a &quot;last element&quot; formula_169. So, after generating formula_162 by swaps, the next permutation in formula_163 has to be formula_172 for some formula_173. Then all swaps that generated formula_162 are repeated, generating the whole coset formula_175, reaching the last permutation in that coset formula_176; the next swap has to move the permutation to representative of another coset formula_177. 

Continuing the same way, one gets coset representatives formula_178 for the cosets of formula_162 in formula_166; the ordered set formula_181 (formula_182) is called the set of coset beginnings. Two of these representatives are in the same coset if and only if formula_183, that is, formula_184. Concluding, permutations formula_185 are all representatives of distinct cosets if and only if for any formula_186, formula_187 (no repeat condition). In particular, for all generated permutations to be distinct it is not necessary for the formula_188 values to be distinct. In the process, one gets that formula_189 and this provides the recursion procedure. 

EXAMPLES: obviously, for formula_190 one has formula_191; to build formula_192 there are only two possibilities for the coset beginnings satisfying the no repeat condition; the choice formula_193 leads to formula_194. To continue generating formula_195 one needs appropriate coset beginnings (satisfying the no repeat condition): there is a convenient choice: formula_196, leading to formula_197. Then, to build formula_198 a convenient choice for the coset beginnings (satisfying the no repeat condition) is formula_199, leading to formula_200. 

From examples above one can inductively go to higher formula_70 in a similar way, choosing coset beginnings of formula_202 in formula_203, as follows: for formula_70 even choosing all coset beginnings equal to 1 and for formula_70 odd choosing coset beginnings equal to formula_206. With such choices the &quot;last&quot; permutation is formula_207 for formula_70 odd and formula_209 for formula_70 even (formula_211). Using these explicit formulae one can easily compute the permutation of certain index in the counting/generation steps with minimum computation. For this, writing the index in factorial base is useful. For example, the permutation for index formula_212 is: formula_213 formula_214formula_215, yelding finally, formula_216.

Because multiplying by swap permutation takes short computing time and every new generated permutation requires only one such swap multiplication, this generation procedure is quite efficient. Moreover as there is a simple formula, having the last permutation in each formula_166 can save even more time to go directly to a permutation with certain index in fewer steps than expected as it can be done in blocks of subgroups rather than swap by swap.

===Applications===
Permutations are used in the interleaver component of the error detection and correction algorithms, such as turbo codes, for example 3GPP Long Term Evolution mobile telecommunication standard uses these ideas (see 3GPP technical specification 36.212).
Such applications raise the question of fast generation of permutations satisfying certain desirable properties. One of the methods is based on the permutation polynomials. Also as a base for optimal hashing in Unique Permutation Hashing.

<text>The assistant to the president for national security affairs (APNSA), commonly referred to as the national security advisor (NSA), is a senior aide in the Executive Office of the President, based at the West Wing of the White House.

The national security advisor serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States on all national security issues. The national security advisor participates in meetings of the National Security Council (NSC) and usually chairs meetings of the principals committee of the NSC with the secretary of state and secretary of defense (those meetings not attended by the president). The NSA also sits on the Homeland Security Council (HSC). The national security advisor is supported by NSC staff who produce classified research and briefings for the national security advisor to review and present, either to the NSC or the president.

The national security advisor is appointed by the president and does not require confirmation by the United States Senate. An appointment of a three- or four-star general to the role requires Senate confirmation to maintain that rank in the new position.

==Role==
The influence and role of the national security advisor varies from administration to administration and depends not only on the qualities of the person appointed to the position, but also on the style and management philosophy of the incumbent president. ideally, the national security advisor serves as an honest broker of policy options for the president in the field of national security, rather than as an advocate for his or her own policy agenda.

The national security advisor is a staff position in the Executive Office of the President and does not have line or budget authority over either the Department of State or the Department of Defense, unlike the secretary of state and the secretary of defense, who are Senate-confirmed officials with statutory authority over their departments. The national security advisor is able to offer daily advice (due to the proximity) to the president independently of the vested interests of the large bureaucracies and clientele of those departments.

In times of crisis, the national security advisor is likely to operate from the White House Situation Room or the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (as on September 11, 2001), updating the president on the latest events in a crisis situation.

==History==

The National Security Council was created at the start of the Cold War under the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate defense, foreign affairs, international economic policy, and intelligence; this was part of a large reorganization that saw the creation of the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. The Act did not create the position of the national security advisor per se, but it did create an executive secretary in charge of the staff. In 1949, the NSC became part of the Executive Office of the President.

Robert Cutler was the first national security advisor in 1953, and held the job twice, both times during the Eisenhower administration. The system has remained largely unchanged since then, particularly since President John Kennedy, with powerful national security advisors and strong staff but a lower importance given to formal NSC meetings. This continuity persists despite the tendency of each new president to replace the advisor and senior NSC staff.

President Richard Nixon&#x27;s national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, enhanced the importance of the role, controlling the flow of information to the president and meeting with him multiple times per day. Kissinger also holds the distinction of serving as national security advisor and secretary of state at the same time from September 22, 1973, until November 3, 1975. He holds the record for longest term of service (2,478 days); Michael Flynn holds the record for shortest term, at just 24 days.

Brent Scowcroft held the job in two non-consecutive administrations: the Ford administration and the George H. W. Bush administration.
