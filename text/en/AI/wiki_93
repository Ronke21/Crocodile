<text>Amélie (, , ) is a 2001 French-language romantic comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre. It tells the story of Amélie Poulain, played by Audrey Tautou, a shy and quirky waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better while dealing with her own isolation. The film features an ensemble cast of supporting roles, including Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Lorella Cravotta, Serge Merlin, Jamel Debbouze, Claire Maurier, Clotilde Mollet, Isabelle Nanty, Dominique Pinon, Artus de Penguern, Yolande Moreau, Urbain Cancelier, and Maurice Bénichou.

&quot;Amélie&quot; was released theatrically in France on 25 April 2001 by UGC-Fox Distribution and in Germany on 16 August 2001 by Prokino Filmverleih. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with major praise for Tautou&#x27;s performance, the cinematography, visuals, production design, sound design, editing, musical score, writing and Jeunet&#x27;s direction. &quot;Amélie&quot; won Best Film at the European Film Awards, four César Awards, including Best Film and Best Director, and two British Academy Film Awards, including Best Original Screenplay. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay. The film was an enormous commercial success, grossing $174.2 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, and is one of the biggest international successes for a French film.

==Plot==
Amélie Poulain is born in 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who – incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect – decide to homeschool her. To cope with her loneliness, Amélie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Amélie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father, Raphaël, withdraws more and more from society. Amélie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking crème brûlée with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin.

On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Amélie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Amélie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.

After asking the apartment&#x27;s concierge and several old tenants about the boy&#x27;s identity, Amélie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s 1881 painting &quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot; every year. He recalls the boy&#x27;s name as &quot;Bretodeau&quot;. Amélie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Amélie happily embarks on her new mission.

Amélie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the Métro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the café. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays practical jokes on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand.

Dufayel, having observed Amélie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Amélie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Amélie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Amélie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Amélie retrieves it.

Amélie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Amélie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Amélie&#x27;s well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph&#x27;s comment about this misleads Amélie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel&#x27;s insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Amélie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself.

==Cast==
==Production==
In his DVD commentary, Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Amélie for the English actress Emily Watson. In that first draft, Amélie&#x27;s father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson&#x27;s French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress. Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for the 1999 film &quot;Venus Beauty Institute&quot;.

Filming took place mainly in Paris. The Café des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Amélie works is a real place. Principal photography took place from 2 March 2000 to 7 July 2000.

The filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery (including computer animation) and a digital intermediate. The studio scenes were filmed in the MMC Studios Coloneum in Cologne (Germany). The film shares many of the themes in its plot with the second half of the 1994 film &quot;Chungking Express&quot;.

==Release==

The film was released in France, Belgium, and French-speaking western Switzerland in April 2001, with subsequent screenings at various film festivals followed by releases around the world. It received limited releases in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australasia later in 2001.

Cannes Film Festival selector Gilles Jacob described &quot;Amélie&quot; as &quot;uninteresting&quot;, and therefore it was not screened at the festival, although the version he viewed was an early cut without music. The absence of &quot;Amélie&quot; at the festival caused something of a controversy because of the warm welcome by the French media and audience in contrast with the reaction of the selector. David Martin-Jones, in an article in &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot;, stated that the film &quot;[wears] its national [French] identity on its sleeve&quot; and that this attracted both audiences of mainstream films and those of arthouse ones.

===Subsequent re-releases===
In 2021, Newen Connect&#x27;s TF1 Studio signed a deal with UGC for international distribution and sales rights to its films, including &quot;Amélie&quot;. The film was then re-released in multiple countries for its 20th anniversary, including on 11 May 2021 in Italy, by BIM Distribuzione.

In February 2022, while discussing the legacy of &quot;Amélie&quot; in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeunet stated that U.S. distribution rights to the film, previously held by Miramax Zoë, had been acquired by Sony Pictures Classics, with the company planning a re-release in the future. While the distributor did confirm this news, no further developments were reported until late December 2023, when Sony announced their acquisition of distribution rights to the film for North America excluding French Canada and scheduled the film for a theatrical re-release in 250 theatres in the United States on 14 February 2024.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;The feel-good &quot;Amélie&quot; is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally positive&quot; reviews.

Alan Morrison from &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave &quot;Amélie&quot; five stars and called it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best, with crossover potential along the lines of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1990) and &quot;Il Postino&quot; (1994). Given its quirky heart, it might well surpass them all&quot;. Paul Tatara of &quot;CNN&quot; praised &quot;Amélie&quot;″s playful nature. In his review, he wrote, &quot;Its whimsical, free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour, in particular, is brimming with amiable, sardonic laughs.&quot;

The film was attacked by critic Serge Kaganski of &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; for an unrealistic and picturesque vision of a bygone French society with few ethnic minorities. Jeunet dismissed the criticism by pointing out that the photo collection contains pictures of people from numerous ethnic backgrounds, and that Jamel Debbouze, who plays Lucien, is of Moroccan descent.

===Box office===
The film opened on 432 screens in France and grossed 43.2 million French Franc ($6.2 million) in its opening week, placing it at number one. It stayed in the top 10 for 22 weeks. It was the highest-grossing film in France for the year with a gross of $41 million. The film also grossed $33 million in the United States and Canada theatrically, making it the highest-grossing French-language film of all time in North America.

===Accolades===

&quot;Amélie&quot; was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. The film placed No. 2 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked it second on its list of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000–2009). In August 2016, &quot;BBC Magazine&quot; conducted a poll on the 21st century&#x27;s 100 greatest films so far, with &quot;Amélie&quot; ranking at number 87.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the film poster one of the best on its list of the top 25 film posters in the past 25 years. It also named Amélie setting up a wild goose chase for her beloved Nino all through Paris as No. 9 on its list of top 25 Romantic Gestures. In 2010, an online public poll by the &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; – the house journal of the American Society of Cinematographers – named &quot;Amélie&quot; the best shot film of the decade.

&quot;Amélie&quot; is rated 37 among the 50 Greatest Romantic Comedies of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to &quot;Amélie&quot; was composed by Yann Tiersen.

==Musical adaptation==
On 23 August 2013, composer Dan Messe, one of the founders and members of the band Hem, confirmed speculation that he would be writing the score for a musical adaptation of &quot;Amélie&quot;, collaborating with Craig Lucas and Nathan Tysen. Messe also confirmed he would be composing all original music for the show and not using the Yann Tiersen score. The musical adaptation premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theater in August 2015. It opened on Broadway in March 2017 and closed in May 2017. The production started its pre-Broadway engagement at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in December 2016, with Phillipa Soo in the title role. A London production opened in 2020, with Australian, German, Dutch, and Finnish productions set to open or resume pending the cessation of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jeunet has distanced himself from the musical due to his distaste for the art form, saying he only sold the rights to raise funds for children&#x27;s charity &quot;&quot;.

==Home media==

The film has no overall worldwide distributor, but Blu-ray Discs have been released in Canada and Australia. The first release occurred in Canada in September 2008 by TVA Films. This version did not contain any English subtitles and received criticisms regarding picture quality. In November 2009, an Australian release occurred. This time the version contained English subtitles and features no region coding. Momentum Pictures released a Blu-ray in the UK on 17 October 2011. Lionsgate released a US Blu-ray edition in 2011 and Sony Pictures issued a US Blu-ray in a steelbook in 2024. The film is also available in HD on iTunes and other digital download services.

In the United Kingdom, it was 2013&#x27;s tenth best-selling foreign-language film on physical home video formats, and the year&#x27;s third best-selling French film (below &quot;The Intouchables&quot; and &quot;Rust and Bone&quot;).

==Legacy==
For the 2007 television show &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, a &quot;quirky fairy tale&quot;, American Broadcasting Company (ABC) sought an &quot;Amélie&quot; feel, with the same chords of &quot;whimsy and spirit and magic&quot;. &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; creator Bryan Fuller said &quot;Amélie&quot; is his favorite film. &quot;All the things I love are represented in that movie&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s a movie that will make me cry based on kindness as opposed to sadness&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ review of &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; reported &quot;the &quot;Amélie&quot; influence on &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; is everywhere&quot;.

A species of frog was named &quot;Cochranella amelie&quot;. The scientist who named it said: &quot;This new species of glass frog is for Amélie, protagonist of the extraordinary movie &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;; a film where little details play an important role in the achievement of &quot;joie de vivre&quot;; like the important role that glass frogs and all amphibians and reptiles play in the health of our planet&quot;. The species was described in the scientific journal &quot;Zootaxa&quot; in an article entitled &quot;An enigmatic new species of Glassfrog (Amphibia: Anura: Centrolenidae) from the Amazonian Andean slopes of Ecuador&quot;.The film is also the inspiration behind a painting game called Été where players can paint Montreal into life.

<text>The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant cat species in the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;. It has a pale yellowish to dark golden fur with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its body is slender and muscular reaching a length of with a long tail and a shoulder height of . Males typically weigh , and females .

The leopard was first described in 1758, and several subspecies were proposed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range in Africa and Asia. It initially evolved in Africa during the Early Pleistocene, before migrating into Eurasia around the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition. Leopards were formerly present across Europe, but became extinct in the region at around the end of the Late Pleistocene-early Holocene.

The leopard is adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and primates. It relies on its spotted pattern for camouflage as it stalks and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree. It is a solitary animal outside the mating season and when raising cubs. Females usually give birth to a litter of 2–4 cubs once in 15–24 months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at the age 2–2.5 years.

Listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, leopard populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. Leopards have had cultural roles in Ancient Greece, West Africa and modern Western culture. Leopard skins are popular in fashion.

==Etymology==
The English name &quot;leopard&quot; comes from Old French or Middle French , that derives from Latin and ancient Greek (). could be a compound of (), meaning , and (), meaning . The word originally referred to a cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;).

&quot;Panther&quot; is another common name, derived from Latin and ancient Greek (); The generic name &quot;Panthera&quot; originates in Latin , a hunting net for catching wild beasts to be used by the Romans in combats. is the masculine singular form.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis pardus&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.
The generic name &quot;Panthera&quot; was first used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.
Oken&#x27;s classification was not widely accepted, and &quot;Felis&quot; or &quot;Leopardus&quot; was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.

The leopard was designated as the type species of &quot;Panthera&quot; by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.
In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (&quot;P. tigris&quot;), lion (&quot;P. leo&quot;), and jaguar (&quot;P. onca&quot;) to &quot;Panthera&quot;.

===Living subspecies===
Following Linnaeus&#x27; first description, 27 leopard subspecies were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956. Since 1996, only eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of mitochondrial analysis. Later analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the Arabian leopard.

In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies as valid taxa:
Results of an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise fixation index of 182 African leopard museum specimens showed that some African leopards exhibit higher genetic differences than Asian leopard subspecies.

===Evolution===

Results of phylogenetic studies based on nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the last common ancestor of the &quot;Panthera&quot; and &quot;Neofelis&quot; genera is thought to have lived about . &quot;Neofelis&quot; diverged about from the &quot;Panthera&quot; lineage. The tiger diverged about , followed by the snow leopard about and the leopard about . The leopard is a sister taxon to a clade within &quot;Panthera&quot;, consisting of the lion and the jaguar.

Results of a phylogenetic analysis of chemical secretions amongst cats indicated that the leopard is closely related to the lion.
The geographic origin of the &quot;Panthera&quot; is most likely northern Central Asia. The leopard-lion clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The leopard-lion clade diverged 3.1–1.95 million years ago. Additionally, a 2016 study revealed that the mitochondrial genomes of the leopard, lion and snow leopard are more similar to each other than their nuclear genomes, indicating that their ancestors hybridized with the snow leopard at some point in their evolution.

The oldest unambiguous fossils of the leopard are from Eastern Africa, dating to around 2 million years ago.

Leopard-like fossil bones and teeth possibly dating to the Pliocene were excavated in Perrier in France, northeast of London, and in Valdarno, Italy. Until 1940, similar fossils dating back to the Pleistocene were excavated mostly in loess and caves at 40 sites in Europe, including Furninha Cave near Lisbon, Genista Caves in Gibraltar, and Santander Province in northern Spain to several sites across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, in the north up to Derby in England, in the east to Přerov in the Czech Republic and the Baranya in southern Hungary.
Leopards arrived in Eurasia during the late Early to Middle Pleistocene around 1.2 to 0.6 million years ago.
Four European Pleistocene leopard subspecies were proposed. &quot;P. p. begoueni&quot; from the beginning of the Early Pleistocene was replaced about by &quot;P. p. sickenbergi&quot;, which in turn was replaced by &quot;P. p. antiqua&quot; around 0.3 million years ago. &quot;P. p. spelaea&quot; is the most recent subspecies that appeared at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene and survived until about 11,000 years ago and possibly into the early Holocene in the Iberian Peninsula.

Leopards depicted in cave paintings in Chauvet Cave provide indirect evidence of leopard presence in Europe.
Leopard fossils dating to the Late Pleistocene were found in Biśnik Cave in south-central Poland.
Fossil remains were also excavated in the Iberian and Italian Peninsula, and in the Balkans.
Leopard fossils dating to the Pleistocene were also excavated in the Japanese archipelago. Leopard fossils were also found in Taiwan.

===Hybrids===

In 1953, a male leopard and a female lion were crossbred in Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya, Japan. Their offspring known as a leopon was born in 1959 and 1961, all cubs were spotted and bigger than a juvenile leopard. Attempts to mate a leopon with a tigress proved unsuccessful.

==Characteristics==

The leopard&#x27;s fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its skin colour varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its underbelly is white and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round. Leopards living in arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the legs. Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in rainforest habitats. Rosette patterns are unique in each individual. This pattern is thought to be an adaptation to dense vegetation with patchy shadows, where it serves as camouflage.

Its white-tipped tail is about long, white underneath and with spots that form incomplete bands toward the end of the tail.
The guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about . Juveniles have woolly fur that appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots. 
Its fur tends to grow longer in colder climates.
The leopard&#x27;s rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside. The leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38.

Melanistic leopards are also known as black panthers. Melanism in leopards is caused by a recessive allele and is inherited as a recessive trait.
In India, nine pale and white leopards were reported between 1905 and 1967.
Leopards exhibiting erythrism were recorded between 1990 and 2015 in South Africa&#x27;s Madikwe Game Reserve and in Mpumalanga. The cause of this morph known as a &quot;strawberry leopard&quot; or &quot;pink panther&quot; is not well understood.

===Size===
The leopard is a slender and muscular cat, with relatively short limbs and a broad head. It is sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females. Males stand at the shoulder, while females are tall. The head-and-body length ranges between with a long tail. Sizes vary geographically. Males typically weigh , and females . Occasionally, large males can grow up to . Leopards from the Cape Province in South Africa are generally smaller, reaching only in males.
The heaviest wild leopard in Southern Africa weighed around , and it measured . In 2016, an Indian leopard killed in Himachal Pradesh measured with an estimated weight of ; it was perhaps the largest known wild leopard in India.

The largest recorded skull of a leopard was found in India in 1920 and measured in basal length, in breadth, and weighed . The skull of an African leopard measured in basal length, and in breadth, and weighed .

== Distribution and habitat ==
The leopard has the largest distribution of all wild cats, occurring widely in Africa and Asia, although populations are fragmented and declining. It inhabits foremost savanna and rainforest, and areas where grasslands, woodlands and riparian forests remain largely undisturbed. It also persists in urban environments, if it is not persecuted, has sufficient prey and patches of vegetation for shelter during the day.

The leopard&#x27;s range in West Africa is estimated to have drastically declined by 95%, and in the Sahara desert by 97%. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is still numerous and surviving in marginal habitats where other large cats have disappeared. In southeastern Egypt, an individual found killed in 2017 was the first sighting of the leopard in this area in 65 years.

In West Asia, the leopard inhabits remain in the areas of southern and southeastern Anatolia.

Leopard populations in the Arabian Peninsula are small and fragmented.

In the Indian subcontinent, the leopard is still relatively abundant, with greater numbers than those of other &quot;Panthera&quot; species. Some leopard populations in India live quite close to human settlements and even in semi-developed areas. Although adaptable to human disturbances, leopards require healthy prey populations and appropriate vegetative cover for hunting for prolonged survival and thus rarely linger in heavily developed areas. Due to the leopard&#x27;s stealth, people often remain unaware that it lives in nearby areas. As of 2020, the leopard population within forested habitats in India&#x27;s tiger range landscapes was estimated at 12,172 to 13,535 individuals. Surveyed landscapes included elevations below in the Shivalik Hills and Gangetic plains, Central India and Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, the Brahmaputra River basin and hills in Northeast India.
In Nepal&#x27;s Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, a melanistic leopard was photographed at an elevation of by a camera trap in May 2012.

In Sri Lanka, leopards were recorded in Yala National Park and in unprotected forest patches, tea estates, grasslands, home gardens, pine and eucalyptus plantations.

In Myanmar, leopards were recorded for the first time by camera traps in the hill forests of Myanmar&#x27;s Karen State. The Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex in southern Myanmar is considered a leopard stronghold. In Thailand, leopards are present in the Western Forest Complex, Kaeng Krachan-Kui Buri, Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok protected area complexes and in Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary bordering Malaysia. In Peninsular Malaysia, leopards are present in Belum-Temengor, Taman Negara and Endau-Rompin National Parks.
In Laos, leopards were recorded in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Nam Kan National Protected Area.
In Cambodia, leopards inhabit deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest.
In southern China, leopards were recorded only in the Qinling Mountains during surveys in 11 nature reserves between 2002 and 2009.

In Java, leopards inhabit dense tropical rainforests and dry deciduous forests at elevations from sea level to . Outside protected areas, leopards were recorded in mixed agricultural land, secondary forest and production forest between 2008 and 2014.

In the Russian Far East, it inhabits temperate coniferous forests where winter temperatures reach a low of .

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The leopard is a solitary and territorial animal. It is typically shy and alert when crossing roadways and encountering oncoming vehicles, but may be emboldened to attack people or other animals when threatened. Adults associate only in the mating season. Females continue to interact with their offspring even after weaning and have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they can not obtain any prey. They produce a number of vocalizations, including growls, snarls, meows, and purrs. Cubs call their mother with an &quot;urr-urr&quot; sound. The most notable vocalization is the &#x27;sawing&#x27; roar, which consists of deep, repeated strokes. This likely functions in establishing territories and attracting mates.

The whitish spots on the back of its ears are thought to play a role in communication.
It has been hypothesized that the white tips of their tails may function as a &#x27;follow-me&#x27; signal in intraspecific communication. However, no significant association were found between a conspicuous colour of tail patches and behavioural variables in carnivores.

Leopards are mainly active from dusk till dawn and will rest for most of the day and some hours at night in thickets, among rocks or over tree branches. Leopards have been observed walking across their range at night; wandering up to if disturbed. In some regions, they are nocturnal. In western African forests, they have been observed to be largely diurnal and hunting during twilight, when their prey animals are active; activity patterns vary between seasons.

Leopards can climb trees quite skillfully, often resting on tree branches and descending headfirst.
They can run at over , leap over horizontally, and jump up to vertically.
===Social spacing===

In Kruger National Park, most leopards tend to keep apart. Males occasionally interact with their partners and cubs, and exceptionally this can extend beyond to two generations. Aggressive encounters are rare, typically limited to defending territories from intruders. In a South African reserve, a male was wounded in a male–male territorial battle over a carcass.

Males occupy home ranges that often overlap with a few smaller female home ranges, probably as a strategy to enhance access to females. In the Ivory Coast, the home range of a female was completely enclosed within a male&#x27;s. Females live with their cubs in home ranges that overlap extensively, probably due to the association between mothers and their offspring. There may be a few other fluctuating home ranges belonging to young individuals. It is not clear if male home ranges overlap as much as those of females do. Individuals try to drive away intruders of the same sex.

A study of leopards in the Namibian farmlands showed that the size of home ranges was not significantly affected by sex, rainfall patterns or season; the higher the prey availability in an area, the greater the leopard population density and the smaller the size of home ranges, but they tend to expand if there is human interference.
Sizes of home ranges vary geographically and depending on habitat and availability of prey. In the Serengeti, males have home ranges of and females of ; but males in northeastern Namibia of and females of . They are even larger in arid and montane areas. In Nepal&#x27;s Bardia National Park, male home ranges of and female ones of are smaller than those generally observed in Africa.

=== Hunting and diet ===
The leopard is a carnivore that prefers medium-sized prey with a body mass ranging from . Prey species in this weight range tend to occur in dense habitat and to form small herds. Species that prefer open areas and have well-developed anti-predator strategies are less preferred. More than 100 prey species have been recorded. The most preferred species are ungulates, such as impala, bushbuck, common duiker and chital. Primates preyed upon include white-eyelid mangabeys, guenons and gray langurs. Leopards also kill smaller carnivores like black-backed jackal, bat-eared fox, genet and cheetah. In urban environments, domestic dogs provide an important food source. The largest prey killed by a leopard was reportedly a male eland weighing . A study in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southern China demonstrated variation in the leopard&#x27;s diet over time; over the course of seven years, the vegetative cover receded, and leopards opportunistically shifted from primarily consuming tufted deer to pursuing bamboo rats and other smaller prey.

The leopard depends mainly on its acute senses of hearing and vision for hunting. It primarily hunts at night in most areas. In western African forests and Tsavo National Park, they have also been observed hunting by day. They usually hunt on the ground. In the Serengeti, they have been seen to ambush prey by descending on it from trees. It stalks its prey and tries to approach as closely as possible, typically within of the target, and, finally, pounces on it and kills it by suffocation. It kills small prey with a bite to the back of the neck, but holds larger animals by the throat and strangles them. It caches kills up to apart. It is able to take large prey due to its powerful jaw muscles, and is therefore strong enough to drag carcasses heavier than itself up into trees; an individual was seen to haul a young giraffe weighing nearly up into a tree. It eats small prey immediately, but drags larger carcasses over several hundred metres and caches it safely in trees, bushes or even caves; this behaviour allows the leopard to store its prey away from rivals, and offers it an advantage over them. The way it stores the kill depends on local topography and individual preferences, varying from trees in Kruger National Park to bushes in the plain terrain of the Kalahari.

Average daily consumption rates of were estimated for males and of for females. In the southern Kalahari Desert, leopards meet their water requirements by the bodily fluids of prey and succulent plants; they drink water every two to three days and feed infrequently on moisture-rich plants such as gemsbok cucumbers, watermelon and Kalahari sour grass.

===Enemies and competitors===
Across its range, the leopard coexists with a number of other large predators. In Africa, it is part of a large predator guild with lions, cheetahs, spotted and brown hyenas, and African wild dogs. The leopard is dominant only over the cheetah while the others have the advantage of size, pack numbers or both. Lions pose a great mortal threat and can be responsible for 22% of leopard deaths in Sabi Sand Game Reserve. Spotted hyenas are less threatening but are more likely to steal kills, being the culprits of up to 50% of stolen leopard kills in the same area. To counter this, leopards store their kills in the trees and out of reach. Lions have a high success rate in fetching leopard kills from trees. Leopards do not seem to actively avoid their competitors but rather difference in prey and habitat preferences appear to limit their spatial overlap. In particular, leopards use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active at the same time of day. 

In Asia, the leopard&#x27;s main competitors are tigers and dholes. Both the larger tiger and pack-living dhole dominate leopards during encounters. Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing. Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of the forest while leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes. The three predators coexist by hunting different sized prey. In Nagarhole National Park, the average size for a leopard kill was compared to for tigers and for dholes. At Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to feed on favoured prey while leopards and dholes had to increase their consumption of small prey. Leopards can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover. Otherwise, they appear to be less common where tigers are numerous. The recovery of the tiger population in Rajaji National Park during the 2000s led to a reduction in leopard population densities.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
In some areas, leopards mate all year round. In Manchuria and Siberia, they mate during January and February. On average, females begin to breed between the ages of 2½ and three, and males between the ages of two and three. The female&#x27;s estrous cycle lasts about 46 days, and she is usually in heat for 6–7 days. Gestation lasts for 90 to 105 days. Cubs are usually born in a litter of 2–4 cubs. The mortality rate of cubs is estimated at 41–50% during the first year. Predators are the biggest cause for leopard cub mortality during their first year. Male leopards are known to cause infanticide, in order to bring the female back into heat. Intervals between births average 15 to 24 months, but can be shorter, depending on the survival of the cubs.

Females give birth in a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree or thicket. Newborn cubs weigh , and are born with closed eyes, which open four to nine days after birth. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in colour with less defined spots. They begin to eat meat at around nine weeks. Around three months of age, the young begin to follow the mother on hunts. At one year of age, cubs can probably fend for themselves, but will remain with the mother for 18–24 months. After separating from their mother, sibling cubs may travel together for months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at 2–2⅓ years.

The generation length of the leopard is 9.3 years.
The average life span of a leopard is 12–17 years. 
The oldest leopard was a captive female that died at the age of 24 years, 2 months and 13 days.

== Conservation ==
The leopard is listed on CITES Appendix I, and hunting is banned in Botswana and Afghanistan; in 11 sub-Saharan countries, trade is restricted to skins and body parts of 2,560 individuals.
In 2007, a leopard reintroduction programme was initiated in the Russian Caucasus, where captive bred individuals are reared and trained in large enclosures in Sochi National Park; six individuals released into Caucasus Nature Reserve and Alaniya National Park in 2018 survived as of February 2022.

=== Threats===
The leopard is primarily threatened by habitat fragmentation and conversion of forest to agriculturally used land, which lead to a declining natural prey base, human–wildlife conflict with livestock herders and high leopard mortality rates. It is also threatened by trophy hunting and poaching. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical range.

Between 2002 and 2012, at least four leopards were estimated to have been poached per week in India for the illegal wildlife trade of its skins and bones.
In spring 2013, 37 leopard skins were found during a 7-week long market survey in major Moroccan cities. In 2014, 43 leopard skins were detected during two surveys in Morocco. Vendors admitted to have imported skins from sub-Saharan Africa.

Surveys in the Central African Republic&#x27;s Chinko area revealed that the leopard population decreased from 97 individuals in 2012 to 50 individuals in 2017. In this period, transhumant pastoralists from the border area with Sudan moved in the area with their livestock. Rangers confiscated large amounts of poison in the camps of livestock herders who were accompanied by armed merchants. They engaged in poaching large herbivores, sale of bushmeat and trading leopard skins in Am Dafok.

In Java, the leopard is threatened by illegal hunting and trade. Between 2011 and 2019, body parts of 51 Javan leopards were seized including six live individuals, 12 skins, 13 skulls, 20 canines and 22 claws.

==Human relations==
===Cultural significance===
Leopards have been featured in art, mythology and folklore of many countries. In Greek mythology, it was a symbol of the god Dionysus, who was depicted wearing leopard skin and using leopards as means of transportation. In one myth, the god was captured by pirates but two leopards rescued him. Numerous Roman mosaics from North African sites depict fauna now found only in tropical Africa. During the Benin Empire, the leopard was commonly represented on engravings and sculptures and was used to symbolise the power of the king or &quot;oba&quot;, since the leopard was considered the king of the forest. The Ashanti people also used the leopard as a symbol of leadership, and only the king was permitted to have a ceremonial leopard stool. Some African cultures considered the leopard to be a smarter, better hunter than the lion and harder to kill.

In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;How the Leopard Got His Spots&quot;, one of his &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, a leopard with no spots in the Highveld lives with his hunting partner, the Ethiopian. When they set off to the forest, the Ethiopian changed his brown skin, and the leopard painted spots on his skin. A leopard played an important role in the 1938 Hollywood film &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. African chiefs, European queens, Hollywood actors and burlesque dancers wore coats made of leopard skins.

The leopard is a frequently used motif in heraldry, most commonly as &quot;passant&quot;. The heraldic leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the heraldic lion, and the two are often used interchangeably. Naturalistic leopard-like depictions appear on the coat of arms of Benin, Malawi, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon, the last of which uses a black panther.

===Attacks on people===
The Leopard of Rudraprayag killed more than 125 people; the Panar Leopard was thought to have killed over 400 people. Both were shot by British hunter Jim Corbett. The &quot;spotted devil of Gummalapur&quot; killed about 42 people in Karnataka, India.

===In captivity===

The ancient Romans kept leopards in captivity to be slaughtered in hunts as well as execute criminals. In Benin, leopards were kept and paraded as mascots, totems and sacrifices to deities. Several leopards were kept in a menagerie originally established by King John of England at the Tower of London in the 13th century; around 1235, three of these animals were given to Henry III by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In modern times, leopards have been trained and tamed in circuses.

<text>Hilderic (460s – 533) was the penultimate king of the Vandals and Alans in North Africa in Late Antiquity (523–530). Although dead by the time the Vandal Kingdom was overthrown in 534, he nevertheless played a key role in that event.

== Life ==
Hilderic was the grandson of king Genseric, founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa. His father was Genseric&#x27;s son Huneric, and his mother was Eudocia, the daughter of the Roman Emperor Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia. Most of the Vandals were Arians and had persecuted Chalcedonians, but Hilderic favored Chalcedonianism as the religion of his mother, making his accession to the throne controversial. Soon after becoming king, Hilderic had his predecessor&#x27;s widow, Amalafrida, imprisoned; he escaped war with her brother, the Gothic king Theoderic the Great, only by virtue of the latter&#x27;s death in 526.

Hilderic&#x27;s reign was noteworthy for the kingdom&#x27;s excellent relations with the Eastern Roman Empire. Procopius writes that he was &quot;a very particular friend and guest-friend of Justinian, who had not yet come to the throne&quot;, noting that Hilderic and Justinian exchanged large presents of money to each other. Hilderic allowed a new Chalcedonian bishop to take office in the Vandal capital of Carthage, and many Vandals began to convert to Chalcedonianism, to the alarm of the Vandal nobility.

By the time he assumed the crown, Hilderic was at least into his fifties, if not more than 60. For this reason, according to Procopius, he was uninterested in the military operations of the Vandals and left them to other family members, of whom Procopius singles out for mention his nephew Hoamer.

After seven years on the throne, Hilderic fell victim to a revolt led by his cousin Gelimer, who led the people in a rebellion against the Vandal King. Gelimer then became King of the Vandals and Alans, and restored Arianism as the official religion of the kingdom. He imprisoned Hilderic, along with Hoamer and his brother Euagees, but did not kill him. Justinian protested Gelimer&#x27;s actions, demanding that Gelimer return the kingdom to Hilderic. Gelimer sent away the envoys who brought him this message, blinding Hoamer and putting both Hilderic and Euagees under closer confinement, claiming that they had planned a coup against him. When Justinian sent a second embassy protesting these developments, Gelimer replied, in effect, that Justinian had no authority to make these demands. Angered at this response, Justinian quickly concluded his ongoing war with the Sassanian Empire and prepared an expedition against the Vandals in 533. Once Gelimer learned of the arrival of the Roman army, he had Hilderic murdered, along with Euagees and other supporters of Hilderic he had imprisoned.

According to later legend, Hilderic had a daughter, Hildis, who through her legendary son Halfdan the Old was an ancestor of Ragnar Lodbrok and his descendants.

<doc id="44305" wikidata="Q942976" url="?curid=44305" title="Pap test">
<text>The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, also known as Pap smear (AE), cervical smear (BE), cervical screening (BE), or smear test (BE)) is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb) or, more rarely, anus (in both men and women). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was independently invented in the 1920s by the Greek physician Georgios Papanikolaou and named after him. A simplified version of the test was introduced by the Canadian obstetrician Anna Marion Hilliard in 1957.

A Pap smear is performed by opening the vagina with a speculum and collecting cells at the outer opening of the cervix at the transformation zone (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells), using an Ayre spatula or a cytobrush. The collected cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially precancerous changes (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical dysplasia; the squamous intraepithelial lesion system (SIL) is also used to describe abnormalities) caused by human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted DNA virus. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of precancer and cervical cancer. While the test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium, it is not designed to do so.

Guidelines on when to begin Pap smear screening are varied, but usually begin in adulthood. Guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years. If results are abnormal, and depending on the nature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in six to twelve months. If the abnormality requires closer scrutiny, the patient may be referred for detailed inspection of the cervix by colposcopy, which magnifies the view of the cervix, vagina and vulva surfaces. The person may also be referred for HPV DNA testing, which can serve as an adjunct to Pap testing. In some countries, viral DNA is checked for first, before checking for abnormal cells. Additional biomarkers that may be applied as ancillary tests with the Pap test are evolving.

==Medical uses==

Screening guidelines vary from country to country. In general, screening starts about the age of 20 or 25 and continues until about the age of 50 or 60. Screening is typically recommended every three to five years, as long as results are normal.

American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21. Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG&#x27;s general recommendation is that people with female reproductive organs age 30–65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, and that they do get Pap tests at three to five year intervals.

HPV is passed through skin to skin contact; sex does not have to occur, although it is a common way for it to spread. It takes an average of a year, but can take up to four years, for a person&#x27;s immune system to clear the initial infection. Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the patient stress and result in further tests and possible treatment. Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially precancerous lesion. For instance, screening people under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.

HPV can be transmitted in sex between females, so those who have only had sex with other females should be screened, although they are at somewhat lower risk for cervical cancer.

Guidelines on frequency of screening vary—typically every three to five years for those who have not had previous abnormal smears. Some older recommendations suggested screening as frequently as every one to two years, however there is little evidence to support such frequent screening; annual screening has little benefit but leads to greatly increased cost and many unnecessary procedures and treatments. It has been acknowledged since before 1980 that most people can be screened less often. In some guidelines, frequency depends on age; for instance in Great Britain, screening is recommended every three years for women under 50, and every five years for those over.

Screening should stop at about age 65 unless there is a history of abnormal test result or disease. There is probably no benefit in screening people aged 60 or over whose previous tests have been negative. If a woman&#x27;s last three Pap results were normal, she can discontinue testing at age 65, according to the USPSTF, ACOG, ACS, and ASCP; England&#x27;s NHS says 64. There is no need to continue screening after a complete hysterectomy for benign disease.

Pap smear screening is still recommended for those who have been vaccinated against HPV since the vaccines do not cover all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Also, the vaccine does not protect against HPV exposure before vaccination.

Those with a history of endometrial cancer should discontinue routine Pap tests after hysterectomy. Further tests are unlikely to detect recurrence of cancer but do bring the risk of giving false positive results, which would lead to unnecessary further testing.

More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer (cervical, anal, etc.).

===Effectiveness===
The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%.

Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).

Adenocarcinoma of the cervix has not been shown to be prevented by Pap smears. In the UK, which has a Pap smear screening program, adenocarcinoma accounts for about 15% of all cervical cancers.

Estimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom&#x27;s call and recall system vary widely, but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK.

Multiple studies have performed sensitivity and specificity analyses on Pap smears. Sensitivity analysis captures the ability of Pap smears to correctly identify women with cervical cancer. Various studies have revealed the sensitivity of Pap smears to be between 47.19 - 55.5%. Specificity analysis captures the ability of Pap smears to correctly identify women without cervical cancer. Various studies have revealed the specificity of Pap smears to be between 64.79 - 96.8%. While Pap smears may not be entirely accurate, they remain one of the most effective cervical cancer prevention tools. Pap smears may be supplemented with HPV DNA testing.

===Results===
In screening a general or low-risk population, most Pap results are normal.

In the United States, about 2–3 million abnormal Pap smear results are found each year. Most abnormal results are mildly abnormal (ASC-US (typically 2–5% of Pap results) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (about 2% of results)), indicating HPV infection. Although most low-grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to cervical cancer, dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed.

In a typical scenario, about 0.5% of Pap results are high-grade SIL (HSIL), and less than 0.5% of results indicate cancer; 0.2 to 0.8% of results indicate Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGC-NOS).

As liquid-based preparations (LBPs) become a common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% in 2006, compared with a 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical squamous cells have changed little.

Abnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda system. They include:

* Atypical squamous cells (ASC)
** Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)
** Atypical squamous cells – cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)
* Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL)
** Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)
** High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Glandular epithelial cell abnormalities
** Atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified (AGC or AGC-NOS)

Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast, herpes simplex virus and trichomoniasis. However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.

===Pregnancy===
Pap tests can usually be performed during pregnancy up to at least 24 weeks of gestational age. Pap tests during pregnancy have not been associated with increased risk of miscarriage. An inflammatory component is commonly seen on Pap smears from pregnant women and does not appear to be a risk for subsequent preterm birth.

After childbirth, it is recommended to wait 12 weeks before taking a Pap test because inflammation of the cervix caused by the birth interferes with test interpretation.

=== In transgender individuals ===
Transgender men are also typically at risk for HPV due to retention of the uterine cervix in the majority of individuals in this subgroup. As such, professional guidelines recommend that transgender men be screened routinely for cervical cancer using methods such as Pap smear, identical to the recommendations for cisgender women.

However, transgender men have lower rates of cervical cancer screening than cisgender women. Many transgender men report barriers to receiving gender-affirming healthcare, including lack of insurance coverage and stigma/discrimination during clinical encounters, and may encounter provider misconceptions regarding risk in this population for cervical cancer. Pap smears may be presented to patients as non-gendered screening procedures for cancer rather than one specific for examination of the female reproductive organs. Pap smears may trigger gender dysphoria in patients and gender-neutral language can be used when explaining the pathogenesis of cancer due to infection, emphasizing the pervasiveness of HPV infection regardless of gender.

Transgender women who have not had vaginoplasties are not at risk of developing cervical cancer because they do not have cervices. Transgender women who have had vaginoplasties and have a neo-cervix or neo-vagina have a small chance of developing cancer, according to the Canadian Cancer Society. Surgeons typically use penile skin to create the new vagina and cervix, which can contract HPV and lead to penile cancer, although it is considerably rarer than cervical cancer. Because the risk of this kind of cancer is so low, cervical cancer screening is not routinely offered for those with a neo-cervix.

==Procedure==
According to the CDC, intercourse, douching, and the use of vaginal medicines or spermicidal foam should be avoided for 2 days before the test. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the Pap smear. Further, cytology is not affected, nor are some STD testing. The CDC states that Pap smears can be performed during menstruation. However, the NHS recommends against cervical screening during, or in the 2 days before and after, menstruation. Pap smears can be performed during menstruation, especially if the physician is using a liquid-based test; however if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and if this occurs the test may need to be repeated in 6 months.

Pap smears begin with the insertion of a speculum into the vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows access to the cervix. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or external os of the cervix by scraping it with either a spatula or brush.

Obtaining a Pap smear should not cause much pain, but may be uncomfortable. Conditions such as vaginismus, vulvodynia, or cervical stenosis can cause insertion of the speculum to be painful.

In a conventional Pap smear, the cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.

A plastic-fronded broom is sometimes used in place of the spatula or brush. The broom is not as good a collection device, since it is much less effective at collecting endocervical material than the spatula and brush. The broom is used more frequently with the advent of liquid-based cytology, although either type of collection device may be used with either type of cytology.

The sample is stained using the Papanicolaou technique, in which tinctorial dyes and acids are selectively retained by cells. Unstained cells cannot be seen adequately with a light microscope. Papanicolaou chose stains that highlighted cytoplasmic keratinization, which actually has almost nothing to do with the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.

A single smear has an area of 25 x 50 mm and contains a few hundred thousand cells on average. Screening with light microscopy is first done on low (10x) power and then switched to higher (40x) power upon viewing suspicious findings. Cells are analyzed under high power for morphologic changes indicative of malignancy (including enlarged and irregularly shaped nucleus, an increase in nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, and more coarse and irregular chromatin). Approximately 1,000 fields of view are required on 10x power for screening of a single sample, which takes on average 5 to 10 minutes.

In some cases, a computer system may prescreen the slides, indicating those that do not need examination by a person or highlighting areas for special attention. The sample is then usually screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light microscope. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according to the country; in the UK, the personnel are known as cytoscreeners, biomedical scientists (BMS), advanced practitioners and pathologists. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample, which may require further investigation.

===Automated analysis===
Since the early 2000s, there have been successful attempts to develop automated, computer image analysis systems for screening. Although, on the available evidence, automated cervical screening could not be recommended for implementation into a national screening program, an NHS Health technology appraisal in 2005 concluded that the &quot;general case for automated image analysis ha(d) probably been made&quot;. Automation may improve sensitivity and reduce unsatisfactory specimens. Two systems have been approved by the FDA and function in high-volume reference laboratories, with human oversight.

===Types of screening===

* Conventional Pap—In a conventional Pap smear, samples are smeared directly onto a microscope slide after collection.
* Liquid-based cytology—The sample of (epithelial) cells is taken from the transitional zone, the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix, between the ectocervix and the endocervix. The cells taken are suspended in a bottle of preservative for transport to the laboratory, where they are analyzed using Pap stains.


Pap tests commonly examine epithelial abnormalities, such as metaplasia, dysplasia, or borderline changes, all of which may be indicative of CIN. Nuclei will stain dark blue, squamous cells will stain green and keratinised cells will stain pink/ orange. Koilocytes may be observed where there is some dyskaryosis (of epithelium). The nucleus in koilocytes is typically irregular, indicating possible cause for concern; requiring further confirmatory screens and tests.

In addition, human papillomavirus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases, dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and an HPV test are done at the same time (also called Pap co-testing).

===Practical aspects===
The endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. Since abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.

The endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.

In the United States, a Pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for Pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.

==History==
The test was invented by and named after the Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou, who started his research in 1923. Aurel Babeș independently made similar discoveries in 1927. However, Babeș&#x27; method was radically different from Papanikolaou&#x27;s.

The Pap test was finally recognized only after a leading article in the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; in 1941 by Papanikolaou and Herbert F. Traut, an American gynecologist. A monograph titled &quot;Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear&quot; that they published contained drawings of the various cells seen in patients with no disease, inflammatory conditions, and preclinical and clinical carcinoma. The monograph was illustrated by Hashime Murayama, who later became a staff illustrator with the National Geographic Society. Both Papanikolaou and his wife, Andromachi Papanikolaou, dedicated the rest of their lives to teaching the technique to other physicians and laboratory personnel.

==Experimental techniques==

In the developed world, cervical biopsy guided by colposcopy is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing cervical abnormalities after an abnormal Pap smear. Other techniques such as triple smear are also done after an abnormal Pap smear. The procedure requires a trained colposcopist and can be expensive to perform. However, Pap smears are very sensitive and some negative biopsy results may represent undersampling of the lesion in the biopsy, so negative biopsy with positive cytology requires careful follow-up.

Experimental visualization techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, visual inspection with acetic acid or with Lugol&#x27;s, and colposcopy) and electronic detection methods (e.g., Polarprobe and &quot;in vivo&quot; spectroscopy). These techniques are less expensive and can be performed with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.

==Implementation by country==

=== Australia ===
Australia has used the Pap test as part of its cervical screening program since its implementation in 1991 which required women past the age of 18 be tested every two years. In December 2017 Australia discontinued its use of the Pap test and replaced it with a new HPV test that is only required to be conducted once every five years from the age of 25. Medicare covers the costs of testing; however, if a patient&#x27;s doctor does not allow bulk billing, they may have to pay for the appointment and then claim the Medicare rebate.

=== Taiwan ===
Free Pap tests were offered from 1974–1984 before being replaced by a system in which all women over the age of 30 could have the cost of their Pap test reimbursed by the National Health Insurance in 1995. This policy was still ongoing in 2018 and encouraged women to screen at least every three years.

Despite this, the number of people receiving Pap tests remain lower than countries like Australia. Some believe this is due to a lack of awareness regarding the test and its availability. It has also been found that women who have chronic diseases or other reproductive diseases are less likely to receive the test.

=== England ===
 the NHS maintains a cervical screening program in which women between the age of 25–49 are invited for a smear test every three years, and women past 50 every five years. Much like Australia, England uses a HPV test before examining cells that test positive using the Pap test. The test is free as part of the national cervical screening program.

==Coccoid bacteria==
The finding of coccoid bacteria on a Pap test is of no consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of precancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.

<doc id="44307" wikidata="Q41568" url="?curid=44307" title="Michel de Montaigne">
<text>Michel Eyquem, [[Seigneur]] de Montaigne ( ; ; ; 28 February 1533 – 13 September 1592), commonly known as Michel de Montaigne, was one of the most significant philosophers of the French Renaissance. He is known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes and autobiography with intellectual insight. Montaigne had a direct influence on numerous Western writers; his massive volume &quot;Essais&quot; contains some of the most influential essays ever written.

During his lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that &quot;I am myself the matter of my book&quot; was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne came to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt that began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his skeptical remark, &quot;&quot; (&quot;What do I know?&quot;, in Middle French; now rendered as &quot;&quot; in modern French).

==Biography==
===Family, childhood and education===
Montaigne was born in the Guyenne (Aquitaine) region of France, on the family estate Château de Montaigne in a town now called Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne, close to Bordeaux. The family was very wealthy. His great-grandfather, Ramon Felipe Eyquem, had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur of Montaigne, was a French Catholic soldier in Italy for a time and had also been the mayor of Bordeaux.

Although there were several families bearing the patronym &quot;Eyquem&quot; in Guyenne, his father&#x27;s family is thought to have had some degree of Marrano (Spanish and Portuguese Jewish) origins, while his mother, Antoinette López de Villanueva, was a convert to Protestantism. His maternal grandfather, Pedro López, from Zaragoza, was from a wealthy Marrano (Sephardic Jewish) family, that had converted to Catholicism. His maternal grandmother, Honorette Dupuy, was from a Catholic family in Gascony, France.

During a great part of Montaigne&#x27;s life his mother lived near him, and even survived him; but she is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaigne&#x27;s relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.

Montaigne&#x27;s education began in early childhood and followed a pedagogical plan that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter&#x27;s humanist friends. Soon after his birth Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, &quot;draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help&quot;. After these first spartan years Montaigne was brought back to the château.

Another objective was for Latin to become his first language. The intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who could not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he employed; and thus they acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne&#x27;s Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than the more traditional books.

The atmosphere of the boy&#x27;s upbringing engendered in him a spirit of &quot;liberty and delight&quot; that he would later describe as making him &quot;relish...duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint&quot;. His father had a musician wake him every morning, playing one instrument or another; and an &quot;epinettier&quot; (player of a type of zither) was the constant companion to Montaigne and his tutor, playing tunes to alleviate boredom and tiredness.

Around the year 1539 Montaigne was sent to study at a highly regarded boarding school in Bordeaux, the College of Guienne, then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era, George Buchanan, where he mastered the whole curriculum by his thirteenth year. He finished the first phase of his educational studies at the College of Guienne in 1546. He then began his study of law (his alma mater remains unknown, since there are no certainties about his activity from 1546 to 1557) and entered a career in the local legal system.

===Career and marriage===

Montaigne was a counselor of the Court des Aides of Périgueux, and in 1557 he was appointed counselor of the Parlement in Bordeaux, a high court. From 1561 to 1563 he was courtier at the court of Charles IX, and he was present with the king at the siege of Rouen (1562). He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the collar of the Order of Saint Michael.

While serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became a very close friend of the humanist poet Étienne de La Boétie, whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame in his introduction to &quot;The Complete Essays of Montaigne&quot; that because of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;imperious need to communicate&quot;, after losing Étienne, he began the &quot;Essais&quot; as a new &quot;means of communication&quot;, and that &quot;the reader takes the place of the dead friend&quot;.

Montaigne married Françoise de la Cassaigne in 1565, probably in an arranged marriage. She was the daughter and niece of wealthy merchants of Toulouse and Bordeaux. They had six daughters, but only the second-born, Léonor, survived infancy. He wrote very little about the relationship with his wife, and little is known about their marriage. Of his daughter Léonor he wrote: &quot;All my children die at nurse; but Léonore, our only daughter, who has escaped this misfortune, has reached the age of six and more, without having been punished, the indulgence of her mother aiding, except in words, and those very gentle ones.&quot; His daughter married François de la Tour and later Charles de Gamaches. She had a daughter by each.

===Writing===
Following the petition of his father, Montaigne started to work on the first translation of the Catalan monk Raymond Sebond&#x27;s &quot;Theologia naturalis&quot;, which he published a year after his father&#x27;s death in 1568 (in 1595 Sebond&#x27;s Prologue was put on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; because of its declaration that the Bible is not the only source of revealed truth). Montaigne also published a posthumous edition of the works of his friend, Boétie.

In 1570 he moved back to the family estate, the Château de Montaigne, which he had inherited. He thus became the Lord of Montaigne. Around this time he was seriously injured in a riding accident on the grounds of the château when one of his mounted companions collided with him at speed, throwing Montaigne from his horse and briefly knocking him unconscious. It took weeks or months for him to recover, and this close brush with death apparently affected him greatly, as he discussed it at length in his writings over the following years. Not long after the accident he relinquished his magistracy in Bordeaux, his first child was born (and died a few months later), and by 1571 he had retired from public life completely to the tower of the château – his so-called &quot;citadel&quot; – where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 volumes, he began work on the writings that would later be compiled into his &quot;Essais&quot; (&quot;Essays&quot;), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves of his working chamber:

In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.
===Travels===

During this time of the Wars of Religion in France, Montaigne, a Roman Catholic, acted as a moderating force, respected both by the Catholic King Henry III and the Protestant Henry of Navarre, who later converted to Catholicism.

In 1578 Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful kidney stones, a tendency he inherited from his father&#x27;s family. Throughout this illness he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs. From 1580 to 1581 Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at Bagni di Lucca, where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto, to which he presented a silver relief (depicting him, his wife, and their daughter, kneeling before the Madonna) considering himself fortunate that it should be hung on a wall within the shrine. He kept a journal, recording regional differences and customs - and a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the stones he succeeded in expelling. This was published much later, in 1774, after its discovery in a trunk that is displayed in his tower.

During a visit to the Vatican that Montaigne described in his travel journal, the &quot;Essais&quot; were examined by Sisto Fabri, who served as Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Gregory XIII. After Fabri examined Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essais&quot;, the text was returned to him on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of &quot;fortuna&quot;, as well as for writing favorably of Julian the Apostate and of heretical poets, and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.

===Later career===
While in the city of Lucca in 1581 he learned that, like his father before him, he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux. He thus returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The plague broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586 the plague and the French Wars of Religion prompted him to leave his château for two years.

Montaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of the &quot;Essais&quot;. In 1588 he wrote its third book, and also met Marie de Gournay, an author who admired his work and later edited and published it. Montaigne later referred to her as his adopted daughter.

When King Henry III was assassinated in 1589, Montaigne, despite his aversion to the cause of the Reformation, was anxious to promote a compromise that would end the bloodshed and gave his support to Henry of Navarre, who would go on to become King Henry IV. Montaigne&#x27;s position associated him with the &quot;politiques&quot;, the establishment movement that prioritised peace, national unity, and royal authority over religious allegiance.

===Death===

Montaigne died of quinsy at the age of 59 in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. In his case the disease &quot;brought about paralysis of the tongue&quot;, especially difficult for one who once said: &quot;the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice.&quot; Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested Mass, and died during the celebration of that Mass.

He was buried nearby. Later his remains were moved to the church of Saint Antoine at Bordeaux. The church no longer exists. It became the Convent des Feuillants, which also has disappeared.

==&quot;Essais&quot;==

His humanism finds expression in his &quot;Essais&quot;, a collection of a large number of short subjective essays on various topics published in 1580 that were inspired by his studies in the classics, especially by the works of Plutarch and Lucretius. Montaigne&#x27;s stated goal was to describe humans, and especially himself, with utter frankness.

Inspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age, he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time. He believed that humans are not able to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays, &quot;Apology for Raymond Sebond&quot;, marking his adoption of Pyrrhonism, contains his famous motto, &quot;What do I know?&quot;

Montaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children but disliked strong feelings of passionate love because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge intended to be accepted uncritically. His essay &quot;On the Education of Children&quot; is dedicated to Diana of Foix.

The &quot;Essais&quot; exercised an important influence on both French and English literature, in thought and style. Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, published over a decade later, first in 1597, usually are presumed to be directly influenced by Montaigne&#x27;s collection, and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.

==Montaigne&#x27;s influence on psychology==
Although not a scientist, Montaigne made observations on topics in psychology. In his essays, he developed and explained his observations of these themes. His thoughts and ideas covered subjects such as thought, motivation, fear, happiness, child education, experience, and human action. Montaigne&#x27;s ideas have influenced psychology and are a part of its rich history.

===Child education===
Child education was among the psychological topics that he wrote about. His essays &quot;On the Education of Children&quot;, &quot;On Pedantry&quot;, and &quot;On Experience&quot; explain the views he had on child education. Some of his views on child education are still relevant today.

Montaigne&#x27;s views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day. He found fault both with what was taught and how it was taught. Much of education during Montaigne&#x27;s time focused on reading the classics and learning through books. Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information; but Montaigne, in general, took the position that to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own:Let the tutor make his charge pass everything through a sieve and lodge nothing in his head on mere authority and trust: let not Aristotle&#x27;s principles be principles to him any more than those of the Stoics or Epicureans. Let this variety of ideas be set before him; he will choose if he can; if not, he will remain in doubt. Only the fools are certain and assured. &quot;For doubting pleases me no less than knowing.&quot; [Dante]. For if he embraces Xenophon&#x27;s and Plato&#x27;s opinions by his own reasoning, they will no longer be theirs, they will be his. He who follows another follows nothing. He finds nothing; indeed he seeks nothing. &quot;We are not under a king; let each one claim his own freedom.&quot; [Seneca]. . . . He must imbibe their way of thinking, not learn their precepts. And let him boldly forget, if he wants, where he got them, but let him know how to make them his own. Truth and reason are common to everyone, and no more belong to the man who first spoke them than to the man who says them later. It is no more according to Plato than according to me, since he and I see it in the same way. The bees plunder the flowers here and there, but afterward they make of them honey, which is all and purely their own, and no longer thyme and marjoram.At the foundation, Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated. Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student. He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.

Individualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things. He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child&#x27;s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.

Experience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning. He argued that students would become passive adults, blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.

Montaigne&#x27;s views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne&#x27;s ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience, over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.

==Related writers and influence==
Thinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne include Erasmus, Thomas More, John Fisher, and Guillaume Budé, who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne. Many of Montaigne&#x27;s Latin quotations are from Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Adagia&quot;, and most critically, all of his quotations from Socrates. Plutarch remains perhaps Montaigne&#x27;s strongest influence, in terms of substance and style. Montaigne&#x27;s quotations from Plutarch in the &quot;Essays&quot; number more than 500.

Ever since Edward Capell first made the suggestion in 1780, scholars have suggested Montaigne to be an influence on William Shakespeare. The latter would have had access to John Florio&#x27;s translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essais&quot;, published in English in 1603, and a scene in &quot;The Tempest&quot; &quot;follows the wording of Florio [translating &quot;Of Cannibals&quot;] so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable&quot;. Most parallels between the two may be explained, however, as commonplaces: as similarities with writers in other nations to the works of Cervantes and Shakespeare could be due simply to their own study of Latin moral and philosophical writers such as Seneca the Younger, Horace, Ovid, and Virgil.

Much of Blaise Pascal&#x27;s skepticism in his &quot;Pensées&quot; has been attributed traditionally to his reading Montaigne. Pascal listed Montaigne and Epictetus as the two philosophers he was most familiar with.

The English essayist William Hazlitt expressed boundless admiration for Montaigne, exclaiming that &quot;he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot. ... In treating of men and manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas&quot;. Beginning most overtly with the essays in the &quot;familiar&quot; style in his own &quot;Table-Talk&quot;, Hazlitt tried to follow Montaigne&#x27;s example.

Ralph Waldo Emerson chose &quot;Montaigne; or, the Skeptic&quot; as a subject of one of his series of lectures entitled, &quot;Representative Men&quot;, alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In &quot;The Skeptic&quot; Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, &quot;It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience.&quot; Friedrich Nietzsche judged of Montaigne: &quot;That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth&quot;. Sainte-Beuve advises us that &quot;to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne.&quot; Stefan Zweig drew inspiration from one of Montaigne&#x27;s quotes to give the title to one of his autobiographical novels, &quot;A Conscience Against Violence.&quot;

The American philosopher Eric Hoffer employed Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Truth Imagined&quot;, he said of Montaigne, &quot;He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts.&quot; The British novelist John Cowper Powys expressed his admiration for Montaigne&#x27;s philosophy in his books, &quot;Suspended Judgements&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Pleasures of Literature&quot; (1938). Judith N. Shklar introduces her book &quot;Ordinary Vices&quot; (1984), &quot;It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages...&quot;

Twentieth-century literary critic Erich Auerbach called Montaigne the first modern man. &quot;Among all his contemporaries&quot;, writes Auerbach (&quot;Mimesis&quot;, Chapter 12), &quot;he had the clearest conception of the problem of man&#x27;s self-orientation; that is, the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support&quot;.

==Discovery of remains==

The Musée d&#x27;Aquitaine announced on 20 November 2019 that the human remains, which had been found in the basement of the museum a year earlier, might belong to Montaigne. Investigation of the remains, postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resumed in September 2020.

== Commemoration ==
The birthdate of Montaigne served as the basis to establish National Essay Day in the United States.

The humanities branch of the University of Bordeaux is named after him: .

<doc id="44308" wikidata="Q13630" url="?curid=44308" title="Olbia">
<text>Olbia (, ; ; ) is a city and commune of 60,346 inhabitants (May 2018) in the Italian insular province of Sassari in northeastern Sardinia, Italy, in the historical region of Gallura. Called in the Roman age, Civita in the Middle Ages (Judicates period) and the Terranova Pausania until the 1940s, &quot;Olbia&quot; has again been the official name of the city since the fascist period.

== History ==
Although the name is of Greek origin, due to the Greek presence during the seventh century B.C., the city of Olbia was first settled either by the Nuragics or by Phoenicians, according to the archaeological findings. It contains ruins from the Nuragic era to the Roman era, when it was an important port, and the Middle Ages, when it was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura, one of the four independent states of Sardinia. During the First Punic War, the Romans fought against the Carthaginians and the Sardinians near Olbia, where the general Hanno died in battle.

From 1113 it was the episcopal see of the Diocese of Cività (succeeding to the Diocese of Gallura, the 1070 restoration of the Diocese of Fausania, 500–750), which was renamed in 1839 as Diocese of Civita–Tempio until its formal suppression in favor of (in fact merger into) the Diocese of Tempio–Ampurias (also integrating the Diocese of Ampurias, which was in personal union with the see of Civita from 1506).

== Geography ==

It is the economic centre of this part of the island (commercial centres, food industry) and is very close to the Costa Smeralda tourist area. It was one of the administrative capitals of the province of Olbia-Tempio, operative since 2005 and canceled after a referendum seven years later. Olbia is a tourist destination thanks to its sea and beaches and also for the large number of places of cultural interest to visit.

=== Climate ===
Olbia has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), with mild winters, warm springs and autumns and hot summers.
== Main sights ==
 
* Romanesque former cathedral of San Simplicio (11th–12th century).
* Church of St. Paul Apostle (medieval)
* National Archaeology Museum
* Pedres Castle
*Several dolmens and a menhir
*Several nuraghes
*Remains of the Roman forum and aqueduct
*Remains of Carthaginian walls
*Fausto Noce park, the largest in Sardinia
*River park of Padrongianus
*Tavolara island

==Sport==
Olbia Calcio 1905 represents Olbia in Serie C, the third division of Italian football.
Olbia hosted several legs of Aquabike World Championship (powerboating) in 2003, 2004, 2018, 2019.

== Transport ==

Olbia is one of the main connections between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, with an airport (Olbia – Costa Smeralda), a passenger port (Olbia-Isola Bianca), and a railway from Olbia railway station to Porto Torres, Golfo Aranci and Cagliari. There is an expressway to Nuoro and Cagliari (SS131) and national roads to Sassari (SS199-E840), Tempio Pausania (SS127) and Palau (SS125).
=== Local transport ===
The internal city public transport and bus connections with the surrounding areas are provided by the ASPO (Olbia&#x27;s public service company), while vehicle connections with the other centers of the territory are provided by the ARST (Sardinian regional transport company). Other private carriers operate with lines under concession. 

== Hospitals ==
The major hospitals in the area are:
* &quot;Giovanni Paolo II&quot; Hospital - Olbia
* &quot;Paolo Dettori&quot; Hospital - Tempio Pausania
* &quot;Paolo Merlo&quot; Hospital - La Maddalena
* Mater Olbia Hospital - Olbia

<text>Edward Franklin Albee III ( ; March 12, 1928 – September 16, 2016) was an American playwright known for works such as &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; (1958), &quot;The Sandbox&quot; (1959), &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1962), &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1966), and &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; (1994). Some critics have argued that some of his work constitutes an American variant of what Martin Esslin identified as and named the Theater of the Absurd. Three of his plays won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and two of his other works won the Tony Award for Best Play.

His works are often considered frank examinations of the modern condition. His early works reflect a mastery and Americanization of the Theatre of the Absurd that found its peak in works by European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet.

His middle period comprised plays that explored the psychology of maturing, marriage and sexual relationships. Younger American playwrights, such as Paula Vogel, credit Albee&#x27;s mix of theatricality and biting dialogue with helping to reinvent postwar American theatre in the early 1960s. Later in life, Albee continued to experiment in works such as &quot;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&quot; (2002).

==Early life==
Edward Albee was born in 1928. His biological father left his mother, Louise Harvey, and he was placed for adoption two weeks later and taken to Larchmont, New York, where he grew up. Albee&#x27;s adoptive father, Reed A. Albee, the wealthy son of vaudeville magnate Edward Franklin Albee II, owned several theaters. His adoptive mother, Reed&#x27;s second wife, Frances (Cotter), was a socialite. He later based the main character of his 1991 play &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; on his mother, with whom he had a conflicted relationship.

Albee attended the Rye Country Day School, then the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, from which he was expelled. He then was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where he was dismissed in less than a year. He enrolled at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, graduating in 1946. He had attracted theatre attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, essays, a long act play, &quot;Schism&quot;, and a 500-page novel, &quot;The Flesh of Unbelievers&quot; (Horn, 1) in 1946. His formal education continued at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was expelled in 1947 for skipping classes and refusing to attend compulsory chapel.

Albee left home for good in his late teens. In a later interview, he said: &quot;I never felt comfortable with the adoptive parents. I don&#x27;t think they knew how to be parents. I probably didn&#x27;t know how to be a son, either.&quot; In a 1994 interview, he said he left home at 18 because &quot;[he] had to get out of that stultifying, suffocating environment.&quot; In 2008, he told interviewer Charlie Rose that he was &quot;thrown out&quot; because his parents wanted him to become a &quot;corporate thug&quot; and did not approve of his aspirations to be a writer.

==Career==

===1959–1966: The Early Plays===
Albee moved into New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, where he supported himself with odd jobs while learning to write plays. His roommate in New York was the composer William Flanagan. Primarily in his early plays, Albee&#x27;s work had various representations of the LGBTQIA community often challenging the image of a heterosexual marriage. Despite challenging society&#x27;s views about the gay community, he did not view himself as an LGBT advocate. Albee&#x27;s work typically criticized the American Dream. His first play, &quot;The Zoo Story&quot;, written in three weeks, was first staged in Berlin in 1959 before premiering Off-Broadway in 1960. His next, &quot;The Death of Bessie Smith&quot;, similarly premiered in Berlin before arriving in New York.

Albee&#x27;s most iconic play, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, opened on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theatre on October 13, 1962, and closed on May 16, 1964, after five previews and 664 performances. The opening night cast featured Uta Hagen. Arthur Hill, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1963 and was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize by the award&#x27;s drama jury, but the selection was overruled by the advisory committee, which elected not to give a drama award at all. The two members of the jury, John Mason Brown and John Gassner, subsequently resigned in protest. An Academy Award-winning film adaptation by Ernest Lehman was released in 1966 starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis, and was directed by Mike Nichols. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

=== 1971–1987: The Middle Plays ===

In 1971 he wrote &quot;All Over&quot;, a two-act play originally titled, &quot;Death&quot;, the second half of a projected double bill with another play called &quot;Life&quot; (which later became &quot;Seascape&quot;). The play premiered on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre with John Gielgud directing and starred Jessica Tandy, Madeleine Sherwood, and Colleen Dewhurst. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Clive Barnes wrote, &quot;It is a lovely, poignant and deeply felt play. In no way at all is it an easy play -- this formal minuet of death, this symphony ironically celebrating death&#x27;s dominion. It is not easy in its structure, a series of almost operatic arias demanding, in their precision, pin-point concentration from the audience, and it is certainly not easy in its subject matter.&quot;

In 1974 he wrote &quot;Seascape&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It debuted on Broadway with Deborah Kerr and Frank Langella. It was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play losing to Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Equus&quot;. Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared the play &quot;a major event&quot;, adding, &quot;As Mr. Albee has matured as a playwright, his work has become leaner, sparer and simpler. He depends on strong theatrical strokes to attract the attention of the audience, but the tone of the writing is always thoughtful, even careful, even philosophic.&quot; He compared his work alongside Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter.

Albee continued to write plays including &quot;Listening&quot; (1976), &quot;Counting the Ways&quot; (1976) before a brief break before &quot;The Lady from Dubuque&quot; (1980) which had a short run on Broadway. He wrote the three act play &quot;The Man Who Had Three Arms&quot; (1983) which was received negatively with Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;isn&#x27;t a play - it&#x27;s a temper tantrum in two acts... One of the more shocking lapses of Mr. Albee&#x27;s writing is that he makes almost no attempt even to pretend that Himself is anything other than a maudlin stand-in for himself, with the disappearing arm representing an atrophied talent.&quot;

Albee&#x27;s plays during the 1980s received mixed reviews with Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing, &quot;American dramatists invariably end up as victims of their own myth: in a success-crazed culture they are never forgiven for failing to live up to their own early masterpieces. But if Edward Albee has suffered the same cruel fate as Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, he has kept on trucking&quot;. Billington wrote of Albee&#x27;s 1987 play, &quot;Marriage Play&quot;, &quot;At the end the play achieves a metaphorical resonance by suggesting that marriage is an accumulation of meaningless habits and that &quot;nothing has made any difference&quot;.

=== 1991–2016: The Later Plays ===
In 1991 he wrote the play &quot;Three Tall Women&quot;, a two act play that premiered at the Vienna&#x27;s English Theatre about three unnamed women. The play was revived in 2018 directed by Joe Mantello starring Glenda Jackson, Laurie Metcalf, and Allison Pill. The 2018 production received the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. Allison Adato of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote of the play, &quot;Edward Albee&#x27;s Three Tall Women, in which a nonagenarian revisits events of her life refracted through both her own dementia and the differing recollections of her younger selves, is a not-quite-memory play filled with regret, resentment, entitlement, various bodily indignities&quot;.

Georgia State University English professor Matthew Roudane divides Albee&#x27;s plays into three periods: the Early Plays (1959–1966), characterized by gladiatorial confrontations, bloodied action and fight to the metaphorical death; the Middle Plays (1971–1987), when Albee lost the favor of Broadway audience and started premiering in the U.S. regional theaters and in Europe; and the Later Plays (1991–2016), received as a remarkable comeback and watched by appreciative audiences and critics the world over.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Albee was &quot;widely considered to be the foremost American playwright of his generation.&quot; The less-than-diligent student later dedicated much of his time to promoting American university theatre. He served as a Distinguished Professor of Playwriting and held the Lyndall Finley Wortham Chair in the Performing Arts at the University of Houston. His plays are published by Dramatists Play Service and Samuel French, Inc.

==Philanthropy==
Albee established the Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc. in 1967, from royalties from his play &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;. The foundation funds the William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center (named after the composer William Flanagan, but better known as &quot;The Barn&quot;) in Montauk, New York, as a residence for writers and visual artists.
The foundation&#x27;s mission is &quot;to serve writers and visual artists from all walks of life, by providing time and space in which to work without disturbance.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Albee was gay and stated that he first knew he was gay at age twelve and a half.

As a teen in Larchmont, Albee became a close friend of English-born Muir Weissinger Jr. and his family. Albee, along with others, referred to Florence, Muir&#x27;s mother, as &quot;Mummy&quot;. For her part, Albee&#x27;s mother felt he spent too much time at the Weissinger household. Albee dated Muir&#x27;s sister, Delphine, and escorted her to her coming-out party. Albee and Delphine had a &quot;long and intense relationship&quot; while it lasted; Albee has said they were &quot;unofficially engaged&quot;. Albee kept in touch for a long time with Florence and Muir Weissinger.

Albee insisted that he did not want to be known as a &quot;gay writer&quot;, saying in his acceptance speech for the 2011 Lambda Literary Foundation&#x27;s Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement: &quot;A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay.&quot; His longtime partner, Jonathan Richard Thomas, a sculptor, died on May 2, 2005, from bladder cancer. They had been partners from 1971 until Thomas&#x27;s death. Albee also had a relationship of several years with playwright Terrence McNally during the 1950s.

Albee died at his home in Montauk, New York on September 16, 2016, aged 88.

Albee lived in a 6,000-square-foot loft that was a former cheese warehouse in New York&#x27;s Tribeca neighborhood. At the time of his death Albee held an expansive collection of fine art, utilitarian works and sculptures. Albee was especially interested in artworks created by indigenous cultures in Africa and Oceania.

<doc id="44310" wikidata="Q962651" url="?curid=44310" title="Gallura">
<text>Gallura ( or ; ) is a region in North-Eastern Sardinia, Italy.

The name &quot;Gallùra&quot; is allegedly supposed to mean &quot;stony area&quot;.

== Geography ==
Gallùra has an area of . It is from the Italian peninsula and from the French island of Corsica.
The coast of Gallura is very jagged and continues along in a continuous series of small fiords, rock-cliffs and little islands that form the archipelago of La Maddalena, a natural bridge towards nearby Corsica.
The landscape is characterised by granite rocks and harsh mountains that, even if not particularly high, have constituted for millennia a barrier between this region and the nearby territories of Baronie and Montalbo. Monte Limbara is the highest mountain (1,362 m/4,469 ft). It represents the boundary between Gallura and the nearby region called Logudoro. Its highest peak is Punta Balestrieri (1362 m above the sea level). In the past, Monte Limbara used to be the location of an important NATO long range radar base and a Carabinieri’s barrack. Today it is used as a telecommunications center for the Italian Air Force and a heliport for the Servizio Antincendi. It is also the location of all the major TV relay stations of West Sardinia. Another small mountain is Monte Cruzitta (666 m). Even if it is not very high, it offers a very characteristic landscape.
The climate is typical of the Mediterranean. The weather is clear. During the year approximately 300 days are sunny and the few others are rainy, with a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring, and snowfalls on the highest massifs and highlands. The mistral is the dominant wind, fresh, strong, and usually dry and cold, blowing from the northwest throughout the year, but most frequently in winter and spring.

== History ==

=== Prehistory===
The first human settlements in Gallura date back to approximately 30.000 years ago, when the first populations crossed the strait between Tuscany and Sardinia. This historic period is known as the Stone Age.
Foreign populations colonize Gallura due to its numerous natural resources. Many people from the nearby island of Corsica came as well to Gallura during this historic period. The mid-late neolithic Arzachena culture subsisted almost exclusively in this area, and here is found the remains of perhaps the oldest megalith on Sardinia, at Li Muri.

=== From Nuragic Prehistory to Antiquity ===

The historic period that goes from 1700 BC to the Roman Age is also known in Sardinia as the Nuragic Age. The particular name of this historic period takes after the Nuraghes, the biggest megalithic edifices ever found in Europe, which still today represent a symbol for Sardinia.
The Phoenicians founded the (hence Punic) city of Olbia (renamed in Greek, though), which was conquered by the Romans with all of Gallura in 238 BC.

=== The Judicate of Gallura ===
During the Middle Ages, Gallura was one of the four Judicates, the four autonomous states into which Sardinia was divided under pope Alexander&#x27;s assent. 
Civita (which today is known as Olbia) was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura and the (first) bishop&#x27;s see.
The Judicate of Gallura included today&#x27;s area of Gallura, the area surrounding the city of Nuoro, and the area called &quot;Baronias&quot; (Italian: &quot;Baronie&quot;). It was occupied by the republic of Pisa in 1288 after the fall of the last ruling judge Nino Visconti.

=== Late Middle Ages till the eighteenth century===
At the end of the 13th century, the city of Civita (today&#x27;s Olbia) takes the name of Terranova, a new settlement founded by the pisans near the site of the ancient Roman port of Olbia.
Pirates – primarily from North Africa – raided the coasts of Gallura and people moved consequently from there to the hinterland. The city of Tempio became especially populated.
Between 1300 and 1800 there was a big emigration of people from the nearby island of Corsica to Gallura. Corsicans deeply influenced the language and the culture of Gallura, which still today is considered quite different from the culture and the dialects of the rest of Sardinia.

By the end of the 1700s people started to move from the hinterland to the coasts.

=== Nineteenth century, Twentieth century and today ===
During the nineteenth century the bishop&#x27;s see was transferred from the city of Olbia to the city of Tempio, which also became a district&#x27;s capital.

In the second half of the 20th century, tourism increased greatly, especially in the areas of Costa Smeralda, Santa Teresa di Gallura and San Teodoro.
Today, Gallura has the highest capital income in all of Sardinia.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
The region&#x27;s original Roman bishopric, the Diocese of Fausania (P(h)ausania), founded no later than the 5th century (tradition says by the 3rd century saint Simplicius), of disputed location (Olbia, Tempio Pausania or Posano) perished under Byzantine rule, probably in the 8th century.

It was restored under the name of Gallura in 1070, renamed Civita after its see (the medieval name of Olbia) and from 1506 held in personal union with the Diocese of Ampurias, but no later than the 12th century a second bishopric was established, the Diocese of Galtelli.

== Demographics ==
Gallura has a population of 143,921 people; the Sardinians from this area are called Galluresi (). The population density has remarkably increased in small centers along the eastern coast and in the cities of Arzachena and Olbia. The population density of 12 municipalities out of 26 has however decreased (-4%) in centers located in the country -side and on the mountains. This tendency depends on the increase of the seaside tourism.

In general, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the lowest fertility rate (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest birth rate.

===Main towns===
; Olbia
Olbia (medieval Civita) is a town of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. It represents the city with the highest population density of the entire Gallura. In 2005 it became an administrative capital together with Tempio-Pausania. They form the province called Olbia-Tempio.
Founded in 350 BC, it used to be one of the most important trade areas of the Mediterranean Sea.
Today, it represents the economic center of Sardinia due to its airport, its seaport and also to its closeness to the famous Costa Smeralda tourist area.

; Tempio Pausania
Tempio Pausania is a town of 13,800 inhabitants. Together with Olbia, it is the administrative capital of the province Olbia-Tempio.
Founded around 250 BC, Tempio Pausania is located 560m above the sea level. It represents both the geographical and the cultural capital of Gallura. Every year, thousands of tourists come to visit Tempio Pausania to assist to the characteristic carnevale (carnival), which takes place at the end of February.

; Arzachena
Arzachena is a town of 12,080 inhabitants. 
It represents the administrative capital of the Costa Smeralda tourist area. Founded in 1961 by the prince Karim Aga Khan, Costa Smeralda represents the most exclusive tourist area of Gallura.
Arzachena is also famous for its archeology. Its archeological sites include the LiMuri Tomba dei Giganti (Giants’ Grave).

; La Maddalena
La Maddalena is part of an archipelago called Arcipelago della Maddalena. It is situated in the Straits of Bonifacio, which divide Sardinia from Corsica. La Maddalena represents the largest town of this archipelago, which includes the islands of Caprera, S. Stefano, Spargi, Budelli, S. Maria and Razzoli. La Maddalena represents an important tourist site in Gallura and the island of Caprera is famous for being the residence of the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi.

== Economy ==

The economy of Gallura is based mostly on tourism and hospitality due to the presence of Costa Smeralda and other world-famous sea sites.
The primary sector is not as important as in the rest of Sardinia. It is based mostly on wine production. Also sheep breeding, dairy production, and poultry farm are relevant.
The secondary sector is quite important. It is mostly based on cork work and mineral processing of granite. In fact, it is easy to find cork oaks in many parts of the region and the whole area is rich in granite, especially in vicinity of Monte Limbara. Cork production is one of the main economic activity in the interior, while on the coasts are developed fish factories and shipyards.

=== Transportation ===
Gallura has one international airport (Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport), which is situated in the city of Olbia. It represents one of the three international airports of Sardinia and the base of the Sardinian airline Meridiana, Italy&#x27;s third-largest airline.

Another way to reach the region of Gallura is by ferry. The ferry companies operating on the Island are Tirrenia di Navigazione, Moby Lines, Corsica Ferry, Grandi Navi Veloci, Snav, SNCM and CMN. They link the harbors of Olbia, Golfo Aranci, Santa Teresa di Gallura and Palau to the harbors of the Italian peninsula, France, Corsica and Spain.

== Culture ==

===Language===
The native language of the area is Gallurese, which is also recognized by the Regional Government of Sardinia. Gallurese is usually not considered a dialect of Sardinian, since it is quite different from most of the other Sardinian dialects, but rather as a direct offshoot from Corsican. Luras and Padru, two small towns in the province of Olbia-Tempio, are the only areas in Gallura in which Gallurese is not traditionally spoken. Sardinian is also spoken in its Logudorese variety.

== Environment ==
With 1,213,250 hectares of woods, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the largest forest extension. Regional landscape plans regulate building activities along the coasts, the forests, and other natural sites.

; National Parks

Sardinia has ten regional parks and three national parks. One of these three national parks is located in Gallura, i.e., the Archipelago of La Maddalena&#x27;s National Park. This park is a world-famous tourist area due to the beauty of its beaches and to the one of its landscape, where granite rocks alternate with green areas.

===Renewable energies===
Renewable energies have increased impressively during the recent years in Sardinia. Due to the windy climate, the most important renewable energy in Gallura is the wind power. During the past years however, the installation of wind power systems has been the subject of controversial debates due to its landscape impact.

<text>An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea or process. An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost. It may also be an entirely new concept. If an idea is unique enough either as a stand-alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented. A patent, if granted, gives the inventor a proprietary interest in the patent over a specific period of time, which can be licensed for financial gain.

An inventor creates or discovers an invention. The word &quot;inventor&quot; comes from the Latin verb &quot;invenire&quot;, &quot;invent-&quot;, to find. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers or scientists. Due to advances in artificial intelligence, the term &quot;inventor&quot; no longer exclusively applies to an occupation (see human computers).

Some inventions can be patented. The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful or has industrial applicability. A patent is jurisdictional, meaning that a patent only provides rights to the patent owner within the jurisdiction (Country or Countries) in which the patent was obtained. A patent provides the patent owner (who may or may not be an inventor) the right to right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling an invention or importing it into the jurisdiction. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.

Another meaning of invention is [[cultural invention]], which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others. The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books. Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.

==Types==
Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.

Scientific-technological inventions include railroads, aviation, vaccination, hybridization, antibiotics, astronautics, holography, the atomic bomb, computing, the Internet, and the smartphone.

Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British Parliament, the US Constitution, the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the Olympic Games, the United Nations, the European Union, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as movements such as socialism, Zionism, suffragism, feminism, and animal-rights veganism.

Humanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences, although people tend to take them for granted. In the domain of linguistics, for example, Hunminjeongeum or many alphabets have been inventions, as are all neologisms (Shakespeare invented about 1,700 words). Literary inventions include the epic, tragedy, comedy, the novel, the sonnet, the Renaissance, neoclassicism, Romanticism, Symbolism, Aestheticism, Socialist Realism, Surrealism, postmodernism, and (according to Freud) psychoanalysis. Among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting, printmaking, photography, cinema, musical tonality, atonality, jazz, rock, opera, and the symphony orchestra. Philosophers have invented logic (several times), dialectics, idealism, materialism, utopia, anarchism, semiotics, phenomenology, behaviorism, positivism, pragmatism, and deconstruction. Religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as monotheism, pantheism, Methodism, Mormonism, iconoclasm, puritanism, deism, secularism, ecumenism, and the Baháʼí Faith. Some of these disciplines, genres, and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord, but most of them have had inventors.

== Process ==
=== Practical means ===
Ideas for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by trial and error, by making models, by experimenting, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. Brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention. Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.

In addition, many inventors keep records of their working process – notebooks, photos, etc., including Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Evangelista Torricelli, Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein.

In the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even &quot;morph&quot; into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too.

History shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct. Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur. For example, the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality.

=== Conceptual means ===
Invention is often a creative process. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields. Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.

==== Play ====

Play may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one&#x27;s play instinct. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.

Sometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming, especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns. For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of Harry Potter) and Frank Hornby (the inventor of Meccano) first had their ideas while on train journeys.

In contrast, the successful aerospace engineer Max Munk advocated &quot;aimful thinking&quot;.

==== Re-envisioning ====

To invent is to see anew. Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their mind&#x27;s eye. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor&#x27;s focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash—a Eureka! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream &quot;like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision&quot;. Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).

==== Insight ====
Insight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insights may begin with questions, doubt or a hunch. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic—an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see conductive polymer, and organic light-emitting diode or OLED).

==== Exploration ====
Invention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.

==== Improvement ====
Inventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more ecologically friendly, or aesthetically different, lighter weight, more ergonomic, structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.

=== Implementation ===
In economic theory, inventions are one of the chief examples of &quot;positive externalities&quot;, a beneficial side effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity. One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized—unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions. The patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.

== Comparison with innovation ==
In contrast to invention, innovation is the implementation of a creative idea that specifically leads to greater value or usefulness. That is, while an invention may be useless or have no value yet still be an invention, an innovation must have some sort of value, typically economic.

== As defined by patent law ==

The term &quot;invention&quot; is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word. Additionally, the &quot;legal&quot; concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.

In Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, &quot;Is this an invention?&quot; If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive. The implication—counter-intuitively—is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries &quot;as such&quot; and software &quot;as such&quot;. The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italian and German tradition. British courts do not agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision (&quot;NRDC&quot;), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a &quot;restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.&quot;

In the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC § 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American &quot;patentable subject matter&quot; concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC § 101) virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts have been made to substantiate the &quot;abstract idea&quot; test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but none have succeeded. The last attempt so far was the &quot;machine or transformation&quot; test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.

In India, invention means a new product or process that involves an inventive step, and capable of being made or used in an industry. Whereas, &quot;new invention&quot; means any invention that has not been anticipated in any prior art or used in the country or anywhere in the world.

== In the arts ==
Invention has a long and important history in the arts. Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process. While some inventions in the arts are patentable, others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them. (see patent).

Some inventions in art include the:
* Collage and construction invented by Picasso
* Readymade art invented by Marcel Duchamp
* mobile invented by Alexander Calder
* Combine invented by Robert Rauschenberg
* Shaped painting invented by Frank Stella
* Motion picture, the invention of which is attributed to Eadweard Muybridge
* Video art invented by Nam June Paik
Likewise, Jackson Pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.

Inventive tools of the artist&#x27;s trade also produced advances in creativity. Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors. Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, e.g. Alexander Calder&#x27;s mobile, which is now commonly used over babies&#x27; cribs. Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work. Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&#x27;s 1879 design patent on the Statue of Liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.

The timeline for invention in the arts lists the most notable artistic inventors.

== Gender gap in inventions ==
Historically, women in many regions have been unrecognised for their inventive contributions (except Russia and France), despite being the sole inventor or co-inventor in inventions, including highly notable inventions. Notable examples include Margaret Knight who faced significant challenges in receiving credit for her inventions; Elizabeth Magie who was not credited for her invention of the game of Monopoly; and among other such examples, Chien-Shiung Wu whose male colleagues alone were awarded the Nobel Prize for their joint contributions to physics. Societal prejudice, institutional, educational and often legal patent barriers have both played a role in the gender invention gap. For example, although there could be found female patenters in US patent Office who also are likely to be helpful in their experience, still a patent applications made to the US Patent Office for inventions are less likely to succeed where the applicant have a &quot;feminine&quot; name, and additionally women could lose their independent legal patent rights to their husbands once married. See also the gender gap in patents.

<doc id="44318" wikidata="Q31556" url="?curid=44318" title="Phocas">
<text>Phocas (; ; 5475 October 610) was Byzantine emperor from 602 to 610. Initially a middle-ranking officer in the Eastern Roman army, Phocas rose to prominence as a spokesman for dissatisfied soldiers in their disputes with the court of the Emperor Maurice. When the army rebelled in 602, Phocas emerged as the leader of the mutiny. The revolt led to the overthrow of Maurice on 22 November 602, with Phocas being declared emperor the next day.

Phocas deeply mistrusted the uncooperative elite of Constantinople, to whom he was a usurper and a provincial boor. He therefore attempted to base his regime on relatives installed in high military and administrative positions. He immediately faced challenges in domestic and foreign affairs, and responded with little success. He dealt with domestic opposition with increasing ruthlessness that alienated ever wider circles, including some of his own household. At the same time, the Empire was threatened on multiple frontiers. Avars and Slavs renewed their destructive raids on the Balkans, and the Sasanian Empire launched a massive invasion of the eastern provinces. Finally, the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, rebelled against Phocas and gained wide support throughout the empire. Phocas attempted to use border troops to crush the rebellion, but this only resulted in allowing invaders to break into the heartlands of the Empire. Heraclius the Elder&#x27;s son, Heraclius, took Constantinople on 5 October 610, executed Phocas the same day, and declared himself emperor.

Surviving sources are universally extremely hostile to Phocas. He is described as an incompetent tyrant and usurper who brutally purged any real or perceived opposition and left the Empire wide open to foreign aggression. The veracity of these sources is difficult to ascertain since emperors of the Heraclian dynasty who succeeded Phocas had a vested interest in tarnishing his reputation.

==Life==
===Early life===
Phocas was probably born in 547, as he was said to be aged 55 when he became emperor. He and his family were likely of Thraco-Roman or Cappadocian origin. The life of Phocas before his usurpation of the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s throne is obscure, but he was said to have served as a centurion in the army in Thrace under Emperor Maurice.

Late in Maurice&#x27;s reign, the army sent Phocas to Constantinople as their spokesperson to complain about the conduct of general Comentiolus. As Phocas presented their case, he argued with the emperor, and as a result, had his beard pulled by an outraged person of patrician rank.

===Usurpation===
In autumn 602, the Thracian army rebelled against Maurice, largely due to exhaustion and outrage over orders to continue campaigning north of the Danube in winter, as well as previous cuts in wages. The army initially sent a delegation, which included Phocas, to general Peter and demanded a dismissal within the Roman borders. But when Maurice reiterated his command, the troops made Phocas their leader and marched to Constantinople. They insisted that Maurice abdicate and offered to proclaim as successors Theodosius, son of Maurice, or his father-in-law Germanus. As Maurice tried to arrest Germanus, riots broke out in Constantinople. That night, on 22 November 602, Maurice and his family fled on a warship to Bithynia, sending Theodosius on a mission to ask for Persian King Khusrow II&#x27;s help. According to Theophylact Simocatta (), Germanus initially made an attempt for the throne, but when rebuffed by the Green circus faction, he paid homage to Phocas, who had emerged as the heavy favorite.

On 23 November 602, Phocas was crowned by the patriarch Cyriacus in the church of St John the Baptist at the Hebdomon. He entered Constantinople in a ceremonial procession two days later, on 25 November, while being unanimously acclaimed.

Maurice and his sons were soon captured and executed. There were, however, stories that Theodosius managed to escape to Persia. Maurice&#x27;s wife Constantina and daughters were put in the monastery of Nea Metanoia. They were executed around 605, when Constantina and Germanus were found conspiring after hearing rumors of Theodosius&#x27; survival.

===Foreign conflict===
Despite the executions of the previous emperor and his dynastic successors, Phocas remained in a precarious position, which led him to devote his energy to purging enemies and destroying conspiracies. Because of this focus, and the local resistance he faced all throughout the Byzantine Empire, he was unable to confront foreign attacks on the empire&#x27;s frontiers. The Avars and Slavs launched numerous raids into the Balkan provinces of the Byzantine Empire, and the Sassanian Empire launched an invasion of the eastern provinces of the empire.

The Avars were able to take all land in the Balkans north of Thessalonica. The populations of Christian cities were slaughtered or captured. The Byzantines transferred most of their forces to the eastern front due to the threat from the Persians.

The Sassanid Persians had formerly been at peace with Maurice as a result of a treaty they made with him in 591. After Phocas usurped and killed Maurice, the Persians invaded the empire in 603. The Sassanids rapidly occupied the eastern provinces, leading the &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot;, Narses, to defect to their side. Phocas swiftly dealt with him, by inviting him to Constantinople under the promise of safe conduct, then having him burnt alive when he arrived. By 607, the Sassanids had occupied Mesopotamia, Syria, and much of Asia Minor, as far as the Bosphorus.

By the time his reign ended in 610, the Persians had already crossed the Euphrates and taken Zenobia. Contemporary accounts describe the Persians as being very brutal to the occupied population. The &#x27;miracle of St Demetrios&#x27; described the carnage:

[T]he devil raised the whirlwind of hatred in all the East, Cilicia, Asia, Palestine and all the lands from there to Constantinople: the factions, no longer content simply to spill blood in public places, attacked homes, slaughtered women, children, the aged, and the young who were sick; those whose youth and frailty impeded their escape from the massacre, [saw] their friends, acquaintances, and parents pillaged, and after all that, even set on fire so that the most wretched inhabitant was not able to escape.

===Administration ===
Phocas frequently filled senior posts with his relatives, due to his isolation from the bulk of Constantinople&#x27;s elite, with whom he had had no connection before, or because of Constantinople&#x27;s system of imperial patronage which prioritized loyalty to the emperor. Phocas installed: his brother Domentziolus as &quot;Magister officiorum&quot; in 603; his nephew Domentziolus as &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot; in 604, giving him command over the eastern provinces; and his brother Comentiolus as &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot; around 610. All three remained loyal to Phocas until they were killed by Heraclius. On the other hand, Phocas appointed Priscus, a general of the previous regime, as the Count of the Excubitors (&quot;comes excubitorum&quot;) in 603. Priscus would later marry Phocas&#x27; daughter Domentzia around 607. During his reign, Phocas was unable to control either the state or the army effectively.

===Italian policy===
When Phocas was emperor, Byzantine Italy was under continual attack from Lombards, but the Byzantine government spent few resources to aid Italy due to troubles elsewhere. In the entirety of Phocas&#x27; reign, the only public structure built with taxes in the city of Rome was a statue of Phocas completed in 608.

When Phocas usurped Maurice, Gregory the Great was bishop of Rome and he praised Phocas as a restorer of liberty. Gregory referred to him as a pious and clement lord, and compared his wife (the new Empress) Leontia to Marcian&#x27;s consort Pulcheria (whom the Council of Chalcedon called the new Helena). In May 603, portraits of the imperial couple arrived in Rome and were ordered by the pope to be placed in the oratory of St. Caesarius in the imperial palace on the Palatine.

Imperial approval was needed at that time to appoint a new pope, but the approval was delayed by a year upon the death of Pope Sabinian in 606, as Phocas was occupied with killing internal enemies that threatened his rule. He finally gave approval in 607 and Boniface III became pope. Phocas declared Rome &quot;the head of all churches&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Phocas had a gilded statue of himself erected on a monumental column in the Roman Forum, known as the Column of Phocas.

===Downfall===

Despite being appointed as &quot;Comes excubitorum&quot;, Priscus was not loyal to Phocas, and in 608 he appealed to Heraclius the Elder, the Exarch of Carthage, to rebel against Phocas. Heraclius the Elder agreed, and began to prepare to invade, by cutting off the supply of grain to Constantinople and assembling a large army and navy. Heraclius the Elder launched his invasion in 609, with his nephew, Nicetas, marching troops overland to the capital, and his son, Heraclius, leading a naval invasion of Thessalonica, before marching to Constantinople. Heraclius arrived outside Constantinople on 3 October 610, and seized the city on 5 October. Heraclius was declared emperor on the same day, and swiftly had Phocas executed.

== Legacy ==
Phocas is generally depicted as a villain by Byzantines and modern historians alike, but some of the earliest sources available about Phocas&#x27; reign were written during the reign of Heraclius. The writings that survive are not reliably neutral and the writers would have good reason to demonize him in order to strengthen the rule of Heraclius.

The reign of Phocas is marked by the change of imperial fashion set by Constantine the Great (). Starting with Constantine, it became common again to show emperors as clean-shaven on coinage. However, Phocas was consistently depicted with a beard and this became the convention until the end of the Byzantine Empire.

On 19 February 607, Emperor Phocas appointed Boniface III as the new bishop of Rome, then Phocas issued an imperial decree by the Roman government, recognizing Boniface III as the &quot;Head of all Churches&quot; and &quot;Universal Bishop&quot;. Phocas transferred the title of &quot;Universal Bishop&quot; from the Diocese of Constantinople to the Diocese of Rome. Boniface sought and obtained a decree from Phocas in which he restated that &quot;the See of Blessed Peter the Apostle should be the head of all the Churches&quot; and ensured that the title of &quot;Universal Bishop&quot; belonged exclusively to the Bishop of Rome. This act effectively ended the attempt by Patriarch Cyriacus of Constantinople to establish himself as &quot;Universal Bishop&quot;.

In calling the Pope the &quot;head of all churches&quot;, Phocas&#x27; decree has been important in discussions about papal primacy and papal supremacy. Some Protestant historicist commentators have seen the decree of Phocas (usually taken to be in 606) as having eschatological significance. For example, in his &quot;Horae Apocalypticae&quot;, Edward Bishop Elliott took the 1260 days of Revelation 11:3 to be the period between 606 and the Unification of Italy in 1866.

<text>Elizabeth or Elizaveta Petrovna (; ) was Empress of Russia from 1741 until her death in 1762. She remains one of the most popular Russian monarchs because of her decision not to execute a single person during her reign, her numerous construction projects, and her strong opposition to Prussian policies.

The second-eldest daughter of Tsar Peter the Great (), Elizabeth lived through the confused successions of her father&#x27;s descendants following her half-brother Alexei&#x27;s death in 1718. The throne first passed to her mother Catherine I of Russia (), then to her nephew Peter II, who died in 1730 and was succeeded by Elizabeth&#x27;s first cousin Anna (). After the brief rule of Anna&#x27;s infant great-nephew, Ivan VI, Elizabeth seized the throne with the military&#x27;s support and declared her own nephew, the future Peter III, her heir.

During her reign Elizabeth continued the policies of her father and brought about a remarkable Age of Enlightenment in Russia. Her domestic policies allowed the nobles to gain dominance in local government while shortening their terms of service to the state. She encouraged Mikhail Lomonosov&#x27;s foundation of the University of Moscow, the highest-ranking Russian educational institution. Her court became one of the most splendid in all Europe, especially regarding architecture: she modernised Russia&#x27;s roads, encouraged Ivan Shuvalov&#x27;s foundation of the Imperial Academy of Arts, and financed grandiose Baroque projects of her favourite architect, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, particularly in Peterhof Palace. The Winter Palace and the Smolny Cathedral in Saint Petersburg are among the chief monuments of her reign.

Elizabeth led the Russian Empire during the two major European conflicts of her time: the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748) and the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). She and diplomat Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin solved the first event by forming an alliance with Austria and France, but indirectly caused the second. Russian troops enjoyed several victories against Prussia and briefly occupied Berlin, but when Frederick the Great was finally considering surrender in January 1762, the Russian Empress died. She was the last agnatic member of the House of Romanov to reign over the Russian Empire.

==Early life==
===Childhood and teenage years===

Elizabeth was born at Kolomenskoye, near Moscow, Russia, on 18 December 1709 (O.S.). Her parents were Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia and Catherine. Catherine was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński, a subject of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Saint Petersburg at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (&quot;princess&quot;) on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter&#x27;s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.

As a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education. Despite this, Elizabeth was still considered to be a bright girl, if not brilliant, and had a French governess who gave lessons of mathematics, arts, languages, and sports. She grew interested in architecture, became fluent in Italian, German, and French, and became an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, she was physically active and loved horseriding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening.

From her earliest years, Elizabeth was recognised as a vivacious young woman, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British ambassador described Grand Duchess Elizabeth as &quot;fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay, and talks to everyone...&quot;

===Marriage plans===

With much of his fame resting on his effective efforts to modernise Russia, Tsar Peter desired to see his children married into the royal houses of Europe, something which his immediate predecessors had consciously tended to avoid. Peter&#x27;s son Aleksei Petrovich, born of his first marriage to a Russian noblewoman, had no problem securing a bride from the ancient house of Brunswick-Lüneburg. However, the Tsar experienced difficulties in arranging similar marriages for the daughters born of his second wife. When Peter offered either of his daughters in marriage to the future Louis XV, the Bourbons of France snubbed him due to the girls&#x27; post-facto legitimisation.

In 1724, Peter betrothed his daughters to two young princes, first cousins to each other, who hailed from the tiny north German principality of Holstein-Gottorp and whose family was undergoing a period of political and economic turmoil. Anna Petrovna (aged 16) was to marry Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who was then living in exile in Russia as Peter&#x27;s guest after having failed in his attempt to succeed his maternal uncle as King of Sweden and whose patrimony was at that time under Danish occupation. Despite all this, the prince was of impeccable birth and well-connected to many royal houses; it was a respectable and politically useful alliance. In the same year, Elizabeth was betrothed to marry Charles Frederick&#x27;s first cousin, Charles Augustus of Holstein-Gottorp, the eldest son of Christian Augustus, Prince of Eutin. Anna Petrovna&#x27;s wedding took place in 1725 as planned, even though her father had died () a few weeks before the nuptials. In Elizabeth&#x27;s case, however, her fiancé died on 31 May 1727, before her wedding could be celebrated. This came as a double blow to Elizabeth, because her mother (who had ascended to the throne as Catherine I) had died just two weeks previously, on 17 May 1727.

By the end of May 1727, 17-year-old Elizabeth had lost her fiancé and both of her parents. Furthermore, her half-nephew Peter II had ascended the throne. Her marriage prospects continued to fail to improve three years later, when her nephew died and was succeeded on the throne by Elizabeth&#x27;s first cousin Anna, daughter of Ivan V. There was little love lost between the cousins and no prospect of either any Russian nobleman or any foreign prince seeking Elizabeth&#x27;s hand in marriage. Nor could she marry a commoner because it would cost her royal status, property rights and claim to the throne. The fact that Elizabeth was something of a beauty did not improve marriage prospects, but instead earned her resentment. When the Empress Anna asked the Chinese minister in Saint Petersburg to identify the most beautiful woman at her court, he pointed to Elizabeth, much to Anna&#x27;s displeasure.

Elizabeth&#x27;s response to the lack of marriage prospects was to take Alexander Shubin, a sergeant in the Semyonovsky Life Guards Regiment, as her lover. When Empress Anna found out about this, she banished him to Siberia. After consoling herself, Elizabeth turned to coachmen and footmen for her sexual pleasure. She eventually found a long-term companion in Alexei Razumovsky, a kind-hearted Ukrainian Cossack with a good bass voice. Razumovsky had been brought from his village to Saint Petersburg by a nobleman to sing for a church choir, but the Grand Duchess purchased the talented serf from the nobleman for her own choir. A simple-minded man, Razumovsky never showed interest in affairs of state during all the years of his relationship with Elizabeth, which spanned from the days of her obscurity to the height of her power. As the couple was devoted to each other, there is reason to believe that they might even have married in a secret ceremony. In 1742, the Holy Roman Emperor made Razumovsky a count of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1756, Elizabeth made him a prince and field marshal.

==Imperial coup==
While Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov remained in power (until September 1727), the government of Elizabeth&#x27;s adolescent nephew Peter II (reigned 1727–1730) treated her with liberality and distinction. However, the Dolgorukovs, an ancient boyar family, deeply resented Menshikov. With Peter II&#x27;s attachment to Prince Ivan Dolgorukov and two of their family members on the Supreme State Council, they had the leverage for a successful . Menshikov was arrested, stripped of all his honours and properties, and exiled to northern Siberia, where he died in November 1729. The Dolgorukovs hated the memory of Peter the Great and practically banished his daughter from Court.

During the reign of her cousin Anna (1730–1740), Elizabeth was gathering support in the background. Being the daughter of Peter the Great, she enjoyed much support from the Russian Guards regiments. She often visited the elite Guards regiments, marking special events with the officers and acting as godmother to their children. After the death of Empress Anna, the regency of Anna Leopoldovna for the infant Ivan VI was marked by high taxes and economic problems. The French ambassador in Saint Petersburg, the Marquis de La Chétardie was deeply involved in planning a coup to depose the regent, whose foreign policy was opposed to the interests of France, and bribed numerous officers in the Imperial Guard to support Elizabeth&#x27;s coup. The French adventurer Jean Armand de Lestocq helped her actions according to the advice of the marquis de La Chétardie and the Swedish ambassador, who were particularly interested in toppling the regime of Anna Leopoldovna.

On the night of 25 November 1741 (O.S.), Elizabeth seized power with the help of the Preobrazhensky Life Guards Regiment. Arriving at the regimental headquarters wearing a warrior&#x27;s metal breastplate over her dress and grasping a silver cross, she challenged them: &quot;Whom do you want to serve: me, your natural sovereign, or those who have stolen my inheritance?&quot; Won over, the regiment marched to the Winter Palace and arrested the infant Emperor, his parents, and their own lieutenant-colonel, Count Burkhard Christoph von Munnich. It was a daring coup and, amazingly, succeeded without bloodshed. Elizabeth had vowed that if she became Empress, she would not sign a single death sentence, an extraordinary promise at the time but one that she kept throughout her life.

Despite Elizabeth&#x27;s promise, there was still cruelty in her regime. Although she initially thought of allowing the young tsar and his mother to leave Russia, she imprisoned them later in a Shlisselburg Fortress, worried that they would stir up trouble for her in other parts of Europe. Fearing a coup on Ivan&#x27;s favour, Elizabeth set about destroying all papers, coins or anything else depicting or mentioning Ivan. She had issued an order that if any attempt were made for the adult Ivan to escape, he was to be eliminated. Catherine the Great upheld the order, and when an attempt was made, he was killed and secretly buried within the fortress.

Another case was Countess Natalia Lopukhina. The circumstances of Elizabeth&#x27;s birth would later be used by her political opponents to challenge her right to the throne on grounds of illegitimacy. When Countess Lopukhina&#x27;s son, Ivan Lopukhin, complained of Elizabeth in a tavern, he implicated his mother, himself and others in a plot to reinstate Ivan VI as tsar. Ivan Lopukhin was overheard and tortured for information. All the conspirators were sentenced to death. The female conspirators had their sentences commuted to having their tongues removed and being publicly flogged. The men were broken on the wheel.

==Reign==

Elizabeth crowned herself Empress in the Dormition Cathedral on 25 April 1742 (O.S.), which would become standard for all emperors of Russia until 1896. At the age of thirty-three, with relatively little political experience, she found herself at the head of a great empire at one of the most critical periods of its existence. Her proclamation explained that the preceding reigns had led Russia to ruin: &quot;The Russian people have been groaning under the enemies of the Christian faith, but she has delivered them from the degrading foreign oppression.&quot;

Russia had been under the domination of German advisers, so Elizabeth exiled the most unpopular of them, including Andrey Osterman and Burkhard Christoph von Münnich. She passed down several pieces of legislation that undid much of the work her father had done to limit the power of the church.

With all her shortcomings (documents often waited months for her signature), Elizabeth had inherited her father&#x27;s genius for government. Her usually keen judgement and her diplomatic tact again and again recalled Peter the Great. What sometimes appeared as irresolution and procrastination was most often a wise suspension of judgement under exceptionally difficult circumstances. From the Russian point of view, her greatness as a stateswoman consisted of her steady appreciation of national interests and her determination to promote them against all obstacles.

===Educational reforms===

Despite the substantial changes made by Peter the Great, he had not exercised a really formative influence on the intellectual attitudes of the ruling classes as a whole. Although Elizabeth lacked the early education necessary to flourish as an intellectual (once finding the reading of secular literature to be &quot;injurious to health&quot;), she was clever enough to know its benefits and made considerable groundwork for her eventual successor, Catherine the Great. She made education freely available to all social classes (except for serfs), encouraged establishment of the first university in Russia founded in Moscow by Mikhail Lomonosov, and helped to finance the establishment of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts.

===Internal peace===

A gifted diplomat, Elizabeth hated bloodshed and conflict and went to great lengths to alter the Russian system of punishment, even outlawing capital punishment. According to historian Robert Nisbet Bain, it was one of her &quot;chief glories that, so far as she was able, she put a stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anna and Ivan VI and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia.&quot;

===Construction projects===

Elizabeth enjoyed and excelled in architecture, overseeing and financing many construction projects during her reign. One of the many projects from the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli was the reconstruction of Peterhof Palace, adding several wings between 1745 and 1755. Her most famous creations were the Smolny Convent and the Winter Palace, though she died before its completion. The Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors, and 1,945 windows, including bureaucratic offices and the Imperial Family&#x27;s living quarters arranged in two enfilades, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. Regarding the Smolny Convent, historian Robert Nisbet Bain stated that &quot;No other Russian sovereign ever erected so many churches.&quot;

The expedited completion of buildings became a matter of importance to the Empress and work continued throughout the year, even in winter&#x27;s severest months. 859,555 rubles had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns, but work temporarily ceased due to lack of resources. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to completely fund the extra costs. However, Elizabeth&#x27;s incredible extravagance ended up greatly benefiting the country&#x27;s infrastructure. Needing goods shipped from all over the world, numerous roads in all Russia were modernised at her orders.

===Selection of an heir===

As an unmarried and childless empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth to find a legitimate heir to secure the Romanov dynasty. She chose her nephew, Peter of Holstein-Gottorp. The young Peter had lost his mother shortly after he was born, and his father at the age of eleven. Elizabeth invited her young nephew to Saint Petersburg, where he was received into the Russian Orthodox Church and proclaimed the heir to the throne on 7 November 1742. Keen to see the dynasty secured, Elizabeth immediately gave Peter the best Russian tutors and settled on Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst as a bride for her heir. Incidentally, Sophie&#x27;s mother, Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, was a sister of Elizabeth&#x27;s own fiancé, who had died before the wedding. On her conversion to the Russian Orthodox Church, Sophie was given the name Catherine in memory of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother. The marriage took place on 21 August 1745. Nine years later a son, the future Paul I, was born on 20 September 1754.

There is considerable speculation as to the actual paternity of Paul. It is suggested that he was not Peter&#x27;s son at all but that his mother had engaged in an affair, to which Elizabeth had consented, with a young officer, Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, who would have been Paul&#x27;s biological father. Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself but took no interest in parenthood. Elizabeth most certainly took an active interest and acted as if she were his mother, instead of Catherine. Shortly after Paul&#x27;s birth the Empress ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her, and Catherine did not see her child for another month, for a short churching ceremony. Six months later, Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had, in effect, become a ward of the state and, in a larger sense, the property of the state.

==Foreign policy==
Elizabeth abolished the cabinet council system that had been used under Anna, and reconstituted the Senate as it had been under Peter the Great, with the chiefs of the departments of state (none of them German) attending. Her first task after this was to address the war with Sweden. On 23 January 1743, direct negotiations between the two powers were opened at Åbo. In the Treaty of Åbo, on 7 August 1743 (O.S.), Sweden ceded to Russia all of southern Finland east of the Kymmene River, which became the boundary between the two states. The treaty also gave Russia the fortresses of Villmanstrand and Fredrikshamn.

=== Bestuzhev ===
The concessions to Russia can be credited to the diplomatic ability of the new vice chancellor, Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, who had Elizabeth&#x27;s support. She placed Bestuzhev at the head of foreign affairs immediately after her accession. He represented the anti-Franco-Prussian side of her council, and his objective was an alliance with England and Austria. At that time, it was probably advantageous to Russia. Both the Lopukhina affair and other attempts of Frederick the Great and Louis XV to get rid of Bestuzhev failed. Instead, they put the Russian court into the centre of a tangle of intrigue during the earlier years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. Ultimately, the minister&#x27;s strong support from the Empress prevailed.
Bestuzhev had many achievements. His effective diplomacy and 30,000 troops sent to the Rhine accelerated the peace negotiations, leading to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (18 October 1748). He extricated his country from the Swedish imbroglio and reconciled his imperial mistress with the courts of Vienna and London. He enabled Russia to assert herself effectually in Poland, the Ottoman Empire, Sweden and isolated the King of Prussia by forcing him into hostile alliances. All this would have been impossible without the steady support of Elizabeth who trusted him completely in spite of the Chancellor&#x27;s many enemies, most of whom were her personal friends.

However, on 14 February 1758, Bestuzhev was removed from office. The future Catherine II recorded, &quot;He was relieved of all his decorations and rank, without a soul being able to reveal for what crimes or transgressions the first gentleman of the Empire was so despoiled, and sent back to his house as a prisoner.&quot; No specific crime was ever pinned on Bestuzhev. Instead, it was inferred that he had attempted to sow discord between the Empress and her heir and his consort. Enemies of the pro-Austrian Bestuzhev were his rivals; the Shuvalov family, Vice-Chancellor Mikhail Vorontsov, and the French ambassador.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

The great event of Elizabeth&#x27;s later years was the Seven Years&#x27; War. Elizabeth regarded the Convention of Westminster (16 January 1756) in which Great Britain and Prussia agreed to unite their forces to oppose the entry of or the passage through Germany of troops of every foreign power, as utterly subversive of the previous conventions between Great Britain and Russia. Elizabeth sided against Prussia over a personal dislike of Frederick the Great. She wanted him reduced within proper limits so that he might no longer be an alleged danger to the empire. Elizabeth acceded to the Second Treaty of Versailles, thus entering into an alliance with France and Austria against Prussia. On 17 May 1757, the Imperial Russian Army, 85,000 strong, advanced against Königsberg.

The serious illness of the Empress, which began with a fainting-fit at Tsarskoe Selo (19 September 1757), the fall of Bestuzhev (21 February 1758) and the cabals and intrigues of the various foreign powers at Saint Petersburg, did not interfere with the progress of the war. The crushing defeat of Kunersdorf (12 August 1759) at last brought Frederick to the verge of ruin. From that day, he despaired of success, but he was saved for the moment by the jealousies of the Russian and Austrian commanders, which ruined the military plans of the allies.

From the end of 1759 to the end of 1761, the eagerness of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force that held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view, her greatness as a stateswoman consisted of her steady appreciation of Russian interests and her determination to promote them against all obstacles. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be reduced to the rank of a Prince-Elector.

Frederick himself was quite aware of his danger. &quot;I&#x27;m at the end of my resources,&quot; he wrote at the beginning of 1760. &quot;The continuance of this war means for me utter ruin. Things may drag on perhaps till July, but then a catastrophe must come.&quot; On 21 May 1760, a fresh convention was signed between Russia and Austria, a secret clause of which, never communicated to the court of Versailles, guaranteed East Prussia to Russia as an indemnity for war expenses. The failure of the campaign of 1760, wielded by the inept Count Buturlin, induced the court of Versailles on the evening of 22 January 1761 to present to the court of Saint Petersburg a dispatch to the effect that the king of France, by reason of the condition of his dominions, absolutely desired peace. The Russian empress&#x27;s reply was delivered to the two ambassadors on 12 February. It was inspired by the most uncompromising hostility towards the king of Prussia. Elizabeth would not consent to any pacific overtures until the original object of the league had been accomplished.

Simultaneously, Elizabeth had conveyed to Louis XV a confidential letter in which she proposed the signature of a new treaty of alliance of a more comprehensive and explicit nature than the preceding treaties between the two powers without the knowledge of Austria. Elizabeth&#x27;s object in the mysterious negotiation seems to have been to reconcile France and Great Britain, in return for which signal service France was to throw all her forces into the attack on Prussia. This project, which lacked neither ability nor audacity, foundered upon Louis XV&#x27;s invincible jealousy of the growth of Russian influence in Eastern Europe and his fear of offending the Porte. It was finally arranged by the allies that their envoys at Paris should fix the date for the assembling of a peace congress and that in the meantime, the war against Prussia should be vigorously prosecuted. In 1760 a Russian flying column briefly occupied Berlin. Russian victories placed Prussia in serious danger.

The campaign of 1761 was almost as abortive as the campaign of 1760. Frederick acted on the defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian fortress of Kolberg on Christmas Day 1761, by Rumyantsev, was the sole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, &quot;We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies.&quot; A fortnight later, he wrote to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, &quot;The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear fellow. I have received the news of a great event.&quot; The Miracle of the House of Brandenburg that snatched him from destruction was the death of the Russian empress, on 5 January 1762 (N.S.).

===Siberia===

In 1742, the imperial government at Saint Petersburg ordered a Russian military expedition to conquer the Chukchi and Koryaks, but the expedition failed and its commander, Major Dmitry Pavlutsky, was killed in 1747. On 12 March 1747, a party of 500 Chukchi warriors raided the Russian stockade of Anadyrsk. By 1750, it had become clear the Chukchi would be difficult to conquer. The Empress then changed her tactical approach and established a formal peace with them.

==Court==
Elizabeth&#x27;s court was one of the most splendid in all Europe. As historian Mikhail Shcherbatov stated, the court was &quot;arrayed in cloth of gold, her nobles satisfied with only the most luxurious garments, the most expensive foods, the rarest drinks, that largest number of servants and they applied this standard of lavishness to their dress as well&quot;. A great number of silver and gold objects were produced, the most the country had seen thus far in its history. It was common to order over a thousand bottles of French champagnes and wines to be served at one event and to serve pineapples at all receptions, despite the difficulty of procuring the fruit in such quantities.

French plays quickly became the most popular and often were performed twice a week. In tandem, music became very important. Many attribute its popularity to Elizabeth&#x27;s supposed husband, the &quot;Emperor of the Night&quot;, Alexei Razumovsky, who reportedly relished music. Elizabeth spared no expense in importing leading musical talents from Germany, France, and Italy. She reportedly owned 15,000 dresses, several thousand pairs of shoes and a seemingly unlimited number of stockings.

Attractive in her youth and vain as an adult, Elizabeth passed various decrees intended to make herself stand out: she issued an edict against anyone wearing the same hairstyle, dress, or accessory as the Empress. One woman accidentally wore the same item as the Empress and was lashed across the face for it. Another law required French fabric salesmen to sell to the Empress first, and those who disregarded that law were arrested. One famous story exemplifying her vanity is that once Elizabeth got a bit of powder in her hair and was unable to remove it except by cutting a patch of her hair. She made all of the court ladies cut patches out of their hair too, which they did &quot;with tears in their eyes&quot;. This aggressive vanity became a tenet of the court throughout her reign, particularly as she grew older. According to historian Tamara Talbot Rice, &quot;Later in life her outbursts of anger were directed either against people who were thought to have endangered Russia&#x27;s security or against women whose beauty rivalled her own&quot;.

Despite her volatile and often violent reactions to others regarding her appearance, Elizabeth was ebullient in most other matters, particularly when it came to court entertainment. It was reported that she threw two balls a week; one would be a large event with an average of 800 guests in attendance, most of whom were the nation&#x27;s leading merchants, members of the lower nobility and guards stationed in and around the city of the event. The other ball was a much smaller affair reserved for her closest friends and members of the highest echelons of nobility. The smaller gatherings began as masked balls, but evolved into the famous metamorphoses balls by 1744. At these metamorphoses balls, guests were expected to dress as the opposite sex, with Elizabeth often dressing up as Cossack or carpenter in honour of her father. Costumes not permitted at the event were those of pilgrims and harlequins, which she considered profane and indecent respectively. Most courtiers thoroughly disliked the balls, as most guests by decree looked ridiculous, but Elizabeth adored them; as Catherine the Great&#x27;s advisor Potemkin posited, this was because she was &quot;the only woman who looked truly fine and completely a man... As she was tall and possessed a powerful body, male attire suited her&quot;. Kazimierz Waliszewski noted that Elizabeth had beautiful legs, and loved to wear male attire because of the tight trousers. Though the balls were by far her most personally beloved and lavish events, Elizabeth often threw children&#x27;s birthday parties and wedding receptions for those affiliated with her Court, going so far as to provide dowries for each of her ladies-in-waiting.

==Death==
In the late 1750s, Elizabeth&#x27;s health started to decline. She suffered a series of dizzy spells and refused to take the medication she had been prescribed. The Empress forbade the word &quot;death&quot; in her presence until she suffered a stroke on 24 December 1761 (O.S.). Knowing that she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying, and to say farewell to the few people who wished to be with her, including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and Kirill Razumovsky.

The Empress died the next day, Orthodox Christmas, 1761. For her lying in state, she was dressed in a shimmering silver dress. It was said that she was beautiful in death as she had been in life. She was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 3 February 1762 (O.S.) six weeks after her lying in state.

<doc id="44324" wikidata="Q1434" url="?curid=44324" title="Commodus">
<text>Commodus (; 31 August 161 – 31 December 192) was Roman emperor from 177 to 192, first serving as nominal co-emperor under his father Marcus Aurelius and then ruling alone from 180. Commodus&#x27;s sole reign is commonly thought to mark the end of a golden age of peace and prosperity in the history of the Roman Empire (the Pax Romana).

Commodus accompanied his father during the Marcomannic Wars in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. The following year, he became the youngest emperor and consul up to that point, at the age of 16. His solo reign saw less military conflict than that of Marcus Aurelius, but internal intrigues and conspiracies abounded, goading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership. This culminated in his creating a deific personality cult, including his performances as a gladiator in the Colosseum. Throughout his reign, Commodus entrusted the management of affairs to his palace chamberlain and praetorian prefects, namely Saoterus, Perennis and Cleander.

Commodus was assassinated by the wrestler Narcissus in 192, ending the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. He was succeeded by Pertinax, the first claimant in the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors.

==Early life and rise to power (161–180)==
===Early life===
Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus was born on 31 August AD161 in Lanuvium, near Rome. He was the son of the reigning emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and Aurelius&#x27; first cousin, Faustina the Younger, the youngest daughter of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who had died only a few months before. Commodus had an elder twin brother, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, who died in 165. On 12 October 166, Commodus was made &quot;caesar&quot; together with his younger brother, Marcus Annius Verus. The latter died in 169 having failed to recover from an operation, which left Commodus as Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s sole surviving son.

He was looked after by his father&#x27;s physician, Galen, who treated many of Commodus&#x27; common illnesses. Commodus received extensive tutoring from a multitude of teachers with a focus on intellectual education. Among his teachers, Onesicrates, Antistius Capella, Titus Aius Sanctus, and Pitholaus are mentioned.


Commodus is known to have been at Carnuntum, the headquarters of Marcus Aurelius during the Marcomannic Wars, in 172. It is presumed that there, on 15 October 172, he was given the victory title &quot;Germanicus&quot;, in the presence of the army. The title suggests Commodus was present at his father&#x27;s victory over the Marcomanni. On 20 January 175, Commodus entered the College of Pontiffs, the starting point of a career in public life.

In 175, Avidius Cassius, Governor of Syria, declared himself emperor following rumours that Marcus Aurelius had died. Having been accepted as emperor by Syria, Palestina and Egypt, Cassius carried on his rebellion even after it had become obvious Marcus was still alive. During the preparations for the campaign against Cassius, Commodus assumed his &quot;toga virilis&quot; on the Danubian front on 7 July 175, thus formally entering adulthood. Cassius, however, was killed by one of his centurions before the campaign against him could begin. Commodus subsequently accompanied his father on a lengthy trip to the Eastern provinces, during which he visited Antioch. The Emperor and his son then travelled to Athens, where they were initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. They then returned to Rome in the autumn of 176.

Marcus Aurelius was the first emperor since Vespasian to have a legitimate biological son, though he himself was the fifth in the line of the so-called Five Good Emperors, also known as the Adoptive Emperors, each of whom had adopted his successor. He was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor &quot;born in the purple,&quot; meaning during his father&#x27;s reign.

On 27 November 176, Marcus Aurelius bestowed the title of &quot;Imperator&quot; on Commodus. Modern authors often use this date as the beginning of his reign, but the exact chronology of events is uncertain. Commodus is first mentioned as &quot;Augustus&quot; (emperor) on 17 June 177, but he reckoned his reign back to his salutation in 176. For instance, he assumed the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power) around February 177, but in April 177 he started to backdate this event to November 176.

On 23 December 176, the two &quot;imperatores&quot; celebrated a joint triumph. On 1 January 177, Commodus became consul for the first time, which made him, aged 15, the youngest consul up to that time (the minimum age for the consulship was around 30). He subsequently married Bruttia Crispina before accompanying his father to the Danubian front once more in 178. Marcus Aurelius died there on 17 March 180, leaving the 18-year-old Commodus as sole emperor.

==Sole reign (180–192)==

Upon his ascension, Commodus devalued the Roman currency. He reduced the weight of the denarius from 96 per Roman pound to 105 per Roman pound (3.85 grams to 3.35 grams). He also reduced the silver purity from 79 percent to 76 percent – the silver weight dropping from 2.57 grams to 2.34 grams. In 186, he further reduced the purity and silver weight to 74 percent and 2.22 grams respectively, being 108 to the Roman pound. His reduction of the denarius during his rule was the largest since the empire&#x27;s first devaluation during Nero&#x27;s reign.

Whereas the reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare, Commodus&#x27; rule was comparatively peaceful in the military sense, but was also characterised by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of Cassius Dio, his accession marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust&quot;.

Despite his notoriety, and considering the importance of his reign, Commodus&#x27; years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are Herodian, Cassius Dio (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer and Senator during Commodus&#x27; reign, whose reports for this period survive only as fragments and abbreviations), and the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; (untrustworthy because of its character as a work of literature rather than of history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it probably embroiders what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).

Commodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180. Unlike the preceding emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, he seems to have had little interest in the business of administration. He tended throughout his reign to leave the practical running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning with Saoterus, a freedman from Nicomedia who had become his chamberlain.

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs led to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner. Nevertheless, though the senatorial order came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign, not least because of his lavish shows of largesse (recorded on his coinage) and because he staged and took part in spectacular gladiatorial combats. He was not an inspired combatant. He killed animals by bow, standing above the arena. When he fought fellow gladiators, they would purposely submit. During this period Rome&#x27;s economy declined.

One of the ways he paid for his donatives (imperial handouts) and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order. On many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (&quot;Senatus Populusque Romanus&quot;) was provocatively reversed (&quot;Populus Senatusque...&quot;).

===Conspiracies of 182===

At the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 18, inherited many of his father&#x27;s senior advisers, notably Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus (the second husband of Commodus&#x27; eldest sister Lucilla), his father-in-law Gaius Bruttius Praesens, Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio, and Aufidius Victorinus the Prefect of the City of Rome. He also had four surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Lucilla was over ten years his senior and held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband, Lucius Verus.

The first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been the envy of the Empress Crispina. Lucilla&#x27;s husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men alleged to have been her lovers, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus (the consul of 167, also her first cousin) and Appius Claudius Quintianus, attempted to murder Commodus as he entered a theater. They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard.

Quadratus and Quintianus were executed. Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two praetorian prefects, Publius Tarrutenius Paternus, had actually been involved in the conspiracy but his involvement was not discovered until later. In the meantime, he and his colleague, Sextus Tigidius Perennis, were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.

Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy, one apparently led by Publius Salvius Julianus, the son of the jurist Salvius Julianus and betrothed to Paternus&#x27; daughter. Salvius and Paternus were executed along with a number of other prominent consulars and senators. Didius Julianus, the future emperor and a relative of Salvius Julianus, was dismissed from the governorship of Germania Inferior.

====Cleander====
After the murder of the powerful Saoterus, Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in Cleander, a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor&#x27;s mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus. After these attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. As he was physically strong, his chief interest was sport: he took part in horse racing, chariot racing, and combat with beasts and men, mostly in private but occasionally in public.

===Dacia and Britain===
Commodus was inaugurated in 183 as consul with Aufidius Victorinus as colleague and assumed the title &quot;Pius&quot;. War broke out in Dacia: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne, Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger, both distinguished themselves in the campaign. Also, in Britain in 184, the governor Ulpius Marcellus re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the Antonine Wall, but the legionaries revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate, Priscus, as emperor.

Priscus refused to accept their acclamation, and Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain cashiered. On 15 October 184, at the Capitoline Games, a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus. His tale was considered false and he was immediately put to death. According to Cassius Dio, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and was a generally good administrator.

However, the following year a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to Italy to suppress brigands) also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor (they had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival), and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions: Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax. Brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.

===Cleander&#x27;s zenith and fall (185–190)===

Cleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by taking responsibility for all public offices. He sold (and bestowed entry to) Senate seats, army commands, governorships, and increasingly, suffect consulships, to the highest bidder. Unrest rose throughout the empire, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany. Pescennius Niger dealt with the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign. The revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain.

In 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, Maternus, came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March but was betrayed and executed. In the same year Pertinax unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander, Antistius Burrus (one of Commodus&#x27; brothers-in-law) and Arrius Antoninus. As a result, Commodus appeared more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates.

Early in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, Atilius Aebutianus, and took over supreme command of the Praetorian Guard at the new rank of &quot;a pugione&quot; (&quot;dagger-bearer&quot;), with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls—a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship—all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor Septimius Severus).

In the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the &quot;praefectus annonae&quot; Papirius Dionysius, the official actually in charge of the grain supply, contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus: he sent the Praetorian Guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the &quot;Vigiles Urbani&quot; to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii, for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.

At the urging of his mistress Marcia, Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus&#x27; cousin Annia Fundania Faustina, and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed, too. In AD 191, Commodus took more of the reins of power, though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus.

===Megalomania (190–192)===

In opposition to the Senate, in his pronouncements and iconography, Commodus had always stressed his unique status as a source of god-like power, liberality, and physical prowess. Innumerable statues around the empire were set up portraying him in the guise of Hercules, reinforcing the image of him as a demigod, a physical giant, a protector, and a warrior who fought against men and beasts (see and below). Moreover, as Hercules, he could claim to be the son of Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon. These tendencies now increased to proportions. Far from celebrating his descent from Marcus Aurelius, the actual source of his power, he stressed his own personal uniqueness as the bringer of a new order, seeking to re-cast the empire in his own image.

During 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax, the Temple of Vesta, and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.

Perhaps seeing this as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new Romulus, ritually re-founded Rome, renaming the city &quot;Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana&quot;. All the months of the year were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: &quot;Lucius&quot;, &quot;Aelius&quot;, &quot;Aurelius&quot;, &quot;Commodus&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, &quot;Herculeus&quot;, &quot;Romanus&quot;, &quot;Exsuperatorius&quot;, &quot;Amazonius&quot;, &quot;Invictus&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, and &quot;Pius&quot;. The legions were renamed &quot;Commodianae&quot;, the fleet which imported grain from Africa was termed &quot;Alexandria Commodiana Togata&quot;, the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman people themselves were all given the name &quot;Commodianus&quot;, and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called &quot;Dies Commodianus&quot;.

Thus, he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire, Roman life, and religion. He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club, placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like &quot;Hercules Romanus&quot;, and added an inscription boasting of being &quot;the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men&quot;.

===Assassination (192)===

In November 192, Commodus held Plebeian Games, in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, winning all the fights. In December, he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.

When Marcia found a list of people Commodus intended to have executed, she discovered that she, the prefect Laetus, and Eclectus were on it. The three of them plotted to assassinate the emperor. On 31 December, Marcia poisoned Commodus&#x27; food, but he vomited up the poison, so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner Narcissus to strangle him in his bath.

Upon his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy (a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;) and restored the original name of the city of Rome and its institutions. Statues of Commodus were demolished. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian.

Commodus&#x27; death marked the end of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. Commodus was succeeded by Pertinax, whose reign was short; he became the first claimant to be usurped during the Year of the Five Emperors.

In 195, the emperor Septimius Severus, trying to gain favour with the family of Marcus Aurelius, rehabilitated Commodus&#x27; memory and had the Senate deify him.

==Character and physical prowess==

===Character and motivations===
Cassius Dio, a first-hand witness, describes him as &quot;not naturally wicked but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.&quot;

His recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father&#x27;s policies, his father&#x27;s advisers, and especially his father&#x27;s austere lifestyle, and an alienation from the surviving members of his family. It seems likely that he was raised in an atmosphere of Stoic asceticism, which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule.

After repeated attempts on Commodus&#x27; life, Roman citizens were often killed for making him angry. One such notable event was the attempted extermination of the house of the Quinctilii. Condianus and Maximus were executed on the pretext that while they were not implicated in any plots, their wealth and talent would make them unhappy with the current state of affairs. Another event, as recorded by the historian Aelius Lampridius, took place at the Roman baths at Terme Taurine, where the emperor had an attendant thrown into an oven after he had found his bathwater to be lukewarm.

===Changes of name===
His original name was Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus. On his father&#x27;s death in 180, Commodus changed this to Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus, before changing back to his birth name in 191. Later that year he adopted as his full style &quot;Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Augustus Herculeus Romanus Exsuperatorius Amazonius Invictus Felix Pius&quot; (the order of some of these titles varies in the sources). &quot;Exsuperatorius&quot; (the supreme) was a title given to Jupiter, and &quot;Amazonius&quot; identified him again with Hercules.

An inscribed altar from Dura-Europos on the Euphrates shows that Commodus&#x27; titles and the renaming of the months were disseminated to the farthest reaches of the Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that he claimed two additional titles: &quot;Pacator Orbis&quot; (pacifier of the world) and &quot;Dominus Noster&quot; (Our Lord). The latter eventually would be used as a conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to assume it.

===Commodus and Hercules===
Disdaining the more philosophic inclinations of his father, Commodus was extremely proud of his physical prowess. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, described Commodus as an extremely handsome man. As mentioned above, he ordered many statues to be made showing him dressed as Hercules with a lion&#x27;s hide and a club. He thought of himself as the reincarnation of Hercules, frequently emulating the legendary hero&#x27;s feats by appearing in the arena to fight a variety of wild animals. He was left-handed and very proud of the fact. Cassius Dio and the writers of the &quot;Augustan History&quot; say that Commodus was a skilled archer, who could shoot the heads off ostriches in full gallop, and kill a panther as it attacked a victim in the arena.

===Commodus the gladiator===
Commodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the arena himself, dressed as a secutor. The Romans found Commodus&#x27; gladiatorial combat to be scandalous and disgraceful. According to Herodian, spectators of Commodus thought it unbecoming of an emperor to take up arms in the amphitheater for sport when he could be campaigning against barbarians among other opponents of Rome. The consensus was that it was below his office to participate as a gladiator. Popular rumors spread alleging he was not actually the son of Marcus Aurelius, but of a gladiator his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta.

Cassius Dio claimed that citizens of Rome who lacked feet (either through accident or illness) were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants. Dio also wrote that it was Commodus&#x27; custom to privately use deadly weapons to fight, murdering and maiming his opponents.

Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror and disgust of the Roman populace. According to Cassius Dio, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day. Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterward carried his sword and the bleeding head of the dead bird over to the Senators&#x27; seating area, and motioned to suggest that they were to be next. Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on laurel leaves to conceal their laughter. On other occasions, Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself, and a giraffe.

==In popular culture==
* An evil and highly narcissistic Commodus is portrayed by Canadian actor Christopher Plummer in the classic epic film &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964), directed by Anthony Mann. This film depicts all of this emperor&#x27;s reign, from the death of Marcus Aurelius until his own death while fighting against the fictional hero Livius.
* In the Best Picture winner &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), a fictionalized Commodus serves as the main antagonist of the film. He is played by Joaquin Phoenix, who received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 73rd Academy Awards.
* Commodus appears in the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; song &quot;Evil Emperors&quot;, alongside Caligula, Elagabalus and Nero, a parody of &quot;Bad&quot;.
* The 2017 docu-drama miniseries &quot;Roman Empire: Reign of Blood&quot; retells his story. In this version, Narcissus kills Commodus in a duel after learning that the Emperor&#x27;s arena opponents had been armed only with edgeless swords. At first, Narcissus strangles Commodus, but ultimately kills him by piercing his heart with a blunt sword. Aaron Jakubenko portrays Commodus in the series.
*Commodus appears as one of the antagonists in the popular young adult fiction novel series &quot;The Trials of Apollo&quot;. He is revealed as having become a minor god after his death and has survived into modern times, along with two other Roman emperors, Caligula and Nero.

<text>Mīrzā Muhammad Tarāghāy bin Shāhrukh (; ), better known as Ulugh Beg (; 22 March 1394 – 27 October 1449), was a Timurid sultan, as well as an astronomer and mathematician. 

Ulugh Beg was notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, such as trigonometry and spherical geometry, as well as his general interests in the arts and intellectual activities. It is thought that he spoke five languages: Arabic, Persian, Chaghatai Turkic, Mongolian, and a small amount of Chinese. During his rule (first as a governor, then outright) the Timurid Empire achieved the cultural peak of the Timurid Renaissance through his attention and patronage. Samarkand was captured and given to Ulugh Beg by his father Shah Rukh.

He built the great Ulugh Beg Observatory in Samarkand between 1424 and 1429. It was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in Central Asia. Ulugh Beg was subsequently recognized as the most important observational astronomer from the 15th century by many scholars. He also built the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417–1420) in Samarkand and Bukhara, transforming the cities into cultural centers of learning in Central Asia.

However, Ulugh Beg&#x27;s scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance. During his short reign, he failed to establish his power and authority. As a result, other rulers, including his family, took advantage of his lack of control, and he was subsequently overthrown and assassinated.

== Early life ==
He was a grandson of the great conqueror and king, Timur (Tamerlane) (1336–1405), and the oldest son of Shah Rukh, both of whom came from the Turkicized Mongol Barlas tribe of Transoxiana (now Uzbekistan). His mother was a noblewoman named Gawhar Shad, daughter of a member of the representative Turkic tribal aristocracy, Ghiyasuddin Tarkhan. 

Ulugh Beg was born in Sultaniyeh during his grandfather&#x27;s invasion of Persia. He was given the name &quot;Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay&quot;. Ulugh Beg, the name he was most commonly known by, was not truly a personal name, but rather a moniker, which can be loosely translated as &quot;Great Ruler&quot; (compare modern Turkish &quot;&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;) and is the Turkic equivalent of Timur&#x27;s Perso-Arabic title &quot;Amīr-e Kabīr&quot;. 

As a child he wandered through a substantial part of the Middle East and India as his grandfather expanded his conquests in those areas. After Timur&#x27;s death, Shah Rukh moved the empire&#x27;s capital to Herat (in modern Afghanistan). Sixteen-year-old Ulugh Beg subsequently became the governor of the former capital of Samarkand in 1409. In 1411, he was named the sovereign ruler of the whole of Mavarannahr.

== Science ==
The teenage ruler set out to turn the city into an intellectual center for the empire. Between 1417 and 1420, he built a &quot;madrasa&quot; (&quot;university&quot; or &quot;institute&quot;) on Registan Square in Samarkand (currently in Uzbekistan), and he invited numerous Islamic astronomers and mathematicians to study there. The &quot;madrasa&quot; building still survives. Ulugh Beg&#x27;s most famous pupil in astronomy was Ali Qushchi (died in 1474). Qadi Zada al-Rumi was the most notable teacher at Ulugh Beg&#x27;s madrasa and Jamshid al-Kashi, an astronomer, later came to join the staff. 

=== Astronomy ===
Astronomy piqued Ulugh Beg&#x27;s interest when he visited the Maragheh Observatory at a young age. This observatory, located in Maragheh, Iran, is where the well-known astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi practised.

In 1428, Ulugh Beg built an enormous observatory, similar to Tycho Brahe&#x27;s later Uraniborg as well as Taqi al-Din&#x27;s observatory in Constantinople. Lacking telescopes to work with, he increased his accuracy by increasing the length of his sextant; the so-called &quot;Fakhri&quot; sextant had a radius of about and the optical separability of 180&quot; (seconds of arc). The Fakhri sextant was the largest instrument at the observatory in Samarkand (an image of the sextant is on the side of this article). There were many other astronomical instruments located at the observatory, but the Fakhri sextant is the most well-known instrument there. The purpose of the Fakhri sextant was to measure the transit altitudes of the stars. This was a measurement of the maximum altitude above the horizon of the stars. It was only possible to use this device to measure the declination of celestial objects. The image, which can be found in this article, shows the remaining portion of the instrument, which consists of the underground, lower portion of the instrument that was not destroyed. The observatory built by Ulugh Beg was the most pervasive and well-known observatory throughout the Islamic world.

With the instruments located in the observatory in Samarkand, Ulugh Beg composed a star catalogue consisting of 1018 stars, which is eleven fewer stars than are present in the star catalogue of Ptolemy. Ulugh Beg utilized dimensions from al-Sufi and based his star catalogue on a new analysis that was autonomous from the data used by Ptolemy. Throughout his life as an astronomer, Ulugh Beg came to realize that there were multiple mistakes in the work and subsequent data of Ptolemy that had been in use for many years.


Using it, he compiled the 1437 &quot;Zij-i-Sultani&quot; of 994 stars, generally considered the greatest star catalogue between those of Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe, a work that stands alongside Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;. The serious errors which he found in previous Arabian star catalogues (many of which had simply updated Ptolemy&#x27;s work, adding the effect of precession to the longitudes) induced him to redetermine the positions of 992 fixed stars, to which he added 27 stars from Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi&#x27;s catalogue &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot; from the year 964, which were too far south for observation from Samarkand. This catalogue, one of the most original of the Middle Ages, was first edited by Thomas Hyde at Oxford in 1665 under the title &quot;Jadāvil-i Mavāzi&#x27; S̱avābit&quot;, and reprinted in 1767 by G. Sharpe. More recent editions are those by Francis Baily in 1843 in Vol. XIII of the &quot;Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, and by Edward Ball Knobel in &quot;Ulugh Beg&#x27;s Catalogue of Stars, Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain, with a Vocabulary of Persian and Arabic Words&quot; (1917).

In 1437, Ulugh Beg determined the length of the sidereal year as 365.2570370...d = 365d 6h 10m 8s (an error of +58 seconds). In his measurements over the course of many years he used a 50 m high gnomon. This value was improved by 28 seconds in 1525 by Nicolaus Copernicus, who appealed to the estimation of Thabit ibn Qurra (826–901), which had an error of +2 seconds. However, Ulugh Beg later measured another more precise value of the tropical year as 365d 5h 49m 15s, which has an error of +25 seconds, making it more accurate than Copernicus&#x27;s estimate which had an error of +30 seconds. Ulugh Beg also determined the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt as 23°30&#x27;17&quot; in the sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds of arc, which in decimal notation converts to 23.5047°.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, Ulugh Beg wrote accurate trigonometric tables of sine and tangent values correct to at least eight decimal places.

== Foreign relations ==
Once Ulugh Beg became governor of Samarqand, he fostered diplomatic relations with the Yongle emperor of the Ming dynasty. In 1416, Ming envoys Chen Cheng and Lu An presented silk and silver stuffs to Ulugh Beg on behalf of the Yongle emperor. In 1419, The Timurid sent his own emissaries, Sultan-Shah and Muhammad Bakhshi, to the Ming court. Ulugh Beg&#x27;s emissaries came across Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh and other envoys representing Shah Rukh, Prince Baysunghur, and other Timurid authorities in Beijing; however, they stayed at separate hostelries. Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh even saw the Yongle emperor riding a black horse with feet which had been gifted by Ulugh Beg. 

In 1439, the Zhengtong emperor ordered an artist to produce a painting of a black horse with white feet and a white forehead that had been sent by Ulugh Beg. Six years later, the Ming emperor sent a letter to Ulugh Beg in order to express his gratitude for all the &quot;tribute&quot; from Samarqand. The emperor sent &quot;vessels made of gold and jade, a spear with a dragon&#x27;s head, a fine horse with saddle, and variegated gold-embroidered silk stuffs&quot; to Ulugh Beg, as well as silk stuffs and garments for the Timurid prince&#x27;s family.

== War of succession and death ==

In 1447, upon learning of the death of his father Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg went to Balkh. Here, he heard that Ala al-Dawla, the son of his late brother Baysunghur, had claimed the rulership of the Timurid Empire in Herat. Consequently, Ulugh Beg marched against Ala al-Dawla and met him in battle at Murghab. He defeated his nephew and advanced toward Herat, massacring its people in 1448. However, Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, Ala al-Dawla&#x27;s brother, came to the latter&#x27;s aid and defeated Ulugh Beg.

Ulugh Beg retreated to Balkh where he found that its governor, his oldest son Abdal-Latif Mirza, had rebelled against him. Another civil war ensued. Abdal-Latif recruited troops to meet his father&#x27;s army on the banks of the Amu Darya river. However, Ulugh Beg was forced to retreat to Samarkand before any fighting took place, having heard news of turmoil in the city. Abdal-Latif soon reached Samarkand and Ulugh Beg involuntarily surrendered to his son. Abd-al-Latif released his father from custody, allowing him to make pilgrimage to Mecca. However, he ensured Ulugh Beg never reached his destination, having him, as well as his brother Abdal-Aziz assassinated in 1449. 

Eventually, Ulugh Beg&#x27;s reputation was rehabilitated by his nephew, Abdallah Mirza (1450–1451), who placed his remains at Timur&#x27;s feet in the Gur-e-Amir in Samarkand, where they were found by Soviet archaeologists in 1941.

==Marriages==
Ulugh Beg had thirteen wives:

* Aka Begi Begum, daughter of Muhammad Sultan Mirza bin Jahangir Mirza and Khan Sultan Khanika, mother of Habiba Sultan known as Khanzada Begum and another Khanzada Begum;
* Sultan Badi al-mulk Begum, daughter of Khalil Sultan bin Miran Shah and Shad Malik Agha;
* Aqi Sultan Khanika, daughter of Sultan Mahmud Khan Ogeday;
* Husn Nigar Khanika, daughter of Shams-i-Jahan Khan Chaghatay;
* Shukr Bīka Khanika, daughter of Darwīsh Khan of the Golden Horde;
* Rukaiya Sultan Agha, an Arlat lady, and mother of Abdal-Latif Mirza, Ak Bash Begum and Sultan Bakht Begum;
* Mihr Sultan Agha, daughter of Tukal bin Sarbuka;
* Sa&#x27;adat Bakht Agha, daughter of Bayan Kukaltash, mother of Qutlugh Turkhan Agha;
* Daulat Sultan Agha, daughter of Khawand Sa&#x27;id;
* Bakhti Bi Agha, daughter of Aka Sufi Uzbek;
* Daulat Bakht Agha, daughter of Sheikh Muhammad Barlas;
* Sultanim Agha, mother of Abdul Hamid Mirza and Abdul Jabrar Mirza;
* Sultan Malik Agha, daughter of Nasir-al-Din, mother of Ubaydullah Mirza, Abdullah Mirza and another Abdullah Mirza;

==Legacy==

* The crater, Ulugh Beigh, on the Moon, was named after him by the German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler on his 1830 map of the Moon.
* 2439 Ulugbek, a main-belt asteroid which was discovered on 21 August 1977 by N. Chernykh at Nauchnyj, was named after him.
* The dinosaur &quot;Ulughbegsaurus&quot; was named after him in 2021.

==Exhumation==
Soviet anthropologist Mikhail M. Gerasimov reconstructed the face of Ulugh Beg. Like his grandfather Timurlane, Ulugh Beg is close to the Mongoloid type with slightly Europoid features. His father Shah Rukh had predominantly Caucasoid features, with no obvious Mongoloid feature.

<doc id="44331" wikidata="Q176772" url="?curid=44331" title="Severus Snape">
<text>Severus Snape is a fictional character in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. In the first five novels, he is the professor of Potions at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In the sixth book, he teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts, and in the seventh book he ascends to the position of headmaster before his death. Snape is hostile, yet heroic towards Harry Potter throughout the series; Harry eventually learns that Snape was bullied by Harry&#x27;s father, James Potter, and was in love with Harry&#x27;s mother, Lily Evans. This causes Snape to have mixed feelings towards Harry, who resembles his father greatly, but has his mother&#x27;s eyes.

As the series progresses, Snape&#x27;s character becomes more layered and enigmatic. A central mystery is unravelled concerning his loyalties. Snape dies at the hands of Lord Voldemort in the seventh book, at which time his back story is revealed. Despite his attraction to the Dark Arts and Voldemort&#x27;s ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape&#x27;s love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry&#x27;s mother, eventually compelled him to defect from the Death Eaters. He then became a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. The fact that Lily chose James Potter, Harry&#x27;s father, only fuels Snape&#x27;s hostility towards Harry.

Snape&#x27;s character has been widely acclaimed by readers and critics. Rowling described him as &quot;a gift of a character&quot; whose story she had known since the first book. Elizabeth Hand of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; explained that Snape&#x27;s life &quot;is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling&#x27;s achievements&quot;. 

Actor Alan Rickman portrayed Snape in all eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, released between 2001 and 2011.

==Character development==
In an interview, Rowling described Snape&#x27;s character as an &quot;antihero&quot;. She has said that she drew inspiration for Snape&#x27;s character from a disliked teacher from her own childhood, and described Snape as a horrible teacher, saying the &quot;worst, shabbiest thing you can do&quot; as a teacher is to bully students. However, she does suggest in the books that he is generally an effective teacher. Although Rowling has said that Gilderoy Lockhart is her only character that she &quot;deliberately based on a real person&quot;, Snape was reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow. Rowling based Snape&#x27;s given name on &quot;Severus Road&quot; in Clapham, and his surname is borrowed from the name of a village in England. In a 1999 interview and again in 2004, Rowling singled out Snape as one of her favourite characters to write.

Rowling was less forthcoming about Snape than she was for other characters, because his true loyalties and motivations were not revealed until the final book. However, she hinted numerous times at Snape&#x27;s important role, suggesting that people should &quot;keep their eye on Snape&quot;. In 1999, answering a question regarding Snape&#x27;s love life and the redemptive pattern to his character, Rowling expressed her surprise at the foresight. Rowling also disclosed that after the publication of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, there was one female fan who guessed Snape loved Lily Potter, making Rowling wonder how she had given herself away.

After the completion of the series, Rowling began to speak openly about Snape, discussing the contrast between his character arc and that of Albus Dumbledore. Rowling said &quot;the series is built around [the Dumbledore and Snape storylines]&quot;, and maintained that she always knew what Snape would turn out to be at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. &quot;I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape&#x27;s motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point where you see what was really going on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you&#x27;ve never seen before.&quot; Rowling further said in an interview that she wanted Snape to find redemption and forgiveness: &quot;Snape is a complicated man...he was a flawed human being, like all of us. Harry forgives him...Harry really sees the good in Snape ultimately... I wanted there to be redemption.&quot;

==Appearances==

=== Novels ===

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; ====
Snape first appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, shortly after Harry arrives at Hogwarts. He is the school&#x27;s Potions Master, though he is widely rumoured to covet the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Snape himself confirms the rumour in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. Snape is a sinister and malicious teacher who makes frequent snide and disparaging remarks at Harry&#x27;s expense. He quickly becomes the primary antagonist of the book, as Harry suspects him of plotting to steal the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, and of attempting to kill him. Only the climax of the book reveals that Professor Quirrell, in league with Lord Voldemort, is the real enemy; Snape, suspicious of Quirrell, had been looking out for Harry throughout the book. In the final chapter, Dumbledore suggests that because Harry&#x27;s father James had saved Snape&#x27;s life when they were both students, even though the two detested each other, Snape felt responsible for Harry in return. As the final book reveals, this is not the full story. In any case, even after Quirrell&#x27;s true role is revealed, Harry retains feelings of suspicion and resentment towards Snape, and their relationship remains tense. Snape&#x27;s behaviour and attitude towards Harry also remain unchanged.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; ====
Snape has a minor role in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, where he helps Gilderoy Lockhart oversee Hogwarts&#x27; short-lived Duelling Club, but he has little interaction with the main plot. It is while attending the Duelling Club that Harry learns the &quot;Expelliarmus&quot; spell, which plays a significant role in later books, by seeing Snape use it.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Snape demonstrates his expertise with potions by brewing the complex Wolfsbane potion for the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin. Throughout the third book, Snape suspects that Lupin may be helping Harry&#x27;s godfather Sirius Black enter Hogwarts castle; Sirius had been convicted (wrongly, as it is later revealed) of murdering Peter Pettigrew and innocent bystanders, and betraying the Potter family&#x27;s hiding place to Voldemort. This suspicion stems from Lupin&#x27;s friendship with Sirius and Harry&#x27;s father, James, while they were all at Hogwarts as students. Near the climax of the book, Snape attempts to apprehend Sirius, but Sirius escapes with Harry&#x27;s aid. Snape informs Dumbledore of this circumstance, and when Harry and Lupin are not punished, Snape retaliates by revealing to the entire school that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing the latter to resign his post.

&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; reveals more details about the connection between Snape and James. While in school together, Sirius once tricked Snape into almost entering the Shrieking Shack while Lupin was there, transformed into a werewolf. James realised the danger and stopped Snape, saving his life; this is the incident Dumbledore referred to at the end of the first book. Snape, however, believes James&#x27; actions were self-serving, to avoid being expelled.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; ====
Snape&#x27;s role in the fourth novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, is not substantially different from that of the previous three books. He is apoplectic when Harry is unexpectedly entered into the Triwizard Tournament. Later Harry accidentally falls into Dumbledore&#x27;s Pensieve and views memories of several Death Eater trials from years before. At one point, Snape is named as a Death Eater by Igor Karkaroff, but Dumbledore comes to Snape&#x27;s defence, claiming that although Snape had indeed been a Death Eater, he changed sides before Voldemort&#x27;s downfall and turned spy against him. Later, Dumbledore assures Harry that Snape&#x27;s reformation is genuine, though he refuses to tell Harry how he knows this, saying the information &quot;is a matter between Professor Snape and myself&quot;.

At the end of the book, Dumbledore attempts to convince a disbelieving Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, that Voldemort has returned. As proof, Snape willingly shows Fudge the restored Dark Mark on his arm. He is subsequently sent on a secret mission by Dumbledore. This mission, as had been implied in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; and revealed in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, was to rejoin the Death Eaters and spy on Voldemort as a re-doubled agent, while pretending to spy on Dumbledore on behalf of Voldemort.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; ====
In the fifth novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Snape returns to a more prominent role. With Voldemort having returned to a fully corporeal body, Snape continues working as a re-doubled agent for Dumbledore. He is seen prior to the start of school at Number 12, Grimmauld Place giving reports to the Order of the Phoenix. He has a very strained relationship with Sirius, who owns Grimmauld Place and must remain there in hiding. The two trade frequent snide remarks and at one point almost begin a duel. Snape taunts Sirius about the latter&#x27;s not being able to take an active role in the Order&#x27;s missions because of his fugitive status. Harry feels later that this taunting contributed to Sirius&#x27; willingness to take unsafe risks. Back at school, Snape&#x27;s allegiance to the Order has no effect on his dislike for Harry.

Later in the book, Dumbledore has Snape teach Harry Occlumency, the protection of the mind from outside intrusion or influence. The sessions mainly consist in Snape forcibly reading Harry&#x27;s mind to teach him to defend himself, but are made difficult by their mutual hostility. They end prematurely when Harry accidentally backfires Snape&#x27;s spell and views one of Snape&#x27;s worst childhood memories without the latter&#x27;s permission. He sees the memory of Snape being bullied by James and Sirius, and of calling Harry&#x27;s mother Lily a Mudblood (a highly offensive term). Only in the final book is it revealed that, prior to this confrontation, Snape and Lily had been close friends.

Towards the end of the novel, Dolores Umbridge – the school&#x27;s politically appointed headmistress – captures Harry and interrogates him about Dumbledore&#x27;s whereabouts. She sends for Snape, demanding that he provide the magical truth serum Veritaserum in order to force Harry to reveal any information he may be hiding. Snape claims that his supplies of the serum have been exhausted after Umbridge tries to use the drug previously on Harry. It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. Snape then carries Harry&#x27;s cryptic warning about Sirius&#x27; capture to the other Order members, allowing them to come to the rescue in the Department of Mysteries. Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius&#x27; death, believing Snape&#x27;s goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; ====
In the second chapter of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy visit Snape at his home in Spinner&#x27;s End. Narcissa&#x27;s son Draco has been given a difficult task by Voldemort, and Narcissa swears Snape to an Unbreakable Vow that he will protect Draco, help him complete Voldemort&#x27;s task, and finish the task himself if Draco fails. When questioned by Bellatrix about his loyalties, Snape says he has been working for Voldemort ever since Voldemort&#x27;s return, and explains his actions in the previous books in that light. He points out that gaining Dumbledore&#x27;s trust and protection has kept him out of Azkaban and free to operate on Voldemort&#x27;s behalf.

At the start-of-term feast at Hogwarts, Dumbledore announces Snape as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Horace Slughorn, a former teacher who himself had taught Snape during his Hogwarts years, comes out of retirement and replaces him as Potions Master. With Snape no longer teaching Potions, Harry enrolls in Slughorn&#x27;s class and is lent an old textbook until his new one arrives. Harry finds marginalia, including a variety of hexes and jinxes seemingly invented by an unknown student, and substantial improvements to the book&#x27;s standard potion-making instructions. The text is inscribed as being &quot;the Property of the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. The notes greatly bolster Harry&#x27;s performance in Potions, so much so that he impresses Slughorn. Snape, who maintains that he &quot;never had the impression that [he] had been able to teach Potter anything at all&quot;, is suspicious of Harry&#x27;s newfound Potions success.

Later, during a fight with Draco, Harry casts one of the Prince&#x27;s spells marked &quot;For Enemies,&quot; and is horrified by the devastating wounds it inflicts to Draco&#x27;s face and chest. Snape rushes to the scene and heals Draco, then interrogates Harry regarding the spell, using Legilimency to extract the source of Harry&#x27;s knowledge (the Potions textbook) from Harry&#x27;s mind. When Snape insists that Harry show him his Potions textbook, Harry hides the Prince&#x27;s book and gives him Ron Weasley&#x27;s book instead. As punishment for the attack and knowing Harry is lying about the textbook, Snape assigns Harry detention during the final Quidditch match of the year.

Before leaving Hogwarts to accompany Dumbledore in locating another horcrux – part of Voldemort&#x27;s soul – Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry&#x27;s angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort&#x27;s Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school&#x27;s astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux&#x27;s protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort&#x27;s order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself. Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore&#x27;s death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry&#x27;s spells and jeeringly points out Harry&#x27;s mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen ). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book&#x27;s end. The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape&#x27;s actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that at this point in the series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become &quot;as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort.&quot;

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Voldemort and his Death Eaters have tightened their grip on the wizarding world. Snape is named Headmaster of Hogwarts, while Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow are appointed as Hogwarts staff. The novel focuses largely on Harry and his friends and events outside the school; therefore Snape plays a limited role at the start. In the course of the book, Harry and his friends find out that a few students attempted to steal the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, and that Snape subsequently sent it to be stored at Gringotts Wizarding Bank; however, that sword was only a copy. Later on, Harry and Ron are led to find the real sword by a Patronus taking the form of a doe. (Towards the end of the book, Harry learns that this was Snape&#x27;s Patronus, taking the same shape as Harry&#x27;s mother Lily&#x27;s Patronus, a visible sign of his lifelong love for Harry&#x27;s mother, and that Dumbledore had asked Snape to ensure that Harry gained possession of the sword. The novel also reveals that Snape had covertly used his position as Headmaster to protect the students and to contain the Carrows.)

Towards the end of the school year, Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout force Snape to flee the school. Voldemort summons Snape to the Shrieking Shack. Erroneously believing Snape is the master of the Elder Wand and that Snape&#x27;s death will make him the master of the Wand, Voldemort kills Snape by having his pet snake Nagini bite him through the neck. The dying Snape releases a cloud of memories and tells Harry, who has watched the entire scene from a hidden spot, to take and view them. The dying Snape asks Harry to look at him, since Harry has the eyes of his mother Lily which Snape loved, and Snape wants to have these eyes as the last thing he would see.

From these memories, Harry sees Snape&#x27;s childhood and learns his true loyalties. In this vision, Harry learns that Snape befriended Lily as a child when they lived near each other. Upon their arrival at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat placed Snape and Lily into Slytherin and Gryffindor Houses, respectively. They remained friends for the next few years until they were driven apart by Snape&#x27;s interest in the Dark Arts; the friendship finally ended following the bullying episode that Harry had briefly seen in the fifth book, in which Snape calls Lily &quot;Mudblood&quot;. Despite this separation and Snape&#x27;s enduring animosity toward Lily&#x27;s eventual husband James Potter, Snape continued to love Lily for the rest of his life.

The memories also show that as a Death Eater, Snape had revealed to Voldemort a prophecy made by Sybill Trelawney, causing Voldemort to attempt to prevent it by killing Harry and his parents. Snape, who had not realised until too late that Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy to be referring to Lily and her family (as it could&#x27;ve also referred to Frank and Alice Longbottom and their son Neville Longbottom), asked Voldemort to spare Lily. Still in terror for her life, he also approached Dumbledore, admitted his actions, and begged him to protect the Potters. Dumbledore chided him for thinking only of himself and not of Lily&#x27;s husband and child, but agreed and ensured that they were placed under the Fidelius Charm. In return, Snape secretly allied himself with Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix as a double agent against Voldemort, using his powers of Occlumency to hide his betrayal from Voldemort. However, Snape demanded of Dumbledore that his love for Lily (his reason for switching sides) be kept a secret, especially from Harry, because of the deep animosity he felt towards Harry&#x27;s father and his mixed feelings towards Harry (who reminded him of both his love for Lily Potter and her death, and his animosity towards James Potter). Dumbledore agreed and kept the secret throughout his life, although questioning Snape&#x27;s request to &quot;never reveal the best of you&quot;. Even with his efforts to protect her, Snape felt guilty and responsible for Lily&#x27;s death at Voldemort&#x27;s hands.

Snape&#x27;s memories then reveal that Dumbledore had impetuously tried to use the Gaunt ring, which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape&#x27;s knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow the spread of the curse from Dumbledore&#x27;s hand through his body, but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy&#x27;s soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of &quot;coup de grâce&quot; would not damage a human&#x27;s soul in the same way murder would. Nevertheless, they both knew that Snape could not avoid what he had sworn to Narcissa at the beginning of the previous book. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape&#x27;s memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort&#x27;s final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.

Rowling noted in an interview that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster&#x27;s office following his death. She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape&#x27;s true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape&#x27;s back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him one of the most important characters of the seventh book.

====Epilogue====
In the epilogue to &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, set nineteen years after Harry defeats Voldemort, Harry has named his second-born son Albus Severus, after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. As Albus is about to enter his first year at Hogwarts, he expresses concern that he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry tells his son, &quot;you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them [Snape] was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.&quot;

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; is a play written by Jack Thorne from a story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. In the play, Draco Malfoy&#x27;s son Scorpius finds himself in an alternate timeline in which Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, killed Harry, and instituted a reign of terror. Scorpius desperately searches for help in restoring history to its original course. He finds that in this reality Snape is still alive and still teaches at Hogwarts, and asks for his help. At first Snape is suspicious of him, since this timeline&#x27;s version of Scorpius is a bully and a Voldemort stalwart. But when Scorpius shows that he knows of Snape having been in love with Lily, Harry&#x27;s mother – Snape&#x27;s most closely guarded secret – Snape becomes convinced that he does indeed come from a different timeline where Harry and his friends won. Snape then reveals that he, together with the fugitive Ron and Hermione Granger, maintain the last remnants of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army – still waging hopeless resistance against the all-powerful Voldemort. In talking with Scorpius, Snape had learned that Harry would name his son &quot;Albus Severus&quot; and would regard Snape as &quot;probably the bravest man I ever knew&quot; – and is deeply moved. Though having guessed that in the other timeline he would die, Snape nevertheless willingly helps Scorpius recreate this timeline – and being discovered by Dementors, Snape sacrifices himself in order to cover Scorpius&#x27; escape.

== Portrayal in films ==
Severus Snape is portrayed by Alan Rickman in all eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Rickman was Rowling&#x27;s personal choice to portray the character. He had conversations with Rowling about his character and is one of the few &quot;Harry Potter&quot; actors that she spoke to prior to the completion of the book series about the future direction of the character. &quot;He knew very early on that he&#x27;d been in love with Lily,&quot; said Rowling. &quot;He needed to understand […] where this bitterness towards this boy who&#x27;s the living example of her preference for another man came from.&quot;Rickman used this knowledge of Snape&#x27;s ultimate loyalties throughout the films to decide how to play certain scenes, deliver specific lines, or use body language to convey specific emotions. When the directors of the films would ask him why he was doing a scene a certain way or delivering a line in a specific manner, Rickman would simply reply that he knew something they didn&#x27;t.

Rickman himself refrained from talking about Snape, asking readers to wait and &quot;see what unfolds&quot; in the course of the novels; however, he did say Snape is a complicated person, very rigid and full of himself; in an interview he went further, saying: &quot;Snape isn&#x27;t one who enjoys jokes and I strongly fear that his sense of humour is extremely limited... But in his defence, I will add that he didn&#x27;t have an easy adolescence, particularly during his studies at Hogwarts.&quot; He also said Snape is a fascinating character, and that he takes immense pleasure in playing such an ambiguous person.

Rickman&#x27;s performance as Snape was widely acclaimed by critics, fans and Rowling herself. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed Rickman as one of the most popular movie stars in 2007 for his performance as Snape, saying: &quot;As the icy, humourless magic instructor Severus Snape, Rickman may not be on screen long—but he owns every minute.&quot; Rickman also noted fans&#x27; reactions; in an interview, he said he found &quot;that people in general adore Snape. He is sarcastic, stubborn, etc, etc. But he is also fascinating. I have a lot of fun impersonating him.&quot; Rickman was nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Snape, and in 2011, was elected the best character portrayal in all the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films series.

In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine published an open letter from Rickman to J.K. Rowling, ruminating on the ten years of working on the Potter films and thanking her for telling the story.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the fifteen-year-old Snape (portrayed by Alec Hopkins) makes a brief appearance in a flashback to Snape&#x27;s youth. In the final film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, the younger Snape, perhaps ten or eleven, is played by Benedict Clarke. In 2016, a fan film prequel, &quot;Severus Snape and the Marauders&quot;, was released online and Snape was played by Morgana Ignis.

Before Alan Rickman was offered the role of Severus Snape, the role was offered to Tim Roth, who turned it down in favour of portraying General Thade in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

==Characterisation==

===Outward appearance===
Snape is described as a thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose, and yellow, uneven teeth. He has shoulder-length, greasy black hair which frames his face, and cold, black eyes. He wears black, flowing robes which give him the appearance of &quot;an overgrown bat&quot;. The youthful Snape had a &quot;stringy, pallid look&quot;, being &quot;round-shouldered yet angular&quot;, having a &quot;twitchy&quot; walk &quot;that recalled a spider&quot; and &quot;long oily hair that jumped about his face&quot;.

In the chapter illustrations by Mary GrandPré in the American editions of &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, &quot;The Order of the Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;The Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Snape is depicted with a moustache and goatee, long black hair, and a receding hairline.

===Personality===
Snape is generally depicted as being cold, calculating, precise, sarcastic, and bitter. He strongly dislikes Harry and often insults him by insulting his father James. As the series progresses, it is revealed that his treatment of Harry stems from Snape&#x27;s bitter rivalry with James when they were in school together. In particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused the already lonely boy to further &quot;shut himself in&quot;. Rowling further described the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: &quot;Given his time over again [Snape] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.[...] [He] was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought [Lily] would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.&quot;

The adult Snape, on the other hand, is portrayed as very self-assured and confident of his abilities, to a degree that Rickman described as &quot;full of himself.&quot; Director David Yates said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power. Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely at a loss for words or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused of cowardice. His otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.

Like some other prominent members of Slytherin house, Snape is shown to be a clever and cunning wizard. He is intelligent and has a keen, analytical mind. In an interview, Rowling adds that Snape is immensely brave, and when asked if she considers Snape a hero, replied: &quot;Yes, I do; though a very flawed hero. An anti-hero, perhaps. He is not a particularly likeable man in many ways. He remains rather cruel, a bully, riddled with bitterness and insecurity—and yet he loved, and showed loyalty to that love and, ultimately, laid down his life because of it. That&#x27;s pretty heroic!&quot;

===Magical abilities and skills===
All seven novels show Snape to be a very powerful wizard and to have been outstanding while a student. He specialises in potion making and has talent and passion for the Dark Arts. Sirius claimed that Snape knew more hexes and curses as a first-year student at Hogwarts than most seventh-years knew. Particularly gifted in potion making, Snape added major improvements to his Potions textbook while still a student. Also as a student, Snape shows a rare gift for discovering new spells. Lupin describes Sectumsempra as Snape&#x27;s &quot;speciality&quot; in &quot;Deathly Hallows.&quot; Snape is shown using this spell as a teenager against Harry&#x27;s father James and in the aerial battle in the last novel when he accidentally hits George Weasley (acting as a Potter decoy) with it while actually aiming for a Death Eater who was trying to attack Lupin, permanently severing George&#x27;s right ear. Despite Sectumsempra&#x27;s deadly power, Snape can also heal the wounds it causes. Snape is adept at reversing or containing potentially fatal damage from other dark curses as well, due to his vast knowledge of Dark Arts, as he does when Dumbledore and then Katie Bell are cursed. Skilful in the arts of Legilimency and especially Occlumency, Snape is able to both access the minds of others and protect his own thoughts—indeed, though Snape does not care for the term himself, Harry forms the uncomfortable impression early in the series that the Potions Master is able to &quot;read minds.&quot; Being an Occlumens, Snape is able to keep his betrayal from Voldemort, who is himself described as being &quot;the greatest Legilimens&quot; in history. According to Rowling, Snape is the only Death Eater capable of producing a full Patronus, which, like Lily&#x27;s, is a doe. Snape is a talented duellist, able to hold off by himself (if only briefly) a group of three Hogwarts professors that included former duelling champion Filius Flitwick. Professor McGonagall later implies that Snape learned to fly without the use of a broom, a rare skill previously displayed only by Voldemort.

===Family===
Snape&#x27;s family background is mostly shown in flashbacks during the course of the last three novels. Snape was born to Eileen Prince, a witch, and Tobias Snape, a Muggle, making him a half-blood (hence the name, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;). This is rare for a Death Eater, as remarked in the last book, though Voldemort himself also had a Muggle father. Snape spent his early childhood living with his parents in a small house in Spinner&#x27;s End. Snape&#x27;s family was a poor one and he is described as wearing ill-fitting clothes &quot;that were so mis-matched that it looked deliberate&quot;. As a child, Snape was apparently neglected and his parents often fought with one another. Snape was very eager to leave his home to go to Hogwarts. Towards the end of the last novel, Harry draws parallels between his childhood, Snape&#x27;s, and Voldemort&#x27;s.

===Loyalties===
Snape&#x27;s true loyalty was one of the most significant questions in the series up until the end of the final instalment, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;. Although the first five novels depict him as unfair and vindictive towards Harry and his friends, he invariably ends up protecting or otherwise helping them when they or their allies are in danger. Several characters express doubts about his loyalty, but Dumbledore&#x27;s trust in him is generally taken to be the final word. Curiously, the same thing appears to happen in the opposite side, when we see how Bellatrix Lestrange mistrust Snape and only the word of Voldemort seems to protect him from the suspicions of the other death-eaters. The sixth novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, departs from that model. In the second chapter, Snape claims to have been working for Voldemort ever since the latter&#x27;s return, and only pretending to help Dumbledore. By killing Dumbledore toward the end of the novel, Snape seems to place himself firmly in Voldemort&#x27;s camp. Rowling maintains this impression through the early chapters of the seventh novel. However, near the climax of the book, Snape leaves Harry his dying thoughts (to be viewed in the Pensieve) and ultimately reveals to Harry that he had been loyal to Albus Dumbledore throughout the series. Snape&#x27;s fierce devotion to and love of his childhood friend Lily, Harry&#x27;s mother, is the foundation of that loyalty.

After &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Snape&#x27;s loyalty was a matter of intense debate among the fans. The issue was given special attention in the marketing campaigns on behalf of the last book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;. &quot;Is Snape Good or Evil?&quot; was one of the questions in Scholastic Inc.&#x27;s seven-question series, part of its marketing campaign for the book. As part of the Waldenbooks marketing campaign, two free stickers, one that said &quot;Trust Snape&quot; and another that stated &quot;Snape Is A Very Bad Man&quot; were available with the book. Borders published a separate book on the topic, &quot;The Great Snape Debate,&quot; containing essays and arguments from both sides of the debate.

==Reception==
The secretive attitude and gradual unfolding of Snape&#x27;s character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, narrator of the UK audiobooks, saying in 2003: &quot;Most characters like Snape are hard to love but there is a sort of ambiguity—you can&#x27;t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it&#x27;s fascinating when you think he&#x27;s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he&#x27;s not so bad after all.&quot; David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: &quot;A character like Snape, where you&#x27;re not really sure if he&#x27;s a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information.&quot; Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay &quot;To Sir with Love&quot; in the book &quot;Mapping the World of Harry Potter&quot;, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;″ Heathcliff.
Jenny Sawyer from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; commented on the character&#x27;s development in the series. She claimed that Snape is the only protagonist who genuinely has a choice to make and who struggles to do the right thing, hence the only one to face a &quot;compelling inner crisis&quot;. She believed the popularity of the character is due to the moral journey and inner conflict that Snape undergoes within the series, as it is the hero&#x27;s struggle and costly redemption that really matter: &quot;[Snape&#x27;s] character ached for resolution. And it is precisely this need for resolution—our desire to know the real Snape and to understand his choices—that makes him the most compelling character in the Potter epic.&quot;

The final revelation of Snape&#x27;s loyalty in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was viewed positively by fans and critics alike. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter in the movie series, expressed his delight, saying he was pleased to see that his theory that Snape would end up being a sort of tragic hero came through. Elizabeth Hand from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of &quot;Deathly Hallows,&quot; but when he does the book becomes his: Snape&#x27;s fate, more than Voldemort&#x27;s, perhaps more even than Harry&#x27;s, is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling&#x27;s achievements.&quot;

IGN listed Snape as their 4th top &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, saying that he makes &quot;quite an impact in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series&quot;, and IGN&#x27;s Joe Utichi called Snape his favourite &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character and praised his character development. Shortly after the release of the final film, MTV held a public poll for fans to vote for the best character in the series, and Snape was voted #1. Around the same time, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine held a public poll for fans to vote for the 25 greatest characters in the series, and Snape once again came in at #1. In May 2011, Snape was again voted as the No. 1 favourite Harry Potter character in a public poll held by the Bloomsbury publishing house.

==In popular culture==
The character of Severus Snape has appeared in various animated parodies of Harry Potter. He is a starring character in Neil Cicierega&#x27;s online &quot;Potter Puppet Pals&quot; parodies, and has a centric episode titled &quot;Bothering Snape&quot;. Also, the video &quot;The Mysterious Ticking Noise&quot; with the chorus &quot;Snape, Snape, Severus Snape&quot; was the winner for &quot;Best Comedy&quot; of the year 2007 at YouTube; it currently has over 170 million views. Snape is also parodied as Professor Santory Snapekin in Sluggy Freelance&#x27;s recurring series &quot;Torg Potter&quot;. In the first parody, Torg mistakenly thinks Professor Snapekin is plotting to achieve ultimate power.

In a 2004 sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in which Lindsay Lohan appears as Hermione Granger, Snape is portrayed by Will Forte. Snape has also been parodied in UK television. Comic Relief released a story called &quot;Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan&quot;, in which Snape is played by Jeremy Irons. Snape appeared in a &quot;Harry Potter&quot; parody named &quot;Louis Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Scone&quot; in Alistair McGowan&#x27;s &quot;Big Impression&quot; show, played by Alistair McGowan himself. In the &quot;Harry Bladder&quot; sketches in &quot;All That&quot;, Snape appears as Professor Chafe (portrayed by Jeremy Rowley), whose legs were badly chafed, causing him to be unnecessarily mean. Many sketches feature students brewing potions that did silly things, like enlarge students&#x27; behinds, give males large breasts, or change people into bras. In a sketch comedy named &quot;Cooking With...&quot; on Australian TV series &quot;The Wedge&quot;, Snape is played by Anthony Ahern, and catches Harry and Hermione making love. In Team Starkid&#x27;s &quot;A Very Potter Musical&quot;, Snape is played by actor Joe Moses.

<text>A club is an association of people united by a common interest or goal. A service club, for example, exists for voluntary or charitable activities. There are clubs devoted to hobbies and sports, social activities clubs, political and religious clubs, and so forth.

== History ==

Historically, clubs occurred in all ancient states of which exists detailed knowledge. Once people started living together in larger groups, there was need for people with a common interest to be able to associate despite having no ties of kinship. Organizations of the sort have existed for many years, as evidenced by Ancient Greek clubs and associations (&quot;collegia&quot;) in Ancient Rome.

=== Origins of the word and concept ===
It is uncertain whether the use of the word &quot;club&quot; originated in its meaning of a knot of people, or from the fact that the members &quot;clubbed&quot; together to pay the expenses of their gatherings. The oldest English clubs were merely informal periodic gatherings of friends for the purpose of dining or drinking with one another. Thomas Occleve (in the time of Henry IV) mentions such a club called &quot;La Court de Bonne Compagnie&quot; (the Court of Good Company), of which he was a member. In 1659 John Aubrey wrote, &quot;We now use the word clubbe for a sodality [a society, association, or fraternity of any kind] in a tavern.&quot;

=== In Shakespeare&#x27;s day ===
Of early clubs the most famous, latterly, was the Bread Street or Friday Street Club that met at the Mermaid Tavern on the first Friday of each month. John Selden, John Donne, John Fletcher
and Francis Beaumont were among the members (although it is often asserted that William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Raleigh were members of this club, there is no documented evidence to support this claim). Another such club, founded by Ben Jonson, met at the Devil Tavern near Temple Bar, also in London.

=== Coffee houses ===
The word “club,” in the sense of an association to promote good-fellowship and social intercourse, became common in England at the time of &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; (1709–1712). With the introduction of coffee-drinking in the middle of the 17th century, clubs entered on a more permanent phase. The coffee houses of the later Stuart period are the real originals of the modern clubhouse. The clubs of the late 17th and early 18th century type resembled their Tudor forerunners in being oftenest associations solely for conviviality or literary coteries. But many were confessedly political, e.g. The Rota, or Coffee Club (1659), a debating society for the spread of republican ideas, broken up at the Restoration in 1660, the Calves Head Club (c.1693) and the Green Ribbon Club (1675). The characteristics of all these clubs were:

# No permanent financial bond between the members, each man&#x27;s liability ending for the time being when he had paid his “score” after the meal.
# No permanent clubhouse, though each clique tended to make some particular coffee house or tavern their headquarters.

These coffee-house clubs soon became hotbeds of political scandal-mongering and intriguing, and in 1675 King Charles II issued a proclamation which ran: “His Majesty hath thought fit and necessary that coffee houses be (for the future) put down and suppressed,” because “in such houses divers false, malitious and scandalous reports are devised and spread abroad to the Defamation of his Majesty’s Government and to the Disturbance of Peace and Quiet of the Realm.” So unpopular was this proclamation that it was almost instantly found necessary to withdraw it, and by Anne’s reign the coffee-house club was a feature of England’s social life. See English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries.

=== 18th and 19th century ===
The idea of the club developed in two directions. One was of a permanent institution with a fixed . The London coffeehouse clubs in increasing their members absorbed the whole accommodation of the coffeehouse or tavern where they held their meetings, and this became the clubhouse, often retaining the name of the original innkeeper, e.g. White&#x27;s, Brooks&#x27;s, Arthur&#x27;s, and Boodle&#x27;s. These still exist today as the famous gentlemen&#x27;s clubs.

The peripatetic lifestyle of the 18th and 19th century middle classes also drove the development of more residential clubs, which had bedrooms and other facilities. Military and naval officers, lawyers, judges, members of Parliament and government officials tended to have an irregular presence in the major cities of the Empire, particularly London, spending perhaps a few months there before moving on for a prolonged period and then returning. Especially when this presence did not coincide with the Season, a permanent establishment in the city (i.e., a house owned or rented, with the requisite staff), or the opening of a townhouse (generally shuttered outside the Season) was inconvenient or uneconomic, while hotels were rare and socially &quot;déclassé&quot;. Clubbing with a number of like-minded friends to secure a large shared house with a manager was therefore a convenient solution.

The other sort of club meets occasionally or periodically and often has no clubhouse, but exists primarily for some specific object. Such are the many purely athletic, sports and pastimes clubs, the Alpine, chess, yacht and motor clubs. Also there are literary clubs (see writing circle and book club), musical and art clubs, publishing clubs. The name of “club” has been annexed by a large group of associations which fall between the club proper and friendly societies, of a purely periodic and temporary nature, such as slate, goose and Christmas clubs, which do not need to be registered under the Friendly Societies Act.

=== Worldwide ===

The institution of the gentleman&#x27;s club has spread all over the English-speaking world. Many of those who energised the Scottish Enlightenment were members of the Poker Club in Edinburgh. In the United States clubs were first established after the War of Independence. One of the first was the Hoboken Turtle Club (1797), which still survived as of 1911. In former British Empire colonies like India and Pakistan they are known as Gymkhana.

The earliest clubs on the European continent were of a political nature. These in 1848 were repressed in Austria and Germany, and later clubs of Berlin and Vienna were mere replicas of their English prototypes. In France, where the term &quot;cercle&quot; is most usual, the Club de l&#x27;Entresol (1724-1731) was followed by the Club Politique (1782), and during the French Revolution such associations proved important political forces (see Jacobins, Feuillants, Cordeliers). Of the purely social clubs in Paris the most notable were the Jockey-Club de Paris (1833), the Cercle de l&#x27;Union, the Traveller&#x27;s and the Cercle Interallié.

==Types of clubs==

===Buying club===

Buyer&#x27;s clubs or buying clubs are clubs organized to pool members&#x27; collective buying power, enabling them to make purchases at lower prices per individual item than are generally available, or purchase goods that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. There are many legitimate buying clubs – for example, food buying clubs – but many are unauthorized credit card billing scams, in which a customer is induced to enroll in a free trial of a buyer&#x27;s club membership, and then unexpectedly billed when the trial ends.

===Country or sports club===

There are two types of athletic and sports clubs: those organized for sporting participants (which include athletic clubs and country clubs), and those primarily for spectator fans of a team.

Athletic and country clubs offer one or more recreational sports facilities to their members. Such clubs may also offer social activities and facilities, and some members may join primarily to take advantage of the social opportunities. Country clubs offer a variety of recreational sports facilities to their members and are usually located in suburban or rural areas. Most country clubs have golf facilities. Swimming pools, tennis courts, polo grounds and exercise facilities are also common. Country clubs usually provide dining facilities to their members and guests, and frequently host special events like weddings. Similar clubs in urban areas are often called &quot;athletic clubs&quot;. These clubs often feature indoor sports, such as indoor tennis, squash, futsal, basketball, volleyball, boxing, and exercise facilities.

Members of sports clubs that support a team can be sports amateurs—groups who meet to practice a sport, as for example in most cycling clubs—or professionals; football clubs consist of well-paid team members and thousands of supporters. A sports club can thus comprise participants (not necessarily competitors) or spectator fans, or both.

Some organizations exist with a mismatch between name and function. The Jockey Club is not a club for jockeys, but rather exists to regulate the sport of horseracing; the Marylebone Cricket Club was until recently the regulatory body of cricket; and so on. Sports club should not be confused with gyms and health clubs, which also can be for members only.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Fraternities and sororities are social clubs of secondary or higher education students. Membership in these organizations is generally by invitation only.

===Hobby club===
Hobbies are practiced for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward. Examples include science fiction clubs, ham radio, model railroading, collecting, creative and artistic pursuits, making, tinkering, sports, and adult education. Participants may form an organization to coordinate gatherings of hobbyists, provide services related to the activity (for example, a club of board game enthusiasts might have a library of games for members), or act as a buyers&#x27; club.

===Professional societies===

These organizations are partly social, partly professional in nature and provide professionals with opportunities for advanced education, presentations on current research, business contacts, public advocacy for the profession and other advantages. Examples of these groups include medical associations, scientific societies, autograph club and bar associations. Professional societies frequently have layers of organization, with regional, national and international levels. The local chapters generally meet more often and often include advanced students unable to attend national meetings.

===School club===

These are activities performed by students that fall outside the realm of classes. Such clubs may fall outside the normal curriculum of school or university education or, as in the case of subject matter clubs (e.g. student chapters of professional societies), may supplement the curriculum through informal meetings and professional mentoring.

===Secret club===
A secret society is a club or an organization whose activities, events, inner functioning, or membership are concealed. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla warfare insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence.

===Service club===

A service club is a type of voluntary organization where members meet regularly for social outings and to perform charitable works either by direct hands-on efforts or by raising money for other organizations.

===Social activities club===

Social activities clubs are a modern combination of several other types of clubs and reflect today&#x27;s more eclectic and varied society. These clubs are centered around the activities available to the club members in the city or area in which the club is located. Because the purpose of these clubs is split between general social interaction and taking part in the events themselves, clubs tend to have more single members than married ones; some clubs restrict their membership to one of the other, and some are for gay and lesbian patrons.

Membership can be limited or open to the general public, as can the events. Most clubs have a limited membership based upon specific criteria, and limit the events to members to increase the security of the members, thus creating an increased sense of camaraderie and belonging. Social activities clubs can be for profit or not for profit, and some are a mix of the two (a for-profit club with a non-profit charitable arm, for instance).

===Social club===
Some social clubs are organized around competitive games, such as chess or bridge. Other clubs are designed to encourage membership of certain social classes. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s social clubs were the precursor name of gangs like the infamous Hamburgs of Chicago. Latino immigrant adult and youth groups organized themselves as social clubs like: Black Eagles, Flaming Arrows, Paragons and Young Lords. Those made up of the elite are best known as gentlemen&#x27;s clubs (not to be confused with strip clubs) and country clubs (though these also have an athletic function, see above). Membership to gentlemen&#x27;s clubs require the ability to pay large fees as well as an invitation by existing members who seek new recruits who meet personal criteria such as lifestyle, moral base, etc. Less elitist, but still in some cases exclusive, are working men&#x27;s clubs. Clubs restricted to either officers or enlisted men exist on military bases.

The modern Gentlemen&#x27;s club is occasionally proprietary, i.e. owned by an individual or private syndicate and run on a for-profit basis, but more frequently owned by the members who delegate to a committee the management of its affairs, first reached its highest development in London, where the district of St. James&#x27;s has long been known as &quot;Clubland&quot;.

Current London proprietary clubs include Soho House, which commenced business in 1995, and Soho&#x27;s Groucho Club, which opened in 1985 as &quot;the antidote to the traditional club.&quot; In this spirit, the club was named for Groucho Marx because of his famous remark that he would not wish to join any club that would have him as a member.

=== Political club ===
A political club is a group of people who share a political ideology, or supporters of a particular political party, of which it may function as a local element. For example, a Constituency Labour Party is an association of British Labour Party members who live in a given electoral district; the rival Conservatives instead have groups called Conservative Associations. Most Canadian political parties are likewise organized into riding associations.

<doc id="44334" wikidata="Q179641" url="?curid=44334" title="Draco Malfoy">
<text>Draco Lucius Malfoy is a fictional character and a major antagonist in J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. He is a student in Harry Potter&#x27;s year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; he is also a cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

==Character development==
Draco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter, and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days. Harry first encounters Draco&#x27;s snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin&#x27;s. Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family&#x27;s beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet &quot;Mudbloods&quot;, should be denied a magical education. Harry&#x27;s first impression that the Wizarding community is a &quot;magical wonderland&quot; is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, &quot;[Harry] found out that many people in power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty as they are in our world.&quot;

Malfoy was originally named &quot;Draco Spungen&quot; in the earliest drafts of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.&quot; &quot;Spungen&quot; also appeared on her pre-canon class list, but it was crossed out and replaced with the surname &quot;Spinks&quot;, while &quot;Malfoy&quot; was later added after the completion of the list. Philip Nel believes that &quot;Malfoy&quot; is derived from the French phrase &quot;mal foi&quot;, meaning &quot;bad faith&quot;.
In an article published in 2002, Nilsen and Nilsen argue that &quot;Draco&quot; has connotations with &quot;draconian&quot;, and that his name starts with &quot;mal&quot;, a French prefix for &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.

Many of Draco&#x27;s relatives on his mother&#x27;s side of the family (the Blacks) are named for stars or constellations (e.g., Sirius Black, Regulus Black, Andromeda Black Tonks, Bellatrix Black Lestrange, Cygnus Black, Orion Black). Another constellation is Draco (the Dragon). Draco Malfoy eventually named his son for yet another constellation, Scorpius.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;===
Draco Malfoy makes his first appearance in the series when he and Harry meet while being fitted for school robes at Madam Malkin&#x27;s, a clothing shop in Diagon Alley. Not realising that the boy in the store is Harry Potter—a child whose parents were murdered when he was one year old by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort—Draco engages him in polite (relative to his later attitude towards Harry) conversation. Harry, however, is alienated by the arrogance of Draco, who asks whether the orphan&#x27;s parents are &quot;our kind&quot; (pure-blood wizards). Draco then proclaims that &quot;the other sort&quot; (Muggle-borns) should not be allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because &quot;they&#x27;ve never been brought up to know our ways&quot;. The two boys part without introductions, but meet again on the Hogwarts Express. After Draco ridicules Ron Weasley&#x27;s family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship, demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. 

According to Rowling, Malfoy originally makes an effort to be Harry&#x27;s friend because &quot;it will be cool to turn up at the school being Harry Potter&#x27;s friend, because Harry is so famous.&quot; However, Harry did not want Malfoy as a friend because he &quot;has been so rude about Rubeus Hagrid and about Ron, who Harry likes so much&quot;. 

At the first years&#x27; Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat places him instantly into Slytherin, the house that has developed all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, Severus Snape, an apparent follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by falsely challenging him to a midnight duel and informing Argus Filch in advance of Harry&#x27;s plans to be out of bed; Draco&#x27;s attempt fails when Harry evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Draco becomes the new Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team after his father, Lucius Malfoy, donates new, high-quality Nimbus 2001 broomsticks. When Hermione Granger comments that the Gryffindor players made the team through talent and not bribery, Draco responds by calling her a &quot;Mudblood&quot;, a derogatory term for people of mixed magical and human ancestry. This provokes an immediate, violent response from Ron. Because of Draco&#x27;s contempt for Muggle-borns, Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that Draco is the Heir of Slytherin, who has recently reopened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and Ron disguise themselves as Crabbe and Goyle with Polyjuice Potion and infiltrate the Slytherin common room in an attempt to collect additional information, whereupon they realise that their initial suspicion about Draco is incorrect.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;===
During Hagrid&#x27;s debut as Care of Magical Creatures instructor in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Buckbeak the hippogriff attacks Draco after he fails to observe proper protocol while approaching it and insults it. He exaggerates the extent of his injury, giving Slytherin a chance to postpone their Quidditch match against Gryffindor until later in the year and as an attempt to have Hagrid fired. Hermione punches Draco when he mocks Hagrid for crying over Buckbeak&#x27;s death sentence. Draco, who implies that he is aware of how Sirius Black was supposedly involved in the deaths of Harry&#x27;s parents, also taunts Harry about the impending threat of Black: &quot;If it was me, I&#x27;d want revenge. I&#x27;d hunt him down myself.&quot;

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;===
After Harry is unexpectedly chosen as a Triwizard Tournament champion in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Draco shows off a &quot;Support Cedric Diggory&quot; badge to Harry, then presses it to replace the phrase with &quot;Potter Stinks.&quot; Draco also gives malicious and often false information about Harry and Hagrid to muckraking &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; journalist Rita Skeeter. When Draco attempts to curse Harry behind his back, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch, Jr in disguise via Polyjuice Potion) humiliates Draco by transforming him into a ferret and repeatedly slamming him against the ground as well as dropping him down Goyle&#x27;s pants.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Draco is named a Slytherin prefect along with Pansy Parkinson. He gets Harry and the Weasley twins banned from the Gryffindor Quidditch team when they attack him during a postmatch brawl after Draco insults their families following Gryffindor&#x27;s win over Slytherin. He later joins Dolores Umbridge&#x27;s Inquisitorial Squad, with whom he plays an important part in the exposure of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. As the D.A. flees the Room of Requirement, Draco earns Slytherin fifty points after catching Harry, and helps hold several members captive in Umbridge&#x27;s office, letting them free only after Ginny Weasley performs her famous Bat Bogey Hex. After his father and other Death Eaters are captured and sentenced to Azkaban following the events at the Department of Mysteries, Draco twice attempts to get revenge on Harry, but Snape and Minerva McGonagall thwart his first effort, and while returning home on the Hogwarts Express, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle are transformed into giant slugs by a barrage of hexes cast by several D.A. members coming to Harry&#x27;s defence.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;===
Draco is drawn into Death-Eaters&#x27; activities more directly in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Because of Lucius&#x27; arrest and fall from Voldemort&#x27;s favour, Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange visit Snape at his home to discuss a dangerous task that Voldemort has assigned Draco. Narcissa, deeply worried that her son will be killed in his attempt to complete it, begs Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to aid Draco with this task and protect him at all costs, and if Draco fails to complete the mission, he will complete it himself; he agrees.

Under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burkes, a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley. Draco threatens Mr. Borgin about repairing one item and keeping another safe for him. Draco shows Mr. Borgin something on his arm that Harry believes to be the Dark Mark, Voldemort&#x27;s sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark on his arm.) On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort&#x27;s task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until Nymphadora Tonks (Luna Lovegood in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends much of the year trailing Draco&#x27;s whereabouts on his Marauder&#x27;s Map, but loses track of him once Draco enters the Room of Requirement. When Katie Bell is almost killed in Hogsmeade after handling a cursed necklace and Ron nearly dies by drinking poisoned mead, Harry suspects Draco is behind both attacks.

In this book, Draco is, for the first time since being introduced in the series, portrayed as having considerable initiative, ingenuity, and perseverance. However, unlike Harry, who always relies on his friends&#x27; support and help, Draco mostly works alone in the Room of Requirement, refusing to confide in or involve his own circle of friends, whom he treats more as underlings. This, and the realisation of what he is ultimately expected to do, nearly drives him to a nervous breakdown. When Harry walks in on Malfoy crying in Moaning Myrtle&#x27;s bathroom, Draco attempts to cast the Cruciatus Curse. Harry is faster to the draw with an obscure &quot;Sectumsempra&quot; spell that he learned from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince&#x27;s book. The spell cuts deep gashes into Malfoy&#x27;s face and chest, resulting in severe blood loss. Snape, alerted by Myrtle&#x27;s screams, swiftly arrives and heals Draco&#x27;s cuts, then takes him to the hospital wing.

Near the conclusion, Draco ambushes and disarms a gravely weakened Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower. After Draco disarms him, Dumbledore calmly reasons with the frightened teenager and persuades him to reveal how he was, according to Voldemort&#x27;s orders, to kill the headmaster through the cursed necklace and the poisoned mead. Malfoy reveals that he mended the broken Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement to act as a portal enabling Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts. Draco is hesitant to kill Dumbledore and he eventually lowers his wand. Snape arrives, dispatches Dumbledore himself and then flees Hogwarts with Draco in tow. As revealed during his confrontation with Dumbledore, Draco was an insecure boy incapable of committing cold-blooded murder and was forced to do Voldemort&#x27;s bidding under the threat of his and his parents&#x27; deaths. Harry, who was horrified by the result of his duel with Draco in the bathroom incident, feels &quot;the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike&quot; for his old rival.

During an interview in 2005, Rowling revealed that she enjoyed writing Draco in this book, and that the character &quot;did a lot of growing up&quot; as well.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;===
The Malfoys remain reluctant followers of Voldemort, who now uses their home as his headquarters; Draco passes out after witnessing Voldemort murder Muggle Studies professor Charity Burbage. Harry experiences occasional and disturbing visions of Draco being forced into performing Voldemort&#x27;s bidding and feels &quot;sickened... by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.&quot; When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, Draco is asked to identify them, and though they are clearly recognisable, he only ambiguously replies &quot;It might be.&quot; During the successful escape from Malfoy Manor headed by Dobby, Harry overpowers Draco and captures his wand.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek Ravenclaw&#x27;s diadem in the Room of Requirement, Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle (Blaise Zabini in film version rather than Crabbe), attempts to capture Harry alive. However, Crabbe (Goyle in film version) defies Draco&#x27;s orders and attempts to kill the trio by casting the deadly Fiendfyre; unable to control the spell, he dies in the blaze while the trio rescue Draco and Goyle (Zabini in film version). Draco, despite his often condescending and belittling attitude toward Crabbe and Goyle (as well as his other underlings), grieves for his lost friend. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco is seen pleading with a Death Eater who seems intent on killing him. He is once again saved by Harry and Ron, the latter of whom punches Draco in the face under the invisibility cloak for attempting to appease the Death Eater.

At about this time, it is revealed through the Pensieve that Dumbledore had known he was dying after being cursed by Voldemort&#x27;s ring. However, to spare Draco&#x27;s soul from being forever tainted by committing murder, Dumbledore pre-arranged his own death with Snape. Voldemort intended Draco to die in the attempt to kill Dumbledore so that Lucius would be punished for his failure to retrieve the prophecy from the Ministry of Magic.

After Harry is struck by the &quot;Avada Kedavra&quot; curse, Voldemort orders Narcissa to verify that Harry is actually dead. She detects his heartbeat, but she lies to Voldemort, knowing that she will be allowed to search for her son if the Death Eaters return to Hogwarts &quot;as part of the conquering army.&quot; Although Draco does not directly take part in Harry&#x27;s final confrontation with Voldemort, as he and his parents flee the battle for their personal safety, he influences its outcome; a plot twist reveals that Draco had unwittingly become the Elder Wand&#x27;s master when he disarmed Dumbledore, even though Draco never actually possessed the wand. The wand&#x27;s allegiance passes to whoever defeats its owner, so Harry, having taken Draco&#x27;s wand at Malfoy Manor, became its new master; this prevents Voldemort from using its full power. In the end, it is Narcissa&#x27;s lie to Voldemort concerning Harry&#x27;s death that enables the Malfoys to narrowly avoid imprisonment in Azkaban.

====Epilogue====
In the epilogue, Draco marries Astoria Greengrass and has a son, Scorpius Malfoy. Draco&#x27;s hairline has receded, making his face look even more pointed. Though they are not friends, Malfoy has somewhat decreased his animosity toward Harry, and, upon seeing them at King&#x27;s Cross station, gives a brief and curt nod to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny.

== Appearance in other material ==
In the play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, Draco appears with his son Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, who became best friends with Harry&#x27;s second son Albus Severus Potter. It was revealed that during the fourth year of Scorpius&#x27;s time in Hogwarts that Draco became widowed, as his wife Astoria Malfoy (née Greengrass) died due to an inherited blood curse, which could shorten her lifespan and disallow her from growing into old age.

The play also explores some of Draco&#x27;s later life after the second wizarding war and prior to the events of the play. Due to his harrowing experiences during his time with the Death Eaters and his remorse over his crimes as a Death Eater, Draco had realised the error in his ways and thus abandoned the old pure-blood beliefs he was raised to believe in. This notably caused friction between him and his parents (who maintained these beliefs despite having defected from Voldemort). As he grew into adulthood, Draco fell in love with fellow Slytherin Astoria Greengrass, who also witnessed the carnage and horrors which the war and the old beliefs brought about (though lesser than Draco). This romance and eventual marriage would disappoint Draco&#x27;s parents further given that they expected a more suitable candidate from one of the wizarding world&#x27;s oldest pure-blood families and also an individual who had the embodiment of the old pure-blood beliefs. Despite having lost the favour of his parents, he still inherits the massive fortune of the Malfoy family, which made him independently wealthy and having no need to work. The inheritance also included his father&#x27;s collection of Dark Arts artefacts.

After he married, Draco initially contemplated letting the Malfoy bloodline end with him to allow Astoria to live longer (much to Lucius&#x27;s disappointment), as he was aware of Astoria&#x27;s family blood curse and that childbirth would weaken her further. Astoria, however, persuaded him from doing so as she wanted a child not for the pure-blood beliefs, but for him so that he will not be alone should she die some day, which culminated in the birth of Draco&#x27;s first and only child Scorpius. Draco had once considered the birth of his son as the greatest day of his life, even though Scorpius&#x27;s birth had further weakened Astoria&#x27;s health and eventually caused her to die fourteen years later.

Draco was strict in Scorpius&#x27;s upbringing and taught him to not believe in the old pure-blood beliefs and instead raised him to become a better child than Draco was in his own childhood, and was willing to allow his son to be punished for breaking school rules. He was also supportive of Scorpius&#x27;s decision to befriend Harry&#x27;s son Albus Severus, even though he and Harry had a history of animosity during their schooling years. Draco even trusted Albus to help Scorpius to heal him of his pain over losing his mother, and he valued his son&#x27;s friendship to the point that he personally went to the Potter house to confront Harry, who tried to separate the two best friends apart. Despite having become more civil with his old enemies from the past, Draco remained apathetic and full of mockery towards them, including how he continued to mock Harry and his friends and sending a cold reply letter to Ginny&#x27;s request to invite Scorpius to stay in the Potter house. These feelings only began to dissipate gradually as they became united by their common interest to save their sons. He was also revealed to be constantly envious of how Harry had true friends like Ron and Hermione (the latter whom became Minister of Magic) during his schooling years while he had only Crabbe and Goyle, who did not amount to being true friends for Draco.

During the events of the play, Draco slowly made amends with Harry and his friends as they all embarked on a journey to save their sons from Voldemort&#x27;s daughter Delphini, demonstrating his slow, but gradual acknowledgement of Harry as a friend and his outright denouncement of his Death Eater past.

==Portrayal==
===Film portrayal===
Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy in all of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Prior to landing the part of Malfoy, Felton auditioned to play Harry and Ron.

Felton contributed to premieres, articles and interviews, and received the Disney Channel&#x27;s Kids Awards for Best DVD &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; on 22 September 2003 with Hermione Granger actress, Emma Watson. He also won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for his portrayal as Malfoy in the 2010 MTV Movie Awards and the 2011 MTV Movie Awards.

Malfoy grew into one of the series&#x27; most popular characters due to Felton&#x27;s performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling&#x27;s dismay. &quot;I&#x27;m trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good-looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It&#x27;s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy.&quot; Rowling has also noted that Malfoy &quot;is certainly stylish in the film.&quot;

===Theatre portrayal===
In the theatre play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; Draco was portrayed by Alex Price and later by James Howard. In the theatre play Draco has a style like his father&#x27;s, such as his long hair. Draco was married to Astoria Greengrass, who had died, and has a son named Scorpius.

==Characterisation==

===Outward appearance===
Draco is described as a tall, slender boy with a pale, pointed face, sleek blond hair, and ice grey eyes.

===Personality===
Draco is the prototypical spoiled, rich brat; he believes that his family&#x27;s wealth and social position gives him the right to bully those poorer than himself, such as Ron Weasley. He also insults Hermione Granger&#x27;s Muggle-born status by referring to her as a &quot;Mudblood&quot;, a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised conversations. As Rowling explained in 1999, &quot;He&#x27;s a bigot and he&#x27;s a bully, and as I say, in the most refined sense, he knows exactly what will hurt people&quot;.

In a July 2005 interview, Rowling added that Draco, unlike Harry, never feels remorse for his actions: &quot;I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he&#x27;s shut down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He&#x27;s shut down compassion— how else would you become a Death Eater?&quot;

Draco, as well as Dudley Dursley, was indoctrinated with his parents&#x27; beliefs. Rowling commented that &quot;The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, reality finally hit him&quot; because his dream was &quot;so very different&quot;. Rowling also stated that there was a real moral cowardice in Draco, but that he was not wholly bad.

Having gone through the horrors of the second wizarding war as a Death Eater, Draco abandoned the pure-blood beliefs he was originally devoted to, and grew to become a better person than he was in his youth, growing more tolerant and accepting of the non-pure-bloods of the wizarding world. He also made sure to discipline his son Scorpius to be a better child than he himself was in his youth, which made Scorpius to show kindness and become friends with Harry&#x27;s son Albus Severus, as evidence of his reformation.

===Magical abilities and skills===
During the series, Draco is portrayed as a cunning, competent young wizard. In his second year, he successfully performed the &quot;Tarantallegra&quot; curse against Harry, a curse used by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov in book 5, and also successfully cast the Serpensortia spell in the same scene, conjuring a serpent from his wand just as Voldemort would later do against Dumbledore in book 5, and Snape against McGonagall in the final book. His character further develops in the sixth book, in which he is among very few students able to reach the required level to take Advanced Potions. Draco also proved capable at Occlumency, which he learned from his Aunt Bellatrix. Rowling recalled a discussion with her editor about Draco having mastered Occlumency while Harry could not. The author said that this is due to Draco being someone &quot;very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions&quot;. Draco&#x27;s wand is 10 inches precisely, made of hawthorn with a unicorn hair core, and which Ollivander states is &quot;reasonably springy&quot;.

When asked what shape Draco&#x27;s Patronus Charm is, Rowling replied that, at least by the end of the sixth book, Draco was not capable of producing a Patronus, as it is not magic routinely taught at Hogwarts.

===Family===
The Malfoy family is one of the few remaining pure-blood wizarding clans in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and among the wealthiest. The anti-Muggle editor Brutus Malfoy is their ancestor. Lucius Malfoy was a Death Eater during both wizard wars. He marries Narcissa Black and together they have one son, Draco, who is the first Malfoy family member introduced in the series. The Malfoys are related to the Black family through Narcissa (a first cousin of Sirius Black, Harry&#x27;s godfather), which makes Draco a nephew of both Bellatrix Lestrange and Andromeda Tonks. Draco is also Nymphadora Tonks&#x27; first cousin through their mothers. Three of Draco&#x27;s grandparents are identified: Abraxas Malfoy, Cygnus Black, and Druella Rosier. Abraxas died before the series begins and was a friend of Professor Slughorn. Draco is, therefore, the scion of two old magical families. The Malfoy home, Malfoy Manor, is an elegant mansion located in the western English county of Wiltshire. They were served by Dobby the house elf until the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.

The Malfoys are a wealthy landed gentry family respected in the Wizarding world mainly from Lucius&#x27; influence with Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, gained mostly from his monetary donations to the Ministry and St Mungo&#x27;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, as well as from his post on the Hogwarts board of governors as chairman. However, he was removed from his position at the conclusion of the second book and imprisoned in Azkaban following the battle at the Department of Mysteries in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. Despite maintaining a respectable, but false, image before these events, some in the Wizarding world were previously aware that the Malfoys were devoted to Voldemort and the Dark Arts. Draco constantly uses his elite status and his father&#x27;s name and influence to gain advantages and to threaten others. Lucius is also known to have used bribery and threats.

==Reception==
In an interview at the Royal Albert Hall, Rowling noted that boys liked to dress up as Malfoy a lot more than Harry, and that people are &quot;getting far too fond of Draco&quot;, which she finds &quot;a little bit worrying&quot;. In the same interview, Stephen Fry noted that just as Harry met Malfoy, he found out that there is also racism in the wizarding world and that many characters in power can be &quot;as nasty and corrupt as in our world&quot;. Fry also noted that while &quot;Malfoy, Goyle and Crabbe are almost irredeemably bad&quot;, Malfoy, unlike his companions, &quot;is reasonably stylish&quot;. IGN listed Malfoy as their ninth top &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character.

==In popular culture==

Wizard-rock band Draco and the Malfoys&#x27; lyrics are inspired by the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books but from Draco Malfoy&#x27;s point of view. As well as Harry and the Potters, the members of Draco and the Malfoys dress themselves as Hogwarts students, in this case in Slytherin-themed costumes. The band is one of about 750 bands of young musicians playing music inspired by the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

Draco is parodied as Jerko Phoenix in the series &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, during the episodes &quot;Wizard School Part 1&quot; and &quot;Wizard School Part 2&quot;, in which Alex and Justin Russo go to a wizarding school named Wiz-tech, where everyone wears yellow and black robes, and glasses reminiscent of Harry Potter. Draco also appears as Sacco (played by Shane Lyons) in the &quot;Harry Bladder&quot; sketches in &quot;All That&quot;, in which Harry Bladder and other students often encounter Sacco&#x27;s mischief-making. In the stage production &quot;Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice&quot;, Malfoy is seen interacting with Hagrid and a dementor. Draco was also parodied in a Big Bite sketch, where he was known as Mailboy (with his father Lucius being parodied as Mailman). In Neil Cicierega&#x27;s &quot;Potter Puppet Pals&quot;, Draco stars in the episode &quot;Draco Puppet&quot;. He is different from all the other characters, simplistically made out of paper and is a smaller puppet, held and voiced by the Harry puppet. Harry created him in order to torture him, and after the puppet &quot;annoys&quot; Harry, he does a series of strange things to the paper Draco and eventually burns it on a stove. In &quot;A Very Potter Musical&quot; Draco is played by actress Lauren Lopez. He has a very obvious crush on Hermione and spends a great deal of time posing and rolling around on the floor.

<text>Beggar-my-neighbour, also known as strip jack naked, beat your neighbour out of doors, or beat jack out of doors, or beat your neighbour, is a simple choice-free card game. It is somewhat similar in nature to the children&#x27;s card game War, and has spawned a more complicated variant, Egyptian ratscrew.

== Origins ==
The game was likely invented in Great Britain and has been known there since at least the 1840s.

It may be the same as beat the knave out of doors or knave out o&#x27; doors, in which case it is much older as this game is mentioned as early as 1755.

Beggar-my-neighbor appears as a children&#x27;s game in 19th-century British novels such as Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861).

== Play ==
A standard 52-card deck is divided equally between two players, and the two stacks of cards are placed on the table face down. The first player lays down their top card face up to start a central pile, and the opponent plays their top card, also face up, on it, and this goes on alternately as long as no Ace or court card (King, Queen, or Jack) appears. These cards are called &quot;penalty cards&quot;.

If either player turns up such a card, their opponent has to pay a penalty: four cards for an Ace, three for a King, two for a Queen, or one for a Jack. They do this playing the required number of cards to the central pile. When they have done so, if all the cards are numerals, the player of the penalty card wins the hand, takes all the cards in the pile and places them under their pack. The game continues in the same fashion, the winner having the advantage of placing the first card. However, if the second player turns up another Ace or court card in the course of paying to the original penalty card, their payment ceases and the first player must pay to this new card. This changing of penalisation can continue for some time. When a single player has all of the cards in the deck in their stack, they have won.

For more than two players, play proceeds clockwise. If a player reveals a new penalty card while paying their penalty, the next player around pays the tax.

== Game theory ==
A longstanding question in combinatorial game theory asks whether there is a game of beggar-my-neighbour that goes on forever. This can happen only if the game is eventually periodic—that is, if it eventually reaches some state it has been in before. Some smaller decks of cards have infinite games, such as Camicia, while others do not. John Conway once listed this among his anti-Hilbert problems,
open questions whose pursuit should emphatically &quot;not&quot; drive the future of mathematical research.

A non-terminating game was first found by Brayden Casella and reported on 10 February 2024. The cyclic game begins and . The longest terminating game known is 1164 tricks / 8344 cards, found by Reed Nessler. 

There are formula_1 possible combinations of beggar-my-neighbour.

==In popular culture==

In the 1854 novel &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; by Wilkie Collins, Zach Thorpe and Matthew Grice kill time by playing beggar-my-neighbor &quot;for sixpence a time.&quot;

In Charles Dickens&#x27; 1861 novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, the game is the only one known by the boy protagonist (Pip) as a child.

<text>Begonia is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Begoniaceae. The genus contains more than 2,000 different plant species. The Begonias are native to moist subtropical and tropical climates. Some species are commonly grown indoors as ornamental houseplants in cooler climates. In cooler climates some species are cultivated outside in summertime for their bright colorful flowers, which have petals but no sepals.

==Description==
With 2,002 species, &quot;Begonia&quot; is one of the largest genera of flowering plants. The species are terrestrial (sometimes epiphytic) herbs or undershrubs, and occur in subtropical and tropical moist climates, in South and Central America, Africa, and southern Asia. Terrestrial species in the wild are commonly upright-stemmed, rhizomatous, or tuberous. The plants are monoecious, with unisexual male and female flowers occurring separately on the same plant; the male contains numerous stamens, and the female has a large inferior ovary and two to four branched or twisted stigmas. In most species, the fruit is a winged capsule containing numerous minute seeds, although baccate fruits are also known. The leaves, which are often large and variously marked or variegated, are usually asymmetric such that their left side and right side are different sizes. The plants vary in size from less than a foot to the recently discovered Begonia giganticaulis which can exceed twelve feet (3.6 meters) in height.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;Begonia&quot; was coined by Charles Plumier, a French patron of botany, and adopted by Linnaeus in 1753, to honor Michel Bégon, a former governor of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti).

== Phylogeny ==
The following phylogenetic tree shows the relationships among sections of the genus &quot;Begonia&quot;.

===Species===
Selected species:
* &quot;Begonia coccinea&quot;
* &quot;Begonia cucullata&quot;
* &quot;Begonia foliosa&quot;
* &quot;Begonia grandis&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia obliqua&quot;
== Cultivation ==
The different groups of begonias have different care requirements, but most species come from tropical regions, so they and their hybrids require warm temperatures. Most are forest understory plants and require bright shade; few will tolerate full sun, especially in warmer climates. In general, begonias require a well-drained growing medium that is neither constantly wet nor allowed to dry out completely. Many begonias will grow and flower year-round except for tuberous begonias, which usually have a dormant period. During this dormant period, the tubers can be stored in a cool, dry place. Begonias of the semperflorens group (or wax begonias) are frequently grown as bedding plants outdoors. Wax begonias are very attractive, they adapt well when brought inside the house for overwintering and can live up to 4-5 years.

A recent group of hybrids derived from this group is marketed as &quot;Dragonwing&quot; begonias; they are much larger both in leaf and in flower. Tuberous begonias are frequently used as container plants. Although most &quot;Begonia&quot; species are tropical or subtropical in origin, the Chinese species &quot;B. grandis&quot; is hardy to USDA hardiness zone 6 and is commonly known as the &quot;hardy begonia&quot;. Most begonias can be grown outdoors year-round in subtropical or tropical climates, but in temperate climates, begonias are grown outdoors as annuals, or as house or greenhouse plants.

Most begonias are easily propagated by division or from stem cuttings. In addition, some can be propagated from leaf cuttings or even sections of leaves, particularly the members of the rhizomatous and rex groups.

=== Horticultural nomenclature ===
The nomenclature of begonias can be very complex and confusing. The term &#x27;picotee&#x27; refers to edging on the petals that is in contrast to the color of the main petal if the colors blend. If they do not, then the term &#x27;marginata&#x27; is used, but sometimes these terms are used simultaneously. &#x27;Non-Stop&#x27; refers to a camellia tuberous hybrid that under certain conditions will bloom &#x27;non-stop&#x27; all year round.

=== Cultivar groups ===
Because of their sometimes showy flowers of white, pink, scarlet, or yellow color and often attractively marked leaves, many species and innumerable hybrids and cultivars are cultivated. The genus is unusual in that species throughout the genus, even those coming from different continents, can frequently be hybridized with each other, and this has led to an enormous number of cultivars. The American Begonia Society is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Begonia&quot;, and classifies them into several major groups:

*Cane begonia forms tough, bamboo-like canes
* shrub-like
* tuberous
* rhizomatous
* semperflorens (wax or fibrous rooted begonias)
* Rex
* trailing-scandent
* thick-stemmed
For the most part, these groups do not correspond to any formal taxonomic groupings or phylogeny, and many species and hybrids have characteristics of more than one group or do not fit well in any of them.

===AGM plants===
The following is a selection from about 70 species, varieties and cultivars which currently hold the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
* &quot;Begonia&quot; &#x27;Benitochiba&#x27; 
* &quot;Begonia dregei&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia foliosa&quot; var. &quot;miniata&quot;
* &quot;Begonia&quot; &#x27;Glowing Embers&#x27; 
* &quot;Begonia grandis&quot; subsp. &quot;evansiana&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia grandis&quot; subsp. &quot;evansiana&quot; var. &quot;alba&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia&quot; &#x27;Green Gold&#x27; 
* &quot;Begonia listada&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia luxurians&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia masoniana&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia metallica&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia solananthera&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia soli-mutata&quot; 
* &quot;Begonia sutherlandii&quot;
==Culture==
The cultivar &#x27;Kimjongilia&#x27; is a floral emblem of North Korea.

Most begonias are sour to the taste, and some people in some areas eat them. This is safe in small amounts but potentially toxic in large quantities due to the prevalence of oxalic acid in the tissues.

<doc id="44340" wikidata="Q212730" url="?curid=44340" title="Steven Pinker">
<text>Steven Arthur Pinker (born September 18, 1954) is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist, psycholinguist, popular science author, and public intellectual. He is an advocate of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.

Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He specializes in visual cognition and developmental linguistics, and his experimental topics include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, regularity and irregularity in language, the neural basis of words and grammar, and childhood language development. Other experimental topics he works on are the psychology of cooperation and of communication, including emotional expression, euphemism, innuendo, and how people use &quot;common knowledge&quot;, a term of art meaning the shared understanding in which two or more people know something, know that the other one knows, know the other one knows that they know, and so on.

Pinker has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children&#x27;s learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, positing that children use default rules, such as adding &quot;-ed&quot; to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.

Pinker is the author of nine books for general audiences. &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; (1994), &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; (1997), &quot;Words and Rules&quot; (2000), &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Stuff of Thought&quot; (2007) describe aspects of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research, positing that language is an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Sense of Style&quot; (2014) is a general language-oriented style guide. Pinker&#x27;s book &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot; (2010) posits that violence in human societies has generally declined over time, and identifies six major trends and five historical forces of this decline, the most important being the humanitarian revolution brought by the Enlightenment and its associated cultivation of reason. &quot;Enlightenment Now&quot; (2018) further argues that the human condition has generally improved over recent history because of reason, science, and humanism. The nature and importance of reason is also discussed in his next book &quot;Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters&quot; (2021).

In 2004, Pinker was named in &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Most Influential People in the World Today&quot;, and in the years 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2011 in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;″s list of &quot;Top 100 Global Thinkers&quot;. Pinker was also included in &quot;Prospect Magazine&#x27;s&quot; top 10 &quot;World Thinkers&quot; in 2013. He has won awards from the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Institution, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, and the American Humanist Association. He delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2013. He has served on the editorial boards of a variety of journals, and on the advisory boards of several institutions. Pinker was the chair of the Usage Panel of the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; from 2008 to 2018.

==Biography==
Pinker was born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1954, to a middle-class secular Jewish family in an English-speaking community. His grandparents immigrated to Canada from Poland and Romania in 1926, and owned a small necktie factory in Montreal. His father, Harry, worked in real estate and was a lawyer. His mother, Roslyn, was originally a homemaker, but later became a guidance counsellor and a high-school vice-principal. In an interview, Pinker described his mother as &quot;very intellectual&quot; and &quot;an intense reader [who] knows everything&quot;. His brother, Robert, worked for the Canadian government for several decades as an administrator and a policy analyst, while his sister, Susan Pinker, is a psychologist and writer who authored &quot;The Sexual Paradox&quot; and &quot;The Village Effect&quot;. Susan is also a columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Pinker graduated from Dawson College in 1973. He graduated from McGill University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, then did doctoral studies in experimental psychology at Harvard University under Stephen Kosslyn, receiving a PhD in 1979. He did research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a year, then became a professor at Harvard and later, Stanford University.

From 1982 until 2003 Pinker taught at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, was the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Science (1985–1994), and eventually became the director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (1994–1999), taking a one-year sabbatical at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1995–96. Since 2003 he has been serving as the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard and between 2008 and 2013 he also held the title of Harvard College Professor in recognition of his dedication to teaching. He currently gives lectures as a visiting professor at the New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.

Pinker married Nancy Etcoff in 1980 and they divorced in 1992; he married again in 1995 and again divorced. His third wife, whom he married in 2007, is the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein. He has two stepdaughters, the novelist Yael Goldstein Love and the poet Danielle Blau. Pinker adopted atheism at 13, but at various times was a &quot;cultural Jew&quot;. Pinker is an avid cyclist.

==Linguistic career==

Pinker&#x27;s research on visual cognition, begun in collaboration with his thesis adviser, Stephen Kosslyn, showed that mental images represent scenes and objects as they appear from a specific vantage point (rather than capturing their intrinsic three-dimensional structure), and thus correspond to the neuroscientist David Marr&#x27;s theory of a &quot;two-and-a-half-dimensional sketch.&quot; He also showed that this level of representation is used in visual attention, and in object recognition (at least for asymmetrical shapes), contrary to Marr&#x27;s theory that recognition uses viewpoint-independent representations.

In psycholinguistics, Pinker became known early in his career for promoting computational learning theory as a way to understand language acquisition in children. He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were &quot;Language Learnability and Language Development&quot; (1984), in Pinker&#x27;s words &quot;outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue&quot;, and &quot;Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure&quot; (1989), in Pinker&#x27;s words &quot;focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects&quot;. He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the irregular verb &quot;bring&quot;, namely &quot;brought&quot;; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb &quot;walk&quot;, namely &quot;walked&quot;.

In 1988 Pinker and Alan Prince published a critique of a connectionist model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children&#x27;s regularization of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, &quot;Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language&quot;. Pinker argued that language depends on two things: the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for grammar. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by generative phonology. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as &quot;-ed&quot;: for instance &#x27;breaked&#x27; and &#x27;comed&#x27; for &#x27;broke&#x27; and &#x27;came&#x27;. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular &quot;-ed&quot; ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as Vpast → Vstem + d, where V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a &quot;massive correlation&quot; of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as &#x27;took&#x27;, &#x27;came&#x27; and &#x27;got&#x27;, has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.

In 1990 Pinker, with Paul Bloom, published a paper arguing that the human language faculty must have evolved through natural selection. The article provided arguments for a continuity-based view of language evolution, contrary to then-current discontinuity-based theories that see language as suddenly appearing with the advent of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as a kind of evolutionary accident. This discontinuity-based view was prominently argued by two main authorities, linguist Noam Chomsky and Stephen Jay Gould. The paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in the evolutionary prehistory of language, and has been credited with shifting the central question of the debate from &quot;did language evolve?&quot; to &quot;&quot;how&quot; did language evolve?&quot; The article also presaged Pinker&#x27;s argument in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;.

In 2006 Pinker provided to Alan Dershowitz, a personal friend of Pinker&#x27;s who was Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s defense attorney, Pinker&#x27;s own interpretation of the wording of a federal law pertaining to the enticement of minors into illegal sex acts via the internet. Dershowitz included Pinker&#x27;s opinion in a letter to the court during proceedings that resulted in a plea deal in which all federal sex trafficking charges against Epstein were dropped. In 2019, Pinker stated that he was unaware of the nature of the charges against Epstein, and that he engaged in an unpaid favor for his Harvard colleague Dershowitz, as he had regularly done. He stated in an interview with BuzzFeed News that he regrets writing the letter. Pinker says he never received money from Epstein and met with him three times over more than a dozen years, and said he could never stand Epstein and tried to keep his distance.

==Popularization of science==

===Human cognition and natural language===

Pinker&#x27;s 1994 &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; was the first of several books to combine cognitive science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky&#x27;s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people&#x27;s grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider&#x27;s web-weaving or a beaver&#x27;s dam-building.

Pinker states in his introduction that his ideas are &quot;deeply influenced&quot; by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to &quot;open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics&quot; – Eric Lenneberg, George Miller, Roger Brown, Morris Halle and Alvin Liberman. Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown&#x27;s &quot;funny and instructive&quot; book &quot;Words and Things&quot; (1958) was one of the inspirations for &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;.

There has been debate about the explanatory adequacy of the theory. By 2015, the linguistic nativist views of Pinker and Chomsky had a number of challenges on the grounds that they had incorrect core assumptions and were inconsistent with research evidence from psycholinguistics and child language acquisition. The reality of Pinker&#x27;s proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by linguists such as Geoffrey Sampson in his 1997 book, &quot;Educating Eve: The &#x27;Language Instinct&#x27; Debate&quot;. Sampson argues that &quot;while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the &#x27;nature versus nurture&#x27; debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind.&quot; Sampson denies there is a language instinct, and argues that children can learn language because people can learn anything. Others have sought a middle ground between Pinker&#x27;s nativism and Sampson&#x27;s culturalism.

The assumptions underlying the nativist view have also been questioned in Jeffrey Elman&#x27;s &quot;Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development&quot;, which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book &quot;Impossible Minds&quot;, the machine intelligence researcher Igor Aleksander calls &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the &#x27;Standard Social Sciences Model&#x27; or SSSM (Pinker&#x27;s term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn&#x27;t support the SSSM, &quot;a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic state machine to play.&quot;

Two other books, &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are genetically adaptive (Pinker is an ally of Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins in many disputes surrounding adaptationism). Another major theme in Pinker&#x27;s theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. On the debate around &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;, Pinker called Thomas Sowell&#x27;s book &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; &quot;wonderful&quot;, and explained that &quot;The Tragic Vision&quot; and the &quot;Utopian Vision&quot; are the views of human nature behind right- and left-wing ideologies.

In &quot;Words and Rules: the Ingredients of Language&quot; (1999), Pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language can be understood as an interaction between the two. &quot;Words and Rules&quot; is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book. Critiqueing the book from the perspective of generative linguistics Charles Yang, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, writes that &quot;this book never runs low on hubris or hyperbole&quot;. The book&#x27;s topic, the English past tense, is in Yang&#x27;s view unglamorous, and Pinker&#x27;s attempts at compromise risk being in no man&#x27;s land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long &#x27;words&#x27;: they can&#x27;t be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. &quot;All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution.&quot;

In &quot;The Stuff of Thought&quot; (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.

Pinker is critical of theories about the evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel – a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, Pinker reiterates Immanuel Kant&#x27;s view that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to &quot;auditory cheesecake&quot;, stating that &quot;As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless&quot;. This argument has been rejected by Daniel Levitin and Joseph Carroll, experts in music cognition, who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition. In his book &quot;This Is Your Brain On Music&quot;, Levitin argues that music could provide adaptive advantage through sexual selection, social bonding, and cognitive development; he questions the assumption that music is the antecedent to language, as opposed to its progenitor, noting that many species display music-like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music.

Pinker has also been critical of &quot;whole language&quot; reading instruction techniques, stating in &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, &quot;...the dominant technique, called &#x27;whole language,&#x27; the insight that [spoken] language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into the evolutionarily improbable claim that &quot;reading&quot; is a naturally developing human instinct.&quot; In the appendix to the 2007 reprinted edition of &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, Pinker cited &quot;Why Our Children Can&#x27;t Read&quot; by cognitive psychologist Diane McGuinness as his favorite book on the subject and noted:

One raging public debate involving language went unmentioned in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;: the &quot;reading wars,&quot; or dispute over whether children should be explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as &quot;phonics&quot;) or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called &quot;whole language&quot;). I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [the sixth chapter of the book] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it&#x27;s essential for children to be taught to become aware of speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.
===&quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;===
In &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;, published in 2011, Pinker argues that violence, including tribal warfare, homicide, cruel punishments, child abuse, animal cruelty, domestic violence, lynching, pogroms, and international and civil wars, has decreased over multiple scales of time and magnitude. Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the &quot;better angels of our nature&quot;. He outlines several &quot;major historical declines of violence&quot; that all have their own social/cultural/economic causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Response to the book was divided. Many critics found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling. This and other aspects drew criticism, including the use of deaths per capita as a metric, Pinker&#x27;s liberal humanism, the focus on Europe, the interpretation of historical data, and its image of indigenous people. Archaeologist David Wengrow summarized Pinker&#x27;s approach to archaeological science as &quot;a modern psychologist making it up as he goes along&quot;.

===English writing style in the 21st century===

In his seventh popular book, &quot;The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person&#x27;s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century&quot; (2014), Pinker attempts to provide a writing style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, given that William Strunk wrote &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; in 1918, nearly a full century prior to Pinker’s publication.

==Views==

Pinker identifies as a liberal who is critical of some aspects of the political left. He supports same-sex marriage, a universal basic income, the legalization of drugs, the taxation of carbon, and the abolition of capital punishment. Pinker is a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. However, Pinker has argued that the far-left has created an atmosphere of intellectual intolerance on college campuses and elsewhere, and helped form the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard to combat what he described as an epidemic of censorship at universities. He was a signatory of the Letter on Justice and Open Debate which argued that discussion of political issues was being silenced by a widespread &quot;intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and a tendency to dissolve complex issues into a binding moral certainty.&quot;

Pinker has sharply criticized social conservatives, such as former chairman of the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics Leon Kass, for opposing stem cell research, arguing that their moral views were mere expressions of disgust that were obstructing treatments that could save millions of lives.

Pinker is a frequent participant in public debates surrounding the contributions of science to contemporary society. Social commentators such as Ed West, author of &quot;The Diversity Illusion&quot;, consider Pinker important and daring in his willingness to confront taboos, as in &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;. According to West, the doctrine of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; remained accepted &quot;as fact, rather than fantasy&quot; a decade after the book&#x27;s publication. West describes Pinker as &quot;no polemicist, and he leaves readers to draw their own conclusions&quot;.

In January 2005 Pinker defended comments by then-President of Harvard University Lawrence Summers. Summers had speculated that in addition to differing societal demands and discrimination, &quot;different availability of aptitude at the high end&quot; may contribute to gender gaps in mathematics and science. In a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science, Pinker argued in favor of the proposition that the gender difference in representation in elite universities was &quot;explainable by some combination of biological differences in average temperaments and talents interacting with socialization and bias&quot;.

In January 2009 Pinker wrote an article about the Personal Genome Project and its possible impact on the understanding of human nature in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He discussed the new developments in epigenetics and gene-environment interactions in the afterword to the 2016 edition of his book &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;. Pinker has been criticised for using the data of scientific racists (on subjects unrelated to race), such as the blogger Steven Sailer, with journalist Angela Saini stating that &quot;for many people, Pinker&#x27;s willingness to entertain the work of individuals who are on the far right and white supremacists has gone beyond the pale&quot;. Pinker has stated that he condemns racism.

In a November 2009 article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Pinker wrote a mixed review of Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s essays, criticizing his analytical methods. Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker&#x27;s comments about the importance of IQ on teaching performance and by analogy the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology could explain the two men&#x27;s differing opinions.

In an appearance for BBC World Service&#x27;s &quot;Exchanges At The Frontier&quot; programme, an audience member questioned whether the virtuous developments in culture and human nature (documented in &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;) could have expressed in our biology either through genetic or epigenetic expression. Pinker responded that it was unlikely since &quot;some of the declines have occurred far too rapidly for them to be explicable by biological evolution, which has a speed limit measured in generations, but crime can plummet in a span of 15 years and some of these humanitarian reforms like eliminating slavery and torture occurred in, say, 50 years&quot;. Helga Vierich and Cathryn Townsend wrote a critical review of Pinker&#x27;s sweeping &quot;civilizational&quot; explanations for patterns of human violence and warfare in response to a lecture he gave at Cambridge University in September 2015.

In his 2018 book &quot;Enlightenment Now&quot;, Pinker posited that Enlightenment rationality should be defended against attacks from both the political left and political right. In a debate with Pinker, post-colonial theorist Homi Bhabha said that Enlightenment philosophy had immoral consequences such as inequality, slavery, imperialism, world wars, and genocide, and that Pinker downplayed them. Pinker argued that Bhabha had perceived the causal relationship between Enlightenment thinking and these sources of suffering &quot;backwards&quot;, responding in part that &quot;The natural state of humanity, at least since the dawn of civilization, is poverty, disease, ignorance, exploitation, and violence (including slavery and imperial conquest). It is knowledge, mobilised to improve human welfare, that allows anyone to rise above this state.&quot; In a 2019 story in &quot;Current Affairs&quot;, proprietor Nathan Robinson criticised Pinker, saying that he misrepresents his critics&#x27; arguments against his work.

In 2020, an open letter to the Linguistic Society of America requesting the removal of Pinker from its list of LSA Fellows and its list of media experts was signed by hundreds of academics. The letter accused Pinker of a &quot;pattern of drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence, in particular in the immediate aftermath of violent acts and/or protests against the systems that created them&quot;, citing as examples six of Pinker&#x27;s tweets. Pinker said in reply that through this letter, he, and more importantly, younger academics with less protection, were being threatened by &quot;a regime of intimidation that constricts the theatre of ideas.&quot; Several academics criticized the letter and expressed support for Pinker. The executive committee of the Linguistic Society of America declined to strike Pinker from its lists and issued a response letter stating that &quot;It is not the mission of the Society to control the opinions of its members, nor their expression.&quot;

In December 2024, Pinker resigned from the board of honorary members of the Freedom from Religion Foundation over what he and several colleagues viewed as the Foundation&#x27;s &quot;quasi-religious&quot; approach to defining gender. His resignation was followed by those of Jerry Coyne and Richard Dawkins.

== Awards and distinctions ==

Pinker was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and one of &quot;Prospect&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;″s 100 top public intellectuals in both years the poll was carried out, 2005 and 2008; in 2010 and 2011 he was named by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; to its list of top global thinkers. In 2016, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

His research in cognitive psychology has won the Early Career Award (1984) and Boyd McCandless Award (1986) from the American Psychological Association, the Troland Research Award (1993) from the National Academy of Sciences, the Henry Dale Prize (2004) from the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and the George Miller Prize (2010) from the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. He has also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle, Surrey, Tel Aviv, McGill, Simon Fraser University and the University of Tromsø. He was twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, in 1998 and in 2003. Pinker received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1999. On May 13, 2006, he received the American Humanist Association&#x27;s Humanist of the Year award for his contributions to public understanding of human evolution. For 2022 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of &quot;Humanities and Social Sciences&quot;.

From 2008 to 2018, Pinker chaired the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary. He wrote the essay on usage for the fifth edition of the Dictionary, published in 2011. In February 2001, Pinker, &quot;whose hair has long been the object of admiration, and envy, and intense study&quot;, was nominated by acclamation as the first member of the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists (LFHCfS) organized by the &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot;.

<text>Sir Henry Bessemer (19 January 1813 – 15 March 1898) was an English inventor, whose steel-making process would become the most important technique for making steel in the nineteenth century for almost one hundred years. He also played a significant role in establishing the town of Sheffield, nicknamed ‘Steel City’, as a major industrial centre.

Bessemer had been trying to reduce the cost of steel-making for military ordnance, and developed his system for blowing air through molten pig iron to remove the impurities. This made steel easier, quicker and cheaper to manufacture, and revolutionised structural engineering. One of the most significant inventors of the Second Industrial Revolution, Bessemer also made at least 128 other inventions in the fields of iron, steel and glass. Unlike many inventors, he managed to bring his own projects to fruition and profited financially from their success. He was knighted for his contribution to science in 1879, and in the same year was made a fellow of the Royal Society.

==Father: Anthony Bessemer==
Bessemer&#x27;s father, Anthony, was born in London into a Huguenot family, but moved to Paris when he was about 21 years old. He was an inventor who, while engaged by the Paris Mint, made a machine for making medallions that could produce steel dies from a larger model. He became a member of the French Academy of Science, for his improvements to the optical microscope when he was 26. He was forced to leave Paris by the French Revolution, and returned to Britain. There he invented a process for making gold chains, which was successful, and enabled him to buy a small estate in the village of Charlton, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, where Henry was born. According to Bessemer he was given his name by his godfather Henry Caslon, who employed his father as a punchcutter.

==Early inventions==
The invention from which Bessemer made his first fortune was a series of six steam-powered machines for making bronze powder, used in the manufacture of gold paint. As he relates in his autobiography, he examined the bronze powder made in Nuremberg which was the only place where it was made at the time. He then copied and improved the product and made it capable of being made on a simple production line. It was an early example of reverse engineering where a product is analysed, and then reproduced.

The process was kept secret, with only members of his immediate family having access to the factory. The Nuremberg powder, which was made by hand, retailed in London for £5 12s per pound and he eventually reduced the price to half a crown , or about 1/40th.
The profits from sale of the paint allowed him to pursue his other inventions.

Bessemer patented a method for making a continuous ribbon of plate glass in 1848, but it was not commercially successful (, chapter 8). He gained experience in designing furnaces, which was to be of great use for his new steel-making process.

==Bessemer process==
Henry Bessemer worked on the problem of manufacturing cheap steel for ordnance production from 1850 to 1855 when he patented his method. However, William Kelly, an American inventor in Kentucky, received a priority patent in 1857, effectively nullifying Bessemer&#x27;s 1855 US patent.

On 24 August 1856 Bessemer first described the process to a meeting of the British Association in Cheltenham which he titled &quot;The Manufacture of Malleable Iron and Steel without Fuel.&quot; It was published in full in &quot;The Times&quot;. The Bessemer process involved using oxygen in air blown through molten pig iron to burn off the impurities and thus create steel. James Nasmyth had been working on a similar idea for some time prior to this. A reluctant patentor, and in this instance still working through some problems in his method, Nasmyth abandoned the project after hearing Bessemer at the meeting. Bessemer acknowledged the efforts of Nasmyth by offering him a one-third share of the value of his patent. Nasmyth turned it down as he was about to retire.
Many industries were constrained by the lack of steel, being reliant on cast iron and wrought iron alone. Examples include railway structures such as bridges and tracks, where the treacherous nature of cast iron was keenly felt by many engineers and designers. There had been many accidents when cast iron beams collapsed suddenly, such as the Dee Bridge disaster of May 1847, the Wootton bridge collapse and the Bull bridge accident of 1860. The problem recurred at the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879, and failures continued until all cast iron under-bridges were replaced by steel structures. Wrought iron structures were much more reliable with very few failures.

Though this process is no longer commercially used, at the time of its invention it was of enormous industrial importance because it lowered the cost of production steel, leading to steel being widely substituted for cast iron and wrought iron. Bessemer&#x27;s attention was drawn to the problem of steel manufacture in the course of an attempt to improve the construction of guns.

===Implementation===
Bessemer licensed the patent for his process to five ironmasters, but from the outset, the companies had great difficulty producing good-quality steel. Mr Göran Fredrik Göransson, a Swedish ironmaster, using the purer charcoal pig iron of that country, was the first to make good steel by the process, but only after many attempts. His results prompted Bessemer to try a purer iron obtained from Cumberland hematite, but even with this he had only limited success because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. Robert Forester Mushet had carried out thousands of experiments at Darkhill Ironworks, in the Forest of Dean, and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen. This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.

When Bessemer tried to induce makers to take up his improved system, he met with general rebuffs and was eventually driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. He erected steelworks in Sheffield in a business partnership with others, such as W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons, and began to manufacture steel. At first the output was insignificant, but gradually the magnitude of the operations was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer &amp; Co. was underselling them to the extent of UK£10–£15 a ton. This argument to the pocket quickly had its effect, and licences were applied for in such numbers that, in royalties for the use of his process, Bessemer received a sum in all considerably exceeding a million pounds sterling.

However Mushet received nothing and by 1866 was destitute and in ill health. In that year his 16-year-old daughter, Mary, travelled to London alone, to confront Bessemer at his offices, arguing that his success was based on the results of her father&#x27;s work. Bessemer decided to pay Mushet an annual pension of £300, a very considerable sum, which he paid for over 20 years, possibly with a view to keeping the Mushets from legal action.

Bessemer also had works in Greenwich, London, adjacent to the River Thames, from about 1865.

W. M. Lord has said with regard to this success that &quot;Sir Henry Bessemer was somewhat exceptional. He had developed his process from an idea to a practical reality in his own lifetime and he was sufficiently of a businessman to have profited by it. In so many cases, inventions were not developed quickly and the plums went to other persons than the inventors.&quot;

==Other inventions==
Bessemer was a prolific inventor and held at least 129 patents, spanning from 1838 to 1883. These included military ordnance, movable dies for embossed postage stamps, a screw extruder to extract sugar from sugar cane, and others in the fields of iron, steel and glass. These are described in some detail in his autobiography.

After suffering from seasickness in 1868, he designed the SS &quot;Bessemer&quot; (also called the &quot;Bessemer Saloon&quot;), a passenger steamship with a cabin on gimbals designed to stay level, however rough the sea, to save her passengers from seasickness. The mechanism – hydraulics controlled by a steersman watching a spirit level – worked in model form and in a trial version built in his garden in Denmark Hill, London. However, it never received a proper seagoing test as, when the ship demolished part of the Calais pier on her maiden voyage, investor confidence was lost and the ship was scrapped.

=== Continuous casting ===
Bessemer also obtained a patent in 1857 for the casting of metal between contrarotating rollers – a forerunner of today&#x27;s continuous casting processes and remarkably, Bessemer&#x27;s original idea has been implemented in the direct continuous casting of steel strip.

==Death==

Bessemer died in March 1898 at Denmark Hill, London. He is buried in West Norwood cemetery,
London SE27. Other influential Victorians such as Sir Henry Tate, Sir Henry Doulton and Baron de Reuters are buried in the same cemetery.

==Honours and legacy==
Bessemer was knighted by Queen Victoria for his contribution to science on 26 June 1879, and in the same year was made a fellow of the Royal Society. An honorary membership was conferred on Bessemer by the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1891. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1894. In 1895, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Sheffield&#x27;s Kelham Island Industrial Heritage Museum maintains an early example of a Bessemer converter for public viewing.

A school was named after him in the town of Hitchin, and when the school was demolished in the 1980s the new road built in its place was named Bessemer Close in 1995. Bessemer Way in Rotherham is also named in his honour. In 2009, the public house &quot;The Fountain&quot; in Sheffield city centre was renamed &quot;The Bessemer&quot; in homage to Henry Bessemer, who had a huge impact on the Steel City&#x27;s development. In Workington, Cumbria, the local Wetherspoons pub is now named after him.

In 2002 the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) was established from mergers encompassing historical organisations including the Iron and Steel Institute, of which Bessemer was president from 1871 to 1873; the latter organisation instituted the Bessemer Gold Medal under his tenure. IOM3 still recognises Bessemer&#x27;s legacy with an annual award of the medal for outstanding services to the steel industry; recent recipients include Indira Samarasekera.

That a man who did so much for industrial development did not receive higher recognition from his own government was a source of deep regret for English engineers, who alluded to the fact that in the United States, where the Bessemer process found much use, eight cities or towns bore his name.

<doc id="44344" wikidata="Q101538" url="?curid=44344" title="Clover">
<text>Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 

They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include &quot;Melilotus&quot; (sweet clover) and &quot;Medicago&quot; (alfalfa or Calvary clover).

As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

== Cultivation history ==

Clover was first domesticated in Spain in around the year 1000. During European urbanization, crop rotations involving clover became essential for replacing the fixed nitrogen exported to cities as food. Increased soil nitrogen levels from the spreading use of clover were one of the main reasons why European agricultural production in 1880 was about 275% of the production in 1750. Fields of clover, used as forage and newly-invented silage, became an important part of the rural landscape; adding clover made livestock feed more nutritious. Honey production also rose drastically, and clover remained the main nectar source for bees until the mid-twentieth century. Clover was carried around the world as a crop by European colonists, and some clover species became invasive in some areas.

Imports of guano and the development of the Haber-Bosch process in the 20th century substantially displaced clover as a crop, with negative effects on pollinators, but in the 1990s and 2010s, the cost of industrially-fixed nitrogen rose substantially, approximately doubling, and reviving interest in forage mixes that include clover. As the fixation process is energy-intensive, prices are closely tied to energy prices. The 21st century also saw interest in clover as a countermeasure to fight the global pollinator decline.

==Cultivation==
Several species of clover are extensively cultivated as fodder plants. The most widely cultivated clovers are white clover, &quot;Trifolium repens&quot;, and red clover, &quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;. Clover, either sown alone or in mixture with ryegrass, has for a long time formed a staple crop for silaging, for several reasons: it grows freely, shooting up again after repeated mowings; it produces an abundant crop; it is palatable to and nutritious for livestock; it fixes nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers; it grows in a great range of soils and climates; and it is appropriate for either pasturage or green composting.
In many areas, particularly on acidic soil, clover is short-lived because of a combination of insect pests, diseases and nutrient balance; this is known as &quot;clover sickness&quot;. When crop rotations are managed so that clover does not recur at intervals shorter than eight years, it grows with much of its pristine vigor.

Clovers are most efficiently pollinated by bumblebees, which have declined as a result of agricultural intensification. Honeybees can also pollinate clover, and beekeepers are often in heavy demand from farmers with clover pastures. Farmers reap the benefits of increased reseeding that occurs with increased bee activity, which means that future clover yields remain abundant. Beekeepers benefit from the clover bloom, as clover is one of the main nectar sources for honeybees.

&quot;Trifolium repens&quot;, white or Dutch clover, is a perennial abundant in meadows and good pastures. The flowers are white or pinkish, becoming brown and deflexed as the corolla fades. &quot;Trifolium hybridum&quot;, alsike or Swedish clover, is a perennial which was introduced early in the 19th century and has now become naturalized in Britain. The flowers are white or rosy, and resemble those of &quot;Trifolium repens&quot;. &quot;Trifolium medium&quot;, meadow or zigzag clover, a perennial with straggling flexuous stems and rose-purple flowers, has potential for interbreeding with &quot;T. pratense&quot; to produce perennial crop plants.

Other species are: &quot;Trifolium arvense&quot;, hare&#x27;s-foot trefoil; found in fields and dry pastures, a soft hairy plant with minute white or pale pink flowers and feathery sepals; &quot;Trifolium fragiferum&quot;, strawberry clover, with globose, rose-purple heads and swollen calyxes; &quot;Trifolium campestre&quot;, hop trefoil, on dry pastures and roadsides, the heads of pale yellow flowers suggesting miniature hops; and the somewhat similar &quot;Trifolium dubium&quot;, common in pastures and roadsides, with smaller heads and small yellow flowers turning dark brown.

== Uses ==
Clover is foraged for by wildlife such as bears, game animals, and birds. Clover is edible by humans, although red clover should be avoided by pregnant women. The plant is a traditional Native American food, which is eaten both raw and after drying and smoking the roots. The seeds from the blossoms are used to make bread. It is also possible to make tea from the blossoms.

== Symbolism ==
Shamrock, the traditional Irish symbol, which according to legend was coined by Saint Patrick for the Holy Trinity, is commonly associated with clover, although alternatively sometimes with the various species within the genus &quot;Oxalis&quot;, which are also trifoliate.

Clovers occasionally have four leaflets, instead of the usual three. These four-leaf clovers, like other rarities, are considered lucky. Clovers can also have five, six, or more leaflets, but these are rarer still. The clover&#x27;s outer leaf structure varies in physical orientation.

The record for most leaflets is 63, set on August 2, 2023, by Yoshiharu Watanabe in Japan. The previous record holder, Shigeo Obara, had discovered an 18-leaf clover in 2002, a 21-leaf clover in 2008 and a 56-leaf clover in 2009, also in Japan.

*A common idiom is &quot;to be (or to live) in clover&quot;, meaning to live a carefree life of ease, comfort, or prosperity.

* A common saying in surgery [regarding the appearance of wound after hemorrhoidectomy] is &quot;If it looks like clover, the trouble is over; if it looks like dahlia, it’s surely a failure.&quot;

*A cloverleaf interchange is named for the resemblance to the leaflets of a (four-leaf) clover when viewed from the air.

== Phylogeny ==
The first extensive classification of &quot;Trifolium&quot; had been done by Michael Zohary and David Heller, and it was subsequently released in 1984. They divided the genus into eight sections: &quot;Lotoidea, Paramesus, Mistyllus, Vesicamridula, Chronosemium, Trifolium, Trichoecephalum,&quot; and &quot;Involucrarium,&quot; with &quot;Lotoidea&quot; placed most basally. Within this classification system, &quot;Trifolium repens&quot; falls within section &quot;Lotoidea&quot;, the largest and least heterogeneous section. &quot;Lotoidea&quot; contains species from America, Africa, and Eurasia, considered a clade because of their inflorescence shape, floral structure, and legume that protrudes from the calyx. However, these traits are not unique to the section, and are shared with many other species in other sections. Zohary and Heller argued that the presence of these traits in other sections proved the basal position of &quot;Lotoidea&quot;, because they were ancestral. Aside from considering this section basal, they did not propose relationships between other sections.
Since then, molecular data has both questioned and confirmed the proposed phylogeny from Zohary and Heller. A genus-wide molecular study has since proposed a new classification system, made up of two subgenera, &quot;Chronosemium&quot; and &quot;Trifolium.&quot; This recent reclassification further divides subgenus &quot;Trifolium&quot; into eight sections. The molecular data supports the monophyletic nature of three sections proposed by Zohary and Heller (&quot;Tripholium, Paramesus,&quot; and &quot;Trichoecepalum&quot;), but not of &quot;Lotoidea&quot; (members of this section have since been reclassified into five other sections). Other molecular studies, although smaller, support the need to reorganize &quot;Lotoidea.&quot;

<doc id="44345" wikidata="Q223590" url="?curid=44345" title="Damnatio memoriae">
<text>() is a modern Latin phrase meaning &quot;condemnation of memory&quot; or &quot;damnation of memory&quot;, indicating that a person is to be excluded from official accounts. Depending on the extent, it can be a case of historical negationism. There are and have been many routes to , including the destruction of depictions, the removal of names from inscriptions and documents, and even large-scale rewritings of history. The term can be applied to other instances of official scrubbing. The practice has been seen as early as the Egyptian New Kingdom period, where the Pharaohs Hatshepsut and Akhenaten were subject to it.

After Herostratus set fire to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of antiquity, the people of Ephesus banned the mention of his name. His name has since become an eponym for people who commit crimes for the purpose of gaining notoriety.

== Etymology ==
Although the term is Latin, the phrase was not used by the ancient Romans, and first appeared in a thesis written in Germany in 1689 by Christoph Schreiter and Johann Heinrich Gerlach. The thesis was titled &quot;Dissertationem juridicam de damnatione memoriae, praescitu superiorum, in florentissima Philurea.&quot;

== Ancient world ==

Today&#x27;s best known examples of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; from antiquity concern chiselling stone inscriptions or deliberately omitting certain information from them.

=== Ancient Mesopotamia ===
According to Stefan Zawadzki, the oldest known examples of such practices come from around 3000–2000 BC. He cites the example of Lagash (an ancient city-state founded by the Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia), where preserved inscriptions concerning a conflict with another city-state, Umma, do not mention the ruler of Umma, but describe him as &quot;the man of Umma&quot;, which Zawadzki sees as an example of deliberate degradation of the ruler of Umma to the role of an unworthy person whose name and position in history the rulers of Lagash did not want to record for posterity.

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Egyptians also practiced this, as seen in relics from pharaoh Akhenaten&#x27;s tomb and elsewhere. Akhenaten&#x27;s sole worship of the god Aten, instead of the traditional pantheon, was considered heretical. During his reign, Akhenaten endeavoured to have all references to the god Amun chipped away and removed. After his reign, temples to Aten were dismantled and the stones reused to create other temples. Images of Akhenaten had their faces chipped away, and images and references to Amun reappeared. The people blamed their misfortunes on Akhenaten&#x27;s shift of worship to Atenism, away from the gods they served before him. Other Egyptian victims of this practice include the pharaohs that immediately succeeded Akhenaten, including Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, and Ay. The campaign of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against Akhenaten and his successors was initiated by Ay&#x27;s successor, Horemheb, who decided to erase from history all pharaohs associated with the unpopular Amarna Period; this process was continued by Horemheb&#x27;s successors. Tutankhamun was also erased from history in this way, even though he had restored Egypt to the Amun god, because he was one the kings who succeeded Akhenaten; he may also have been Akhenaten&#x27;s son.

=== Ancient Hittites ===
One case of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; is known for the ancient Hittite empire. Mursili III was a king of the Hittites for about seven years in 1282–1275 BC who was then overthrown by his uncle Hattusili III, who assumed the throne.

There is a well known relief of Mursili&#x27;s father Muwatalli II near the village of Sirkeli Höyük in Turkey, as well as a second, very similar relief that is believed to be that of his son Mursili. It was largely destroyed in antiquity, most likely by his spiteful uncle. The relief of the father was left untouched.

=== Ancient Greece ===
The practice was known in Ancient Greece. The Athenians frequently destroyed inscriptions which referred to individuals or events that they no longer wished to commemorate. After Timotheus was convicted of treason and removed from his post as general in 373 BC, all references to him as a general were deleted from the previous year&#x27;s naval catalogue. The most complete example is their systematic removal of all references to the Antigonids from inscriptions in their city, in 200 BC when they were besieged by the Antigonid king Philip V of Macedon during the Second Macedonian War. One decree praising Demetrius Poliorcetes (Philip V&#x27;s great-grandfather) was smashed and thrown down a well.

At Delphi, an honorific inscription erected between 337 and 327 BC for Aristotle and his nephew Callisthenes, two philosophers who were closely associated with the Macedonians, were smashed and thrown in a well after the death of Alexander of Macedon in 323 BC.

=== Ancient Rome ===
In ancient Rome, the practice of was the condemnation of emperors after their deaths. If the Senate or a later emperor did not like the acts of an emperor, they could have his property seized, his name erased and his statues reworked (normally defaced). Because there was an economic incentive to seize property and rework statues, historians and archaeologists have had difficulty determining when official actually took place, although it seems to have been quite rare.

Compounding this difficulty is the fact that a completely successful results—by definition—in the full and total erasure of the subject from the historical record. In the case of figures such as emperors or consuls it is unlikely that complete success was possible, as even comprehensive obliteration of the person&#x27;s existence and actions in records and the like would continue to be historically visible without extensive reworking. The impracticality of such a cover-up could be vast—in the case of Emperor Geta, for example, coins bearing his effigy proved difficult to entirely remove from circulation for several years, even though the mere mention of his name was punishable by death.

Difficulties in implementation also arose if there was not full and enduring agreement with the punishment, such as when the Senate&#x27;s condemnation of Nero was implemented—leading to attacks on many of his statues—but subsequently evaded with the enormous funeral he was given by Vitellius. Similarly, it was often difficult to prevent later historians from &quot;resurrecting&quot; the memory of the sanctioned person.

The impossibility of actually erasing memory of an emperor has led scholars to conclude that this was not actually the goal of &quot;damnatio&quot;. Instead, they understand &quot;damnatio&quot;: 
These emperors are known to have been erased from monuments:
== Middle Ages ==

In the Middle Ages, heresiarchs could have their memory condemned. The Council of Constance decreed the of John Wycliffe.

The practice of replacing pagan beliefs and motifs with Christian, and purposefully not recording the pagan history, has been compared to as well.

In her book &quot;Medici Women - Portraits of Power, Love and Betrayal&quot;, Gabrielle Langdon also presents compelling evidence concerning a probable damnatio memoriae issued against Isabella de&#x27; Medici, a prominent female figure of the 16th century Renaissance Medici court.

== Americas ==
=== Ancient Maya ===
Several apparent &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; incidents occurred within the Maya civilization during the Classic period (AD 250–900) as a result of political conflicts between leaders of the local kingdoms.

One notable incident occurred in the kingdom of Paʼ Chan (modern-day Yaxchilan, Mexico) in the middle of the 8th century. In June 742, the &quot;k&#x27;uhul ajaw&quot; (Holy Lord, i.e. king) of Pa&#x27; Chan, Itzamnaaj Bahlam III, died after a 60-year-long rule, during which he turned his kingdom into one of great riches after a large number of military campaigns which were recorded and illustrated on multiple high-quality stelae, lintels and hieroglyphic steps of temples which he dedicated to his military success (e.g. Temple 44) and his family (e.g. Temple 23). Though he had a son who eventually ascended to the throne after his death, there was a mysterious decade-long &quot;interregnum&quot; period in which Pa&#x27; Chan did not record the existence of any king. Itzamnaaj Bahlam&#x27;s son, Yaxun Bʼalam IV, also known as Bird Jaguar IV, ascended to the throne in April 752, nearly ten years after his father&#x27;s death.

This &quot;interregnum&quot; period may be explained by a text from the nearby northern kingdom of Yokib (modern-day Piedras Negras, Guatemala). Panel 3 of this city, largely regarded as one of the most beautiful pieces of Mayan art, was carved approximately in 782 and illustrates an episode of the reign of Itzam Kʼan Ahk II (also known as Pawaaj Kʼan Ahk II), in which he celebrated his first &quot;kʼatun&quot; (period of 7200 days) as king, on July 27, 749. Panel 3 claims that the celebration &quot;was witnessed by Sak Jukub Yopaat Bahlam, Holy Lord of Paʼ Chan.&quot; Also known as Yopaat Bahlam II, this mysterious ruler does not appear anywhere else in the historical record, not even in his supposed homeland. Moreoever, his respectful presence at a celebration in Yokib, Paʼ Chan&#x27;s centuries-old and bitter rival (which had, in fact, scored a victory in battle against Itzamnaaj Bahlam III in 726), as well as the depiction of Itzam Kʼan Ahk apparently addressing a speech (now hardly readable, but probably involving an event of Paʼ Chan&#x27;s past) toward a party from Paʼ Chan—which included his son and &quot;heir to the throne&quot; of Paʼ Chan (&quot;chʼok paʼchan ajaw&quot;), Sihyaj Ahkteʼ—, possibly indicate that he ruled as a vassal of Itzam Kʼan Ahk, or that he used the celebration as an opportunity to ask for Itzam Kʼan Ahk&#x27;s support against Yaxun Bʼalam IV, his political rival. This has led to the conclusion that if this man truly ruled Paʼ Chan, any records of his existence were destroyed during the reign of Yaxun Bʼalam IV, who notoriously led a massive propaganda campaign throughout his rule to claim legitimacy over the throne, which involved the rewriting of his kingdom&#x27;s dynastic history and restoration of several historical records of previous kings. The immense texts writing Yaxun Bʼalam&#x27;s own version of his kingdom&#x27;s dynastic history may have been carved over existing records which would have been intentionally erased with plaster, possibly destroying the records of the king (or kings) of the &quot;interregnum&quot;.

It is possible Yopaat Bahlam and his son lived the rest of their lives in exile at Yokib, and that the &quot;heir to the throne&quot; never rose to power. Yopaat Bahlam may have been buried in Burial 13 of the city, judging from a text carved on four &quot;Spondylus limbatus&quot; shells found within it which bears his name and mentions that he had previously visited the city in January 747, also within the &quot;interregnum&quot;.

=== New Spain ===

Notorious incidents of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; occurred during the existence of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Spanish colony that emerged after the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. Various viceroys ordered the destruction of monuments and documents depicting certain episodes of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican history and rebels to Spanish rule over the Americas.

For instance, Moctezuma I (not to be confused with his more famous great-grandson Moctezuma II), 15th-century &quot;huei tlahtoani&quot; (Great Speaker, i.e. emperor) of the &quot;Excan Tlahtoloyan&quot; ( Triple Capital), known by historians as the Mexica or Aztec Empire (also known as the Aztec Triple Alliance, whose inhabitants referred to themselves as Culhua-Mexica), ordered the creation of a portrait of himself and of his military and political advisor Tlacaelel at Chapultepec, a historically and naturally important site which nowadays is within Mexico City. This became a tradition among subsequent Mexica rulers, and portraits of Axayacatl and Ahuizotl, two of Moctezuma&#x27;s successors, were also made throughout the rest of the century (Tizoc&#x27;s absence may be explained by his sudden death from poisoning). Moctezuma II would create the last portrait of this kind in 1519 (which believes might be &quot;the last Aztec monument&quot;), at the eve of the Spanish conquest.

Antonio de León y Gama, a distinguished Mexican intellectual, wrote in the late 18th century that these portraits were well preserved up until that century. León y Gama claimed that the only portrait he got to see himself was Moctezuma II&#x27;s, before its destruction was ordered by the authorities in 1753 or 1754. He mentioned that Axayacatl&#x27;s portrait still existed earlier in that century before it was &quot;broken up and removed.&quot; Indeed, the remains of Moctezuma&#x27;s portrait, approximately 2 meters (over 6 feet) high, reveal that its damage was not accidental or natural. It was carved on pink-to-gray andesite, which is &quot;slightly harder than marble,&quot; according to Hajovsky. The markings in the damaged parts show that apparently its destruction was executed with the dropping of a boulder, and that deep holes were drilled &quot;perhaps in order to pry the stone apart or blow it up.&quot;

In another notorious instance, Spanish bishop Juan de Zumárraga ordered the destruction of a portrait depicting Nezahualcoyotl, king of Texcoco, on July 7, 1539, along with various other sculptures at the Hill of Texcotzingo &quot;in a manner such that they would no longer be remembered,&quot; a clear example of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.

During the Mexican War of Independence, which started in 1810, one of the earliest revolutionary leaders, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, nowadays remembered as a national Hero, was executed by the Spanish authorities in 1811. After his execution, according to contemporary accounts, the authorities declared a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. According to one of Hidalgo&#x27;s soldiers, Pedro García (1790–1873), &quot;the fierce war against Hidalgo&#x27;s memory and his ideas&quot; was done through strict censorship.
The Spanish efforts to erase his memory, however, were in vain. The War of Independence continued, and the leaders who continued to revolution after Hidalgo&#x27;s death made great efforts to commemorate his legacy. José María Morelos, for example, declared in 1813 that September 16, the anniversary of the beginning of the war, would be celebrated every year &quot;remembering always the merit of the great Hero Don Miguel Hidalgo and his partner Don Ignacio Allende.&quot;

==Similar practices in modern times==


While complete has not been attempted in modern times—naming or writing about a person fallen from favour has never been made subject to formal punishment—less total instances of in modern times include numerous examples from the Soviet Union, retouching photos to remove individuals such as Leon Trotsky, Nikolay Yezhov, and even Stalin. After Stalin ordered the murder of Grigory Kulik&#x27;s wife Kira Kulik-Simonich, all photographic records of her were destroyed; although she was described as very pretty, no photographs or other images of her survive. Following their fall from favour, Lavrentiy Beria and others were removed from articles in the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, many communist statues, particularly of Lenin and Stalin, were removed from former Soviet satellite states. Following a 2015 decision, a process of decommunization in Ukraine successfully dismantled all 1,320 statues of Lenin after its independence, as well as renaming roads and structures named under Soviet authority.

The graphic designer David King had a strong interest in Soviet art and design, and amassed a collection of over 250,000 images. His most striking examples of before-and-after alterations were published as &quot;The Commissar Vanishes&quot;.

=== Poland ===
19th century Polish writers often omitted mentioning two kings from the list of Polish monarchs, Bezprym and Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, which has resulted in their being omitted from many later works as well.

=== China ===
The treatment of Chinese politician Zhao Ziyang following his fall from grace inside the Chinese Communist Party is regarded as another modern case of .

=== Germany ===
The destruction of all copies of &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot; in order to erase Ernst Röhm is considered an act of Nazi &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. In the end, two copies survived: one preserved in London and one preserved by the Communist government of East Germany.

=== North Korea ===
In December 2013, Jang Song-thaek was abruptly accused of being a counter-revolutionary and was stripped of all his posts, expelled from the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK), arrested and executed. His photos were removed from official media and his image digitally removed from photos with other North Korean leaders.
==Analysis==
The term is used in modern scholarship to cover a wide array of official and unofficial sanctions through which the physical remnants and memories of a deceased individual are destroyed.

Looking at cases of in modern Irish history, Guy Beiner has argued that iconoclastic vandalism only makes martyrs of the &quot;dishonored&quot;, thus ensuring that they will be remembered for all time. Nonetheless, Beiner goes on to argue that the purpose of —rather than being to erase people from history—was to guarantee only negative memories of those who were so dishonored. Pointing out that did not erase people from history but in effect kept their memory alive, Beiner concluded that those who partake in the destruction of a monument should be considered agents of memory.

Author Charles Hedrick proposes that a distinction be made between (the condemnation of a deceased person) and (the actual erasure of another from historical texts).

In case of removal of Soviet monuments in Eastern Europe, the primary reason was that they were established as a symbol of occupation, domination or cult of personality, rather than simple historic mark. It has been pointed out that all Nazi-established monuments and street names have been removed after World War II which has been perceived as natural reaction after liberation at that time.

<text>The shallot is a cultivar group of the onion. Until 2010, the (French red) shallot was classified as a separate species, &quot;Allium ascalonicum&quot;. The taxon was synonymized with &quot;Allium cepa&quot; (the common onion) in 2010, as the difference was too small to justify a separate species.

As part of the onion genus &quot;Allium&quot;, its close relatives include garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, and the Chinese onion.

== Etymology and names==
The names &quot;scallion&quot; and &quot;shallot&quot; are derived from the Old French &quot;eschalotte&quot;, by way of &quot;eschaloigne&quot;, from the Latin &quot;Ascalōnia caepa&quot; or Ascalonian onion, a &quot;Ascalōnia caepa&quot; or Ascalonian onion, a namesake of the ancient city of Ascalon.

The term &quot;shallot&quot; is usually applied to the French red shallot (&quot;Allium cepa&quot; var. &quot;aggregatum&quot;, or the &quot;A. cepa&quot; Aggregatum Group). It is also used for the Persian shallot or &quot;musir&quot; (&quot;A. stipitatum&quot;) from the Zagros Mountains in Iran and Iraq, and the French gray shallot (&quot;Allium oschaninii&quot;) which is also known as &quot;griselle&quot; or &quot;true shallot&quot;; it grows wild from Central to Southwest Asia. The name &quot;shallot&quot; is also used for a scallion in New South Wales, Australia and among English-speaking people in Quebec while the term &quot;French shallot&quot; refers to the plant referred to on this page. In most English-speaking nations, the name is pronounced with the emphasis on the last syllable in common with the French pronunciation, &quot;sha-lot&quot;, while the emphasis is commonly made on the first syllable, &quot;shall-ət&quot;, in the United States.

The term &quot;eschalot&quot;, derived from the French word &quot;échalote&quot;, can also be used to refer to the shallot.

== Description and cultivation ==

Like garlic, shallots are formed in clusters of offsets with a head composed of multiple cloves. The skin colour of shallots can vary from golden brown to gray to rose red, and their off-white flesh is usually tinged with green or magenta.

Shallots are extensively cultivated for culinary uses, propagated by offsets. In some regions (&quot;long-season areas&quot;), the offsets are usually planted in autumn (September or October in the Northern Hemisphere). In some other regions, the suggested planting time for the principal crop is early spring (typically in February or the beginning of March in the Northern Hemisphere).

In planting, the tops of the bulbs should be kept a little above ground, and the soil surrounding the bulbs is often drawn away when the roots have taken hold. They come to maturity in summer, although fresh shallots can now be found year-round in supermarkets. Shallots should not be planted on ground recently manured. Shallots suffer damage from leek moth larvae, which mine into the leaves or bulbs of the plant.

==Nutrition==
A raw shallot is 80% water, 17% carbohydrates, 2.5% protein and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw shallot supplies 72 calories and is a rich source of vitamin B6 (27% of the Daily Value, DV), while providing moderate amounts of manganese (14% DV) and vitamin C (10% DV) (table). No other micronutrients are in significant content.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
Shallots are used in cooking. They may be pickled. Finely-sliced deep-fried shallots are used as a condiment in Asian cuisine, often served with porridge. Shallots taste similar to other cultivars of the common onion, but have a milder flavor. Like onions, when sliced, raw shallots release substances that irritate the human eye, resulting in production of tears.

Fresh shallots can be stored in a cool, dry area (0 to 4 °C, 32 to 40 °F, 60 to 70% RH) for six months or longer. Chopped, dried shallots are available.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, the Pikant, Atlas, and Ed&#x27;s Red types of shallots are the most common.

=== Asia ===

Shallots are the traditional choice for many dishes in Sri Lankan cuisine, including pol sambola, lunu miris and many meat, fish and vegetable dishes.

In most Indian cuisines, the distinction between onions and shallots is weak; larger varieties of shallot are sometimes confused with small red onions and used interchangeably. Indeed, most parts of India use the regional name for onion interchangeably with shallot (Maharashtra, for instance, where both are called &quot;kanda&quot;). The southern regions of India distinguish shallots from onions in recipes more often, especially the much loved tiny varieties (about the width of a finger); these are widely used in curries and different types of &quot;sambar&quot;, a lentil-based dish. Shallots pickled in red vinegar are common in many Indian restaurants, served along with sauces and papad on the condiments tray. They are also used as a home remedy for sore throats, mixed with jaggery or sugar. In Nepal, shallots are used as one of the ingredients for making &quot;momo&quot;.

In Kashmir shallots are widely used in preparation of Wazwan Kashmiri cuisine, as they add distinct flavor and prevent curry from becoming black, which is common with onions.

In Iran shallots are used in various ways, the most common being grated shallot mixed into dense yogurt, a combination served in almost every restaurant when one orders grills or kebabs. Shallots are also used to make different types of &quot;torshi&quot; (ترشی), a sour Iranian side dish consisting of a variety of vegetables under vinegar, eaten with main dishes in small quantities. Shallot is also pickled—called &quot;shour&quot; (شور) in Persian—along with other vegetables to be served as &quot;torshi&quot;.

In Southeast Asian cuisines, such as those of Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Brunei, both shallots and garlic are often used as elementary spices. Raw shallots can also accompany cucumbers when pickled in mild vinegar solution. They are also often chopped finely, then fried until golden brown, resulting in tiny crispy shallot chips called &quot;bawang goreng&quot; (fried shallots) in Indonesian, which can be bought ready-made from groceries and supermarkets. Shallots enhance the flavor of many Southeast Asian dishes, such as fried rice variants. They are also often present in noodle and slaw dishes. Crispy shallot chips are also used in southern Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, shallots are sometimes pickled and added to several traditional foods; the pickles&#x27; sourness is thought to increase the appetite. In the southern Philippines, shallot bulbs and leaves are used to make the popular spicy Maranao condiment called palapa, which is used in the dish Piaparan.

The tubular green leaves of the plant can also be eaten and are very similar to the leaves of spring onions and chives.

<text>Star Wars Episode I.I: The Phantom Edit is a fan edit of the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, removing many elements of the original film. The purpose of the edit, according to creator Mike J. Nichols, was to make a much stronger version of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; based on the previous execution and philosophies of film storytelling and editing of George Lucas. &quot;The Phantom Edit&quot; was the first unauthorized re-edit of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; to receive major publicity and acclaim and is also considered the first fan-edit of a feature film ever to be shared by an online audience.

==History==
&quot;The Phantom Edit&quot; was originally circulated in Hollywood studios in 2000 and 2001, and was followed by media attention. Salon.com, NPR, PBS, and the BBC all covered the edit to various degrees.

Rumor initially attributed &quot;The Phantom Edit&quot; to Kevin Smith, who admitted to having seen the re-edit but denied that he was the editor. The editor was revealed to be Mike J. Nichols of Santa Clarita, California, in the September 7, 2001, edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Lucasfilm, the production company of series creator George Lucas, condoned the edit and did not pursue legal action against its distributors.

==Reviews==
Critics and filmmakers have commented on the original &quot;Phantom Edit&quot;, in most cases providing the approval and recognition which furthered the fan edit movement.

* &quot;Smart editing to say the least&quot; — Kevin Smith, film director
* &quot;...Materialized from out of nowhere was a good film that had been hidden inside the disappointing original one.&quot; — Daniel Kraus, &quot;Salon&quot;
* &quot;[Done by]; someone with a gift (and equipment) for editing&quot; — Michael Wilmington, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic

The 2010 documentary film &quot;The People vs. George Lucas&quot; cites &quot;The Phantom Edit&quot; as a key example of the remix culture created by the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

<text>Rudolf Hell (19 December 1901 – 11 March 2002) was a German inventor and engineer.

== Career ==
Hell was born in Eggmühl. From 1919 to 1923, he studied electrical engineering in Munich. He worked there from 1923 to 1929 as assistant of Prof. Max Dieckmann, with whom he operated a television station at the &quot;Verkehrsausstellung&quot; (lit.: &quot;traffic exhibition&quot;) in Munich in 1925. In the same year Hell invented an apparatus called the &quot;Hellschreiber&quot;, an early forerunner to impact dot matrix printers and faxes. Hell received a patent for the Hellschreiber in 1929.

In the year 1929 he founded his own company in Babelsberg. After World War II he re-founded his company in Kiel. He kept on working as an engineer and invented machines for electronically controlled engraving of printing plates and an electronic photo typesetting system called &quot;digiset&quot; marketed in the US as &quot;VideoComp&quot; by RCA and later by III.

He has received numerous awards such as the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Gutenberg Prize of the International Gutenberg Society and the City of Mainz, the Werner von Siemens Ring and the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation (1992).

His company was taken over by Siemens AG in 1981 and merged with Linotype in 1990, becoming &quot;Linotype-Hell AG&quot;.

Hellschreiber is still in use today by amateur radio (ham) operators around the world. Hellverein Kiel collects Hell devices and keeps them functional. In addition, the website contains numerous documents and patents relating to the Hell devices: https://www.hell-kiel.de/en/

== Death ==
Rudolf Hell died in Kiel on 11 March 2002.

<doc id="44353" wikidata="Q2915914" url="?curid=44353" title="Selfish genetic element">
<text>Selfish genetic elements (historically also referred to as selfish genes, ultra-selfish genes, selfish DNA, parasitic DNA and genomic outlaws) are genetic segments that can enhance their own transmission at the expense of other genes in the genome, even if this has no positive or a net negative effect on organismal fitness. Genomes have traditionally been viewed as cohesive units, with genes acting together to improve the fitness of the organism.

Early observations of selfish genetic elements were made almost a century ago, but the topic did not get widespread attention until several decades later. Inspired by the gene-centred views of evolution popularized by George Williams and Richard Dawkins, two papers were published back-to-back in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1980 – by Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick and by Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza – introducing the concept of selfish genetic elements (at the time called &quot;selfish DNA&quot;) to the wider scientific community. Both papers emphasized that genes can spread in a population regardless of their effect on organismal fitness as long as they have a transmission advantage.

Selfish genetic elements have now been described in most groups of organisms, and they demonstrate a remarkable diversity in the ways by which they promote their own transmission. Though long dismissed as genetic curiosities, with little relevance for evolution, they are now recognized to affect a wide swath of biological processes, ranging from genome size and architecture to speciation.

==History==
===Early observations ===
Observations of what is now referred to as selfish genetic elements go back to the early days in the history of genetics. Already in 1928, Russian geneticist Sergey Gershenson reported the discovery of a driving X chromosome in &quot;Drosophila obscura&quot;. Crucially, he noted that the resulting female-biased sex ratio may drive a population extinct (see Species extinction). The earliest clear statement of how chromosomes may spread in a population not because of their positive fitness effects on the individual organism, but because of their own &quot;parasitic&quot; nature came from the Swedish botanist and cytogeneticist Gunnar Östergren in 1945. Discussing B chromosomes in plants he wrote:

In many cases these chromosomes have no useful function at all to the species carrying them, but that they often lead an exclusively parasitic existence ... [B chromosomes] need not be useful for the plants. They need only be useful to themselves.

Around the same time, several other examples of selfish genetic elements were reported. For example, the American maize geneticist Marcus Rhoades described how chromosomal knobs led to female meiotic drive in maize. Similarly, this was also when it was first suggested that an intragenomic conflict between uniparentally inherited mitochondrial genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes could lead to cytoplasmic male sterility in plants. Then, in the early 1950s, Barbara McClintock published a series of papers describing the existence of transposable elements, which are now recognized to be among the most successful selfish genetic elements. The discovery of transposable elements led to her being awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1983.

=== Conceptual developments ===
The empirical study of selfish genetic elements benefited greatly from the emergence of the so-called gene-centred view of evolution in the nineteen sixties and seventies. In contrast with Darwin&#x27;s original formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection that focused on individual organisms, the gene&#x27;s-eye view takes the gene to be the central unit of selection in evolution. It conceives evolution by natural selection as a process involving two separate entities: replicators (entities that produce faithful copies of themselves, usually genes) and vehicles (or interactors; entities that interact with the ecological environment, usually organisms).

Since organisms are temporary occurrences, present in one generation and gone in the next, genes (replicators) are the only entity faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring. Viewing evolution as a struggle between competing replicators made it easier to recognize that not all genes in an organism would share the same evolutionary fate.

The gene&#x27;s-eye view was a synthesis of the population genetic models of the modern synthesis, in particular the work of RA Fisher, and the social evolution models of W. D. Hamilton. The view was popularized by George Williams&#x27;s &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; and Richard Dawkins&#x27;s best seller &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. Dawkins summarized a key benefit from the gene&#x27;s-eye view as follows:

&quot;If we allow ourselves the license of talking about genes as if they had conscious aims, always reassuring ourselves that we could translate our sloppy language back into respectable terms if we wanted to, we can ask the question, what is a single selfish gene trying to do?&quot; — Richard Dawkins, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;

In 1980, two high-profile papers published back-to-back in &quot;Nature&quot; by Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick, and by Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza, brought the study of selfish genetic elements to the centre of biological debate. The papers took their starting point in the contemporary debate of the so-called C-value paradox, the lack of correlation between genome size and perceived complexity of a species. Both papers attempted to counter the prevailing view of the time that the presence of differential amounts of non-coding DNA and transposable elements is best explained from the perspective of individual fitness, described as the &quot;phenotypic paradigm&quot; by Doolittle and Sapienza. Instead, the authors argued that much of the genetic material in eukaryotic genomes persists, not because of its phenotypic effects, but can be understood from a gene&#x27;s-eye view, without invoking individual-level explanations. The two papers led to a series of exchanges in &quot;Nature&quot;.

=== Current views ===
If the selfish DNA papers marked the beginning of the serious study of selfish genetic elements, the subsequent decades have seen an explosion in theoretical advances and empirical discoveries. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby wrote a landmark review about the conflict between maternally inherited cytoplasmic genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes. The paper also provided a comprehensive introduction to the logic of genomic conflicts, foreshadowing many themes that would later be subject of much research. Then in 1988 John H. Werren and colleagues wrote the first major empirical review of the topic. This paper achieved three things. First, it coined the term selfish genetic element, putting an end to a sometimes confusingly diverse terminology (selfish genes, ultra-selfish genes, selfish DNA, parasitic DNA, genomic outlaws). Second, it formally defined the concept of selfish genetic elements. Finally, it was the first paper to bring together all different kinds of selfish genetic elements known at the time (genomic imprinting, for example, was not covered).

In the late 1980s, most molecular biologists considered selfish genetic elements to be the exception, and that genomes were best thought of as highly integrated networks with a coherent effect on organismal fitness. In 2006, when Austin Burt and Robert Trivers published the first book-length treatment of the topic, the tide was changing. While their role in evolution long remained controversial, in a review published a century after their first discovery, William R. Rice concluded that &quot;nothing in genetics makes sense except in the light of genomic conflicts&quot;.

== Logic ==
Though selfish genetic elements show a remarkable diversity in the way they promote their own transmission, some generalizations about their biology can be made. In a classic 2001 review, Gregory D.D. Hurst and John H. Werren proposed two ‘rules&#x27; of selfish genetic elements.

=== Rule 1: Spread requires sex and outbreeding ===
Sexual reproduction involves the mixing of genes from two individuals. According to Mendel&#x27;s Law of Segregation, alleles in a sexually reproducing organism have a 50% chance of being passed from parent to offspring. Meiosis is therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;fair&quot;.

Highly self-fertilizing or asexual genomes are expected to experience less conflict between selfish genetic elements and the rest of the host genome than outcrossing sexual genomes. There are several reasons for this. First, sex and outcrossing put selfish genetic elements into new genetic lineages. In contrast, in a highly selfing or asexual lineage, any selfish genetic element is essentially stuck in that lineage, which should increase variation in fitness among individuals. The increased variation should result in stronger purifying selection in selfers/asexuals, as a lineage without the selfish genetic elements should out-compete a lineage with the selfish genetic element. Second, the increased homozygosity in selfers removes the opportunity for competition among homologous alleles. Third, theoretical work has shown that the greater linkage disequilibrium in selfing compared to outcrossing genomes may in some, albeit rather limited, cases cause selection for reduced transposition rates. Overall, this reasoning leads to the prediction that asexuals/selfers should experience a lower load of selfish genetic elements. One caveat to this is that the evolution of selfing is associated with a reduction in the effective population size. A reduction in the effective population size should reduce the efficacy of selection and therefore leads to the opposite prediction: higher accumulation of selfish genetic elements in selfers relative to outcrossers.

Empirical evidence for the importance of sex and outcrossing comes from a variety of selfish genetic elements, including transposable elements, self-promoting plasmids, and B chromosomes.

=== Rule 2: Presence is often revealed in hybrids ===
The presence of selfish genetic elements can be difficult to detect in natural populations. Instead, their phenotypic consequences often become apparent in hybrids. The first reason for this is that some selfish genetic elements rapidly sweep to fixation, and the phenotypic effects will therefore not be segregating in the population. Hybridization events, however, will produce offspring with and without the selfish genetic elements and so reveal their presence. The second reason is that host genomes have evolved mechanisms to suppress the activity of the selfish genetic elements, for example the small RNA administered silencing of transposable elements. The co-evolution between selfish genetic elements and their suppressors can be rapid, and follow a Red Queen dynamics, which may mask the presence of selfish genetic elements in a population. Hybrid offspring, on the other hand, may  inherit a given selfish genetic element, but not the corresponding suppressor and so reveal the phenotypic effect of the selfish genetic element.

== Examples ==

=== Segregation distorters ===

Some selfish genetic elements manipulate the to their own advantage, and so end up being overrepresented in the gametes. Such distortion can occur in various ways, and the umbrella term that encompasses all of them is segregation distortion. Some elements can preferentially be transmitted in egg cells as opposed to polar bodies during meiosis, where only the former will be fertilized and transmitted to the next generation. Any gene that can manipulate the odds of ending up in the egg rather than the polar body will have a transmission advantage, and will increase in frequency in a population.

Segregation distortion can happen in several ways. When this process occurs during meiosis it is referred to as . Many forms of segregation distortion occur in male gamete formation, where there is differential mortality of spermatids during the process of sperm maturation or . The segregation distorter (SD) in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is the best studied example, and it involves a nuclear envelope protein Ran-GAP and the X-linked repeat array called Responder (Rsp), where the SD allele of Ran-GAP favors its own transmission only in the presence of a Rspsensitive allele on the homologous chromosome. SD acts to kill RSPsensitive sperm, in a post-meiotic process (hence it is not strictly speaking meiotic drive). Systems like this can have interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamics, oscillating between the SD-RSPinsensitive, SD+-RSPinsensitive and SD+-RSPsensitive haplotypes. The SD-RSPsensitive haplotype is not seen because it essentially commits suicide.

When segregation distortion acts on sex chromosomes, they can skew the sex ratio. The SR system in &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;, for example, is on the X chromosome, and XSR/Y males produce only daughters, whereas females undergo normal meiosis with Mendelian proportions of gametes. Segregation distortion systems would drive the favored allele to fixation, except that most of the cases where these systems have been identified have the driven allele opposed by some other selective force. One example is the lethality of the t-haplotype in mice, another is the effect on male fertility of the Sex Ratio system in &quot;D. pseudoobscura&quot;.

=== Homing endonucleases ===

A phenomenon closely related to segregation distortion is homing endonucleases. These are enzymes that cut DNA in a sequence-specific way, and those cuts, generally double-strand breaks, are then &quot;healed&quot; by the regular DNA repair machinery. Homing endonucleases insert themselves into the genome at the site homologous to the first insertion site, resulting in a conversion of a heterozygote into a homozygote bearing a copy of the homing endonuclease on both homologous chromosomes. This gives homing endonucleases an allele frequency dynamics rather similar to a segregation distortion system, and generally unless opposed by strong countervailing selection, they are expected to go to fixation in a population. CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows the artificial construction of homing endonuclease systems. These so-called &quot;gene drive&quot; systems pose a combination of great promise for biocontrol but also potential risk.

=== Transposable elements ===

Transposable elements (TEs) include a wide variety of DNA sequences that all have the ability to move to new locations in the genome of their host. Transposons do this by a direct cut-and-paste mechanism, whereas retrotransposons need to produce an RNA intermediate to move. TEs were first discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in the 1940s and their ability to occur in both active and quiescent states in the genome was also first elucidated by McClintock. TEs have been referred to as selfish genetic elements because they have some control over their own propagation in the genome. Most random insertions into the genome appear to be relatively innocuous, but they can disrupt critical gene functions with devastating results. For example, TEs have been linked to a variety of human diseases, ranging from cancer to haemophilia. TEs that tend to avoid disrupting vital functions in the genome tend to remain in the genome longer, and hence they are more likely to be found in innocuous locations.

Both plant and animal hosts have evolved means for reducing the fitness impact of TEs, both by directly silencing them and by reducing their ability to transpose in the genome. It would appear that hosts in general are fairly tolerant of TEs in their genomes, since a sizable portion (30-80%) of the genome of many animals and plants is TEs. When the host is able to stop their movement, TEs can simply be frozen in place, and it then can take millions of years for them to mutate away. The fitness of a TE is a combination of its ability to expand in numbers within a genome, to evade host defenses, but also to avoid eroding host fitness too drastically. The effect of TEs in the genome is not entirely selfish. Because their insertion into the genome can disrupt gene function, sometimes those disruptions can have positive fitness value for the host. Many adaptive changes in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and dogs for example, are associated with TE insertions.

=== B chromosomes ===
B chromosomes refer to chromosomes that are not required for the viability or fertility of the organism, but exist in addition to the normal (A) set. They persist in the population and accumulate because they have the ability to propagate their own transmission independently of the A chromosomes. They often vary in copy number between individuals of the same species.

B chromosomes were first detected over a century ago. Though typically smaller than normal chromosomes, their gene poor, heterochromatin-rich structure made them visible to early cytogenetic techniques. B chromosomes have been thoroughly studied and are estimated to occur in 15% of all eukaryotic species. In general, they appear to be particularly common among eudicot plants, rare in mammals, and absent in birds. In 1945, they were the subject of Gunnar Östergren&#x27;s classic paper &quot;Parasitic nature of extra fragment chromosomes&quot;, where he argues that the variation in abundance of B chromosomes between and within species is because of the parasitic properties of the Bs. This was the first time genetic material was referred to as &quot;parasitic&quot; or &quot;selfish&quot;. B chromosome number correlates positively with genome size and has also been linked to a decrease in egg production in the grasshopper &quot;Eyprepocnemis plorans&quot;.

=== Selfish mitochondria ===
Genomic conflicts often arise because not all genes are inherited in the same way. Probably the best example of this is the conflict between uniparentally (usually but not always, maternally) inherited mitochondrial and biparentally inherited nuclear genes. Indeed, one of the earliest clear statements about the possibility of genomic conflict was made by the English botanist Dan Lewis in reference to the conflict between maternally inherited mitochondrial and biparentally inherited nuclear genes over sex allocation in hermaphroditic plants.

A single cell typically contains multiple mitochondria, creating a situation for competition over transmission. Uniparental inheritance has been suggested to be a way to reduce the opportunity for selfish mitochondria to spread, as it ensures all mitochondria share the same genome, thus removing the opportunity for competition. This view remains widely held, but has been challenged. Why inheritance ended up being maternal, rather than paternal, is also much debated, but one key hypothesis is that the mutation rate is lower in female compared to male gametes.

The conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear genes is especially easy to study in flowering plants. Flowering plants are typically hermaphrodites, and the conflict thus occurs within a single individual. Mitochondrial genes are typically only transmitted through female gametes, and therefore from their point of view the production of pollen leads to an evolutionary dead end. Any mitochondrial mutation that can affect the amount of resources the plant invests in the female reproductive functions at the expense of the male reproductive functions improves its own chance of transmission. Cytoplasmic male sterility is the loss of male fertility, typically through loss of functional pollen production, resulting from a mitochondrial mutation. In many species where cytoplasmic male sterility occurs, the nuclear genome has evolved so-called restorer genes, which repress the effects of the cytoplasmic male sterility genes and restore the male function, making the plant a hermaphrodite again.

The co-evolutionary arms race between selfish mitochondrial genes and nuclear compensatory alleles can often be detected by crossing individuals from different species that have different combinations of male sterility genes and nuclear restorers, resulting in hybrids with a mismatch.

Another consequence of the maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome is the so-called Mother&#x27;s Curse. Because genes in the mitochondrial genome are strictly maternally inherited, mutations that are beneficial in females can spread in a population even if they are deleterious in males. Explicit screens in fruit flies have successfully identified such female-neutral but male-harming mtDNA mutations. Furthermore, a 2017 paper showed how a mitochondrial mutation causing Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy, a male-biased eye disease, was brought over by one of the &quot;Filles du roi&quot; that arrived in Quebec, Canada, in the 17th century and subsequently spread among many descendants.

=== Genomic imprinting ===

Another sort of conflict that genomes face is that between the mother and father competing for control of gene expression in the offspring, including the complete silencing of one parental allele. Due to differences in methylation status of gametes, there is an inherent asymmetry to the maternal and paternal genomes that can be used to drive a differential parent-of-origin expression. This results in a violation of Mendel&#x27;s rules at the level of expression, not transmission, but if the gene expression affects fitness, it can amount to a similar result.

Imprinting seems like a maladaptive phenomenon, since it essentially means giving up diploidy, and heterozygotes for one defective allele are in trouble if the active allele is the one that is silenced. Several human diseases, such as Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, are associated with defects in imprinted genes. The asymmetry of maternal and paternal expression suggests that some kind of conflict between these two genomes might be driving the evolution of imprinting. In particular, several genes in placental mammals display expression of paternal genes that maximize offspring growth, and maternal genes that tend to keep that growth in check. Many other conflict-based theories about the evolution of genomic imprinting have been put forward.

At the same time, genomic or sexual conflict are not the only possible mechanisms whereby imprinting can evolve. Several molecular mechanisms for genomic imprinting have been described, and all have the aspect that maternally and paternally derived alleles are made to have distinct epigenetic marks, in particular the degree of methylation of cytosines. An important point to note regarding genomic imprinting is that it is quite heterogeneous, with different mechanisms and different consequences of having single parent-of-origin expression. For example, examining the imprinting status of closely related species allows one to see that a gene that is moved by an inversion into close proximity of imprinted genes may itself acquire an imprinted status, even if there is no particular fitness consequence of the imprinting.

=== Greenbeards ===
A greenbeard gene is a gene that has the ability to recognize copies of itself in other individuals and then make its carrier act preferentially toward such individuals. The name itself comes from thought-experiment first presented by William Hamilton and then it was developed and given its current name by Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Selfish Gene.&quot; The point of the thought experiment was to highlight that from a gene&#x27;s-eye view, it is not the genome-wide relatedness that matters (which is usually how kin selection operates, i.e. cooperative behavior is directed towards relatives), but the relatedness at the particular locus that underlies the social behavior.

Following Dawkins, a greenbeard is usually defined as a gene, or set of closely linked genes, that has three effects:

# It gives carriers of the gene a phenotypic label, such as a greenbeard.
# The carrier is able to recognize other individuals with the same label.
# The carrier then behaves altruistically towards individuals with the same label.

Greenbeards were long thought to be a fun theoretical idea, with limited possibility of them actually existing in nature. However, since its conception, several examples have been identified, including in yeast, slime moulds, and fire ants.  

There has been some debate whether greenbeard genes should be considered selfish genetic elements. Conflict between a greenbeard locus and the rest of the genome can arise because during a given social interaction between two individuals, the relatedness at the greenbeard locus can be higher than at other loci in the genome. As a consequence, it may in the interest of the greenbeard locus to perform a costly social act, but not in the interest of the rest of the genome.

In conjunction with selfish genetic elements, greenbeard selection has also been used as a theoretical explanation for suicide.

== Consequences to the host ==

=== Species extinction ===
Perhaps one of the clearest ways to see that the process of natural selection does not always have organismal fitness as the sole driver is when selfish genetic elements have their way without restriction. In such cases, selfish elements can, in principle, result in species extinction. This possibility was pointed out already in 1928 by Sergey Gershenson and then in 1967, Bill Hamilton developed a formal population genetic model for a case of segregation distortion of sex chromosomes driving a population to extinction. In particular, if a selfish element should be able to direct the production of sperm, such that males bearing the element on the Y chromosome would produce an excess of Y-bearing sperm, then in the absence of any countervailing force, this would ultimately result in the Y chromosome going to fixation in the population, producing an extremely male-biased sex ratio. In ecologically challenged species, such biased sex ratios imply that the conversion of resources to offspring becomes very inefficient, to the point of risking extinction.

=== Speciation ===
Selfish genetic elements have been shown to play a role in speciation. This could happen because the presence of selfish genetic elements can result in changes in morphology and/or life history, but ways by which the co-evolution between selfish genetic elements and their suppressors can cause reproductive isolation through so-called Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities has received particular attention.

An early striking example of hybrid dysgenesis induced by a selfish genetic element was the &quot;P&quot; element in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. If males carrying the &quot;P&quot; element were crossed to females lacking it, the resulting offspring suffered from reduced fitness. However, offspring of the reciprocal cross were normal, as would be expected since piRNAs are maternally inherited. The &quot;P&quot; element is typically present only in wild strains, and not in lab strains of &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;, as the latter were collected before the &quot;P&quot; elements were introduced into the species, probably from a closely related &quot;Drosophila&quot; species. The &quot;P&quot; element story is also a good example of how the rapid co-evolution between selfish genetic elements and their silencers can lead to incompatibilities on short evolutionary time scales, as little as within a few decades.

Several other examples of selfish genetic elements causing reproductive isolation have since been demonstrated. Crossing different species of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; results in both higher activity of transposable elements and disruption in imprinting, both of which have been linked to fitness reduction in the resulting hybrids. Hybrid dysgenesis has also been shown to be caused by centromeric drive in barley and in several species of angiosperms by mito-nuclear conflict.

=== Genome-size variation ===
Attempts to understand the extraordinary variation in genome size (C-value)—animals vary 7,000 fold and land plants some 2,400-fold—has a long history in biology. However, this variation is poorly correlated with gene number or any measure of organismal complexity, which led CA Thomas to coin the term C-value paradox in 1971. The discovery of non-coding DNA resolved some of the paradox, and most current researchers now use the term &quot;C-value enigma&quot;.

Two kinds of selfish genetic elements in particular have been shown to contribute to genome-size variation: B chromosomes and transposable elements. The contribution of transposable elements to the genome is especially well studied in plants. A striking example is how the genome of the model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; contains the same number of genes as that of the Norwegian spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), around 30,000, but accumulation of transposons means that the genome of the latter is some 100 times larger. Transposable element abundance has also been shown to cause the unusually large genomes found in salamanders.

The presence of an abundance of transposable elements in many eukaryotic genomes was a central theme of the original selfish DNA papers mentioned above (See Conceptual developments). Most people quickly accepted the central message of those papers, that the existence of transposable elements can be explained by selfish selection at the gene level and there is no need to invoke individual level selection. However, the idea that organisms keep transposable elements around as genetic reservoir to &quot;speed up evolution&quot; or for other regulatory functions persists in some quarters. In 2012, when the ENCODE Project published a paper claiming that 80% of the human genome can be assigned a function, a claim interpreted by many as the death of the idea of junk DNA, this debate was reignited.

== Applications in agriculture and biotechnology ==

=== Cytoplasmic male sterility in plant breeding ===
A common problem for plant breeders is unwanted self-fertilization. This is particularly a problem when breeders try to cross two different strains to create a new hybrid strain. One way to avoid this is manual emasculation, i.e. physically removing anthers to render the individual male sterile. Cytoplasmic male sterility offers an alternative to this laborious exercise. Breeders cross a strain that carries a cytoplasmic male sterility mutation with a strain that does not, the latter acting as the pollen donor. If the hybrid offspring are to be harvested for their seed (like maize), and therefore needs to be male fertile, the parental strains need to be homozygous for the restorer allele. In contrast, in species that harvested for their vegetable parts, like onions, this is not an issue. This technique has been used in a wide variety of crops, including rice, maize, sunflower, wheat, and cotton.

=== PiggyBac vectors ===
While many transposable elements seem to do no good for the host, some transposable elements have been &quot;tamed&quot; by molecular biologists so that the elements can be made to insert and excise at the will of the scientist. Such elements are especially useful for doing genetic manipulations, like inserting foreign DNA into the genomes of a variety of organisms.

One excellent example of this is PiggyBac, a transposable element that can efficiently move between cloning vectors and chromosomes using a &quot;cut and paste&quot; mechanism. The investigator constructs a PiggyBac element with the desired payload spliced in, and a second element (the PiggyBac transposase), located on another plasmid vector, can be co-transfected into the target cell. The PiggyBac transposase cuts at the inverted terminal repeat sequences located on both ends of the PiggyBac vector and efficiently moves the contents from the original sites and integrates them into chromosomal positions where the sequence TTAA is found. The three things that make PiggyBac so useful are the remarkably high efficiency of this cut-and-paste operation, its ability to take payloads up to 200 kb in size, and its ability to leave a perfectly seamless cut from a genomic site, leaving no sequences or mutations behind.

=== CRISPR gene drive and homing endonuclease systems ===
CRISPR allows the construction of artificial homing endonucleases, where the construct produces guide RNAs that cut the target gene, and homologous flanking sequences then allow insertion of the same construct harboring the Cas9 gene and the guide RNAs. Such gene drives ought to have the ability to rapidly spread in a population (see Gene-drive systems), and one practical application of such a system that has been proposed is to apply it to a pest population, greatly reducing its numbers or even driving it extinct. This has not yet been attempted in the field, but gene drive constructs have been tested in the lab, and the ability to insert into the wild-type homologous allele in heterozygotes for the gene drive has been demonstrated. Unfortunately, the double-strand break that is introduced by Cas9 can be corrected by homology directed repair, which would make a perfect copy of the drive, or by non-homologous end joining, which would produce &quot;resistant&quot; alleles unable to further propagate themselves. When Cas9 is expressed outside of meiosis, it seems like non-homologous end joining predominates, making this the biggest hurdle to practical application of gene drives.

== Mathematical theory ==
Much of the confusion regarding ideas about selfish genetic elements center on the use of language and the way the elements and their evolutionary dynamics are described. Mathematical models allow the assumptions and the rules to be given &quot;a priori&quot; for establishing mathematical statements about the expected dynamics of the elements in populations. The consequences of having such elements in genomes can then be explored objectively. The mathematics can define very crisply the different classes of elements by their precise behavior within a population, sidestepping any distracting verbiage about the inner hopes and desires of greedy selfish genes. There are many good examples of this approach, and this article focuses on segregation distorters, gene drive systems and transposable elements.

=== Segregation distorters ===
The mouse t-allele is a classic example of a segregation distorter system that has been modeled in great detail. Heterozygotes for a t-haplotype produce &gt;90% of their gametes bearing the t (see Segregation distorters), and homozygotes for a t-haplotype die as embryos. This can result in a stable polymorphism, with an equilibrium frequency that depends on the drive strength and direct fitness impacts of t-haplotypes. This is a common theme in the mathematics of segregation distorters:virtually every example we know entails a countervailing selective effect, without which the allele with biased transmission would go to fixation and the segregation distortion would no longer be manifested. Whenever sex chromosomes undergo segregation distortion, the population sex ratio is altered, making these systems particularly interesting. Two classic examples of segregation distortion involving sex chromosomes include the &quot;Sex Ratio&quot; X chromosomes of &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; and Y chromosome drive suppressors of &quot;Drosophila mediopunctata&quot;. A crucial point about the theory of segregation distorters is that just because there are fitness effects acting against the distorter, this does not guarantee that there will be a stable polymorphism. In fact, some sex chromosome drivers can produce frequency dynamics with wild oscillations and cycles.

=== Gene-drive systems ===
The idea of spreading a gene into a population as a means of population control is actually quite old, and models for the dynamics of introduced compound chromosomes date back to the 1970s. Subsequently, the population genetics theory for homing endonucleases and CRISPR-based gene drives has become much more advanced. An important component of modeling these processes in natural populations is to consider the genetic response in the target population. For one thing, any natural population will harbor standing genetic variation, and that variation might well include polymorphism in the sequences homologous to the guide RNAs, or the homology arms that are meant to direct the repair. In addition, different hosts and different constructs may have quite different rates of non-homologous end joining, the form of repair that results in broken or resistant alleles that no longer spread. Full accommodation of the host factors presents considerable challenge for getting a gene drive construct to go to fixation, and Unckless and colleagues show that in fact the current constructs are quite far from being able to attain even moderate frequencies in natural populations. This is another excellent example showing that just because an element appears to have a strong selfish transmission advantage, whether it can successfully spread may depend on subtle configurations of other parameters in the population.

=== Transposable elements ===
To model the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) within a genome, one has to realize that the elements behave like a population within each genome, and they can jump from one haploid genome to another by horizontal transfer. The mathematics has to describe the rates and dependencies of these transfer events. It was observed early on that the rate of jumping of many TEs varies with copy number, and so the first models simply used an empirical function for the rate of transposition. This had the advantage that it could be measured by experiments in the lab, but it left open the question of why the rate differs among elements and differs with copy number. Stan Sawyer and Daniel L. Hartl fitted models of this sort to a variety of bacterial TEs, and obtained quite good fits between copy number and transmission rate and the population-wide incidence of the TEs. TEs in higher organisms, like &quot;Drosophila&quot;, have a very different dynamics because of sex, and Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth, Charles Langley, John Brookfield and others modeled TE copy number evolution in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and other species. What is impressive about all these modeling efforts is how well they fitted empirical data, given that this was decades before discovery of the fact that the host fly has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of piRNAs. Incorporation of host defense along with TE dynamics into evolutionary models of TE regulation is still in its infancy.

<doc id="44354" wikidata="Q207739" url="?curid=44354" title="Carole Lombard">
<text>Carole Lombard (born Jane Alice Peters; October 6, 1908 – January 16, 1942) was an American actress. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Lombard 23rd on its list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

Born into a wealthy family, Lombard was raised by her single mother. She made her screen debut in &quot;A Perfect Crime&quot; (1921) at the age of 12 and the experience spurred her and her mother to seek further film work, eventually resulting in a movie career.

Lombard was killed in a plane crash aboard TWA Flight 3 while returning from a war bond tour. She was 33 years old. Today, she is remembered as one of the definitive actresses of the screwball comedy genre and American comedy and as an icon of American cinema.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education (1908–1920)===
Lombard was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on October 6, 1908, at 704 Rockhill Street. Christened Jane Alice Peters, she was the third child and only daughter of Frederic Christian Peters (1875–1935) and Elizabeth Jayne &quot;Bessie&quot; (Knight) Peters (1876–1942). Her two older brothers, with whom she was close all her life, were Frederic Charles (1902–1979) and John Stuart (1906–1956). Lombard&#x27;s parents both came from wealthy families, and biographer Robert Matzen called her early years her &quot;silver spoon period&quot;. Her parents&#x27; marriage was strained, and in October 1914, her mother took the children and moved to Los Angeles. Although the couple did not divorce, the separation was permanent. Her father&#x27;s continued financial support allowed the family to live comfortably, and they settled into an apartment near Venice Boulevard.

At Virgil Junior High School, Lombard participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies in athletics. At the age of 12, her passion for sports landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball, she caught the attention of film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing &quot;a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking the hell out of the other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture.&quot; With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard took a small role in the melodrama &quot;A Perfect Crime&quot; (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later said &quot;She ate it up.&quot;

===Career beginnings and Fox contract (1921–1926)===
Though &quot;A Perfect Crime&quot; was not widely distributed, the experience spurred Lombard and her mother to audition for more film work, but she was unsuccessful. While appearing as the queen of Fairfax High School&#x27;s May Day Carnival at the age of 15, Lombard was scouted by an employee of Charlie Chaplin and offered a screen test to appear in &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925). Lombard did not win the role, but her test was seen by the Vitagraph Film Company, which expressed interest in signing her. Although this did not materialize, their condition that she adopt a new first name led to her selecting the name &quot;Carole&quot; after a girl with whom she played tennis at Virgil Jr. High School.

In October 1924, 16-year-old Lombard signed a contract with the Fox Film Corporation. Lombard&#x27;s mother contacted gossip columnist Louella Parsons, who arranged a screen test. According to biographer Larry Swindell, Lombard&#x27;s beauty convinced studio head Winfield Sheehan to sign her to a $75-per-week contract, and she abandoned her schooling to pursue the new career. Fox disliked her surname and she was renamed Carole Lombard, the surname of a family friend.

Most of Lombard&#x27;s appearances with Fox were bit parts in low-budget Westerns and adventure films. She later said, &quot;All I had to do was simper prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain.&quot; However, she enjoyed other aspects of film work such as photo shoots, costume fittings, and socializing with actors on the studio set. Lombard embraced the flapper lifestyle and became a regular at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub, where she won several Charleston dance competitions.

In March 1925, Lombard landed a leading role in the drama &quot;Marriage in Transit&quot; with Edmund Lowe. A reviewer for &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; wrote that Lombard displayed &quot;good poise and considerable charm&quot;. However, the studio heads were unconvinced that Lombard was leading-lady material, and her contract was not renewed. Gehring has suggested a facial scar resulting from a car crash was a factor in this decision, but that incident occurred nearly two years later on September 9, 1927. According to historian Olympia Kiriakou, on the night of the crash, Lombard was on a date with a man named Harry Cooper. On Santa Monica Boulevard, Cooper hit another car; the windshield shattered and shards of glass cut &quot;Lombard&#x27;s face from her nose and across her left cheek to her eye.&quot; Lombard underwent reconstructive surgery and faced a long recovery period. For the remainder of her career, Lombard learned to hide the mark with makeup and careful lighting. At the time of the crash, Lombard was already under contract with Mack Sennett. In October 1927, Lombard and her mother Bess sued Cooper for $35,000 in damages, citing in the lawsuit that &quot;where she formerly was able to earn a salary of $300 monthly as a Sennett girl, she is now unable to obtain employment of any kind.&quot; The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Lombard received $3,000. Although Lombard feared that the incident would end her career, Sennett pledged to help her recover. He afforded her &quot;lucrative film roles and ample publicity&quot;, including the nickname &quot;Carole of the Curves&quot;. Kiriakou explains, &quot;the nickname simultaneously drew audiences&#x27; focus away from her facial scars and worked harmoniously with the physicality and female sensuality that were emblematic of Lombard&#x27;s performances&quot; in Sennett&#x27;s films.

===Breakthrough and early success (1927–1929)===

Although Lombard initially had reservations about slapstick comedies, she became one of Sennett Bathing Beauties and appeared in 18 short films (all as Lillian Smith in the Smith Family series) from September 1927 to March 1929, Lombard&#x27;s first experiences in comedy provided valuable training for her future comedic work. In 1940, she called her Sennett years &quot;the turning point of [my] acting career&quot;.

Sennett&#x27;s productions were distributed by Pathé Exchange, and the company began casting Lombard in feature films. She had prominent roles in &quot;Show Folks&quot; and &quot;Ned McCobb&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (both 1928), and reviewers observed that she made a &quot;good impression&quot; and was &quot;worth watching&quot;. The following year, Pathé elevated Lombard to a leading lady. Her success in Raoul Walsh&#x27;s picture &quot;Me, Gangster&quot; (also 1928), with June Collyer and Don Terry in his film debut, finally eased the pressure that her family had been exerting for her to succeed. In Howard Higgin&#x27;s &quot;High Voltage&quot; (1929), Lombard&#x27;s first sound film, she played a criminal in the custody of a deputy sheriff, both of whom are among bus passengers stranded in deep snow. Her next film, the comedy &quot;Big News&quot; (1929), cast her with Robert Armstrong and was a critical and commercial success. Lombard was reunited with Armstrong for the crime drama &quot;The Racketeer&quot;, released in late 1929. The review in &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;Carol Lombard proves a real surprise, and does her best work to date. In fact, this is the first opportunity she has had to prove that she has the stuff to go over.&quot;

===Paramount contract and first marriage (1930–1933)===
Lombard returned to Fox for a one-off role in the Western &quot;The Arizona Kid&quot; (1930). It was a big release for the studio, starring the popular actor Warner Baxter, in which Lombard received third billing. Following the success of the film, Paramount Pictures recruited Lombard and signed her to a $350-per-week contract, gradually increasing to $3,500 per week by 1936. They cast her in the Buddy Rogers comedy &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; (also 1930), and one critic observed of her work, &quot;Lombard proves [to be] an ace comedienne.&quot; For her second assignment, &quot;Fast and Loose&quot; (also 1930) with Miriam Hopkins, Paramount mistakenly credited the actress as &quot;Carole Lombard&quot;. She decided she liked this spelling and it became her permanent screen name.

Lombard appeared in five films released during 1931, beginning with the Frank Tuttle comedy &quot;It Pays to Advertise&quot;. Her next two films, &quot;Man of the World&quot; and &quot;Ladies Man&quot;, both featured William Powell, Paramount&#x27;s top male star. Lombard had been a fan of the actor before they met and they were soon in a relationship. The differences between the pair have been noted by biographers: She was 22, carefree, and famously foul-mouthed, and he was 38, intellectual, and sophisticated. Despite this, Lombard married Powell on June 26, 1931, at her Beverly Hills home. Talking to the media, she argued for the benefits of &quot;love between two people who are diametrically different&quot;, claiming that their relationship allowed for a &quot;perfect see-saw love&quot;.

The marriage to Powell increased Lombard&#x27;s fame, while she continued to please critics with her work in &quot;Up Pops the Devil&quot; and &quot;I Take this Woman&quot; (both 1931). In reviews for the latter film, which co-starred Gary Cooper, several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star. She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932. &quot;No One Man&quot; and &quot;Sinners in the Sun&quot; were not successful, but Edward Buzzell&#x27;s romantic picture &quot;Virtue&quot; was well received. After featuring in the drama &quot;No More Orchids&quot;, Lombard was cast as the wife of a con artist in &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot; with Clark Gable The film was a critical and commercial success, and Wes Gehring writes that it was &quot;arguably Lombard&#x27;s finest film appearance&quot; to that point. It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard made together. There was no romantic interest at this time, however, as she recounted to Garson Kanin: &quot;[we] did all kinds of hot love scenes ... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all&quot;.

In August 1933, Lombard and Powell divorced after 26 months of marriage, but they remained friends until the end of Lombard&#x27;s life. At the time, she blamed it on their careers, but in a 1936 interview, she admitted that this &quot;had little to do with the divorce. We were just two completely incompatible people&quot;.

She appeared in five films that year, beginning with the drama &quot;From Hell to Heaven&quot; and continuing with &quot;Supernatural&quot;, her only horror vehicle. After a small role in &quot;The Eagle and the Hawk&quot;, a war film starring Fredric March and Cary Grant, she starred in two melodramas: &quot;Brief Moment&quot;, which critics enjoyed, and &quot;White Woman&quot;, where she was paired with Charles Laughton.

Lombard was involved romantically with Russ Columbo, the famous crooner killed in a tragic accident in 1934. Lombard had been guiding Columbo&#x27;s movie and radio career and told Sonia Lee of &quot;Mirror&quot; magazine in 1934 that they had been engaged. Other press outlets had reported on their relationship earlier that year; &quot;Screenland Magazine&quot; declared, &quot;the Russ Columbo and Carole Lombard romance is one of Hollywood&#x27;s most charming.&quot;

===Success in screwball comedies (1934–1935)===
The year 1934 marked a high point in Lombard&#x27;s career, beginning with Wesley Ruggles&#x27;s musical drama &quot;Bolero&quot;, where George Raft and she showcased their dancing skills in an extravagantly staged performance to Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. Before filming began, she was offered the lead female role in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. &quot;Bolero&quot; was favorably received, while her next film, the musical comedy &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot; with Bing Crosby, was a box-office hit.

Lombard was then recruited by the director Howard Hawks, a second cousin, to star in his screwball &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; which proved a watershed in her career and made her a major star. Hawks had seen the actress inebriated at a party, where he found her to be &quot;hilarious and uninhibited and just what the part needed&quot;, and she was cast with John Barrymore. In &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, Lombard plays an actress who is pursued by her former mentor, a flamboyant Broadway impresario. Hawks and Barrymore were unimpressed with her work in rehearsals, finding that she was &quot;acting&quot; too hard and giving a stiff performance. The director encouraged Lombard to relax, be herself, and act on her instincts. She responded well to this tutoring, and reviews for the film commented on her unexpectedly &quot;fiery talent&quot;—&quot;a Lombard like no Lombard you&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; critic felt that she was &quot;entirely different&quot; from her formerly cool, &quot;calculated&quot; persona, adding, &quot;she vibrates with life and passion, abandon and diablerie&quot;.

The next films in which Lombard appeared were Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;Now and Forever&quot; (1934), featuring Gary Cooper and the new child star Shirley Temple, and &quot;Lady by Choice&quot; (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. &quot;The Gay Bride&quot; (1934) placed her with Chester Morris in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics. After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, &quot;Rumba&quot; (1935), Lombard was given the opportunity to repeat the screwball success of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. In Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s &quot;Hands Across the Table&quot; (1935), she portrays a manicurist in search of a rich husband, played by Fred MacMurray. Critics praised the film, and &quot;Photoplay&quot;&#x27;s reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre. It is remembered as one of her best films, and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three more pictures together.

===Critical recognition (1936–1937)===

Lombard&#x27;s first film of 1936 was &quot;Love Before Breakfast&quot;, described by Gehring as &quot;&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, screwball style&quot;. In William K. Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Comes Across&quot;, her second comedy with MacMurray, she played a budding actress who wins a film contract by masquerading as a Swedish princess. The performance was considered a satire of Greta Garbo and was widely praised by critics. Lombard&#x27;s success continued as she was recruited by Universal Studios to star in the screwball comedy &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936). William Powell, who was playing the eponymous Godfrey, insisted on her being cast as the female lead; despite their divorce, the pair remained friendly and Powell felt she would be perfect in the role of Irene, a zany heiress who employs a &quot;forgotten man&quot; as the family butler. The film was directed by Gregory LaCava, who knew Lombard personally and advised that she draw on her &quot;eccentric nature&quot; for the role. She worked hard on the performance, particularly with finding the appropriate facial expressions for Irene. &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was released to great acclaim and was a box-office hit. It received six nominations at the 9th Academy Awards, including Lombard for Best Actress. Biographers cite it as her finest performance, and Frederick Ott says it &quot;clearly established [her] as a comedienne of the first rank.&quot;

By 1937, Lombard was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular actresses, and also the highest-paid star in Hollywood following the deal which Myron Selznick negotiated with Paramount that brought her $450,000, more than five times the salary of the U.S. president. As her salary was widely reported in the press, Lombard stated that 80% of her earnings went in taxes, but that she was happy to help improve her country. The comments earned her much positive publicity, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent her a personal letter of thanks.

Her first release of the year was Leisen&#x27;s &quot;Swing High, Swing Low&quot;, a third pairing with MacMurray. The film focused on a romance between two cabaret performers, and was a critical and commercial success. It had been primarily a drama, with occasional moments of comedy, but for her next project, &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, Lombard returned to the screwball genre. Producer David O. Selznick, impressed by her work in &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, was eager to make a comedy with the actress and hired Ben Hecht to write an original screenplay for her. &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, directed by William Wellman and co-starring Fredric March, satirized the journalism industry and &quot;the gullible urban masses&quot;. Lombard portrayed a small-town girl who pretends to be dying and finds her story exploited by a New York reporter. The film was Lombard&#x27;s only Technicolor feature-length production, and she later praised it highly as one of her personal favorites.

Lombard continued with screwball comedies, next starring in &quot;True Confession&quot; (1937), what Swindell calls one of her &quot;wackiest&quot; films, . She played a compulsive liar who wrongly confesses to murder. Lombard loved the script and was excited about the project, which reunited her with John Barrymore and was her final appearance with MacMurray. Her prediction that it &quot;smacked of a surefire success&quot; proved accurate as critics responded positively, and it was popular at the box office.

===Dramatic efforts and second marriage (1938–1940)===

&quot;True Confession&quot; was the last film Lombard made on her Paramount contract, and she remained an independent performer for the rest of her career. Her next film was made at Warner Bros., where she played a famous actress in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Fools for Scandal&quot; (1938). The comedy met with scathing reviews and was a commercial failure, with Swindell calling it &quot;one of the most horrendous flops of the thirties&quot;.

&quot;Fools for Scandal&quot; was the only film Lombard made in 1938. By this time, she was devoted to her relationship with Clark Gable. The pair had reunited at a Hollywood party and began a romance early in 1936. The media took great interest in their partnership and frequently questioned if they would wed. Gable was separated from his wife, Maria, but she did not want to grant him a divorce. As his relationship with Lombard became serious, Maria eventually agreed to a settlement. The divorce was finalized in March 1939, and Gable and Lombard eloped in Kingman, Arizona on March 29. The couple bought a ranch in Encino, California, where they kept barnyard animals and enjoyed hunting trips. Almost immediately, Lombard wanted to start a family, but her attempts failed; after two miscarriages and numerous trips to fertility specialists, she was unable to have children. In early 1938, Lombard officially joined the Baháʼí Faith, which her mother had been a member of since 1922.

While continuing with a slower work-rate, Lombard decided to move away from comedies and return to dramatic roles. She appeared in &quot;Made for Each Other&quot; (1939) with James Stewart playing a couple facing domestic difficulties. Reviews for the film were highly positive, and praised Lombard&#x27;s dramatic effort; financially, it was a disappointment. Lombard&#x27;s next appearance came with Cary Grant in the John Cromwell romance &quot;In Name Only&quot; (1939), a credit she personally negotiated with RKO Radio Pictures upon hearing of the script and Grant&#x27;s involvement. The role reflected her recent experiences, as she played a woman in love with a married man whose wife refuses to divorce. She was paid $150,000 for the film, continuing her status as one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actresses, and it was a moderate success. At the 12th Academy Awards ceremony in February 1940, Lombard was quoted as comforting Gable after his loss as Rhett Butler from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, with the comment &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Pappy. We&#x27;ll bring one home next year&quot;. Gable replied that he felt this had been his last chance to which Lombard was said to have replied, &quot;Not you, you self-centered bastard. I meant me.&quot;

Lombard was eager to win an Academy Award, and selected her next project with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. &quot;Vigil in the Night&quot; (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed the drama &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful, and which did receive an Oscar nomination -- for her co-star, William Gargan, for Best Supporting Actor.

===Final roles (1941–1942)===

Accepting that &quot;my name doesn&#x27;t sell tickets to serious pictures&quot;, Lombard returned to comedy in &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (1941), about a couple who learns that their marriage is invalid, with Robert Montgomery. Lombard was influential in bringing Alfred Hitchcock, whom she knew through David O. Selznick, to direct one of his most atypical films. It was a commercial success, and audiences were happy with what Swindell calls &quot;the belated happy news ... that Carole Lombard was a screwball once more.&quot;

It was nearly a year before Lombard committed to another film, as she focused instead on her home and marriage. Determined that her next film be &quot;an unqualified smash hit&quot;, she was also careful in selecting a new project. Through her agent, Lombard heard of Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s upcoming film: &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942), a dark comedy that satirized the Nazi takeover of Poland. The actress had long wanted to work with Lubitsch, and felt that the material—although controversial—was a worthy subject. Lombard accepted the role of actress Maria Tura, despite it being a smaller part than she was used to, and was given top billing over the film&#x27;s male lead Jack Benny. Filming took place in the fall of 1941, and it was reportedly one of the happier experiences of Lombard&#x27;s career.

==Death==

When the U.S. entered World War II, Lombard traveled to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother and Clark Gable&#x27;s press agent, Otto Winkler. Lombard raised more than $2 million in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was eager to reach home more quickly and wanted to travel by air. Her mother and Winkler were afraid of flying and insisted that the group follow their original travel plans.
In the early morning hours of January 16, 1942, Lombard, her mother and Winkler boarded a Transcontinental and Western Air Douglas DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) aircraft to return to California. After refueling in Las Vegas, TWA Flight 3 took off at 7:07 p.m. and crashed into Double Up Peak near the level of Potosi Mountain, southwest of the Las Vegas airport. All 22 aboard, including Lombard, her mother, Winkler and 15 U.S. Army soldiers, were killed. Lombard was 33 years old. The crash&#x27;s cause was attributed to the flight crew&#x27;s inability to properly navigate over the mountains surrounding Las Vegas. As a precaution against the possibility of enemy Japanese bomber aircraft coming into American airspace from the Pacific, safety beacons normally used to direct night flights had been turned off, leaving the pilot and crew of the TWA flight without visual warnings of the mountains in their flight path.

===Aftermath===
When &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; aired on January 18, Jack Benny did not attend the live radio broadcast. At its opening, announcer Don Wilson stated Benny would not appear that night, but did not explain why. The show that night did not feature any comedy, just musical numbers. Lombard had been scheduled to appear on the following Sunday&#x27;s broadcast.

Lombard&#x27;s funeral was January 21 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. She was interred beside her mother under the name of Carole Lombard Gable. Despite remarrying twice following her death, Gable was interred beside Lombard when he died in 1960.

&quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;, Lombard&#x27;s final film, was in post-production at the time of her death. Allegedly, the film&#x27;s producers decided to cut a line in which Lombard&#x27;s character asks &quot;What can happen on a plane?&quot; out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death. Although, there is no indication that this line existed and was removed posthumously, the film&#x27;s script as filed with the Production Code Administration included the addendum:.
At the time of her death, Lombard had been scheduled to star in the film &quot;They All Kissed the Bride&quot;; when production started, she was replaced by Joan Crawford. Crawford donated all of her salary for the film to the Red Cross, which had helped extensively in the recovery of bodies from the air crash.

Shortly after Lombard&#x27;s death, Gable, who was inconsolable and devastated by his loss, joined the United States Army Air Forces. Lombard had asked him to do that numerous times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit attached to a B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named in her honor would be launched. Gable attended the launch of the SS &quot;Carole Lombard&quot; on January 15, 1944, the second anniversary of Lombard&#x27;s war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.

In 1962, Jill Winkler Rath, widow of publicist Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 lawsuit against the $2 million estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler&#x27;s death. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so because he did not want to repeat his grief in court, and subsequently he provided her no financial aid in his will.

==Legacy==
Author Robert D. Matzen has cited Lombard as &quot;among the most commercially successful and admired film personalities in Hollywood in the 1930s&quot;, and feminist writer June Sochen believes that Lombard &quot;demonstrated great knowledge of the mechanics of film making&quot;. George Raft, her co-star in &quot;Bolero&quot;, was extremely fond of the actress, remarking &quot;I truly loved Carole Lombard. She was the greatest girl that ever lived and we were the best of pals. Completely honest and outspoken, she was liked by everyone&quot;.

Historian Olympia Kiriakou identifies Lombard as a progressive, feminist studio-era star. She describes Lombard&#x27;s politics as &quot;proto-feminist&quot;, explaining that &quot;many of her political and social statements pre-date the second-wave feminist movement, yet were very much in line with the second wave&#x27;s focus,&quot; particularly her views about women&#x27;s roles in the home and workplace. Lombard&#x27;s independent star persona balanced her femininity and screen glamour with &quot;male business sense&quot;. She was described by &quot;Photoplay&quot; columnist Hart Seymore as the &quot;perfect example of a modern Career Girl&quot;, which was based on Lombard&#x27;s capability to &quot;live by the logical premise that women have equal rights with men.&quot; In 1937, &quot;Photoplay&quot; published an article about Lombard&#x27;s business acumen entitled &quot;Carole Lombard tells: &#x27;How I Live by a Man&#x27;s Code&#x27;,&quot; in which she offers readers rules for how to be successful in business and at home such as &quot;play fair [with men]...don&#x27;t burn over criticism—stand up to it like a man.&quot; Notably, in the article Lombard tells readers that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in a man&#x27;s world,&quot; and encourages women to &quot;work—and like it,&quot; adding: &quot;All women should have something worthwhile to do, and cultivate efficiency at it, whether it be housekeeping or raising chickens. Working women are interesting women.&quot; But as Kiriakou explains, such an article was published in order &quot;to elicit a specific response from the fan magazine readers—namely, to view Lombard&#x27;s independent star as indistinguishable from the Lombard heroines they saw on screen.&quot;

Moreover, according to scholar Emily Carman, Lombard&#x27;s independent female star persona was able to emerge only when she &quot;attained greater professional autonomy in the mid-1930s,&quot; ultimately leading her to become one of the first stars of the studio-era to go freelance. Freelancing gave Lombard more autonomy over her career decisions, and the types of roles she was able to play. Additionally, Lombard was the first Hollywood star to propose profit participation: in 1938, she negotiated with Selznick International Pictures to take a reduced salary of $100,000 in exchange for a 20 percent cut of the distributor&#x27;s gross of $1.6 to $1.7 million, and subsequent smaller percentages as the gross increased. Carman explains that this contract also included a &quot;no-loan out&quot; clause, the right to employ Travis Banton as her costume designer of choice, as well as all legal rights to her image. Carman concludes that Lombard&#x27;s strategic business sense and easy-going nature were central to her independent star persona, and the control she maintained over her career was a challenge to the &quot;paternalistic structure&quot; of the studio system.

Lombard was particularly noted for the zaniness of her performances, described as a &quot;natural prankster, a salty tongued straight-shooter, a feminist precursor and one of the few stars who was beloved by the technicians and studio functionaries who worked with her&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; magazine noted that her film personality transcended to real life, &quot;her conversation, often brilliant, is punctuated by screeches, laughs, growls, gesticulations and the expletives of a sailor&#x27;s parrot&quot;. Graham Greene praised the &quot;heartbreaking and nostalgic melodies&quot; of her faster-than-thought delivery, whereas &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote &quot;Platinum blonde, with a heart-shaped face, delicate, impish features and a figure made to be swathed in silver lamé, Lombard wriggled expressively through such classics of hysteria as &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;.&quot;

In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Lombard 23rd on its list of the 25 greatest American female screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6930 Hollywood Blvd. Lombard received one Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;. Actresses who have portrayed her in films include Jill Clayburgh in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976), Sharon Gless in &quot;&quot; (1980), Denise Crosby in &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), Anastasia Hille in &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999) and Vanessa Gray in &quot;Lucy&quot; (2003). Lombard&#x27;s Fort Wayne childhood home has been designated a historic landmark. The city named the nearby bridge over the St. Mary&#x27;s River the Carole Lombard Memorial Bridge.

Lombard&#x27;s star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame is shown in the movie &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

<doc id="44356" wikidata="Q8479" url="?curid=44356" title="Peter the Great">
<text>Peter I (, ; 
– ), known as Peter the Great, was the Tsar of all Russia from 1682 and the first Emperor of all Russia from 1721 until his death in 1725. He reigned jointly with his half-brother Ivan V until 1696. From this year, Peter was an absolute monarch, an autocrat who remained the ultimate authority and organized a well-ordered police state.

Much of Peter&#x27;s reign was consumed by lengthy wars against the Ottoman and Swedish empires. His Azov campaigns were followed by the foundation of the Russian Navy; after his victory in the Great Northern War despite initial difficulties, Russia annexed a significant portion of the eastern Baltic coastline and was officially renamed from a tsardom to an empire. Peter led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, Westernized, and based on radical Enlightenment.

In December 1699, he introduced the Julian calendar, which replaced the Byzantine calendar that was long used in Russia, but the Russian Orthodox Church was particularly resistant to this change. In 1703, he introduced the first Russian newspaper, &quot;Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti&quot;, and ordered the civil script, a reform of Russian orthography largely designed by himself. On the shores of the Neva River, he founded Saint Petersburg, a city famously dubbed by Francesco Algarotti as the &quot;window to the West&quot;. In 1712, Peter relocated the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg, a status it retained until 1918.

Peter had a great interest in plants, animals and minerals, in malformed creatures or exceptions to the law of nature for his cabinet of curiosities. He encouraged research of deformities, all along trying to debunk the superstitious fear of monsters. He promoted industrialization in the Russian Empire and higher education. The Russian Academy of Sciences and the Saint Petersburg State University were founded in 1724, and invited Christian Wolff and Willem &#x27;s Gravesande.

Peter is primarily credited with the modernization of the country, quickly transforming it into a major European power. His administrative reforms, creating a Governing Senate in 1711, the Collegium in 1717 and the Table of Ranks in 1722 had a lasting impact on Russia, and many institutions of the Russian government trace their origins to his reign.

==Early life==
Peter grew up at Izmaylovo Estate and was educated at the Amusement Palace from an early age by several tutors commissioned by his father, most notably Nikita Zotov, Patrick Gordon, and Paul Menesius. When his father died in 1676, he left the sovereignty to Peter&#x27;s elder half-brother, the crippled Feodor III. Throughout this period, the government was largely run by Artamon Matveyev, an enlightened friend of Alexis, the political head of the Naryshkin family and one of Peter&#x27;s greatest childhood benefactors.

This position changed when Feodor died in 1682. As Feodor did not leave any children, a dispute arose between the Miloslavsky family (Maria Miloslavskaya was the first wife of Alexis I) and Naryshkin family (Natalya Naryshkina was his second wife) over who should inherit the throne. He jointly ruled with his elder half-brother, Ivan V, until 1696. Ivan was next in line but was weakminded and blind. Consequently, the Boyar Duma (a council of Russian nobles) chose the 10-year-old Peter to become tsar, with his mother as regent. A hole was cut in the back of the throne, so that she, literally behind the scenes, could whisper to the two boys.

The &quot;Moscow Grand Discharge&quot; started in 1677 and was completed in 1688; it affected noble families with high ranks in the administration; the ministries were also reduced in number. This provoked fierce reactions. Sophia, one of Alexis&#x27; daughters from his first marriage, led a rebellion of the &quot;streltsy&quot; (Russia&#x27;s elite military corps) in April–May 1682. In the subsequent conflict, some of Peter&#x27;s relatives and friends were murdered, including Artamon Matveyev, and Peter witnessed some of these acts of political violence.

The &quot;streltsy&quot; made it possible for Sophia, the Miloslavskys (the clan of Ivan) and their allies to insist that Peter and Ivan be proclaimed joint tsars, with Ivan being acclaimed as the senior. Sophia then acted as regent during the minority of the sovereigns and exercised all power. For seven years, she ruled as an autocrat.

From 1682 to 1689, Peter and his mother were banned to Preobrazhenskoye. At the age of 16, he discovered an English boat on the estate, had it restored and learned to sail. He received a sextant, but did not know how to use it. Peter was fascinated by sundials. Therefore, he began a search for a foreign expert in the German Quarter. Peter befriended Andrew Vinius, a bibliophile, who taught him Dutch and two Dutch carpenters, Frans Timmerman and Karsten Brandt. Peter studied arithmetic, geometry, and military sciences (fortification). He was not interested in a musical education but liked fireworks and drumming.

Peter was not particularly concerned that others ruled in his name; Boris Golitsyn and Fyodor Apraksin played an important role. He engaged in such pastimes as shipbuilding in Pereslavl-Zalessky and sailing at Lake Pleshcheyevo, as well as mock battles with his toy army. Peter&#x27;s mother sought to force him to adopt a more conventional approach and arranged his marriage to Eudoxia Lopukhina in 1689. The marriage was a failure, and 10 years later, Peter forced his wife to become a nun and thus freed himself from the union.

By the summer of 1689, Peter, planned to take power from his half-sister Sophia, whose position had been weakened by two unsuccessful Crimean campaigns against the Crimean Khanate in an attempt to stop devastating Crimean Tatar raids into Russia&#x27;s southern lands. When she learned of his designs, Sophia conspired with some leaders of the Streltsy, who continually aroused disorder and dissent. Peter, warned by others from the Streltsy, escaped in the middle of the night to the impenetrable monastery of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra; there he slowly gathered adherents who perceived he would win the power struggle. Sophia was eventually overthrown, with Peter I and Ivan V continuing to act as co-tsars. Peter forced Sophia to enter a convent, where she gave up her name and her position as a member of the royal family.

Meanwhile, he was a frequent guest in the German quarter, where he met Anna and Willem Mons. In 1692 he sent Eberhard Isbrand Ides as envoy to the Kangxi Emperor of China. In 1693 he sailed to Solovetsky Monastery and accepted divine providence after surviving a storm.
Still, Peter could not acquire actual control over Russian affairs. Power was instead exercised by his mother. It was only when Natalya died in 1694 that Peter, then aged 22, became an independent sovereign. Formally, Ivan V was a co-ruler with Peter, though being ineffective. Peter became the sole ruler when Ivan died in 1696 without male offspring.

Peter grew to be extremely tall, especially for the time period, reportedly standing . He was seen as a &quot;second Goliath&quot; or Samson. Saint-Simon described him in 1717 as &quot;tall, well-formed and slim... with a look both bewildered and fierce&quot;. Peter had noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from neck spasm.

==Ideology of Peter&#x27;s reign==
As a young man, Peter I adopted the Protestant model of existence in a pragmatic world of competition and personal success, which largely shaped the philosophy of his reformism. He perceived the Russian people as rude, unintelligent, stubborn in their sluggishness, a child, a lazy student. He highly appreciated the state&#x27;s role in the life of society, saw it as an ideal instrument for achieving high goals, saw it as a universal institution for transforming people, with the help of violence and fear, into educated, conscious, law-abiding and useful to the whole society subjects. Peter had a keen interest in The Education of a Christian Prince which offers advice to rulers on how to govern justly and wisely.

He introduced into the concept of the autocrat&#x27;s power the notion of the monarch&#x27;s duties. He considered it necessary to take care of his subjects, to protect them from enemies, to work for their benefit. Above all, he put the interests of Russia. He saw his mission in turning it into a power similar to Western countries, and subordinated his own life and the lives of his subjects to the realization of this idea. Gradually penetrated the idea that the task should be solved with the help of reforms, which will be carried out at the autocrat&#x27;s will, who creates good and punishes evil. He considered the morality of a statesman separately from the morality of a private person and believed that the sovereign in the name of state interests can go to murder, violence, forgery and deceit.

He went through the naval service, starting from the lowest ranks: bombardier (1695), captain (1696), colonel (1706), schout-bij-nacht (1709), vice-admiral (1714), admiral (1721). By hard daily work (according to the figurative expression of Peter the Great himself, he was simultaneously &quot;forced to hold a sword and a quill in one right hand&quot;) and courageous behavior he demonstrated to his subjects his personal positive example, showed how to act, fully devoting himself to the fulfillment of duty and service to the fatherland.

==Reign==

Peter reigned for around 43 years. He implemented sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing Russia. Heavily influenced by his advisors, like Jacob Bruce, Peter reorganized the Russian army along modern lines and dreamed of making Russia a maritime power. He faced much opposition to these policies at home but brutally suppressed rebellions against his authority, including by the Streltsy, Bashkirs, Astrakhan, and the greatest civil uprising of his reign, the Bulavin Rebellion.

In his process to westernize Russia, he wanted members of his family to marry other European royalty. In the past, his ancestors had been snubbed at the idea; however, it was proving fruitful. He negotiated with Frederick William, Duke of Courland to marry his niece, Anna Ivanovna. He used the wedding in order to launch his new capital, St Petersburg, where he had already ordered building projects of westernized palaces and buildings. Peter hired Italian and German architects to design it. He attracted Domenico Trezzini, Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli, Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond and Andreas Schlüter.

To improve his nation&#x27;s position on the seas, Peter sought more maritime outlets. His only outlet at the time was the White Sea at Arkhangelsk. The Baltic Sea was at the time controlled by Sweden in the north, while the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea were controlled by the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire respectively in the south. The country&#x27;s need for metal was exacerbated by the outbreak of wars for access to the Black and Baltic Seas.

Peter attempted to acquire control of the Black Sea, which would require expelling the Tatars from the surrounding areas. As part of an agreement with Poland that ceded Kiev to Russia, Peter was forced to wage war against the Crimean Khan and against the Khan&#x27;s overlord, the Ottoman Sultan. Peter&#x27;s primary objective became the capture of the Ottoman fortress of Azov, near the Don River. In the summer of 1695 Peter organized the Azov campaigns to take the fortress, but his attempts ended in failure.

Peter returned to Moscow in November 1695 and began building a large navy in Voronezh. He launched about thirty ships against the Ottomans in 1696, capturing Azov in July of that year. He appointed Alexander Gordon, who later would publish a biography on Peter. Peter used to hold all his important meetings and numerous celebrations in Le Fort&#x27;s palace.

===Grand Embassy===

Peter knew that Russia could not face the Ottoman Empire alone. In March 1697, he traveled &quot;incognito&quot; to Western Europe on an 18-month journey with a large Russian delegation—the so-called &quot;Grand Embassy&quot;. Peter was the first tsar to leave Russia for more than 100 years. He used a fake name, allowing him to escape social and diplomatic events, but since he was far taller than most others, he could not fool anyone. One goal was to seek the aid of European monarchs, but Peter&#x27;s hopes were dashed. France was a traditional ally of the Ottoman Sultan, and Austria was eager to maintain peace in the east while conducting its own wars in the west. Peter, furthermore, had chosen an inopportune moment: the Europeans at the time were more concerned about the War of the Spanish Succession over who would succeed the childless King Charles II of Spain than about fighting the Ottoman Sultan. Peter failed to expand the anti-Ottoman alliance.

In Riga, the local Swedish commander Erik Dahlbergh decided to pretend that he did not recognize Peter and did not allow him to inspect the fortifications. (Three years later, Peter would cite the inhospitable reception as one of the reasons for starting the Great Northern War). He met Frederick Casimir Kettler, the Duke of Courland. In Königsberg, the tsar was apprenticed for two months to an artillery engineer. (Decrees were issued on the construction of the first Ural blast furnace plants.) In July he met Sophia of Hanover at Coppenbrügge castle. She described him: &quot;The tsar is a tall, handsome man, with an attractive face. He has a lively mind is very witty. Only, someone so well endowed by nature could be a little better mannered.&quot; Peter rented a ship in Emmerich am Rhein and sailed to Zaandam, where he arrived on 18 August 1697.

====Amsterdam====
Peter studied saw-mills, manufacturing and shipbuilding in Zaandam but left after a week. He sailed to Amsterdam after he was recognized and attacked. The log-cabin he rented became the Czar Peter House. He sailed to Texel to see a fleet. Through the mediation of Nicolaas Witsen, an expert on Russia, the tsar was given the opportunity to gain practical experience in shipyard, belonging to the Dutch East India Company, for a period of four months, under the supervision of Gerrit Claesz Pool. The diligent and capable tsar assisted in the construction of an East Indiaman &quot;Peter and Paul&quot; specially laid down for him. Peter felt that the ship&#x27;s carpenters in Holland worked too much by eye and lacked accurate construction drawings. During his stay the tsar engaged many skilled workers such as builders of locks, fortresses, shipwrights, and seamen—including Cornelis Cruys, a vice-admiral who became, under Franz Lefort, the tsar&#x27;s advisor in maritime affairs; engineer Menno van Coehoorn refused. Peter put his knowledge of shipbuilding to use in helping build Russia&#x27;s navy.

Peter and Witsen visited Frederik Ruysch who had all the specimens exposed in five rooms. He taught Peter how to catch butterflies and how to preserve them. They also had a common interest in lizards. Together they went to see patients. He arrived in Utrecht on a barge and met stadtholder William III in a tavern. When he visited the States-General of the Netherlands he left the hall and the astonished attendees with his wig pulled over his head, according Massie. He visited Jan van der Heyden, the inventor of a fire hose. He collected paintings by Adam Silo with ships and seascapes. In October 1697, the Tsar visited Delft and received an &quot;eal viewer&quot; from the microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek. After the Peace of Ryswick he was invited by King of England to visit him. The Dutch regents considered the Tsar too inquisitive, and this affected their willingness to help the Russians.

====Deptford====

On 11 January 1698 (O.S.), Peter arrived at Victoria Embankment with four chamberlains, three interpreters (Peter Shafirov, LeFort), two clock makers, a cook, a priest, six trumpeters, 70 soldiers from the Preobrazhensky regiment, four dwarfs and a monkey which he purchased in Amsterdam; Jacob Bruce accompanied him. Peter stayed at 21 Norfolk Street, Strand, and met with Bishop of Salisbury Gilbert Burnet and Thomas Osborne and posed for Sir Godfrey Kneller. He watched the proceedings within the Parliament from a rooftop window. At some time, he had an affair with actress Letitia Cross. He visited the Royal Mint four times; it is not clear whether he ever met Isaac Newton, the mint&#x27;s warden, who introduced milling on the coinage. Peter was impressed by the Great Recoinage of 1696, according to Massie.

At some time he visited Spithead, Plymouth, with captain John Perry to watch a mock battle. In February he attended a Fleet Review in Deptford, and inspected the Woolwich Dockyard and Royal Arsenal with Anthony Deane. For three months he stayed at Sayes Court as the guest of John Evelyn, a member of the Royal Society. He was trained on a telescope at the Greenwich Observatory by John Flamsteed. Peter communicated with Thomas Story and William Penn about their position that believers should not join the military. King William III presented a schooner with a whole crew to Peter I in exchange for the monopoly right of English merchants to trade tobacco in Russia (see Charles Whitworth). At the end of April 1698 he left after being shown how to make watches, and carpeting coffins. Back in Holland he visited Harderwijk and Cleves.

The Embassy next went to Leipzig, Dresden, where he met with the Queen of Poland. Three times he visited the Kunstsammlung, then Königstein Fortress, Prague, Vienna, to pay a visit to Leopold I. At Rava-Ruska, he crossed the border and Peter spoke with Augustus II the Strong. Peter&#x27;s visit was cut short, when he was informed of the second Streltsy uprising in June. The rebellion was easily crushed by General Gordon before Peter returned home early September. Peter nevertheless acted ruthlessly towards the mutineers; 4,600 rebels were sent to prison. Around 1,182 were tortured and executed, and Peter ordered that their bodies be publicly exhibited as a warning to future conspirators. The Streltsy were disbanded, and Peter&#x27;s half-sister Sophia, who they sought to put on the throne, was kept in strictest seclusion at Novodevichy Convent.

Peter&#x27;s visits to the West impressed upon him the notion that European customs were in several respects superior to Russian traditions. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to wear European clothing (no caftans) and cut off their long beards, causing Boyars and Old Believers, who were very fond of their beards, great upset. Boyars who sought to retain their beards were required to pay an annual beard tax of one hundred rubles. In the same year, Peter also sought to end arranged marriages, which were the norm among the Russian nobility, because he thought such a practice was barbaric and led to domestic violence, since the partners usually resented each other.

===Reforms===
In 1698, Peter sent a delegation to Malta, under boyar Boris Sheremetev, to observe the training and abilities of the Knights of Malta and their fleet. Sheremetev investigated the possibility of future joint ventures with the Knights, including action against the Turks and the possibility of a future Russian naval base. On 12 September 1698, Peter officially founded the first Russian Navy base, Taganrog on the Sea of Azov.

In 1699, Peter changed the date of the celebration of the new year from 1 September to 1 January. Traditionally, the years were reckoned from the purported creation of the World, but after Peter&#x27;s reforms, they were to be counted from the birth of Christ. Thus, in the year 7207 of the old Russian calendar, Peter proclaimed that the Julian Calendar was in effect and the year was 1700. On the death of Lefort in 1699, Menshikov succeeded him as Peter&#x27;s prime favourite and confidant.

In 1700, Peter I prevented the election of a new patriarch and deprived the Russian Church of the opportunity to regain a single spiritual leader. Reducing the number of monasteries, he converted all monasteries with less than 30 monks into schools or churches. He encouraged the development of private entrepreneurship, but under strict state control. He initiated the construction of canals by John Perry and implemented a monetary reform, using the decimal principle as the basis of the monetary system (1698-–1704).

Peter attracted many foreign specialists and opened an educational institution for surgery, led by Nicolaas Bidloo. In 1701, the Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation was founded, led by Jacob Bruce; for fifteen years, naval officers, surveyors, engineers, and gunners were educated there.

In 1700, Jan Thesingh (-1701) received a monopoly on printing and importing books, maps and prints into Russia for fifteen years. In 1701 he appointed Fedor Polikarpov-Orlov as head of the Moscow Print Yard. In 1707, Tsar Peter I bought a fully equipped printing house in Holland, including staff. Peter replaced the Cyrillic numerals with Arabic numerals (1705–1710) and the Cyrillic font with a civil script (1708–1710).

In 1708, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz became an advisor and offered to write new laws for the country. In December Russia was divided into eight governorates (&quot;guberniya&quot;). Matwei Petrowitsch Gagarin was the first governor of Siberia. Peter was visited by Cornelis de Bruijn, who spent six years in Russia and made drawings of the Kremlin. In 1711, Peter visited elector August II of Poland in Dresden, Carlsbad and Torgau where his son Aleksei married. In 1713 he visited Hamburg, sieged Tönningen with his allies. He then traveled to Hanover and was a guest of Duke Anton Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in Salzdahlum. From Danzig he sailed to Riga, Helsingfors and Turku.

In 1711, Peter established by decree a new state body known as the Governing Senate. Normally, the Boyar duma would have exercised power during his absence. Peter, however, mistrusted the boyars; he instead abolished the Duma and created a Senate of ten members. The Senate was founded as the highest state institution to supervise all judicial, financial and administrative affairs. Originally established only for the time of the monarch&#x27;s absence, the Senate became a permanent body after his return. A special high official, the Ober-Procurator, served as the link between the ruler and the senate and acted, in Peter own words, as &quot;the sovereign&#x27;s eye&quot;. Without his signature no Senate decision could go into effect; the Senate became one of the most important institutions of Imperial Russia.

In 1701, 1705 and 1712, Peter I issued decrees establishing an Engineering School in Sukharev Tower, which was supposed to recruit up to 100 students, but had only 23. Therefore, he issued another decree in 1714 calling for compulsory education, which dictated that all Russian 10- to 15-year-old children of the nobility, government clerks, and lesser-ranked officials must learn basic arithmetic, trigonometry and geometry, and should be tested on the subjects at the end of their studies.

Areskine, an iatrochemist, became head of the court apothecary; Johann Daniel Schumacher was appointed secretary and librarian of the Kunstkamera. The country&#x27;s first scientific library was opened in his palace in the Summer Garden. Peter ordered the development of Aptekarsky Island, headquarters for the Medical Clerical Office and the Main Pharmacy. Gottlieb Schober was commissioned to examine hot springs and discovered rich deposits of sulfur; Peter immediately set up a factory for the development in the Samara Oblast. In 1721 the shipyard Petrozavod and Petrodvorets Watch Factory was established. Some 3,500 new words—German, French, Dutch, English, Italian, Swedish in origin—entered Russian in Peter&#x27;s period, roughly one-fourth of them shipping and naval terms.

As part of his reforms, Peter started an industrialization effort that was slow but eventually successful. Russian manufacturing and main exports were based on the mining and lumber industries. In 1719, the privileges of miners were enshrined in law with the Berg Privilege, which allowed representatives of all classes to search for ores and build metallurgical plants. At the same time, manufacturers and artisans were exempted from state taxes and recruiting, and their houses were exempt from the post of troops. The law also guaranteed the inheritance of the ownership of factories, proclaimed industrial activity a matter of state importance and protected manufacturers from interference in their affairs by local authorities. The same law established the Collegium of Mining, and managed the entire mining and metallurgical industry, and local administrations. The Demidovs became the first Russian exporters of iron to Western Europe. In 1721, a decree was issued that allowed factory owners, regardless of whether they had a noble rank, to buy serfs.

===Great Northern War===



Peter made a temporary peace with the Ottoman Empire that allowed him to keep the captured fort of Azov, and turned his attention to Russian maritime supremacy. He sought to acquire control of the Baltic Sea, which had been taken by the Swedish Empire a half-century earlier. Peter declared war on Sweden, which was at the time led by the young King Charles XII. Sweden was also opposed by Denmark–Norway, Saxony, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Preobrazhensky regiment took part in all major battles of the Great Northern War.

Russia was ill-prepared to fight the Swedes, and their first attempt at seizing the Baltic coast ended in disaster at the Battle of Narva in 1700. In the conflict, the forces of Charles XII, rather than employ a slow methodical siege, attacked immediately using a blinding snowstorm to their advantage. After the battle, Charles XII decided to concentrate his forces against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave Peter time to reorganize the Russian army and conquered Nyenschantz in the Ingrian campaign. Bidloo had to organize a military hospital. Robert Bruce was appointed commander-in-chief of St. Petersburg. After the defeat at Narva, Peter I gave the order to melt the church bells into cannons and mortars. In 1701, Peter ordered the construction of Novodvinsk Fortress north of Archangelsk. Everybody was convinced they knew: his Majesty will wage war. In the siege of Nöteborg Russian forces captured the Swedish fortress, renamed Shlisselburg. In 1702 Peter the Great established the Olonets Shipyard at Lodeynoye Pole, where Russian frigate Shtandart was built.

While the Poles fought the Swedes, Peter founded the city of Saint Petersburg on 29 June 1703 on Hare Island. He forbade the building of stone edifices outside Saint Petersburg, which he intended to become Russia&#x27;s capital, so that all stonemasons could participate in the construction of the new city. While the city was being built along the Neva he lived in a modest three-room log cabin (with a study but without a fire-place) which had to make room for the first version of the Winter Palace. The first buildings which appeared were a shipyard at the Admiralty, Kronstadt (1704-1706) and the Peter and Paul Fortress (1706). Peter took his whole family on a boat trip to Kronstadt.

Following several defeats, Polish King Augustus II the Strong abdicated in 1706. Swedish king Charles XII turned his attention to Russia, invading it in 1708. After crossing into Russia, Charles defeated Peter at Golovchin in July. In the Battle of Lesnaya, Charles suffered his first loss after Peter crushed a group of Swedish reinforcements marching from Riga. Deprived of this aid, Charles was forced to abandon his proposed march on Moscow.

Charles XII refused to retreat to Poland or back to Sweden and instead invaded Ukraine. Peter withdrew his army southward, employing scorched earth, destroying along the way anything that could assist the Swedes. Deprived of local supplies, the Swedish army was forced to halt its advance in the winter of 1708–1709. In the summer of 1709, they resumed their efforts to capture Russian-ruled Ukraine, culminating in the Battle of Poltava on 27 June. The battle was a decisive defeat for the Swedish forces, ending Charles&#x27; campaign in Ukraine and forcing him south to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire. Russia had defeated what was considered to be one of the world&#x27;s best militaries, and the victory overturned the view that Russia was militarily incompetent. In Poland, Augustus II was restored as King.

Peter, overestimating the support he would receive from his Balkan allies, attacked the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Russo-Turkish War of 1710. Peter&#x27;s campaign in the Ottoman Empire was disastrous, and in the ensuing Treaty of the Pruth, Peter was forced to return the Black Sea ports he had seized in 1697. In return, the Sultan expelled Charles XII. The Ottomans called him &quot;Mad Peter&quot; (), for his willingness to sacrifice large numbers of his troops in wartime.

Peter&#x27;s northern armies took the Swedish province of Livonia (the northern half of modern Latvia, and the southern half of modern Estonia), driving the Swedes out of Finland. In 1714, the Russian fleet won the Battle of Gangut. During the Great Wrath most of Finland was occupied by Russian forces.

===Second Embassy===

In January 1716, Tsar Peter traveled in the Baltic region to discuss peace negotiations and how to protect the sea trade route from the Swedes. He visited Riga, Königsberg and Danzig. There his niece married the quarrelsome Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin with which Peter wanted an alliance. He obtained the assistance of the Frederick William I of Prussia who sieged the strong Swedish fortress Wismar. In Altona he met with Danish diplomats, supporting Prussia. He sailed to Copenhagen heading an allied fleet. In Wittenberg he visited the monastery, where Luther lived. In May he went on to Bad Pyrmont, and, because of his physical problems he stayed at this spa. There he met with the genius Leibniz. Blumentrost and Areskine accompanied him.

In early December Peter arrived in Amsterdam and visited Nicolaas Witsen. He bought the anatomic and herbarium collection of Frederik Ruysch, Levinus Vincent and Albertus Seba. He obtained many paintings among other from Maria Sibylla Merian for his Kunstkamera and Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;David and Jonathan&quot; for Peterhof Palace. He paid a visit to a friend&#x27;s mansion near Nigtevecht, a silk manufacture and a paper-mill. At five in the morning he was received by Herman Boerhaave who showed Peter the Botanical Garden. In April 1717 he continued his travel to Austrian Netherlands, Dunkirk and Calais. In Paris he obtained many books, requested to become a member of the Academie de Sciences and visited the parliament, the Sorbonne and Madame Maintenon. Via the Palace of Saint-Cloud, the Grand Trianon at Versailles, Fontainebleau, Spa he travelled on to Maastricht, at that time one of the most important fortresses in Europe. He went back Amsterdam to attend a Treaty with France and Prussia on 15 August. He achieved a diplomatic success, and his international prestige, consolidated. Again he visited the Hortus Botanicus and left the city early September 1717, heading for Berlin. In October he was back in St Petersburg. In 1719 New Holland Island was created.

The tsar&#x27;s navy was powerful enough that the Russians could penetrate Sweden. Still, Charles XII refused to yield, and not until his death in battle in 1718 did peace become feasible. After the battle of Grengam, Sweden made peace with all powers but Russia by 1720. In 1721, the Treaty of Nystad ended the Great Northern War. Russia acquired Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, and a substantial portion of Karelia. In turn, Russia paid two million Riksdaler and surrendered most of Finland.

===Later years===
In 1717, Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky led the first Russian military expedition into Central Asia against the Khanate of Khiva. The expedition ended in complete disaster when the entire expeditionary force was slaughtered.

To the end of 1717, the preparatory phase of administrative reform in Russia was completed. After 1718, Peter established collegiums in place of the old central agencies of government, including foreign affairs, war, navy, expense, income, justice, and inspection. Later others were added, to regulate mining and industry. Each college consisted of a president, a vice-president, a number of councilors and assessors, and a procurator. Some foreigners were included in various colleges but not as president. Pavel Yaguzhinsky was entrusted with the observation of the &quot;soonest possible establishment of colleges by their presidents&quot;. Peter did not have enough loyal, talented or educated persons to put in full charge of the various departments. Peter preferred to rely on groups of individuals who would keep check on one another. Decisions depended on the majority vote.

In 1718, Peter investigated why the formerly Swedish province of Livonia was so orderly. He discovered that the Swedes spent as much administering Livonia (300 times smaller than his empire) as he spent on the entire Russian bureaucracy. He was forced to dismantle the province&#x27;s government. In June 1721 he had Gagarin, the governor of Siberia, executed.

Peter&#x27;s last years were marked by further reform in Russia. On 2 November 1721 (N.S.), soon after peace was made with Sweden, he was officially proclaimed &quot;Emperor of All Russia&quot;. The coronation of the Russian monarch took place in Uspensky Cathedral, Moscow. Some proposed that he take the title &quot;Emperor of the East&quot;, but he refused. Gavrila Golovkin, the State Chancellor, was the first to add &quot;the Great, Father of His Country, Emperor of All the Russias&quot; to Peter&#x27;s traditional title of tsar following a speech by Theophan Prokopovich in 1721. Peter&#x27;s imperial title was recognized by Augustus II of Poland, Frederick William I of Prussia, and Frederick I of Sweden, but not by the other European monarchs. In the minds of many, the word &quot;emperor&quot; connoted superiority or pre-eminence over kings. Several rulers feared that Peter would claim authority over them, just as the Holy Roman Emperor had claimed suzerainty over all Christian nations.

By the grace of God, the most excellent and great sovereign emperor Pyotr Alekseevich the ruler of all the Russias: of Moscow, of Kiev, of Vladimir, of Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan and Tsar of Siberia, sovereign of Pskov, great prince of Smolensk, of Tver, of Yugorsk, of Perm, of Vyatka, of Bulgaria and others, sovereign and great prince of the Novgorod Lower lands, of Chernigov, of Ryazan, of Rostov, of Yaroslavl, of Belozersk, of Udora, of Kondia and the sovereign of all the northern lands, and the sovereign of the Iverian lands, of the Kartlian and Georgian Kings, of the Kabardin lands, of the Circassian and Mountain princes and many other states and lands western and eastern here and there and the successor and sovereign and ruler.

In 1722, Peter issued a Decree on the succession to the throne, in which he abolished the ancient custom of transferring the throne to direct descendants in the male line (as he had no son). The decree was so unusual for Russian society that it was necessary to explain it. Peter created a new order of precedence for landowners known as the Table of Ranks. Formerly, precedence had been determined by birth. To deprive the Boyars of their high positions, Peter directed that precedence should be determined by merit and service to the Emperor. The Table of Ranks continued to remain in effect until the Russian monarchy was overthrown in 1917.

In 1722, John Bell accompanied Peter the Great on a military expedition to the city of Derbent near the Caspian Sea. The once powerful Persian Safavid Empire to the south was in deep decline. Taking advantage of the profitable situation, Peter launched the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, otherwise known as &quot;The Persian Expedition of Peter the Great&quot;, which drastically increased Russian influence for the first time in the Caucasus and Caspian Sea region, and prevented the Ottoman Empire from making territorial gains in the region. After considerable success and the capture of many provinces and cities in the Caucasus and northern mainland Persia, the Safavids were forced to hand over territory to Russia, comprising Derbent, Shirvan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Baku, and Astrabad. Within twelve years all the territories were ceded back to Persia, now led by the charismatic military genius Nader Shah, as part of the Treaty of Resht, the Treaty of Ganja, and as the result of a Russo-Persian alliance against the Ottoman Empire, which was the common enemy of both.

Peter changed the system of direct taxation. He abolished the land tax and household tax and replaced them with a poll tax. The taxes on land and on households were payable only by individuals who owned property or maintained families. The new head taxes were payable by serfs and paupers. Peter began construction of the Monplaisir Palace based on his own sketches. He ordered to purchase 2,000 lime trees which were shipped to St Petersburg. In 1725, the construction of Peterhof, a palace near Saint Petersburg, was completed. Peterhof was a grand residence, becoming known as the &quot;Russian Versailles&quot;.

===Illness and death===
In the winter of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having problems with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724, a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In the first week of October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. Rastrelli finished his monument to Peter I (St. Michael&#x27;s Castle). According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Gulf of Finland to inspect some ironworks, Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning near shore and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue. This icy water rescue is said to have exacerbated Peter&#x27;s bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler :de:Jacob von Staehlin is the only source for the story.

In early January 1725, Peter was struck once again with uremia or azotemia. Legend has it that before lapsing into unconsciousness Peter asked for a paper and pen and scrawled an unfinished note that read: &quot;Leave all to ...&quot; and then, exhausted by the effort, asked for his daughter Anna to be summoned.

Peter died between four and five in the morning 8 February. An autopsy revealed his bladder to be infected with gangrene. He was fifty-two years, seven months old when he died, having reigned forty-two years. He is interred in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral.

After his death, students came to the Military College with a request to &quot;leave science&quot; under the pretext of &quot;unconsciousness and incomprehensibility.&quot;

==Religion==
Peter had a great interest in dissenters and visited gatherings of Quakers and Mennonites. He did not believe in miracles and founded The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters, an organization that mocked the Orthodox and Catholic Church when he was eighteen. In January 1695, Peter refused to partake in a traditional Russian Orthodox ceremony of the Epiphany Ceremony, and would often schedule events for The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters to directly conflict with the Church. He often used the nickname &quot;Pakhom Mikhailov&quot; () among the ministers of religion who made up his relatively close circle of long-term drinking companions.

Peter was brought up in the Russian Orthodox faith, but he had low regard for the Church hierarchy, which he kept under tight governmental control. The traditional leader of the Church was the Patriarch of Moscow. In 1700, when the office fell vacant, Peter refused to name a replacement, allowing the patriarch&#x27;s coadjutor (or deputy) to discharge the duties of the office. Peter could not tolerate the patriarch exercising power superior to the tsar, as indeed had happened in the case of Philaret (1619–1633) and Nikon (1652–66). The Alexander Nevsky Lavra was constructed between 1710–1712; Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral between 1712–1733. In 1716 he invited Theophan Prokopovich, a pietist and astronomer, to come to the capital. The &quot;Ecclesiastical Regulations&quot; of 1721 are based on the ideas of August Hermann Francke. The Church reform of Peter the Great therefore abolished the patriarchate, replacing it with a Holy Synod that was under the control of a Procurator.

In 1721, Peter followed the advice of Prokopovich in designing the Holy Synod as a council of ten clergymen. For leadership in the Church, Peter turned increasingly to Ukrainians, who were more open to reform, but were not well loved by the Russian clergy. Peter implemented a law that stipulated that no Russian man could join a monastery before the age of fifty. He felt that too many able Russian men were being wasted on clerical work when they could be joining his new and improved army.

==Marriages and family==
Peter the Great had two wives, with whom he had fifteen children, three of whom survived to adulthood. Peter&#x27;s mother selected his first wife, Eudoxia Lopukhina, when he was only 16. This was consistent with previous Romanov tradition by choosing a daughter of a minor noble. This was done to prevent fighting between the stronger noble houses and to bring fresh blood into the family. Upon his return from his European tour in 1698, Peter sought to end his unhappy marriage. He divorced the tsaritsa and forced her to join a convent. She had borne him three children, although only one, Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia, survived past his childhood.

Menshikov introduced him to Marta Helena Skowrońska, the daughter of a Polish-Lithuanian peasant, and took her as a mistress some time between 1702 and 1704. Marta converted to the Russian Orthodox Church and was given the name Catherine. Though no record exists, Catherine and Peter married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in St. Petersburg. Peter valued Catherine and married officially, at Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral on 19 February 1712.

In 1718, his son Alexei Petrovich was locked up in the Peter and Paul fortress, whom he regarded as the rebellious Absalom. He was suspected of being involved in a plot to overthrow the Emperor. Alexei was tried and confessed under torture during questioning conducted by a secular court (count Tolstoy). He was convicted and sentenced to be executed. The sentence of high treason could only be carried out with Peter&#x27;s signed authorization, and Alexei died in prison, as Peter hesitated before making the decision. Alexei&#x27;s death most likely resulted from injuries suffered during his torture. Alexei&#x27;s mother Eudoxia was punished. She was dragged from her home, tried on false charges of adultery, publicly flogged, and confined in monasteries while being forbidden to be talked to. 

In 1724, Peter had his second wife, Catherine, crowned as Empress, although he remained Russia&#x27;s actual ruler.

===Issue===
By his two wives, he had fifteen children: three by Eudoxia and twelve by Catherine. These included four sons named &quot;Pavel&quot; and three sons named &quot;Peter&quot;, all of whom died in infancy. Only three of his children survived to adulthood. He had only three grandchildren: Tsar Peter II and Grand Duchess Natalia by Alexei and Tsar Peter III by Anna.

==Legacy==
Peter&#x27;s legacy has always been a major concern of Russian intellectuals. Peter is a more complex character than he is sometimes given credit for. Some believe Peter&#x27;s reforms divided the country socially and weakened it spiritually. Riasanovsky points to a &quot;paradoxical dichotomy&quot; in the black and white images such as God/Antichrist, educator/ignoramus, architect of Russia&#x27;s greatness/destroyer of national culture, father of his country/scourge of the common man. For Old Believers he was the Antichrist, because of the calendar changes and poll tax. Peter compared himself with King David or Noah with a divine mission. At his funeral Prokopovich compared him with Moses and Solomon. Voltaire&#x27;s 1759 biography gave 18th-century Russians a man of the Enlightenment, while Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot; poem of 1833 gave a powerful romantic image of a creator-god. Slavophiles in mid-19th century deplored Peter&#x27;s westernization of Russia.

Western writers and political analysts recounted &quot;The Testimony&quot; or secret will of Peter the Great. It supposedly revealed his grand evil plot for Russia to control the world via conquest of Constantinople, Afghanistan and India. It was a forgery made in Paris at Napoleon&#x27;s command when he started the invasion of Russia in 1812. Nevertheless, it is still quoted in foreign policy circles.

The Communists executed the last Romanovs, and their historians such as Mikhail Pokrovsky presented strongly negative views of the entire dynasty. Stalin however admired how Peter strengthened the state, and wartime, diplomacy, industry, higher education, and government administration. Stalin wrote in 1928, &quot;when Peter the Great, who had to deal with more developed countries in the West, feverishly built works in factories for supplying the army and strengthening the country&#x27;s defenses, this was an original attempt to leap out of the framework of backwardness.&quot; As a result, Soviet historiography emphasizes both the positive achievement and the negative factor of oppressing the common people.

After the fall of Communism in 1991, scholars and the general public in Russia and the West gave fresh attention to Peter and his role in Russian history. His reign is now seen as the decisive formative event in the Russian imperial past. Many new ideas have merged, such as whether he strengthened the autocratic state or whether the tsarist regime was not statist enough given its small bureaucracy. Modernization models have become contested ground.

He initiated a wide range of economic, social, political, administrative, educational and military reforms which ended the dominance of traditionalism and religion in Russia and initiated its westernization. His efforts included secularization of education, organization of administration for effective governance, enhanced use of technology, establishing an industrial economy, modernization of the army and establishment of a strong navy.

Historian Y. Vodarsky said in 1993 that Peter, &quot;did not lead the country on the path of accelerated economic, political and social development, did not force it to &#x27;achieve a leap&#x27; through several stages... On the contrary, these actions to the greatest degree put a brake on Russia&#x27;s progress and created conditions for holding it back for one and a half centuries!&quot; The autocratic powers that Stalin admired appeared as a liability to Evgeny Anisimov, who complained that Peter was, &quot;the creator of the administrative command system and the true ancestor of Stalin.&quot; In the period from 1678 to 1710, however, the population grew 2 times.

According to &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;He did not completely bridge the gulf between Russia and the Western countries, but he achieved considerable progress in development of the national economy and trade, education, science and culture, and foreign policy. Russia became a great power, without whose concurrence no important European problem could thenceforth be settled. His internal reforms achieved progress to an extent that no earlier innovator could have envisaged.&quot;

While the cultural turn in historiography has downplayed diplomatic, economic and constitutional issues, new cultural roles have been found for Peter, for example in architecture (Petrine Baroque) and dress. James Cracraft argues:

:The Petrine revolution in Russia—subsuming in this phrase the many military, naval, governmental, educational, architectural, linguistic, and other internal reforms enacted by Peter&#x27;s regime to promote Russia&#x27;s rise as a major European power—was essentially a cultural revolution, one that profoundly impacted both the basic constitution of the Russian Empire and, perforce, its subsequent development.

The iconic representations of dead saints typical for centuries of Russian visual culture suddenly give way to naturalistic portraiture.

==In popular culture==
Peter has been featured in many histories, novels, plays, films, monuments and paintings. They include the poems &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;, &quot;Poltava&quot; and the unfinished novel &quot;The Moor of Peter the Great&quot;, all by Alexander Pushkin. The former dealt with The Bronze Horseman, an equestrian statue raised in Peter&#x27;s honour.
