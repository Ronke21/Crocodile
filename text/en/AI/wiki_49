<text>In science, an inverse-square law is any scientific law stating that the observed &quot;intensity&quot; of a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.

Radar energy expands during both the signal transmission and the reflected return, so the inverse square for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse fourth power of the range.

To prevent dilution of energy while propagating a signal, certain methods can be used such as a waveguide, which acts like a canal does for water, or how a gun barrel restricts hot gas expansion to one dimension in order to prevent loss of energy transfer to a bullet.

== Formula ==
In mathematical notation the inverse square law can be expressed as an intensity (I) varying as a function of distance (d) from some centre. The intensity is proportional (see ∝) to the reciprocal of the square of the distance thus: 
formula_1

It can also be mathematically expressed as :
formula_2

or as the formulation of a constant quantity: 
formula_3

The divergence of a vector field which is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources is proportional to the strength of the local sources, and hence zero outside sources. Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of electric, light, sound, and radiation phenomena.

== Justification ==
The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or other conserved quantity is evenly radiated outward from a point source in three-dimensional space. Since the surface area of a sphere (which is 4π&quot;r&quot;2) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the emitted radiation gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.

===Gravitation===
Gravitation is the attraction between objects that have mass. Newton&#x27;s law states:

formula_4

If the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric, then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation, as shown in the shell theorem. Otherwise, if we want to calculate the attraction between massive bodies, we need to add all the point-point attraction forces vectorially and the net attraction might not be exact inverse square. However, if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes, then to a good approximation, it is reasonable to treat the masses as a point mass located at the object&#x27;s center of mass while calculating the gravitational force.

As the law of gravitation, this law was suggested in 1645 by Ismaël Bullialdus. But Bullialdus did not accept Kepler&#x27;s second and third laws, nor did he appreciate Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s solution for circular motion (motion in a straight line pulled aside by the central force). Indeed, Bullialdus maintained the sun&#x27;s force was attractive at aphelion and repulsive at perihelion. Robert Hooke and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli both expounded gravitation in 1666 as an attractive force. Hooke&#x27;s lecture &quot;On gravity&quot; was at the Royal Society, in London, on 21 March. Borelli&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Planets&quot; was published later in 1666. Hooke&#x27;s 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to &quot;all celestiall bodys&quot; and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines. By 1679, Hooke thought gravitation had inverse square dependence and communicated this in a letter to Isaac Newton: 
&quot;my supposition is that the attraction always is in duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall&quot;.

Hooke remained bitter about Newton claiming the invention of this principle, even though Newton&#x27;s 1686 &quot;Principia&quot; acknowledged that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system, as well as giving some credit to Bullialdus.

===Electrostatics===

The force of attraction or repulsion between two electrically charged particles, in addition to being directly proportional to the product of the electric charges, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; this is known as Coulomb&#x27;s law. The deviation of the exponent from 2 is less than one part in 1015.

===Light and other electromagnetic radiation===
The intensity (or illuminance or irradiance) of light or other linear waves radiating from a point source (energy per unit of area perpendicular to the source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, so an object (of the same size) twice as far away receives only one-quarter the energy (in the same time period).

More generally, the irradiance, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the intensity (or power per unit area in the direction of propagation), of a spherical wavefront varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source (assuming there are no losses caused by absorption or scattering).

For example, the intensity of radiation from the Sun is 9126 watts per square meter at the distance of Mercury (0.387 AU); but only 1367 watts per square meter at the distance of Earth (1 AU)—an approximate threefold increase in distance results in an approximate ninefold decrease in intensity of radiation.

For non-isotropic radiators such as parabolic antennas, headlights, and lasers, the effective origin is located far behind the beam aperture. If you are close to the origin, you don&#x27;t have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have antenna gain in the direction of the narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an isotropic antenna.

In photography and stage lighting, the inverse-square law is used to determine the “fall off” or the difference in illumination on a subject as it moves closer to or further from the light source. For quick approximations, it is enough to remember that doubling the distance reduces illumination to one quarter; or similarly, to halve the illumination increase the distance by a factor of 1.4 (the square root of 2), and to double illumination, reduce the distance to 0.7 (square root of 1/2). When the illuminant is not a point source, the inverse square rule is often still a useful approximation; when the size of the light source is less than one-fifth of the distance to the subject, the calculation error is less than 1%.

The fractional reduction in electromagnetic fluence (Φ) for indirectly ionizing radiation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the inverse-square law. Since emissions from a point source have radial directions, they intercept at a perpendicular incidence. The area of such a shell is 4π&quot;r&quot; 2 where &quot;r&quot; is the radial distance from the center. The law is particularly important in diagnostic radiography and radiotherapy treatment planning, though this proportionality does not hold in practical situations unless source dimensions are much smaller than the distance. As stated in Fourier theory of heat “as the point source is magnification by distances, its radiation is dilute proportional to the sin of the angle, of the increasing circumference arc from the point of origin”.

====Example====
Let &quot;P&quot;  be the total power radiated from a point source (for example, an omnidirectional isotropic radiator). At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases. Since the surface area of a sphere of radius &quot;r&quot; is &quot;A&quot; = 4&quot;πr&quot; 2, the intensity &quot;I&quot; (power per unit area) of radiation at distance &quot;r&quot; is
formula_6

The energy or intensity decreases (divided by 4) as the distance &quot;r&quot; is doubled; if measured in dB would decrease by 6.02 dB per doubling of distance. When referring to measurements of power quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to the reference value.

===Sound in a gas===

In acoustics, the sound pressure of a spherical wavefront radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance &quot;r&quot; is doubled; measured in dB, the decrease is still 6.02 dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):

formula_7

The same is true for the component of particle velocity formula_8 that is in-phase with the instantaneous sound pressure formula_9:

formula_10

In the near field is a quadrature component of the particle velocity that is 90° out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound. The sound intensity is the product of the RMS sound pressure and the &quot;in-phase&quot; component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:

formula_11

==Field theory interpretation==
For an irrotational vector field in three-dimensional space, the inverse-square law corresponds to the property that the divergence is zero outside the source. This can be generalized to higher dimensions. Generally, for an irrotational vector field in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, the intensity &quot;I&quot; of the vector field falls off with the distance &quot;r&quot; following the inverse (&quot;n&quot; − 1)th power law

formula_12

given that the space outside the source is divergence free. 

== Non-Euclidean implications ==

The inverse-square law, fundamental in Euclidean spaces, also applies to non-Euclidean geometries, including hyperbolic space. The curvature present in these spaces alters physical laws, influencing a variety of fields such as cosmology, general relativity, and string theory.

John D. Barrow, in his 2020 paper &quot;Non-Euclidean Newtonian Cosmology,&quot; expands on the behavior of force (F) and potential (Φ) within hyperbolic 3-space (H3). He explains that F and Φ obey the relationships F ∝ 1 / R² sinh²(r/R) and Φ ∝ coth(r/R), where R represents the curvature radius and r represents the distance from the focal point.

The concept of spatial dimensionality, first proposed by Immanuel Kant, remains a topic of debate concerning the inverse-square law. Dimitria Electra Gatzia and Rex D. Ramsier, in their 2021 paper, contend that the inverse-square law is more closely related to force distribution symmetry than to the dimensionality of space.

In the context of non-Euclidean geometries and general relativity, deviations from the inverse-square law do not arise from the law itself but rather from the assumption that the force between two bodies is instantaneous, which contradicts special relativity. General relativity reinterprets gravity as the curvature of spacetime, leading particles to move along geodesics in this curved spacetime.

==History==

John Dumbleton of the 14th-century Oxford Calculators, was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the mean speed theorem stating that &quot;the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint&quot; and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination in his &quot;Summa logicæ et philosophiæ naturalis&quot; (ca. 1349), stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law.

In proposition 9 of Book 1 in his book &quot;Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur&quot; (1604), the astronomer Johannes Kepler argued that the spreading of light from a point source obeys an inverse square law:


In 1645, in his book &quot;Astronomia Philolaica&quot; ..., the French astronomer Ismaël Bullialdus (1605–1694) refuted Johannes Kepler&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;gravity&quot; weakens as the inverse of the distance; instead, Bullialdus argued, &quot;gravity&quot; weakens as the inverse square of the distance:

In England, the Anglican bishop Seth Ward (1617–1689) publicized the ideas of Bullialdus in his critique &quot;In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis&quot; (1653) and publicized the planetary astronomy of Kepler in his book &quot;Astronomia geometrica&quot; (1656).

In 1663–1664, the English scientist Robert Hooke was writing his book &quot;Micrographia&quot; (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface. Since the atmosphere surrounds the Earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the Earth&#x27;s surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the Earth&#x27;s center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the Earth&#x27;s surface to space bears on the Earth&#x27;s surface). Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air&#x27;s pressure at the Earth&#x27;s surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude. Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth&#x27;s center.

<text>In telecommunications and radio science, an ionospheric sounding is a technique that provides real-time data on high-frequency ionospheric-dependent radio propagation, using a basic system consisting of a synchronized transmitter and receiver. 

The time delay between transmission and reception is translated into effective ionospheric layer altitude. Vertical incident sounding uses a collocated transmitter and receiver and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the ionosphere and measuring the values of the reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the critical frequency. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display (ionogram), at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-frequency signal which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts time delay to effective altitude of the ionospheric layer. The ionogram display shows the effective altitude of the ionospheric layer as a function of frequency.

<text>A sequence of events is isochronous if the events occur regularly, or at equal time intervals. The term &quot;isochronous&quot; is used in several technical contexts, but usually refers to the primary subject maintaining a constant period or interval (the reciprocal of frequency), despite variations in other measurable factors in the same system. Isochronous timing is a characteristic of a repeating event whereas synchronous timing refers to the relationship between two or more events.

*In dynamical systems theory, an oscillator is called &quot;isochronous&quot; if its frequency is independent of its amplitude.
*In horology, a mechanical clock or watch is &quot;isochronous&quot; if it runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so that it keeps correct time as its mainspring unwinds or chain length varies. Isochrony is important in timekeeping devices. Simply put, if a power providing device (e.g. a spring or weight) provides constant torque to the wheel train, it will be isochronous, since the escapement will experience the same force regardless of how far the weight has dropped or the spring has unwound. 
*In electrical power generation, &quot;isochronous&quot; means that the frequency of the electricity generated is constant under varying load; there is zero generator droop. (See Synchronization (alternating current).)
*In telecommunications, an isochronous signal is one where the time interval separating any two corresponding transitions is equal to the unit interval or to a multiple of the unit interval; but phase is arbitrary and potentially varying.
**The term is also used in data transmission to describe cases in which corresponding significant instants of two or more sequential signals have a constant phase relationship.
**Isochronous burst transmission is used when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the input data signaling rate.
*In the Universal Serial Bus used in computers, &quot;isochronous&quot; is one of the four data flow types for USB devices (the others being Control, Interrupt and Bulk). It is commonly used for streaming data types such as video or audio sources. Similarly, the IEEE 1394 interface standard, commonly called Firewire, includes support for isochronous streams of audio and video at known constant rates.
*In particle accelerators an isochronous cyclotron is a cyclotron where the field strength increases with radius to compensate for relativistic increase in mass with speed.
*An isochrone is a contour line of equal time, for instance, in geological layers, tree rings or wave fronts. An isochrone map or diagram shows such contours.
*In linguistics, isochrony is the postulated rhythmic division of time into equal portions by a language.
*In neurology, isochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone used for brainwave entrainment.

<text>Isochronous burst transmission is a method of transmission. In a data network where the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the input data signaling rate, transmission is performed by interrupting, at controlled intervals, the data stream being transmitted.

&quot;Note 1:&quot; Burst transmission in isochronous form enables communication between data terminal equipment (DTE) and data networks that operate at dissimilar data signaling rates, such as when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the DTE output data signaling rate.

&quot;Note 2:&quot; The binary digits are transferred at the information-bearer channel rate. The data transfer is interrupted at intervals in order to produce the required average data signaling rate.

&quot;Note 3:&quot; The interruption is always for an integral number of unit intervals.

<text>Jerkiness (sometimes called strobing or choppy footage) describes the perception of individual still images while watching a motion picture.

== Description ==
Motion pictures are made from still images shown in rapid sequence. Provided there is sufficient continuity between the images and provided the sequence is shown fast enough, the central nervous system interprets the sequence as continuous motion. However, some technologies cannot process or carry data fast enough for sufficiently high frame rates. For example, viewing motion pictures by Internet connection generally necessitates a greatly reduced frame rate, making jerkiness clearly apparent.

In conventional cinematography, the images are filmed and displayed at 24 frames per second, at which speed jerkiness is not normally discernible. Television screens refresh at even higher frequencies. PAL and SÉCAM television (the standards in Europe) refresh at 25 or 50 (HDTV) frames per second. NTSC television displays (the standard in North America) refresh at 29.97 frames per second.
Animated cartoon films are typically made at reduced frame rates (accomplished by shooting several film frames of the individual drawings) so as to limit production costs, with the result that jerkiness tends to be apparent, especially on older limited animation features.

== Other uses ==
Strobing can also refer to cross colour and Moiré patterning. Cross colour refers to when any high frequency luminance content of the picture, close to the TV system&#x27;s colour sub-carrier frequency, is interpreted by the analogue receiver&#x27;s decoder as colour information. Moiré patterning is where an interference pattern is produced by fine scene detail beating with the line (or even pixel) structure of the device used to analyse or display the scene.

<doc id="41296" wikidata="Q1052698" url="?curid=41296" title="Jitter">
<text>In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal. In clock recovery applications it is called timing jitter. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links.

Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals, e.g., root mean square (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement. Also, like other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral density.

Jitter period is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with time. Jitter frequency, the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse. ITU-T G.810 classifies deviation lower frequencies below 10 Hz as wander and higher frequencies at or above 10 Hz as &quot;jitter&quot;.

Jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers, introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.

==Metrics==
For clock jitter, there are three commonly used metrics:

;Absolute jitter 
:The absolute difference in the position of a clock&#x27;s edge from where it would ideally be.

;Maximum time interval error (MTIE)
:Maximum error committed by a clock under test in measuring a time interval for a given period of time.

;Period jitter (a.k.a. &quot;cycle jitter&quot;)
:The difference between any one clock period and the ideal or average clock period. Period jitter tends to be important in synchronous circuitry such as digital state machines where the error-free operation of the circuitry is limited by the shortest possible clock period (average period less maximum cycle jitter), and the performance of the circuitry is set by the average clock period. Hence, synchronous circuitry benefits from minimizing period jitter, so that the shortest clock period approaches the average clock period.

;Cycle-to-cycle jitter
:The difference in duration of any two adjacent clock periods. It can be important for some types of clock generation circuitry used in microprocessors and RAM interfaces.

In telecommunications, the unit used for the above types of jitter is usually the unit interval (UI) which quantifies the jitter in terms of a fraction of the transmission unit period. This unit is useful because it scales with clock frequency and thus allows relatively slow interconnects such as T1 to be compared to higher-speed internet backbone links such as OC-192. Absolute units such as &quot;picoseconds&quot; are more common in microprocessor applications. Units of &quot;degrees&quot; and &quot;radians&quot; are also used.
If jitter has a Gaussian distribution, it is usually quantified using the standard deviation of this distribution. This translates to an RMS measurement for a zero-mean distribution. Often, jitter distribution is significantly non-Gaussian. This can occur if the jitter is caused by external sources such as power supply noise. In these cases, &quot;peak-to-peak&quot; measurements may be more useful. Many efforts have been made to meaningfully quantify distributions that are neither Gaussian nor have a meaningful peak level. All have shortcomings but most tend to be good enough for the purposes of engineering work.

In computer networking, jitter can refer to packet delay variation, the variation (statistical dispersion) in the delay of the packets.

==Types==
One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.

===Random jitter===
Random jitter, also called Gaussian jitter, is unpredictable electronic timing noise. Random jitter typically follows a normal distribution due to being caused by thermal noise in an electrical circuit.

===Deterministic jitter===
Deterministic jitter is a type of clock or data signal jitter that is predictable and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter has a known non-normal distribution. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream (data-dependent jitter) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and intersymbol interference.

===Total jitter===
Total jitter (&quot;T&quot;) is the combination of random jitter (&quot;R&quot;) and deterministic jitter (&quot;D&quot;) and is computed in the context to a required bit error rate (BER) for the system:

in which the value of &quot;n&quot; is based on the BER required of the link.

A common BER used in communication standards such as Ethernet is 10−12.

==Examples==

===Sampling jitter===
In analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of signals, the sampling is normally assumed to be periodic with a fixed period—the time between every two samples is the same. If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the analog-to-digital converter or a digital-to-analog converter, the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error is proportional to the slew rate of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error. The effect of jitter on the signal depends on the nature of the jitter. Random jitter tends to add broadband noise while periodic jitter tends to add errant spectral components, &quot;birdys&quot;. In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a Nyquist frequency of 22 kHz to 14 bits.

Sampling jitter is an important consideration in high-frequency signal conversion, or where the clock signal is especially prone to interference.

In digital antenna arrays ADC and DAC jitters are the important factors determining the direction of arrival estimation accuracy and the depth of jammers suppression.

===Packet jitter in computer networks===
In the context of computer networks, packet jitter or packet delay variation (PDV) is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the end-to-end delay across a network. A network with constant delay has no packet jitter. Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean delay. PDV is an important quality of service factor in assessment of network performance.

Transmitting a burst of traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate transmission may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts may be seen as a desirable feature, e.g. in variable bitrate transmissions.

===Video and image jitter===
Video or image jitter occurs when the horizontal lines of video image frames are randomly displaced due to the corruption of synchronization signals or electromagnetic interference during video transmission. Model-based dejittering study has been carried out under the framework of digital image and video restoration.

==Testing==
Jitter in serial bus architectures is measured by means of eye patterns. There are standards for jitter measurement in serial bus architectures. The standards cover jitter tolerance, jitter transfer function and jitter generation, with the required values for these attributes varying among different applications. Where applicable, compliant systems are required to conform to these standards.

Testing for jitter and its measurement is of growing importance to electronics engineers because of increased clock frequencies in digital electronic circuitry to achieve higher device performance. Higher clock frequencies have commensurately smaller eye openings, and thus impose tighter tolerances on jitter. For example, modern computer motherboards have serial bus architectures with eye openings of 160 picoseconds or less. This is extremely small compared to parallel bus architectures with equivalent performance, which may have eye openings on the order of 1000 picoseconds.

Jitter is measured and evaluated in various ways depending on the type of circuit under test. In all cases, the goal of jitter measurement is to verify that the jitter will not disrupt normal operation of the circuit.

Testing of device performance for jitter tolerance may involve injection of jitter into electronic components with specialized test equipment.

A less direct approach—in which analog waveforms are digitized and the resulting data stream analyzed—is employed when measuring pixel jitter in frame grabbers.

==Mitigation==

=== Anti-jitter circuits===
Anti-jitter circuits (AJCs) are a class of electronic circuits designed to reduce the level of jitter in a clock signal. AJCs operate by re-timing the output pulses so they align more closely to an idealized clock. They are widely used in clock and data recovery circuits in digital communications, as well as for data sampling systems such as the analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter. Examples of anti-jitter circuits include phase-locked loop and delay-locked loop.

===Jitter buffers===
Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are buffers used to counter jitter introduced by queuing in packet-switched networks to ensure continuous playout of an audio or video media stream transmitted over the network. The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the media stream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term &quot;packet delay variation&quot; is often preferred over &quot;jitter&quot;.

Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network characteristics. The adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adjustments associated with adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out which may be noticeable to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that include voice activity detection that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.

===Dejitterizer===
A dejitterizer is a device that reduces jitter in a digital signal. A dejitterizer usually consists of an elastic buffer in which the signal is temporarily stored and then retransmitted at a rate based on the average rate of the incoming signal. A dejitterizer may not be effective in removing low-frequency jitter (wander).

===Filtering and decomposition===
A filter can be designed to minimize the effect of sampling jitter.

A jitter signal can be decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which can be further applied for filtering or dejittering.

<text>In telecommunications the Kendall effect is a spurious pattern or other distortion in a facsimile.

It is caused by unwanted modulation products which arise from the transmission of the carrier signal, and appear in the form of a rectified baseband that interferes with the lower sideband of the carrier. 

The Kendall effect occurs principally when the single-sideband width is greater than half of the facsimile carrier frequency.

<doc id="41306" wikidata="Q1190146" url="?curid=41306" title="Lambert's cosine law">
<text>In optics, Lambert&#x27;s cosine law says that the observed radiant intensity or luminous intensity from an ideal diffusely reflecting surface or ideal diffuse radiator is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle &quot;θ&quot; between the observer&#x27;s line of sight and the surface normal; . The law is also known as the cosine emission law or Lambert&#x27;s emission law. It is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, from his &quot;Photometria&quot;, published in 1760.

A surface which obeys Lambert&#x27;s law is said to be &quot;Lambertian&quot;, and exhibits Lambertian reflectance. Such a surface has a constant radiance/luminance, regardless of the angle from which it is observed; a single human eye perceives such a surface as having a constant brightness, regardless of the angle from which the eye observes the surface. It has the same radiance because, although the emitted power from a given area element is reduced by the cosine of the emission angle, the solid angle, subtended by surface visible to the viewer, is reduced by the very same amount. Because the ratio between power and solid angle is constant, radiance (power per unit solid angle per unit projected source area) stays the same.

==Lambertian scatterers and radiators==

When an area element is radiating as a result of being illuminated by an external source, the irradiance (energy or photons /time/area) landing on that area element will be proportional to the cosine of the angle between the illuminating source and the normal. A Lambertian scatterer will then scatter this light according to the same cosine law as a Lambertian emitter. This means that although the radiance of the surface depends on the angle from the normal to the illuminating source, it will not depend on the angle from the normal to the observer. For example, if the moon were a Lambertian scatterer, one would expect to see its scattered brightness appreciably diminish towards the terminator due to the increased angle at which sunlight hit the surface. The fact that it does not diminish illustrates that the moon is not a Lambertian scatterer, and in fact tends to scatter more light into the oblique angles than a Lambertian scatterer.

The emission of a Lambertian radiator does not depend on the amount of incident radiation, but rather from radiation originating in the emitting body itself. For example, if the sun were a Lambertian radiator, one would expect to see a constant brightness across the entire solar disc. The fact that the sun exhibits limb darkening in the visible region illustrates that it is not a Lambertian radiator. A black body is an example of a Lambertian radiator.

==Details of equal brightness effect==

The situation for a Lambertian surface (emitting or scattering) is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. For conceptual clarity we will think in terms of photons rather than energy or luminous energy. The wedges in the circle each represent an equal angle &quot;d&quot;Ω, of an arbitrarily chosen size, and for a Lambertian surface, the number of photons per second emitted into each wedge is proportional to the area of the wedge.

The length of each wedge is the product of the diameter of the circle and cos(&quot;θ&quot;). The maximum rate of photon emission per unit solid angle is along the normal, and diminishes to zero for &quot;θ&quot; = 90°. In mathematical terms, the radiance along the normal is &quot;I&quot; photons/(s·m2·sr) and the number of photons per second emitted into the vertical wedge is . The number of photons per second emitted into the wedge at angle &quot;θ&quot; is .

Figure 2 represents what an observer sees. The observer directly above the area element will be seeing the scene through an aperture of area &quot;dA&quot;0 and the area element &quot;dA&quot; will subtend a (solid) angle of &quot;d&quot;Ω0, which is a portion of the observer&#x27;s total angular field-of-view of the scene. Since the wedge size &quot;d&quot;Ω was chosen arbitrarily, for convenience we may assume without loss of generality that it coincides with the solid angle subtended by the aperture when &quot;viewed&quot; from the locus of the emitting area element dA. Thus the normal observer will then be recording the same photons per second emission derived above and will measure a radiance of

:formula_1 photons/(s·m2·sr).

The observer at angle &quot;θ&quot; to the normal will be seeing the scene through the same aperture of area &quot;dA&quot;0 (still corresponding to a &quot;d&quot;Ω wedge) and from this oblique vantage the area element &quot;dA&quot; is foreshortened and will subtend a (solid) angle of &quot;d&quot;Ω0 cos(&quot;θ&quot;). This observer will be recording photons per second, and so will be measuring a radiance of

:formula_2 photons/(s·m2·sr),

which is the same as the normal observer.

== Relating peak luminous intensity and luminous flux ==

In general, the luminous intensity of a point on a surface varies by direction; for a Lambertian surface, that distribution is defined by the cosine law, with peak luminous intensity in the normal direction. Thus when the Lambertian assumption holds, we can calculate the total luminous flux, formula_3, from the peak luminous intensity, formula_4, by integrating the cosine law:
formula_5
and so
:formula_6
where formula_7 is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix for the unit sphere, and realizing that formula_4 is luminous flux per steradian. Similarly, the peak intensity will be formula_9 of the total radiated luminous flux. For Lambertian surfaces, the same factor of formula_10 relates luminance to luminous emittance, radiant intensity to radiant flux, and radiance to radiant emittance. Radians and steradians are, of course, dimensionless and so &quot;rad&quot; and &quot;sr&quot; are included only for clarity.

Example: A surface with a luminance of say 100 cd/m2 (= 100 nits, typical PC monitor) will, if it is a perfect Lambert emitter, have a luminous emittance of 100π lm/m2. If its area is 0.1 m2 (~19&quot; monitor) then the total light emitted, or luminous flux, would thus be 31.4 lm.

<text>In fiber optic telecommunications, the launch angle has the following meanings: 

*The angle, with respect to the normal, at which a light ray emerges from a surface. 
*The beam divergence at an emitting surface, such as that of a light-emitting diode (LED), laser, lens, prism, or optical fiber end face. 
*At an end face of an optical fiber, the angle between an input ray and the fiber axis. If the end face of the fiber is perpendicular to the fiber axis, the launch angle is equal to the angle of incidence.

In baseball, the &quot;launch angle&quot; is the angle, with respect to the ground level at home plate, at which a batted ball leaves the bat.

<text>In telecommunications, launch numerical aperture (LNA) is the numerical aperture of an optical system used to couple (launch) power into an optical fiber. 

LNA may differ from the stated NA of a final focusing element if, for example, that element is underfilled or the focus is other than that for which the element is specified. 
LNA is one of the parameters that determine the initial distribution of power among the modes of an optical fiber.

<text>A leaky mode or tunneling mode in an optical fiber or other waveguide is a mode having an electric field that decays monotonically for a finite distance in the transverse direction but becomes oscillatory everywhere beyond that finite distance. Such a mode gradually &quot;leaks&quot; out of the waveguide as it travels down it, producing attenuation even if the waveguide is perfect in every respect. In order for a leaky mode to be definable as a mode, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory part (the leakage rate) must be sufficiently small that the mode substantially maintains its shape as it decays.

Leaky modes correspond to leaky rays in the terminology of geometric optics.
The propagation of light through optical fibre can take place via meridional rays or skew rays. These skew rays suffer only partial reflection while meridional rays are completely guided. Thus the modes allowing propagation of skew rays are called leaky modes. 
Some optical power is lost into clad due to these modes.

<text>In electrodynamics, linear polarization or plane polarization of electromagnetic radiation is a confinement of the electric field vector or magnetic field vector to a given plane along the direction of propagation. The term &quot;linear polarization&quot; (French: &quot;polarisation rectiligne&quot;) was coined by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1822. See &quot;polarization&quot; and &quot;plane of polarization&quot; for more information.

The orientation of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is defined by the direction of the electric field vector. For example, if the electric field vector is vertical (alternately up and down as the wave travels) the radiation is said to be vertically polarized.

==Mathematical description==
The classical sinusoidal plane wave solution of the electromagnetic wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields is (cgs units)
:formula_1

:formula_2

for the magnetic field, where k is the wavenumber,

:formula_3

is the angular frequency of the wave, and formula_4 is the speed of light.

Here formula_5 is the amplitude of the field and

:formula_6

is the Jones vector in the x-y plane.

The wave is linearly polarized when the phase angles formula_7 are equal,

:formula_8.

This represents a wave polarized at an angle formula_9 with respect to the x axis. In that case, the Jones vector can be written

:formula_10.

The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:formula_11

and

:formula_12

then the polarization state can be written in the &quot;x-y basis&quot; as

:formula_13.

<text>In telecommunications, a line code is a pattern of voltage, current, or photons used to represent digital data transmitted down a communication channel or written to a storage medium. This repertoire of signals is usually called a constrained code in data storage systems. 
Some signals are more prone to error than others as the physics of the communication channel or storage medium constrains the repertoire of signals that can be used reliably.

Common line encodings are unipolar, polar, bipolar, and Manchester code.

== Transmission and storage ==
After line coding, the signal is put through a physical communication channel, either a transmission medium or data storage medium. The most common physical channels are:
* the line-coded signal can directly be put on a transmission line, in the form of variations of the voltage or current (often using differential signaling).
* the line-coded signal (the &quot;baseband signal&quot;) undergoes further pulse shaping (to reduce its frequency bandwidth) and then is modulated (to shift its frequency) to create an &quot;RF signal&quot; that can be sent through free space.
* the line-coded signal can be used to turn on and off a light source in free-space optical communication, most commonly used in an infrared remote control.
* the line-coded signal can be printed on paper to create a bar code.
* the line-coded signal can be converted to magnetized spots on a hard drive or tape drive.
* the line-coded signal can be converted to pits on an optical disc.

Some of the more common binary line codes include:


Each line code has advantages and disadvantages. Line codes are chosen to meet one or more of the following criteria:
* Minimize transmission hardware
* Facilitate synchronization
* Ease error detection and correction
* Achieve a target spectral density
* Eliminate a DC component

== Disparity ==
Most long-distance communication channels cannot reliably transport a DC component. The DC component is also called the &quot;disparity&quot;, the &quot;bias&quot;, or the DC coefficient. The disparity of a bit pattern is the difference in the number of one bits vs the number of zero bits. The &quot;running disparity&quot; is the running total of the disparity of all previously transmitted bits. The simplest possible line code, unipolar, gives too many errors on such systems, because it has an unbounded DC component.

Most line codes eliminate the DC component such codes are called DC-balanced, zero-DC, or DC-free. There are three ways of eliminating the DC component:

* Use a constant-weight code. Each transmitted code word in a constant-weight code is designed such that every code word that contains some positive or negative levels also contains enough of the opposite levels, such that the average level over each code word is zero. Examples of constant-weight codes include Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5.
* Use a paired disparity code. Each code word in a paired disparity code that averages to a negative level is paired with another code word that averages to a positive level. The transmitter keeps track of the running DC buildup, and picks the code word that pushes the DC level back towards zero. The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits. Examples of paired disparity codes include alternate mark inversion, 8b/10b and 4B3T.
* Use a scrambler. For example, the scrambler specified in for 64b/66b encoding.

== Polarity ==
Bipolar line codes have two polarities, are generally implemented as RZ, and have a radix of three since there are three distinct output levels (negative, positive and zero). One of the principle advantages of this type of code is that it can eliminate any DC component. This is important if the signal must pass through a transformer or a long transmission line.

Unfortunately, several long-distance communication channels have polarity ambiguity. Polarity-insensitive line codes compensate in these channels.
There are three ways of providing unambiguous reception of 0 and 1 bits over such channels:
* Pair each code word with the polarity-inverse of that code word. The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits. Examples include alternate mark inversion, Differential Manchester encoding, coded mark inversion and Miller encoding.
* differential coding each symbol relative to the previous symbol. Examples include MLT-3 encoding and NRZI.
* Invert the whole stream when inverted syncwords are detected, perhaps using polarity switching

==Run-length limited codes==
For reliable clock recovery at the receiver, a run-length limitation may be imposed on the generated channel sequence, i.e., the maximum number of consecutive ones or zeros is bounded to a reasonable number. A clock period is recovered by observing transitions in the received sequence, so that a maximum run length guarantees sufficient transitions to assure clock recovery quality.

RLL codes are defined by four main parameters: &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;k&quot;. The first two, &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot;, refer to the rate of the code, while the remaining two specify the minimal &quot;d&quot; and maximal &quot;k&quot; number of zeroes between consecutive ones. This is used in both telecommunications and storage systems that move a medium past a fixed recording head.

Specifically, RLL bounds the length of stretches (runs) of repeated bits during which the signal does not change. If the runs are too long, clock recovery is difficult; if they are too short, the high frequencies might be attenuated by the communications channel. By modulating the data, RLL reduces the timing uncertainty in decoding the stored data, which would lead to the possible erroneous insertion or removal of bits when reading the data back. This mechanism ensures that the boundaries between bits can always be accurately found (preventing bit slip), while efficiently using the media to reliably store the maximal amount of data in a given space.

Early disk drives used very simple encoding schemes, such as RLL (0,1) FM code, followed by RLL (1,3) MFM code which were widely used in hard disk drives until the mid-1980s and are still used in digital optical discs such as CD, DVD, MD, Hi-MD and Blu-ray using EFM and EFMPLus codes. Higher density RLL (2,7) and RLL (1,7) codes became the de facto standards for hard disks by the early 1990s.

== Synchronization ==
Line coding should make it possible for the receiver to synchronize itself to the phase of the received signal. If the clock recovery is not ideal, then the signal to be decoded will not be sampled at the optimal times. This will increase the probability of error in the received data.

Biphase line codes require at least one transition per bit time. This makes it easier to synchronize the transceivers and detect errors, however, the baud rate is greater than that of NRZ codes.

== Other considerations ==
A line code will typically reflect technical requirements of the transmission medium, such as optical fiber or shielded twisted pair. These requirements are unique for each medium, because each one has different behavior related to interference, distortion, capacitance and attenuation.

<text>In computer networking, in the hierarchical structure of a primary or secondary station, link level is the conceptual level of control or data processing logic that controls the data link. 

Link-level functions provide an between the station high-level logic and the data link. Link-level functions include (a) transmit bit injection and receive bit extraction, (b) address and control field interpretation, (c) command response generation, transmission and interpretation, and (d) frame check sequence computation and interpretation.

<text>In adaptive high-frequency (HF) radio, link quality analysis (LQA) is the overall process by which measurements of radio signal quality are made, assessed, and analyzed.

In LQA, signal quality is determined by measuring, assessing, and analyzing link parameters, such as bit error ratio (BER), and the levels of the ratio of signal-plus-noise-plus-distortion to noise-plus-distortion (SINAD). Measurements are stored at—and exchanged between—stations, for use in making decisions about link establishment.

For adaptive HF radio, LQA is automatically performed and is usually based on analyses of pseudo-BERs and SINAD readings.

<doc id="41326" wikidata="Q830044" url="?curid=41326" title="Loading coil">
<text>A loading coil or load coil is an inductor that is inserted into an electronic circuit to increase its inductance. The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in radio antennas, or between the antenna and its feedline, to make an electrically short antenna resonant at its operating frequency.

The concept of loading coils was discovered by Oliver Heaviside in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal. The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the Heaviside condition. Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great. Submarine communications cables are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using balanced pairs were often continuously loaded with iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.

Loading coils are historically also known as Pupin coils after Mihajlo Pupin, especially when used for the Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called &quot;pupinization&quot;.

==Applications==

===Telephone lines===
A common application of loading coils is to improve the voice-frequency amplitude response characteristics of the twisted balanced pairs in a telephone cable. Because twisted pair is a balanced format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance. It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core. This increases the flux linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common cores, such loading coils do not comprise transformers, as they do not provide coupling to other circuits.

Loading coils inserted periodically in series with a pair of wires reduce the attenuation at the higher voice frequencies up to the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly. The shorter the distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency. The cutoff effect is an artifact of using lumped inductors. With loading methods using continuous distributed inductance there is no cutoff.

Without loading coils, the line response is dominated by the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency. With loading coils of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, waveforms are undistorted and the characteristic impedance is resistive up to the cutoff frequency. The coincidental formation of an audio frequency filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.

====DSL====
With loading coils, signal attenuation of a circuit remains low for signals within the passband of the transmission line but increases rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. If the telephone line is subsequently reused to support applications that require higher frequencies, such as in analog or digital carrier systems or digital subscriber line (DSL), loading coils must be removed or replaced. Using coils with parallel capacitors forms a filter with the topology of an m-derived filter and a band of frequencies above the cut-off is also passed. Without removal, for subscribers at an extended distance, e.g., over 4 miles (6.4 km) from the central office, DSL cannot be supported.

====Carrier systems====
American early and middle 20th century telephone cables had load coils at intervals of a mile (1.61 km), usually in coil cases holding many. The coils had to be removed to pass higher frequencies, but the coil cases provided convenient places for repeaters of digital T-carrier systems, which could then transmit a 1.5 Mbit/s signal that distance. Due to narrower streets and higher cost of copper, European cables had thinner wires and used closer spacing. Intervals of a kilometer allowed European systems to carry 2 Mbit/s.

=== Radio antenna ===
Another type of loading coil is used in radio antennas. Monopole and dipole radio antennas are designed to act as resonators for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna&#x27;s transmission line, excites standing waves of voltage and current in the antenna element. To be &quot;naturally&quot; resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of one quarter of the wavelength of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length, with odd multiples usually preferred). At resonance, the antenna acts electrically as a pure resistance, absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.

In many cases, for practical reasons, it is necessary to make the antenna shorter than the resonant length, this is called an electrically short antenna. An antenna shorter than a quarter wavelength presents capacitive reactance to the transmission line . Some of the applied power is reflected back into the transmission line and travels back toward the transmitter . The two currents at the same frequency running in opposite directions causes standing waves on the transmission line , measured as a standing wave ratio (SWR) greater than one. The elevated currents waste energy by heating the wire, and can even overheat the transmitter.

To make an electrically short antenna resonant, a loading coil is inserted in series with the antenna. The coil is built to have an inductive reactance equal and opposite to the capacitive reactance of the short antenna, so the combination of reactances cancels. When so loaded the antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected. The loading coil is often placed at the base of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (&quot;base loading&quot;), but for more efficient radiation, it is sometimes inserted near the midpoint of the antenna element (&quot;center loading&quot;).

Loading coils for powerful transmitters can have challenging design requirements, especially at low frequencies. The radiation resistance of short antennas can be very low, as low a few ohms in the LF or VLF bands, where antennas are commonly short and inductive loading is most needed. Because resistance in the coil winding is comparable to, or exceeds the radiation resistance, loading coils for extremely electrically short antennas must have extremely low AC resistance at the operating frequency. To reduce skin effect losses, the coil is often made of tubing or Litz wire, with single layer windings, with turns spaced apart to reduce proximity effect resistance. They must often handle high voltages. To reduce power lost in dielectric losses, the coil is often suspended in air supported on thin ceramic strips. The capacitively loaded antennas used at low frequencies have extremely narrow bandwidths, and therefore if the frequency is changed the loading coil must be adjustable to tune the antenna to resonance with the new transmitter frequency. Variometers are often used.

===Bulk power transmission===
To reduce losses due to high capacitance on long-distance bulk power transmission lines, inductance can be introduced to the circuit with a flexible AC transmission system (FACTS), a static VAR compensator, or a static synchronous series compensator. Series compensation can be thought of as an inductor connected to the circuit in series if it is supplying inductance to the circuit.

==Campbell equation==
The Campbell equation is a relationship due to George Ashley Campbell for predicting the propagation constant of a loaded line. It is stated as;

:formula_1

where,

:formula_2 is the propagation constant of the unloaded line
:formula_3 is the propagation constant of the loaded line
:formula_4 is the interval between coils on the loaded line
:formula_5 is the impedance of a loading coil and
:formula_6 is the characteristic impedance of the unloaded line.

A more engineer friendly rule of thumb is that the approximate requirement for spacing loading coils is ten coils per wavelength of the maximum frequency being transmitted. This approximation can be arrived at by treating the loaded line as a constant k filter and applying image filter theory to it. From basic image filter theory the angular cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of a low-pass constant k filter are given by;

:formula_7  and,  formula_8

where formula_9 and formula_10 are the half section element values.

From these basic equations the necessary loading coil inductance and coil spacing can be found;

:formula_11  and,  formula_12

where C is the capacitance per unit length of the line.

Expressing this in terms of number of coils per cutoff wavelength yields;

:formula_13

where &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of propagation of the cable in question.

Since formula_14 then

:formula_15.

Campbell arrived at this expression by analogy with a mechanical line periodically loaded with weights described by Charles Godfrey in 1898 who obtained a similar result. Mechanical loaded lines of this sort were first studied by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813).

The phenomenon of cutoff whereby frequencies above the cutoff frequency are not transmitted is an undesirable side effect of loading coils (although it proved highly useful in the development of filters). Cutoff is avoided by the use of continuous loading since it arises from the lumped nature of the loading coils.

==History==

===Oliver Heaviside===

The origin of the loading coil can be found in the work of Oliver Heaviside on the theory of transmission lines. Heaviside (1881) represented the line as a network of infinitesimally small circuit elements. By applying his operational calculus to the analysis of this network he discovered (1887) what has become known as the Heaviside condition. This is the condition that must be fulfilled in order for a transmission line to be free from distortion. The Heaviside condition is that the series impedance, Z, must be proportional to the shunt admittance, Y, at all frequencies. In terms of the primary line coefficients the condition is:

:formula_16

where:

:formula_17 is the series resistance of the line per unit length
:formula_18 is the series self-inductance of the line per unit length
:formula_19 is the shunt leakage conductance of the line insulator per unit length
:formula_20 is the shunt capacitance between the line conductors per unit length

Heaviside was aware that this condition was not met in the practical telegraph cables in use in his day. In general, a real cable would have,

:formula_21

This is mainly due to the low value of leakage through the cable insulator, which is even more pronounced in modern cables which have better insulators than in Heaviside&#x27;s day. In order to meet the condition, the choices are therefore to try to increase G or L or to decrease R or C. Decreasing R requires larger conductors. Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and this is the very best conductor available short of using silver. Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable. Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper). Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the signal loss. Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.

Heaviside immediately (1887) proposed several methods of increasing the inductance, including spacing the conductors further apart and loading the insulator with iron dust. Finally, Heaviside made the proposal (1893) to use discrete inductors at intervals along the line. However, he never succeeded in persuading the British GPO to take up the idea. Brittain attributes this to Heaviside&#x27;s failure to provide engineering details on the size and spacing of the coils for particular cable parameters. Heaviside&#x27;s eccentric character and setting himself apart from the establishment may also have played a part in their ignoring of him.

===John Stone===
John S. Stone worked for the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and was the first to attempt to apply Heaviside&#x27;s ideas to real telecommunications. Stone&#x27;s idea (1896) was to use a bimetallic iron-copper cable which he had patented. This cable of Stone&#x27;s would increase the line inductance due to the iron content and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition. However, Stone left the company in 1899 and the idea was never implemented. Stone&#x27;s cable was an example of continuous loading, a principle that was eventually put into practice in other forms, see for instance Krarup cable later in this article.

===George Campbell===
George Campbell was another AT&amp;T engineer working in their Boston facility. Campbell was tasked with continuing the investigation into Stone&#x27;s bimetallic cable, but soon abandoned it in favour of the loading coil. His was an independent discovery: Campbell was aware of Heaviside&#x27;s work in discovering the Heaviside condition, but unaware of Heaviside&#x27;s suggestion of using loading coils to enable a line to meet it. The motivation for the change of direction was Campbell&#x27;s limited budget.

Campbell was struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone&#x27;s distributed line. When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant. The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.

Campbell&#x27;s work on loading coils provided the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which proved to be so important for frequency-division multiplexing. The cut-off phenomena of loading coils, an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.

===Michael Pupin===

Michael Pupin, inventor and Serbian immigrant to the US, also played a part in the story of loading coils. Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell&#x27;s. This patent of Pupin&#x27;s dates from 1899. There is an earlier patent (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin&#x27;s loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different. The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894, although there is nothing from him published at that time.

Pupin&#x27;s 1894 patent &quot;loads&quot; the line with capacitors rather than inductors, a scheme that has been criticised as being theoretically flawed and never put into practice. To add to the confusion, one variant of the capacitor scheme proposed by Pupin does indeed have coils. However, these are not intended to compensate the line in any way. They are there merely to restore DC continuity to the line so that it may be tested with standard equipment. Pupin states that the inductance is to be so large that it blocks all AC signals above 50 Hz. Consequently, only the capacitor is adding any significant impedance to the line and &quot;the coils will not exercise any material influence on the results before noted&quot;.
===Legal battle===
Heaviside never patented his idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his work. Despite the legal disputes surrounding this invention, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils. There also can be little doubt that Heaviside was the first to publish and many would dispute Pupin&#x27;s priority.

AT&amp;T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim. Pupin was first to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899). Campbell&#x27;s delay in filing was due to the slow internal machinations of AT&amp;T.

However, AT&amp;T foolishly deleted from Campbell&#x27;s proposed patent application all the tables and graphs detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before the patent was submitted. Since Pupin&#x27;s patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT&amp;T was open to claims of incomplete disclosure. Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared unpatentable due to Heaviside&#x27;s prior publication, they decided to desist from the challenge and buy an option on Pupin&#x27;s patent for a yearly fee so that AT&amp;T would control both patents. By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 ($13 million in 2011) and by 1917, when the AT&amp;T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000 ($25 million in 2011).

===Benefit to AT&amp;T===
The invention was of enormous value to AT&amp;T. Telephone cables could now be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the same distance. When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey alone. It has been estimated that AT&amp;T saved $100 million in the first quarter of the 20th century. Heaviside, who began it all, came away with nothing. He was offered a token payment but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work. He remarked ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would &quot;interfere ... with the flow of dollars in the proper direction ...&quot;.

==Submarine cables==
Signal distortion is a particular problem for submarine communication cables, partly because their great length allows more distortion to build up, but also because they are more susceptible to distortion than open wires on poles due to the characteristics of the insulating material. Different wavelengths of the signal travel at different velocities in the material causing dispersion. It was this problem on the first transatlantic telegraph cable that motivated Heaviside to study the problem and find the solution. Loading coils solve the dispersion problem, and the first use of them on a submarine cable was in 1906 by Siemens and Halske in a cable across Lake Constance.

There are a number of difficulties using loading coils with heavy submarine cables. The bulge of the loading coils could not easily pass through the cable laying apparatus of cable ships and the ship had to slow down during the laying of a loading coil. Discontinuities where the coils were installed caused stresses in the cable during laying. Without great care, the cable might part and would be difficult to repair. A further problem was that the material science of the time had difficulties sealing the joint between coil and cable against ingress of seawater. When this occurred the cable was ruined. Continuous loading was developed to overcome these problems, which also has the benefit of not having a cutoff frequency.

===Krarup cable===
A Danish engineer, Carl Emil Krarup, invented a form of continuously loaded cable which solved the problems of discrete loading coils. Krarup cable has iron wires continuously wound around the central copper conductor with adjacent turns in contact with each other. This cable was the first use of continuous loading on any telecommunication cable. In 1902, Krarup both wrote his paper on this subject and saw the installation of the first cable between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden).

===Permalloy cable===

Even though the Krarup cable added inductance to the line, this was insufficient to meet the Heaviside condition. AT&amp;T searched for a better material with higher magnetic permeability. In 1914, Gustav Elmen discovered permalloy, a magnetic nickel-iron annealed alloy. In c. 1915, Oliver E. Buckley, H. D. Arnold, and Elmen, all at Bell Labs, greatly improved transmission speeds by suggesting a method of constructing submarine communications cable using permalloy tape wrapped around the copper conductors.

The cable was tested in a trial in Bermuda in 1923. The first permalloy cable placed in service connected New York City and Horta (Azores) in September 1924. Permalloy cable enabled signalling speed on submarine telegraph cables to be increased to 400 words/min at a time when 40 words/min was considered good. The first transatlantic cable achieved only two words/min.

===Mu-metal cable===

Mu-metal has similar magnetic properties to permalloy but the addition of copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal to be drawn into wire. Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor in much the same way as the iron wire in Krarup cable. A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.

Mu-metal was invented in 1923 by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, London, who made the cable, initially, for the Western Union Telegraph Co. Western Union were in competition with AT&amp;T and the Western Electric Company who were using permalloy. The patent for permalloy was held by Western Electric which prevented Western Union from using it.
===Patch loading===
Continuous loading of cables is expensive and hence is only done when absolutely necessary. Lumped loading with coils is cheaper but has the disadvantages of difficult seals and a definite cutoff frequency. A compromise scheme is patch loading whereby the cable is continuously loaded in repeated sections. The intervening sections are left unloaded.

===Current practice===
Loaded cable is no longer a useful technology for submarine communication cables, having first been superseded by co-axial cable using electrically powered in-line repeaters and then by fibre-optic cable. Manufacture of loaded cable declined in the 1930s and was then superseded by other technologies post-World War II. Loading coils can still be found in some telephone landlines today but new installations use more modern technology.

<text>Local access and transport area (LATA) is a term used in U.S. telecommunications regulation. It represents a geographical area of the United States under the terms of the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Civil Action number 82-0192 or any other geographic area designated as a LATA in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No. 4. that precipitated the breakup of the original AT&amp;T into the &quot;Baby Bells&quot; or created since that time for wireline regulation.

Generally, a LATA represents an area within which a divested Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) is permitted to offer exchange telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.

LATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily along existing state or area code borders. Some LATAs cross over state boundaries, such as those for the New York metropolitan area and Greenwich, Connecticut; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and areas between Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Area codes and LATAs do not necessarily share boundaries; many LATAs exist in multiple area codes, and many area codes exist in multiple LATAs.

Originally, the LATAs were grouped into regions within which one particular RBOC was allowed to provide services. The LATAs in each of these regions are numbered beginning with the same digit. Generally, the LATAs were associated with carriers or other indications in the following manner:

In addition to this list, two local carriers were made independent: Cincinnati Bell in the Cincinnati area, and SNET (a former unit of AT&amp;T, sold to Frontier) in Connecticut. These were assigned LATAs in the 9xx range.

Since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, however, some amount of deregulation, as well as a number of phone company mergers, have blurred the significance of these regions. A number of new LATAs have been formed within these regions since their inception, most beginning with the digit 9.

LATAs contribute to an often confusing aspect of long-distance telephone service. Due to the various and overlapping regulatory limitations and inter-business arrangements, phone companies typically provide differing types of “long distance” service, each with potentially different rates:
* within same LATA, within same state
* within same LATA, between different states
* between different LATAs, within same state
* between different LATAs, between different states
Given the complexity of the legal and financial issues involved in each distinction, many long-distance companies tend to not explain the details of these different rates, which can lead to billing questions from surprised customers.

Local carriers have various alternative terms for LATAs such as “Service Area” by Pacific Bell in California, or “Regional Calling Area” by Verizon in Maryland.

To facilitate the sharing of Telcordia telephone routing databases between countries, LATAs were later defined for the provinces of Canada, the other countries and territories of the North American Numbering Plan, and Mexico. Aside from U.S. territories, LATAs have no regulatory purpose in these areas. In 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission eliminated all Canadian provincial LATAs in favor of a single LATA for Canada (888).

No LATAs exist with a second digit of 0 or 1, which distinguished them from traditional area codes.
==List of LATAs==

===US state LATAs===
The city or place name given with some LATAs is the name given to identify the LATA, not the limit of its boundary. Generally this is the most significant metropolitan area in the LATA. In some cases, a LATA is named after the largest phone exchange in the LATA that was historically served by an RBOC. For example, the largest city in the Pahrump LATA in Nevada is Las Vegas. Since Las Vegas was not historically served by an RBOC, the LATA is named after the smaller town of Pahrump, which was historically served by Nevada Bell (now AT&amp;T Inc.). Also, listing under a state does not necessarily limit the LATA&#x27;s territory to that state; there may be overlaps as well as enclaves. Areas that include notable portions of other states are explained, but not all LATA state overlaps may be detailed.

LATA boundaries are not always solidly defined. Inter-carrier agreements, change proposals to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and new wiring developments into rural areas can and do often alter the effective borders between LATAs. Many sources on LATA boundary information conflict with each other at detailed levels. Telcordia data may provide the most up-to-date details of LATA inclusions.

===U.S. territory LATAs===

*American Samoa - 884
*Guam - 871
*Northern Mariana Islands - 870
*Puerto Rico - 820
*U.S. Virgin Islands - 822
*Wake Island - 836

===Non-U.S. LATAs (non-regulatory)===

*Mexico - 838
*Bahamas - 824
*Jamaica - 826
*Dominican Republic - 828
*Other Caribbean - 830
*Canada - 888

== Canada ==
As LATAs exist for US regulatory purposes, where they serve as a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T), they have no legal significance in Canada.

As of 2000, all of Canada (except for non-geographic numbers) is identified as LATA 888.

The use of this LATA set to identify individual provinces is therefore deprecated:
*Alberta - 881, 884
*British Columbia - 886
*Manitoba - 888
*New Brunswick - 890
*Newfoundland - 885
*Nova Scotia/P.E.I. - 887, 889
*Ontario - 851
*Quebec - 850, 883
*Saskatchewan - 891
*Yukon Territory - 892

===Local interconnection region===
Canada does define local interconnection regions (LIR&#x27;s), which determine where points of interconnection (POI) must be provided by competing local exchange and mobile carriers to provide local number portability. A Canadian LIR is geographically smaller than a US LATA, typically comparable in size to a small city&#x27;s flat-rate local calling area or to an entire large regional municipality. In areas where a small-city Digital Multiplex System controls a group of remote switching centres, one for each surrounding village, the local interconnect region normally includes each exchange in the city plus all downstream remotes of those exchanges. In a Toronto-sized city, the LIR will include only the city itself.

While the LIRs resemble local calling areas in geographic size, there are some key differences:
* LIR&#x27;s normally do not include incumbent local independent telephone company exchanges in locations not opened to competition, where the independent numbers are currently not portable.
* LIR&#x27;s do not cross provincial boundaries. Lloydminster has an LIR for each province, as does Ottawa-Hull.
* LIR&#x27;s closely follow network topology, which often does not match a local flat-rate calling area as local calling is defined by arbitrary regulatory constructs.

One example: The tiny unincorporated village of Beebe Plain, divided by the Quebec-Vermont border, is served by +1-819-876 Rock Island, Quebec, Canada (a remote station controlled from Magog) and +1-802-873 Derby Line, Vermont, USA (a remote station controlled from St. Johnsbury). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to Sherbrooke, US subscribers can locally call Newport and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog&#x27;s LIR, not Sherbrooke&#x27;s LIR.

<text>In telephony, the term local call has the following meanings:

# Any call using a single switching center; that is, not traveling to another telephone network;
# A call made within a local calling area as defined by the local exchange carrier;
# Any call for which an additional charge, &quot;i.e.&quot;, toll charge, is not billed to the calling or called party, or (depending on the country) for which this charge is reduced because it is a short-distance call (e.g. within a town or local metropolitan area).

Typically, local calls have shorter numbers than long-distance calls, as the area code may not be required. However, this is not true in parts of the United States and Canada that are subject to overlay plans or many countries in Europe that require closed dialing plans.

Toll free (e.g. &quot;800&quot; numbers in the United States) are not necessarily local calls; despite being free to the caller, any charge due for the distance of the connection is charged to the &quot;called&quot; party.

Commercial users who make or accept many long-distance calls to or from a particular distant place may make them as local calls by use of a foreign exchange service. Such an &quot;FX&quot; line also allows people in the distant place to call by using a telephone number local to them.

<text>A log-periodic antenna (LP), also known as a log-periodic array or log-periodic aerial, is a multi-element, directional antenna designed to operate over a wide band of frequencies. It was invented by John Dunlavy in 1952.

The most common form of log-periodic antenna is the log-periodic dipole array or LPDA, The LPDA consists of a number of half-wave dipole driven elements of gradually increasing length, each consisting of a pair of metal rods. The dipoles are mounted close together in a line, connected in parallel to the feedline with alternating phase. Electrically, it simulates a series of two- or three-element Yagi–Uda antennas connected together, each set tuned to a different frequency.

LPDA antennas look somewhat similar to Yagi antennas, in that they both consist of dipole rod elements mounted in a line along a support boom, but they work in very different ways. Adding elements to a Yagi increases its directionality, or gain, while adding elements to an LPDA increases its frequency response, or bandwidth. 

One large application for LPDAs is in rooftop terrestrial television antennas, since they must have large bandwidth to cover the wide television bands of roughly 54–88 and 174–216 MHz in the VHF and 470–890 MHz in the UHF while also having high gain for adequate fringe reception. One widely used design for television reception combined a Yagi for UHF reception in front of a larger LPDA for VHF.

== Basic concept ==

The LPDA normally consists of a series of half wave dipole &quot;elements&quot; each consisting of a pair of metal rods, positioned along a support boom lying along the antenna axis. The elements are spaced at intervals following a logarithmic function of the frequency, known as &quot;d&quot; or &quot;sigma&quot;. The length of the successive elements and the spacing between them gradually decrease along the boom. The relationship between the lengths is a function known as &quot;tau&quot;. &quot;Sigma&quot; and &quot;tau&quot; are the key design elements of the LPDA design. The radiation pattern of the antenna is unidirectional, with the main lobe along the axis of the boom, off the end with the shortest elements. Each dipole element is resonant at a wavelength approximately equal to twice its length. The bandwidth of the antenna, the frequency range over which it has near-maximum gain, is approximately between the resonant frequencies of the longest and shortest elements.

Every element in the LPDA antenna is a driven element, that is, connected electrically to the feedline. A parallel wire transmission line usually runs along the central boom, and each successive element is connected in &quot;opposite&quot; phase to it. The feedline can often be seen zig-zagging across the support boom holding the elements. Another common construction method is to use two parallel central support booms that also acts as the transmission line, mounting the dipoles on the alternate booms. Other forms of the log-periodic design replace the dipoles with the transmission line itself, forming the log-periodic zig-zag antenna. Many other forms using the transmission wire as the active element also exist.

The Yagi and the LPDA designs look very similar at first glance, as they both consist of a number of dipole elements mounted along a support boom. The Yagi, however, has only a single driven element connected to the transmission line, usually the second one from the back of the array, the remaining elements are parasitic. The Yagi antenna differs from the LPDA in having a very narrow bandwidth.

In general terms, at any given frequency the log-periodic design operates somewhat similar to a three-element Yagi antenna; the dipole element closest to resonant at the operating frequency acts as a driven element, with the two adjacent elements on either side as director and reflector to increase the gain, the shorter element in front acting as a director and the longer element behind as a reflector. However, the system is somewhat more complex than that, and all the elements contribute to some degree, so the gain for any given frequency is higher than a Yagi of the same dimensions as any one section of the log-periodic. However, a Yagi with the same number of elements as a log-periodic would have &quot;far&quot; higher gain, as all of those elements are improving the gain of a single driven element. In its use as a television antenna, it was common to combine a log-periodic design for VHF with a Yagi for UHF, with both halves being roughly equal in size. This resulted in much higher gain for UHF, typically on the order of 10 to 14 dB on the Yagi side and 6.5 dB for the log-periodic. But this extra gain was needed anyway in order to make up for a number of problems with UHF signals.

The log-periodic shape, according to the IEEE definition, does not align with broadband property for antennas. The broadband property of log-periodic antennas comes from its self-similarity. A planar log-periodic antenna can also be made self-complementary, such as logarithmic spiral antennas (which are not classified as log-periodic &quot;per se&quot; but among the frequency independent antennas that are also self-similar) or the log-periodic toothed design. Y. Mushiake found, for what he termed &quot;the simplest self-complementary planar antenna,&quot; a driving point impedance of η0/2=188.4 Ω at frequencies well within its bandwidth limits.
== History ==
John Dunlavy invented the log-periodic antenna in 1952 while working for the United States Air Force but was not credited with it due to its &quot;Secret&quot; classification. The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign had patented the Isbell and Mayes–Carrel antennas and licensed the design as a package exclusively to JFD Electronics in New York. Channel Master and Blonder Tongue Labs ignored the patents and produced a wide range of antennas based on that design. Lawsuits regarding the antenna patent, which the U.I. Foundation lost, evolved into the 1971 Blonder-Tongue Doctrine. This precedent governs patent litigation.

== Short wave broadcast antennas ==
The log-periodic is commonly used as a transmitting antenna in high power shortwave broadcasting stations because its broad bandwidth allows a single antenna to transmit on frequencies in multiple bands. The log-periodic zig-zag design with up to 16 sections has been used. These large antennas are typically designed to cover 6 to 26 MHz but even larger ones have been built which operate as low as 2 MHz. Power ratings are available up to 500 kW. Instead of the elements being driven in parallel, attached to a central transmission line, the elements are driven in series, adjacent elements connected at the outer edges. The antenna shown here would have about 14 dBi gain. An antenna array consisting of two such antennas, one above the other and driven in phase has a gain of up to 17 dBi. Being log-periodic, the antenna&#x27;s main characteristics (radiation pattern, gain, driving point impedance) are almost constant over its entire frequency range, with the match to a 300 Ω feed line achieving a standing wave ratio of better than 2:1 over that range.

<text>In telecommunications, the term long-haul communications has the following meanings:

1. In public switched networks, pertaining to circuits that span large distances, such as the circuits in inter-LATA, interstate, and international communications. See also Long line (telecommunications)

2. In the military community, communications among users on a national or worldwide basis.

&quot;Note 1:&quot; Compared to tactical communications, long-haul communications are characterized by (a) higher levels of users, such as the US National Command Authority, (b) more stringent performance requirements, such as higher quality circuits, (c) longer distances between users, including worldwide distances, (d) higher traffic volumes and densities, (e) larger switches and trunk cross sections, and (f) fixed and recoverable assets.

&quot;Note 2:&quot; &quot;Long-haul communications&quot; usually pertains to the U.S. Defense Communications System.

&quot; Note 3:&quot; &quot;Long-haul telecommunications technicians&quot; can be translated into many fields of IT work within the corporate industry (Information Technology, Network Technician, Telecommunication Specialist, It Support, and so on). While the term is used in military most career fields that are in communications such as 3D1X2 - Cyber Transport Systems (the career field has been renamed so many times over the course of many years but essentially it is the same job (Network Infrastructure Tech., Systems Control Technician, and Cyber Transport Systems)) or may work in areas that require the &quot;in between&quot; (cloud networking) for networks (MSPP, ATM, Routers, Switches), phones (VOIP, DS0 - DS4 or higher, and so on), encryption (configuring encryption devices or monitoring), and video support data transfers. The &quot;bulk data transfer&quot; or aggregation networking.

The Long-haul telecommunication technicians is considered a &quot;jack of all&quot; but it is much in the technician&#x27;s interest to gather greater education with certifications to qualify for certain jobs outside the military. The Military provides an avenue but does not make the individual a master of the career field. The technician will find that the job out look outside of military requires many things that aren&#x27;t required of them within the career field while in the military. So it is best to find the job that is similar to the AFSC and also view the companies description of the qualification to fit that job. Also at least get an associate degree, over 5 years experience, and all of the required &quot;certs&quot; (Network +, Security +, CCNA, CCNP and so on) to acquire the job or at least an interview. The best time to apply or get a guaranteed job is the last three months before you leave the military. Military personnel that are within the career field 3D1X2 require a Secret, TS, or TS with SCI clearance in order to do the job.

<doc id="41334" wikidata="Q1502482" url="?curid=41334" title="Longitudinal redundancy check">
<text>In telecommunication, a longitudinal redundancy check (LRC), or horizontal redundancy check, is a form of redundancy check that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams. The data must be divided into transmission blocks, to which the additional check data is added.

The term usually applies to a single parity bit per bit stream, calculated independently of all the other bit streams (BIP-8).

This &quot;extra&quot; LRC word at the end of a block of data is very similar to checksum and cyclic redundancy check (CRC).

== Optimal rectangular code ==
While simple longitudinal parity can only detect errors, it can be combined with additional error-control coding, such as a transverse redundancy check (TRC), to correct errors. The transverse redundancy check is stored on a dedicated &quot;parity track&quot;.

Whenever any single-bit error occurs in a transmission block of data, such two-dimensional parity checking, or &quot;two-coordinate parity checking&quot;,
enables the receiver to use the TRC to detect which byte the error occurred in, and the LRC to detect exactly which track the error occurred in, to discover exactly which bit is in error, and then correct that bit by flipping it.

== Pseudocode ==

International standard ISO 1155 states that a longitudinal redundancy check for a sequence of bytes may be computed in software by the following algorithm:

 &quot;lrc&quot; := 0
 for each byte &quot;b&quot; in the buffer do
 &quot;lrc&quot; := (&quot;lrc&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) and 0xFF
 &quot;lrc&quot; := (((&quot;lrc&quot; XOR 0xFF) + 1) and 0xFF)

which can be expressed as &quot;the 8-bit two&#x27;s-complement value of the sum of all bytes modulo 28&quot; (codice_1 is equivalent to codice_2).

== Other forms ==

Many protocols use an XOR-based longitudinal redundancy check byte (often called block check character or BCC), including the serial line interface protocol (SLIP, not to be confused with the later and well-known Serial Line Internet Protocol),
the IEC 62056-21 standard for electrical-meter reading, smart cards as defined in ISO/IEC 7816, and the ACCESS.bus protocol.

An 8-bit LRC such as this is equivalent to a cyclic redundancy check using the polynomial &quot;x&quot;8 + 1, but the independence of the bit streams is less clear when looked at in that way.

<text>In electronics and control system theory, loop gain is the sum of the gain, expressed as a ratio or in decibels, around a feedback loop. Feedback loops are widely used in electronics in amplifiers and oscillators, and more generally in both electronic and nonelectronic industrial control systems to control industrial plant and equipment. The concept is also used in biology. In a feedback loop, the output of a device, process or plant is sampled and applied to alter the input, to better control the output. The loop gain, along with the related concept of loop phase shift, determines the behavior of the device, and particularly whether the output is stable, or unstable, which can result in oscillation. The importance of loop gain as a parameter for characterizing electronic feedback amplifiers was first recognized by Heinrich Barkhausen in 1921, and was developed further by Hendrik Wade Bode and Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs in the 1930s.
A block diagram of an electronic amplifier with negative feedback is shown at right. The input signal is applied to the amplifier with open-loop gain &quot;A&quot; and amplified. The output of the amplifier is applied to a feedback network with gain &quot;β&quot;, and subtracted from the input to the amplifier. The loop gain is calculated by imagining the feedback loop is broken at some point, and calculating the net gain if a signal is applied. In the diagram shown, the loop gain is the product of the gains of the amplifier and the feedback network, &quot;−Aβ&quot;. The minus sign is because the feedback signal is subtracted from the input. 

The gains &quot;A&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, and therefore the loop gain, generally vary with the frequency of the input signal, and so are usually expressed as functions of the angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; in radians per second. It is often displayed as a graph with the horizontal axis frequency &quot;ω&quot; and the vertical axis gain. In amplifiers, the loop gain is the difference between the open-loop gain curve and the closed-loop gain curve (actually, the 1/β curve) on a dB scale.

<doc id="41340" wikidata="Q13033691" url="?curid=41340" title="LPD433">
<text>LPD433 (low power device 433 MHz) is a UHF band in which license free communication devices are allowed to operate in some regions. The frequencies correspond with the ITU region 1 ISM band of 433.050 MHz to 434.790 MHz. The frequencies used are within the 70-centimeter band, which is currently otherwise reserved for government and amateur radio operations in the United States and most nations worldwide.

LPD hand-held radios are authorized for licence-free voice communications use in most of Europe using analog frequency modulation (FM) as part of short range device regulations, with 25 kHz channel spacing, for a total of 69 channels. In some countries, LPD devices may only be used with an integral and non-removable antenna with a maximum legal power output of 10 mW.

Voice communication in the LPD band was introduced to reduce the burden on the eight (now sixteen) PMR446 channels over shorter ranges (less than 1 km).

LPD is also used in vehicle key-less entry device, garage or gate openers and some outdoor home weather station products.

==Usage by country==

===ITU Region 1 (Europe)===

====United Kingdom====

In the UK, LPD433 equipment that meets the respective Ofcom Interface Requirement can be used for model control, analogue/digitised voice and remote keyless entry systems. There is significant scope for interference however, both on frequency and on adjacent frequencies, as the band is far from free. The frequencies from 430 to 440 MHz are allocated on a secondary basis to licensed radio amateurs who are allowed to use up to 40 W (16 dBW) between 430 and 432 MHz and 400 W (26 dBW) between 432 and 440 MHz. Channels 1 to 14 are UK amateur repeater outputs and channels 62 to 69 are UK amateur repeater inputs. This band is shared on a secondary basis for both licensed and licence exempt users, with the primary user being the Ministry of Defence.

Ofcom, together with the RSGB Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee have produced guidelines to help mitigate the side effects of interference to an extent.

====Switzerland====

Switzerland permits the use of all 69 LPD433 channels with a maximum power output of 10 mW.

====Spain====

According to a recently published (June 2021) resolution of the Spanish government, where it defines &#x27;interface IR-266&#x27;, non-specific mobile short-range devices may be used without authorization for voice applications with &#x27;advanced mitigation techniques&#x27; (such as listening before talking) from 434.040 to 434.790 MHz, with channels narrower than 25 kHz and with a maximum &#x27;apparent radiated power&#x27; of 10 mW. This would make the use of LPD433 channels 40 to 69 possible in Spain.

====Other European countries====

European remote keyless entry systems often use the 433 MHz band, although, as in all of Europe, these frequencies are within the 70-centimeter band allocated to amateur radio, and interference results. In Germany, before the end of 2008, radio control enthusiasts were able to use frequencies from channel 03 through 67 for radio control of any form of model (air or ground-based), all with odd channel numbers (03, 05, etc. up to ch. 67), with each sanctioned frequency having 50 kHz of bandwidth separation between each adjacent channel.

===ITU Region 2 (America)===

In ITU region 2 (the Americas), the frequencies that LPD433 uses are also within the 70-centimeter band allocated to amateur radio. In the United States LPD433 radios can only be used under FCC amateur regulations by properly licensed amateur radio operators.

===ITU Region 3===

====Malaysia====

In Malaysia, this band is also within the 70-centimeter band (430.000 – 440.000 MHz) allocated to amateur radio. Class B amateur radio holders are permitted to transmit up to 50 watts PEP power level. There is no licence requirement for LPD as long as it complies with requirement regulated by Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC). As regulated by MCMC in Technical Code for Short Range Devices, remote control and security device are allowed up to 50 mW ERP and up to 100 mW ERP for Short Range Communication (SRC) devices. RFID are allowed up to 100 mW EIRP.

<text>In communications and computing, a machine-readable medium (or computer-readable medium) is a medium capable of storing data in a format easily readable by a digital computer or a sensor. 
It contrasts with &quot;human-readable&quot; medium and data.

The result is called machine-readable data or computer-readable data, and the data itself can be described as having machine-readability.

==Data==
Machine-readable data must be structured data.

Attempts to create machine-readable data occurred as early as the 1960s. At the same time that seminal developments in machine-reading and natural-language processing were releasing (like Weizenbaum&#x27;s ELIZA), people were anticipating the success of machine-readable functionality and attempting to create machine-readable documents. One such example was musicologist Nancy B. Reich&#x27;s creation of a machine-readable catalog of composer William Jay Sydeman&#x27;s works in 1966.

In the United States, the OPEN Government Data Act of 14 January 2019 defines machine-readable data as &quot;data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.&quot; The law directs U.S. federal agencies to publish public data in such a manner, ensuring that &quot;any public data asset of the agency is machine-readable&quot;.

Machine-readable data may be classified into two groups: human-readable data that is marked up so that it can also be read by machines (e.g. microformats, RDFa, HTML), and data file formats intended principally for processing by machines (CSV, RDF, XML, JSON). These formats are only machine readable if the data contained within them is formally structured; exporting a CSV file from a badly structured spreadsheet does not meet the definition.

&quot;Machine readable&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;digitally accessible&quot;. A digitally accessible document may be online, making it easier for humans to access via computers, but its content is much harder to extract, transform, and process via computer programming logic if it is not machine-readable. 

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is designed to be both human- and machine-readable, and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) is used to improve the presentation of the data for human readability. For example, XSLT can be used to automatically render XML in Portable Document Format (PDF). Machine-readable data can be automatically transformed for human-readability but, generally speaking, the reverse is not true.

For purposes of implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines &quot;machine readable format&quot; as follows: &quot;Format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a web browser or computer system. (e.g.; xml). Traditional word processing documents and portable document format (PDF) files are easily read by humans but typically are difficult for machines to interpret. Other formats such as extensible markup language (XML), (JSON), or spreadsheets with header columns that can be exported as comma separated values (CSV) are machine readable formats. As HTML is a structural markup language, discreetly labeling parts of the document, computers are able to gather document components to assemble tables of contents, outlines, literature search bibliographies, etc. It is possible to make traditional word processing documents and other formats machine readable but the documents must include enhanced structural elements.&quot;

==Media==
Examples of machine-readable media include magnetic media such as magnetic disks, cards, tapes, and drums, punched cards and paper tapes, optical discs, barcodes and magnetic ink characters.

Common machine-readable technologies include magnetic recording, processing waveforms, and barcodes. Optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to enable machines to read information available to humans. Any information retrievable by any form of energy can be machine-readable.

Examples include:

*Acoustics
*Chemical
**Photochemical
*Electrical
**Semiconductor used in volatile RAM microchips
**Floating-gate transistor used in non-volatile memory cards
**Radio transmission
*Magnetic storage
*Mechanical
** Tins And Swins
*** Punched card
*** Paper tape

<text>In telecommunications, magneto-ionic double refraction is the combined effect of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and atmospheric ionization, whereby a linearly polarized wave entering the ionosphere is split into two components called the ordinary wave and extraordinary wave.

The component waves follow different paths, experience different attenuations, have different phase velocities, and, in general, are elliptically polarized in opposite senses. The critical frequency of the extraordinary wave is always greater than the critical frequency of the ordinary wave (i.e. the wave in absence of the magnetic field) by the amount approximately equal to .5 times of gyro frequency . The amplitude of extraordinary wave is dependent on the earth magnetic field at that particular point . Beside splitting, the polarization of the incident radio wave is also effected by this phenomenon because the electron that were earlier in simple harmonic motion only are now in spiral motion too due to the magnetic field.

<doc id="41343" wikidata="Q2744368" url="?curid=41343" title="Magneto-optic effect">
<text>A magneto-optic effect is any one of a number of phenomena in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through a medium that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field. In such a medium, which is also called gyrotropic or gyromagnetic, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds, leading to a number of important phenomena. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the plane of polarization can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of reflection from a magneto-optic material are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not to be confused with the nonlinear Kerr effect).

In general, magneto-optic effects break time reversal symmetry locally (i.e., when only the propagation of light, and not the source of the magnetic field, is considered) as well as Lorentz reciprocity, which is a necessary condition to construct devices such as optical isolators (through which light passes in one direction but not the other).

Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations, corresponding to complex-conjugate ε tensors for lossless media, are called optical isomers.

==Gyrotropic permittivity==

In particular, in a magneto-optic material the presence of a magnetic field (either externally applied or because the material itself is ferromagnetic) can cause a change in the permittivity tensor ε of the material. The ε becomes anisotropic, a 3×3 matrix, with complex off-diagonal components, depending on the frequency ω of incident light. If the absorption losses can be neglected, ε is a Hermitian matrix. The resulting principal axes become complex as well, corresponding to elliptically-polarized light where left- and right-rotating polarizations can travel at different speeds (analogous to birefringence).

More specifically, for the case where absorption losses can be neglected, the most general form of Hermitian ε is:

:formula_1

or equivalently the relationship between the displacement field D and the electric field E is:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is a real symmetric matrix and formula_4 is a real pseudovector called the gyration vector, whose magnitude is generally small compared to the eigenvalues of formula_3. The direction of g is called the axis of gyration of the material. To first order, g is proportional to the applied magnetic field:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the magneto-optical susceptibility (a scalar in isotropic media, but more generally a tensor). If this susceptibility itself depends upon the electric field, one can obtain a nonlinear optical effect of magneto-optical parametric generation (somewhat analogous to a Pockels effect whose strength is controlled by the applied magnetic field).

The simplest case to analyze is the one in which g is a principal axis (eigenvector) of formula_3, and the other two eigenvalues of formula_3 are identical. Then, if we let g lie in the &quot;z&quot; direction for simplicity, the ε tensor simplifies to the form:

:formula_10

Most commonly, one considers light propagating in the &quot;z&quot; direction (parallel to g). In this case the solutions are elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves with phase velocities formula_11 (where μ is the magnetic permeability). This difference in phase velocities leads to the Faraday effect.

For light propagating purely perpendicular to the axis of gyration, the properties are known as the Cotton-Mouton effect and used for a Circulator.

===Kerr rotation and Kerr ellipticity===
Kerr rotation and Kerr ellipticity are changes in the polarization of incident light which comes in contact with a gyromagnetic material. Kerr rotation is a rotation in the plane of polarization of transmitted light, and Kerr ellipticity is the ratio of the major to minor axis of the ellipse traced out by elliptically polarized light on the plane through which it propagates. Changes in the orientation of polarized incident light can be quantified using these two properties.
According to classical physics, the speed of light varies with the permittivity of a material:

formula_12

where formula_13 is the velocity of light through the material, formula_14 is the material permittivity, and formula_15 is the material permeability. Because the permittivity is anisotropic, polarized light of different orientations will travel at different speeds.

This can be better understood if we consider a wave of light that is circularly polarized (seen to the right). If this wave interacts with a material at which the horizontal component (green sinusoid) travels at a different speed than the vertical component (blue sinusoid), the two components will fall out of the 90 degree phase difference (required for circular polarization) changing the Kerr ellipticity.

A change in Kerr rotation is most easily recognized in linearly polarized light, which can be separated into two circularly polarized components: Left-handed circular polarized (LHCP) light and right-handed circular polarized (RHCP) light. The anisotropy of the magneto-optic material permittivity causes a difference in the speed of LHCP and RHCP light, which will cause a change in the angle of polarized light. Materials that exhibit this property are known as birefringent.

From this rotation, we can calculate the difference in orthogonal velocity components, find the anisotropic permittivity, find the gyration vector, and calculate the applied magnetic field formula_16.

<text>In telephony, a main distribution frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant).

==Overview==
The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk main distribution frame (TMDF).

Like other distribution frames the MDF provides flexibility in assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a patch panel.

The most common kind of large MDF is a long steel rack accessible from both sides. On one side, termination blocks are arranged horizontally at the front of rack shelves. Jumpers lie on the shelves and go through an insulated steel hoop to run vertically to other termination blocks that are arranged vertically. There is a hoop or ring at the intersection of each level and each vertical. Installing a jumper historically required two workers, one on either side of the MDF. The shelves are shallow enough to allow the rings to be within arm&#x27;s reach, but the workers prefer to hang the jumper on a hook on a pole so their partner can pull it through the ring. A fanning strip at the back of each termination block prevents the wires from covering each other&#x27;s terminals. With disciplined administration, the MDF can hold over a hundred thousand jumpers, with dozens changed every day, for decades without tangling.

The MDF usually holds telephone exchange protective devices including heat coils, and functions as a test point between a line and the exchange equipment.

== History ==

Before 1960, MDF jumpers were generally soldered. This was reliable but slow and expensive. Wire wrap was introduced in the 1960s, and punch blocks in the 1970s. In the early 21st century most exchanges in the UK, still used soldered blocks but were being slowly phased out.

Each jumper is a twisted pair. Middle 20th century jumper wires in the USA were 24 AWG single strand copper, with a soft polyethylene inner jacket and a cotton wrapper, impregnated to make it slightly brittle and easy to remove neatly. Late 20th century ones had a single, thicker coating of polyethylene cross-linked to provide a suitable degree of brittleness.

Some urban telephone exchange MDFs are two stories high so they do not have to be more than a city block long. A few are three stories. Access to the upper levels can be either by a traveling ladder attached to the MDF, or by mezzanine walkways at a suitable height. By British custom the cables to the outside world are terminated on the horizontal side, and the indoors equipment on the vertical side. American usage is the opposite.

Smaller MDFs, and some modern large ones, are single sided so one worker can install, remove or change a jumper. COSMOS and other computerized Operations Support Systems help by assigning terminals close to one another, so most jumpers need not be long and shelves on either type of MDF do not become congested. This database keeps track of all terminals and jumpers. In the early and middle 20th century these records were kept as pencil entries in ledger books. The later database method saves much labor by permitting old jumpers to be reused for new lines.

The adoption of distributed switching in the late 20th century diminished the need for large, active, central MDFs.

Sometimes the MDF is combined with other kinds of distribution frame in a CDF.

The MDF in a private branch exchange performs functions similar to those performed by the MDF in a central office.

Automated Main Distribution Frame (AMDF) has been a subject of experiments.

<text>In a radio antennas, the main lobe or main beam is the region of the radiation pattern containing the highest power or exhibiting the greatest field strength.

The radiation pattern of most antennas shows a pattern of &quot;&quot;lobes&quot; at various directions, where the radiated signal strength reaches a local maximum, separated by &quot;nulls&quot;, at which the radiation falls to zero. In a directional antenna in which the objective is to emit the radio waves in one direction, the lobe in that direction is designed to have higher field strength than the others, so on a graph of the radiation pattern it appears biggest; this is the main lobe. The other lobes are called &quot;sidelobes&quot;, and usually represent unwanted radiation in undesired directions. The sidelobe in the opposite direction from the main lobe is called the &quot;backlobe&quot;&quot;. 

The radiation pattern referred to above is usually the horizontal radiation pattern, which is plotted as a function of azimuth about the antenna, although the vertical radiation pattern may also have a main lobe. The beamwidth of the antenna is the width of the main lobe, usually specified by the &quot;half power beam width&quot; (HPBW), the angle encompassed between the points on the side of the lobe where the power has fallen to half (-3 dB) of its maximum value.

The concepts of main lobe and sidelobes also apply to acoustics and optics, and are used to describe the radiation pattern of optical systems like telescopes, and acoustic transducers like microphones and loudspeakers.

<text>Maintainability is the ease of maintaining or providing maintenance for a functioning product or service. Depending on the field, it can have slightly different meanings.

== Usage in different fields ==
=== Engineering ===
In engineering, maintainability is the ease with which a product can be maintained to:
* correct defects or their cause,
* Repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts,
* prevent unexpected working conditions,
* maximize a product&#x27;s useful life,
* maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
* meet new requirements,
* make future maintenance easier, or
* cope with a changing environment.

In some cases, maintainability involves a system of continuous improvement - learning from the past to improve the ability to maintain systems, or improve the reliability of systems based on maintenance experience.

=== Telecommunication ===
In telecommunications and several other engineering fields, the term maintainability has the following meanings:

* A characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of time, when the maintenance is performed by prescribed procedures and resources.
* The ease with which maintenance of a functional unit can be performed by prescribed requirements.

=== Software ===
In software engineering, these activities are known as software maintenance (cf. ISO/IEC 9126). Closely related concepts in the software engineering domain are evolvability, modifiability, technical debt, and code smells.

The maintainability index is calculated with certain formulae from lines-of-code measures, McCabe measures and Halstead complexity measures.

The measurement and tracking of maintainability are intended to help reduce or reverse a system&#x27;s tendency toward &quot;code entropy&quot; or degraded integrity, and to indicate when it becomes cheaper and/or less risky to rewrite the code than it is to change it.

<text>In network, a managed object is an abstract representation of network resources that are managed. With &quot;representation&quot;, we mean not only the actual device that is managed but also the device driver, that communicates with the device. An example of a printer as a managed object is the window that shows information about the printer, such as the location, printer status, printing progress, paper choice, and printing margins.

The database, where all managed objects are stored, is called Management Information Base. In contrast with a CI, a managed object is &quot;dynamic&quot; and communicates with other network resources that are managed. 

A managed object may represent a physical entity, a network service, or an abstraction of a resource that exists independently of its use in management.

In telecommunications management, managed object can refer to a resource within the telecommunications environment that may be managed through the use of operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAMP) application protocols.

<doc id="41350" wikidata="Q832147" url="?curid=41350" title="Manchester code">
<text>In telecommunications and data storage, Manchester code (also known as phase encoding, or PE) is a line code in which the encoding of each data bit is either low then high, or high then low, for equal time. It is a self-clocking signal with no DC component. Consequently, electrical connections using a Manchester code are easily galvanically isolated.

Manchester code derives its name from its development at the University of Manchester, where the coding was used for storing data on the magnetic drums of the Manchester Mark 1 computer.

Manchester code was widely used for magnetic recording on 1600 bpi computer tapes before the introduction of 6250 bpi tapes which used the more efficient group-coded recording. Manchester code was used in early Ethernet physical layer standards and is still used in consumer IR protocols, RFID and near-field communication. It was and still is used for uploading commands to the Voyager spacecraft.

== Features ==
Manchester coding is a special case of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), where the data controls the phase of a square wave carrier whose frequency is the data rate. Manchester code ensures frequent line voltage transitions, directly proportional to the clock rate; this helps clock recovery.

The DC component of the encoded signal is not dependent on the data and therefore carries no information. Therefore connections may be inductively or capacitively coupled, allowing the signal to be conveyed conveniently by galvanically isolated media (e.g., Ethernet) using a network isolator—a simple one-to-one pulse transformer which cannot convey a DC component.

=== Limitations ===
Manchester coding&#x27;s data rate is only half that of a non-coded signal, which limits its usefulness to systems where bandwidth is not an issue, such as a local area network (LAN).

Manchester encoding introduces difficult frequency-related problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates.

There are more complex codes, such as 8B/10B encoding, that use less bandwidth to achieve the same data rate but may be less tolerant of frequency errors and jitter in the transmitter and receiver reference clocks.

==Encoding and decoding==
Manchester code always has a transition at the middle of each bit period and may (depending on the information to be transmitted) have a transition at the start of the period also. The direction of the mid-bit transition indicates the data. Transitions at the period boundaries do not carry information. They exist only to place the signal in the correct state to allow the mid-bit transition.

===Conventions for representation of data===
There are two opposing conventions for the representations of data.

The first of these was first published by G. E. Thomas in 1949 and is followed by numerous authors (e.g., Andy Tanenbaum). It specifies that for a 0 bit the signal levels will be low–high (assuming an amplitude physical encoding of the data) – with a low level in the first half of the bit period, and a high level in the second half. For a 1 bit the signal levels will be high–low. This is also known as Manchester II or Biphase-L code.

The second convention is also followed by numerous authors (e.g., William Stallings) as well as by IEEE 802.4 (token bus) and lower speed versions of IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) standards. It states that a logic 0 is represented by a high–low signal sequence and a logic 1 is represented by a low–high signal sequence.

If a Manchester encoded signal is inverted in communication, it is transformed from one convention to the other. This ambiguity can be overcome by using differential Manchester encoding.

===Decoding===
The existence of guaranteed transitions allows the signal to be self-clocking, and also allows the receiver to align correctly; the receiver can identify if it is misaligned by half a bit period, as there will no longer always be a transition during each bit period. The price of these benefits is a doubling of the bandwidth requirement compared to simpler NRZ coding schemes.

===Encoding===
Encoding conventions are as follows:
* Each bit is transmitted in a fixed time (the period).
* A codice_1 is expressed by a low-to-high transition, a codice_2 by high-to-low transition (according to G. E. Thomas&#x27;s convention – in the IEEE 802.3 convention, the reverse is true).
* The transitions which signify codice_1 or codice_2 occur at the midpoint of a period.
* Transitions at the start of a period are overhead and don&#x27;t signify data.

<text>In multimode fibre optics, mandrel wrapping is a technique used to preferentially attenuate high-order mode power of a propagating optical signal. Consequently, if the fibre is propagating substantial energy in affected modes, the modal distribution will be changed.

A cylindrical rod wrap consists of a specified number turns of fibre on a mandrel of specified size, depending on the fibre characteristics and the desired modal distribution. It has application in optical transmission performance tests, to create a defined mode power distribution or to prevent multimode propagation in single mode fibre. If the launch fibre is fully filled ahead of the mandrel wrap, the higher-order modes will be stripped off, leaving only lower-order modes. If the launch fibre is underfilled, for example as a consequence of being energized by a laser diode or edge-emitting LED, there will be no effect on the mode power distribution or loss measurements.

In multimode fibre, mandrel wrapping is used to eliminate the effect of &quot;transient loss&quot;, the tendency of high-order modes to experience higher loss than lower-order modes. Numerical addition (in decibels) of the measured loss of multiple fibre segments and/or components overestimates the loss of the concatenated set if each segment or component has been measured with a full mode power distribution.

In single-mode optical fibre measurements, it is used to enforce true single-mode propagation at wavelengths near or below the theoretical cutoff wavelength, at which substantial power can exist in a higher-order mode group. In this use, it is commonly termed a High Order Mode Filter (HOMF).

Ultimately, the effect of mandrel wrapping on optical measurements depends on the propagating mode power distribution. An additional loss mechanism has no effect unless power is present in the affected modes.

==Principle of operation==

The effect of physically bending an optical fibre around a cylindrical form is to slightly modify the effective refractive index in the curved region, which locally reduces the effective mode volume of the fibre. This causes optical power in the highest order modes to become unguided, or so weakly guided as to be released into an unbound state, absorbed by the fibre coating or completely ejected from the fibre. The practical effect of mandrel wrapping is to attenuate optical power propagating in the highest-order modes. Lower-order modes are unaffected, experiencing neither increased loss nor conversion into other modes (mode mixing).

==Determination of appropriate mandrel wrap conditions==

The mandrel diameter and number of turns are chosen to eliminate certain modes in a reproducible way. It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360-degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified. The mandrel diameter affects how far into the mode volume the modal unbinding occurs. Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, as a function of mandrel diameter, maintaining a constant number of turns. This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is the point at which the mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower mode group. For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths. Total mode volume in a fiber is a function of wavelength, so the mandrel diameter at which the mode group transitions occur will change with wavelength.

<text>In telecommunications, a master station is a station that controls or coordinates the activities of other stations in the system.

Examples:
*In a data network, the control station may designate a master station to ensure data transfer to one or more slave stations. Such a master station controls one or more data links of the data communications network at any given instant. The assignment of master status to a given station is temporary and is controlled by the control station according to the procedures set forth in the operational protocol. Master status is normally conferred upon a station so that it may transmit a message, but a station need not have a message to send to be designated the master station.
* In navigation systems using precise time dissemination, the master station is a station that has the clock that is used to synchronize the clocks of subordinate stations.
* In basic mode link control, the master station is a data station that has accepted an invitation to ensure a data transfer to one or more slave stations. At a given instant, there can be only one master station on a data link.

==Operation modes==
In data transmission, a master station can be set to not wait for a reply from a slave station after transmitting each message or transmission block. In this case the station is said to be in &quot;continuous operation&quot;.

<text>In telecommunications, maximum-ratio combining (MRC) is a method of diversity combining in which:
#the signals from each channel are added together,
#the gain of each channel is made proportional to the rms signal level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that channel.
#different proportionality constants are used for each channel. 
It is also known as ratio-squared combining and predetection combining. Maximum-ratio combining is the optimum combiner for independent additive white Gaussian noise channels.

MRC can restore a signal to its original shape. The technique was invented by American engineer Leonard R. Kahn in 1954.

MRC has also been found in the field of neuroscience, where it has been shown that neurons in the retina scale their dependence on two sources of input in proportion to the signal-to-noise ratio of the inputs.

This has the advantage of producing an output with acceptable SNR even when none of the individual signals are themselves acceptable.

== Example: Least Squares estimate in the case of Rx diversity ==

We consider an example of which the receiver is endowed with N antennas. In this case, the received vector formula_1 is

where formula_2 is noise vector formula_3. Following the ML detection criterion the detection procedure may be written as
|\hat{s}-s|^2,&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_4 is the considered constellation of formula_5 and formula_6 is the least square solution to the above model.

The least square solution in this case is also known as maximum-ratio-combining (MRC). In the case of N antennas the LS can be written as
which means that the signal from each antenna is rotated and weighted according to the phase and strength of the channel, such that the signals from all antennas are combined to yield the maximum ratio between signal and noise terms.

<text>In radio transmission, maximum usable frequency (MUF) is the highest radio frequency that can be used for transmission between two points on Earth by reflection from the ionosphere (skywave or skip) at a specified time, independent of transmitter power. This index is especially useful for shortwave transmissions.

In shortwave radio communication, a major mode of long distance propagation is for the radio waves to reflect off the ionized layers of the atmosphere and return diagonally back to Earth. In this way radio waves can travel beyond the horizon, around the curve of the Earth. However the refractive index of the ionosphere decreases with increasing frequency, so there is an upper limit to the frequency which can be used. Above this frequency the radio waves are not reflected by the ionosphere but are transmitted through it into space.

The ionization of the atmosphere varies with time of day and season as well as with solar conditions, so the upper frequency limit for skywave communication varies throughout the day. MUF is a median frequency, defined as the highest frequency at which skywave communication is possible 50% of the days in a month, as opposed to the lowest usable high frequency (LUF) which is the frequency at which communication is possible 90% of the days, and the frequency of optimum transmission (FOT).

Typically the MUF is a predicted number. Given the maximum observed frequency (MOF) for a mode on each day of the month at a given hour, the MUF is the highest frequency for which an ionospheric communications path is predicted on 50% of the days of the month.

On a given day, communications may or may not succeed at the MUF. Commonly, the optimal operating frequency for a given path is estimated at 80 to 90% of the MUF. As a rule of thumb the MUF is approximately 3 times the critical frequency.

where the critical frequency is the highest frequency reflected for a signal propagating directly upward and θ is the angle of incidence.

== Optimum Working Frequency ==
Another important parameter used in skywave propagation is the optimum working frequency (OWF), which estimates the maximum frequency that must be used for a given critical frequency and incident angle. It is the frequency chosen to avoid the irregularities of the atmosphere.

<text>Mechanically induced modulation is an optical signal modulation induced by mechanical means. 

An example of deleterious mechanically induced modulation is speckle noise created in a multimode fiber by an imperfect splice or imperfectly mated connectors. Mechanical disturbance of the fiber ahead of the joint will introduce changes in the modal structure, resulting in variations of joint loss. This is a subset of many mechanisms that can lead to modal noise in an optical system.

<text>A message is a unit of communication that conveys information from a sender to a receiver. It can be transmitted through various forms, such as spoken or written words, signals, or electronic data, and can range from simple instructions to complex information. 

The consumption of the message relies on how the recipient interprets the message, there are times where the recipient contradicts the intention of the message which results in a boomerang effect. Message fatigue is another outcome recipients can obtain if a message is conveyed too much by the source. 

One example of a message is a press release, which may vary from a brief report or statement released by a public agency to commercial publicity material. Another example of a message is how they are portrayed to a consumer via an advertisement.

==History==

==Roles in human communication ==

In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or nonverbal:
* A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, emails, etc.
* A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, such as conscious or unconscious body language.

The phrase &quot;send a message&quot; or &quot;sending a message&quot; is also used for actions taken by a party to convey that party&#x27;s attitude towards a certain thing. For example, a government that executes people who commit acts of treason is sending a message that treason will not be tolerated. Conversely, a party that appears through its actions to endorse something that it opposes can be said to be &quot;sending the wrong message&quot;, while one which appears to simultaneously endorse contradictory things can be said to be sending &quot;mixed messages&quot;.

== In computer science ==

=== Events vs. Messages ===
In distributed systems, events represent a fact or state change (e.g., &quot;OrderPlaced&quot;) and are typically broadcast asynchronously to multiple consumers, promoting loose coupling and scalability. While events generally don’t expect an immediate response, acknowledgment mechanisms are often implemented at the infrastructure level (e.g., Kafka commit offsets, SNS delivery statuses) rather than being an inherent part of the event pattern itself. 

In contrast, messages serve a broader role, encompassing commands (e.g., &quot;ProcessPayment&quot;), events (e.g., &quot;PaymentProcessed&quot;), and documents (e.g., &quot;DataPayload&quot;). Both events and messages can support various delivery guarantees, including at-least-once, at-most-once, and exactly-once, depending on the technology stack and implementation. However, exactly-once delivery is often achieved through idempotency mechanisms rather than true, infrastructure-level exactly-once semantics. 

Delivery patterns for both events and messages include publish/subscribe (one-to-many) and point-to-point (one-to-one). While request/reply is technically possible, it is more commonly associated with messaging patterns rather than pure event-driven systems. Events excel at state propagation and decoupled notifications, while messages are better suited for command execution, workflow orchestration, and explicit coordination. 

Modern architectures commonly combine both approaches, leveraging events for distributed state change notifications and messages for targeted command execution and structured workflows based on specific timing, ordering, and delivery requirements.

<doc id="41372" wikidata="Q1687147" url="?curid=41372" title="Sprague–Grundy theorem">
<text>In combinatorial game theory, the Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a one-heap game of nim, or to an infinite generalization of nim. It can therefore be represented as a natural number, the size of the heap in its equivalent game of nim, as an ordinal number in the infinite generalization, or alternatively as a nimber, the value of that one-heap game in an algebraic system whose addition operation combines multiple heaps to form a single equivalent heap in nim.

The Grundy value or nim-value of any impartial game is the unique nimber that the game is equivalent to. In the case of a game whose positions are indexed by the natural numbers (like nim itself, which is indexed by its heap sizes), the sequence of nimbers for successive positions of the game is called the nim-sequence of the game.

The Sprague–Grundy theorem and its proof encapsulate the main results of a theory discovered independently by R. P. Sprague (1936) and P. M. Grundy (1939).

==Definitions==
For the purposes of the Sprague–Grundy theorem, a game is a two-player sequential game of perfect information satisfying the &quot;ending condition&quot; (all games come to an end: there are no infinite lines of play) and the &quot;normal play condition&quot; (a player who cannot move loses).

At any given point in the game, a player&#x27;s position is the set of moves they are allowed to make. As an example, we can define the &quot;zero game&quot; to be the two-player game where neither player has any legal moves. Referring to the two players as formula_1 (for Alice) and formula_2 (for Bob), we would denote their positions as formula_3, since the set of moves each player can make is empty.

An impartial game is one in which at any given point in the game, each player is allowed exactly the same set of moves. Normal-play nim is an example of an impartial game. In nim, there are one or more heaps of objects, and two players (we&#x27;ll call them Alice and Bob), take turns choosing a heap and removing 1 or more objects from it. The winner is the player who removes the final object from the final heap. The game is impartial because for any given configuration of pile sizes, the moves Alice can make on her turn are exactly the same moves Bob would be allowed to make if it were his turn. In contrast, a game such as checkers is not impartial because, supposing Alice were playing red and Bob were playing black, for any given arrangement of pieces on the board, if it were Alice&#x27;s turn, she would only be allowed to move the red pieces, and if it were Bob&#x27;s turn, he would only be allowed to move the black pieces.

Note that any configuration of an impartial game can therefore be written as a single position, because the moves will be the same no matter whose turn it is. For example, the position of the &quot;zero game&quot; can simply be written formula_4, because if it&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s turn, she has no moves to make, and if it&#x27;s Bob&#x27;s turn, he has no moves to make either.
A move can be associated with the position it leaves the next player in. 

Doing so allows positions to be defined recursively. For example, consider the following game of Nim played by Alice and Bob.

=== Example Nim Game ===
* At step 6 of the game (when all of the heaps are empty) the position is formula_4, because Bob has no valid moves to make. We name this position formula_6. 
* At step 5, Alice had exactly one option: to remove one object from heap C, leaving Bob with no moves. Since her &quot;move&quot; leaves Bob in position formula_6, her &quot;position&quot; is written formula_8. We name this position formula_9.
* At step 4, Bob had two options: remove one from B or remove one from C. Note, however, that it didn&#x27;t really matter which heap Bob removed the object from: Either way, Alice would be left with exactly one object in exactly one pile. So, using our recursive definition, Bob really only has one move: formula_9. Thus, Bob&#x27;s position is formula_11.
* At step 3, Alice had 3 options: remove two from C, remove one from C, or remove one from B. Removing two from C leaves Bob in position formula_9. Removing one from C leaves Bob with two piles, each of size one, i.e., position formula_11, as described in step 4. However, removing 1 from B would leave Bob with two objects in a single pile. &quot;His&quot; moves would then be formula_6 and formula_9, so &quot;her&quot; move would result in the position formula_16. We call this position formula_17. Alice&#x27;s position is then the set of all her moves: formula_18.
* Following the same recursive logic, at step 2, Bob&#x27;s position is formula_19
* Finally, at step 1, Alice&#x27;s position is formula_20

===Nimbers===
The special names formula_6, formula_9, and formula_17 referenced in our example game are called nimbers. In general, the nimber formula_24 corresponds to the position in a game of nim where there are exactly formula_25 objects in exactly one heap. 
Formally, nimbers are defined inductively as follows: formula_6 is formula_4, formula_28, formula_29 and for all formula_30, formula_31.

While the word &quot;nim&quot;ber comes from the game &quot;nim&quot;, nimbers can be used to describe the positions of any finite, impartial game, and in fact, the Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every instance of a finite, impartial game can be associated with a &quot;single&quot; nimber.

===Combining Games===
Two games can be combined by adding their positions together.
For example, consider another game of nim with heaps formula_32, formula_33, and formula_34.

====Example Game 2====
We can combine it with our first example to get a combined game with six heaps: formula_1, formula_2, formula_37, formula_32, formula_33, and formula_34:

====Combined Game====
To differentiate between the two games, for the first example game, we&#x27;ll label its starting position formula_41, and color it blue:
formula_42

For the second example game, we&#x27;ll label the starting position formula_43 and color it red:
formula_44

To compute the starting position of the combined game, remember that a player can either make a move in the first game, leaving the second game untouched, or make a move in the second game, leaving the first game untouched. So the combined game&#x27;s starting position is:
formula_45

The explicit formula for adding positions is: formula_46, which means that addition is both commutative and associative.

===Equivalence=== 
Positions in impartial games fall into two outcome classes: either the next player (the one whose turn it is) wins (an formula_47- position), or the previous player wins (a formula_48- position). So, for example, formula_6 is a formula_50-position, while formula_9 is an formula_52-position.

Two positions formula_53 and formula_54 are equivalent if, no matter what position formula_55 is added to them, they are always in the same outcome class. 
Formally,
formula_56 if and only if formula_57, formula_58 is in the same outcome class as formula_59.

To use our running examples, notice that in both the first and second games above, we can show that on every turn, Alice has a move that forces Bob into a formula_50-position. Thus, both formula_41 and formula_43 are formula_52-positions. (Notice that in the combined game, &quot;Bob&quot; is the player with the formula_52-positions. In fact, formula_65 is a formula_50-position, which as we will see in Lemma 2, means formula_67.)

==First Lemma==
As an intermediate step to proving the main theorem, we show that for every position formula_53 and every formula_50-position formula_1, the equivalence formula_71 holds. By the above definition of equivalence, this amounts to showing that formula_72 and formula_73 share an outcome class for all formula_55.

Suppose that formula_72 is a formula_50-position. Then the previous player has a winning strategy for formula_73: respond to moves in formula_1 according to their winning strategy for formula_1 (which exists by virtue of formula_1 being a formula_50-position), and respond to moves in formula_72 according to their winning strategy for formula_72 (which exists for the analogous reason). So formula_73 must also be a formula_50-position.

On the other hand, if formula_72 is an formula_52-position, then formula_73 is also an formula_52-position, because the next player has a winning strategy: choose a formula_50-position from among the formula_72 options, and we conclude from the previous paragraph that adding formula_1 to that position is still a formula_50-position. Thus, in this case, formula_73 must be a formula_52-position, just like formula_72.

As these are the only two cases, the lemma holds.

==Second Lemma==
As a further step, we show that formula_97 if and only if formula_98 is a formula_50-position.

In the forward direction, suppose that formula_97. Applying the definition of equivalence with formula_101, we find that formula_102 (which is equal to formula_98 by commutativity of addition) is in the same outcome class as formula_104. But formula_104 must be a formula_50-position: for every move made in one copy of formula_53, the previous player can respond with the same move in the other copy, and so always make the last move.

In the reverse direction, since formula_108 is a formula_50-position by hypothesis, it follows from the first lemma, formula_110, that formula_111. Similarly, since formula_112 is also a formula_50-position, it follows from the first lemma in the form formula_114 that formula_115. By associativity and commutativity, the right-hand sides of these results are equal. Furthermore, formula_116 is an equivalence relation because equality is an equivalence relation on outcome classes. Via the transitivity of formula_116, we can conclude that formula_97.

==Proof of the Sprague–Grundy theorem==
We prove that all positions are equivalent to a nimber by structural induction. The more specific result, that the given game&#x27;s initial position must be equivalent to a nimber, shows that the game is itself equivalent to a nimber.

Consider a position formula_119. By the induction hypothesis, all of the options are equivalent to nimbers, say formula_120. So let formula_121. We will show that formula_122, where formula_123 is the mex (minimum exclusion) of the numbers formula_124, that is, the smallest non-negative integer not equal to some formula_125.

The first thing we need to note is that formula_126, by way of the second lemma. If formula_127 is zero, the claim is trivially true. Otherwise, consider formula_98. If the next player makes a move to formula_129 in formula_53, then the previous player can move to formula_131 in formula_54, and conversely if the next player makes a move in formula_54. After this, the position is a formula_50-position by the lemma&#x27;s forward implication. Therefore, formula_98 is a formula_50-position, and, citing the lemma&#x27;s reverse implication, formula_126.

Now let us show that formula_138 is a formula_50-position, which, using the second lemma once again, means that formula_140. We do so by giving an explicit strategy for the previous player.

Suppose that formula_54 and formula_142 are empty. Then formula_138 is the null set, clearly a formula_50-position.

Or consider the case that the next player moves in the component formula_142 to the option formula_146 where formula_147. Because formula_123 was the &quot;minimum&quot; excluded number, the previous player can move in formula_54 to formula_146. And, as shown before, any position plus itself is a formula_50-position.

Finally, suppose instead that the next player moves in the component formula_54 to the option formula_131. If formula_154 then the previous player moves in formula_142 to formula_131; otherwise, if formula_157, the previous player moves in formula_131 to formula_142; in either case the result is a position plus itself. (It is not possible that formula_160 because formula_123 was defined to be different from all the formula_125.)

In summary, we have formula_97 and formula_140. By transitivity, we conclude that formula_122, as desired.

==Development==
If formula_53 is a position of an impartial game, the unique integer formula_123 such that formula_122 is called its Grundy value, or Grundy number, and the function that assigns this value to each such position is called the Sprague–Grundy function. R. L. Sprague and P. M. Grundy independently gave an explicit definition of this function, not based on any concept of equivalence to nim positions, and showed that it had the following properties:
*The Grundy value of a single nim pile of size formula_123 (i.e. of the position formula_142) is formula_123;
* A position is a loss for the next player to move (i.e. a formula_50-position) if and only if its Grundy value is zero; and
*The Grundy value of the sum of a finite set of positions is just the nim-sum of the Grundy values of its summands.
It follows straightforwardly from these results that if a position formula_53 has a Grundy value of formula_123, then formula_58 has the same Grundy value as formula_176, and therefore belongs to the same outcome class, for any position formula_55. Thus, although Sprague and Grundy never explicitly stated the theorem described in this article, it follows directly from their results and is credited to them.
These results have subsequently been developed into the field of combinatorial game theory, notably by Richard Guy, Elwyn Berlekamp, John Horton Conway and others, where they are now encapsulated in the Sprague–Grundy theorem and its proof in the form described here. The field is presented in the books &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot; and &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;.

<text>In fiber optics, the mode field diameter (MFD) is a measure of the width of an irradiance distribution, i.e., the optical power per unit area, across the end face of a single-mode fiber. It is analogous to the formula_1 measure of the beam diameter for a beam propagating in free space.

The mode field diameter is defined as twice the mode field radius, and the mode field radius is equal to the distance from the center at which the electric and magnetic field strengths are reduced to formula_2 of their maximum values. Since the intensity (given by the Poynting vector) is proportional to the square of the field amplitude, the intensity drops by formula_3 or -8.69 dB at this distance from the center. For a Gaussian-shaped mode, the mode field diameter is twice the beam waist formula_4.

The MFD is typically slightly larger than the core of an optical fiber extending slightly into the cladding.

<text>In an optical communication link, mode partition noise is phase jitter of the signal caused by the combined effects of mode hopping in the optical source and intramodal distortion in the fiber. 

Mode hopping causes random wavelength changes which in turn affect the group velocity, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the propagation time. Over a long length of fiber, the cumulative effect is to create jitter, &quot;i.e.&quot; mode partition noise. The variation of group velocity creates the mode partition noise.

<doc id="41375" wikidata="Q6888119" url="?curid=41375" title="Mode scrambler">
<text>In telecommunications, a mode scrambler or mode mixer is a device for inducing mode coupling in an optical fiber, or a device that, itself, exhibits a uniform output intensity profile independent of the input mode volume or modal excitation condition. Mode scramblers are used to provide a modal distribution that is independent of the optical source for purposes of laboratory, manufacturing, or field measurements or tests. Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of multimode fiber bandwidth measurements.

== Overview ==
If multimode fiber bandwidth is measured using a laser diode directly coupled to its input, the resulting measurement can vary by as much as an order of magnitude. This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in laser output characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the differential mode delay of the fiber. Differential mode delay is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber&#x27;s propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.

The primary purpose of a mode scrambler is to create a uniform, overfilled launch condition that can be easily reproduced on multiple measurement systems, so that measurement systems have essentially the same launch conditions and can measure approximately the same bandwidth despite having different laser sources. These were used for this purpose in the first U.S. NIST round-robins on multimode fiber. The overfilled launch (OFL) was created to reduce measurement variability, and improve concatenation estimates for multimode fibers, used at that time for telecom &#x27;long haul&#x27; (e.g., 7–10 km 850 nm or 20–30 km 1300 nm) systems.

When the telecom industry converted to near-exclusive use of single-mode fiber ca. 1984, multimode fiber was re-purposed for use in LANs, such as Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), then under development. The output modal power distribution of a mode scrambler is similar to the surface-emitters used in those first LAN transmitters, but this was fortuitous coincidence. On average, but not in every case, the OFL bandwidth measured using a mode scrambler is lower than that produced by excitation of a partial mode volume (restricted mode launch or RML), such as occurs with directly coupled laser diodes.

== Types ==
There are two common types of mode scramblers: the &quot;Step-Graded-Step&quot; (S-G-S) and the &quot;step index with bends&quot;. The S-G-S mode scrambler is actually an assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a step-index profile, a graded-index profile and another step-index profile fiber. Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested. Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use &quot;Step Index with Bends&quot; mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber through a series of small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness. The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.

A mode scrambler can be characterized and qualified by measuring its near-field and far-field distributions, as well as by measuring one of these distributions while restricting the other. Guidelines for constructing a mode scrambler and qualifying its output can be found in the ANSI/TIA/EIA-455-54 fiber optic test procedure (FOTP).

<text>Mode volume may refer to figures of merit used either to characterise optical and microwave cavities or optical fibers.

==In electromagnetic cavities==

The mode volume (or modal volume) of an optical or microwave cavity is a measure of how concentrated the electromagnetic energy of a single cavity mode is in space, expressed as an effective volume in which most of the energy associated with an electromagentic mode is confined. Various expressions may be used to estimate this volume:

* The volume that would be occupied by the mode if its electromagnetic energy density was constant and equal to its maximum value 
formula_1
* The volume over which the electromagnetic energy density exceeds some threshold (e.g., half the maximum energy density)
formula_2
* The volume that would be occupied by the mode if its electromagnetic energy density was constant and equal to a weighted average value that emphasises higher energy densities.
formula_3

where formula_4 is the electric field strength, formula_5 is the magnetic flux density, formula_6 is the electric permittivity, formula_7 denotes the magnetic permeability, and formula_8 denotes the maximum value of its functional argument. In each definition the integral is over all space and may diverge in leaky cavities where the electromagnetic energy can radiate out to infinity and is thus not is not confined within the cavity volume. In this case modifications to the expressions above may be required to give an effective mode volume.

The mode volume of a cavity or resonator is of particular importance in cavity quantum electrodynamics where it determines the magnitude of the Purcell effect and coupling strength between cavity photons and atoms in the cavity. In particular, the Purcell factor is given by

: formula_9
where formula_10 is the vacuum wavelength, formula_11 is the refractive index of the cavity material (so formula_12 is the wavelength inside the cavity), and formula_13 and formula_14 are the cavity quality factor and mode volume, respectively.

==In fiber optics==

In fiber optics, mode volume is the number of bound modes that an optical fiber is capable of supporting. 

The mode volume &quot;M&quot; is approximately given by formula_15 and formula_16, respectively for step-index and power-law index profile fibers, where &quot;g&quot; is the profile parameter, and &quot;V&quot; is the normalized frequency, &quot;which must be greater than 5 for this approximation to be valid&quot;.

<text>In United States telecommunication law, the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) is the August 1982 consent decree concerning the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and its subsidiaries, in the antitrust lawsuit &quot;United States v. AT&amp;T&quot; of 1974. The terms required the breakup of the Bell System, including removing local telephone service from AT&amp;T control and placing business restrictions on the divested local telephone companies in exchange for removing other longstanding restrictions on what businesses AT&amp;T could own and manage.

The decree replaced the entirety of the previous final judgment of January 24, 1956 in the case &quot;United States v. Western Electric Inc.&quot;, which had been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and is referred to in the MFJ as the &quot;Western Electric&quot; case, and consolidated with the existing &quot;United States v. AT&amp;T&quot; filed on November 20, 1974, which is referred to in the MFJ as the &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; action or &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; case.

The decree was made with Harold H. Greene as presiding judge.

<text>Modified AMI codes are a digital telecommunications technique to maintain system synchronization. Alternate mark inversion (AMI) line codes are modified by deliberate insertion of bipolar violations. There are several types of modified AMI codes, used in various T-carrier and E-carrier systems.

==Overview==
The clock rate of an incoming T-carrier is extracted from its bipolar line code. Each signal transition provides an opportunity for the receiver to see the transmitter&#x27;s clock. The AMI code guarantees that transitions are always present before and after each mark (1 bit), but are missing between adjacent spaces (0 bits). To prevent loss of synchronization when a long string of zeros is present in the payload, deliberate bipolar violations are inserted into the line code, to create a sufficient number of transitions to maintain synchronization; this is a form of run length limited coding. The receive terminal equipment recognizes the bipolar violations and removes from the user data the marks attributable to the bipolar violations.

T-carrier was originally developed for voice applications. When voice signals are digitized for transmission via T-carrier, the data stream always includes ample 1 bits to maintain synchronization. (To help this, the μ-law algorithm for digitizing voice signals encodes silence as a continuous stream of 1 bits.) However, when used for the transmission of digital data, the conventional AMI line code may fail to have sufficient marks to permit recovery of the incoming clock, and synchronization is lost. This happens when there are too many consecutive zeros in the user data being transported. 

The exact pattern of bipolar violations that is transmitted in any given case depends on the line rate (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the level of the line code in the T-carrier hierarchy) and the polarity of the last valid mark in the user data prior to the unacceptably long string of zeros. It would not be useful to have a violation immediately following a mark, as that would not produce a transition. For this reason, all modified AMI codes include a space (0 bit) before each violation mark.

In the descriptions below, &quot; denotes a balancing mark with the opposite polarity to that of the preceding mark, while &quot; denotes a bipolar violation mark, which has the same polarity as the preceding mark. In order to preserve AMI coding&#x27;s desirable absence of DC bias, the number of positive marks must equal the number of negative marks. This happens automatically for balancing () marks, but the line code must ensure that positive and negative violation marks balance each other.

==Zero length code suppression ==
The first technique used to ensure a minimum density of marks was zero code suppression a form of bit stuffing, which set the least significant bit of each 8-bit byte transmitted to a 1. (This bit was already unavailable due to robbed-bit signaling.) This avoided the need to modify the AMI code in any way, but limited available data rates to 56,000 bits per second per DS0 voice channel. Also, the low minimum density of ones (12.5%) sometimes led to increased clock slippage on the span.

Increased demand for bandwidth, and compatibility with the G.703 and ISDN PRI standards which called for 64,000 bits per second, led to this system being superseded by B8ZS.

==B8ZS (North American T1) ==
Commonly used in the North American T1 (Digital Signal 1) 1.544 Mbit/s line code, bipolar with eight-zero substitution (B8ZS) replaces each string of 8 consecutive zeros with the special pattern &quot;&quot;. Depending on the polarity of the preceding mark, that could be or .

==B6ZS (North American T2) ==
At the North American T2 rate (6.312 Mbit/s), bipolar violations are inserted if 6 or more consecutive zeros occur. This line code is called bipolar with six-zero substitution (B6ZS), and replaces 6 consecutive zeros with the pattern &quot;&quot;. Depending on the polarity of the preceding mark, that could be or .

==HDB3 (European E-carrier) ==
Used in all levels of the European E-carrier system, the high density bipolar of order 3 (HDB3) code replaces any instance of 4 consecutive 0 bits with one of the patterns &quot; or &quot;. The choice is made to ensure that consecutive violations are of differing polarity; i.e., separated by an odd number of normal marks.
These rules are applied on the code as it is being built from the original string. Every time there are 4 consecutive zeros in the code they will be replaced by either 000−, 000+, +00+ or −00−. To determine which pattern to use, one must count the number of pluses (+) and the number of minuses (−) since the last violation bit V, then subtract one from the other. If the result is an odd number then 000− or 000+ is used. If the result is an even number then +00+ or −00− is used. To determine which polarity to use, one must look at the pulse preceding the four zeros. If 000V form must be used then V simply copies the polarity of last pulse, if B00V form must be used then B and V chosen will have the opposite polarity of the last pulse.

===Examples===
Here are some examples of bit streams codes with AMI and HDB3. All assume the same starting conditions: the previous 1 bit was −, and the previous violation was an even number of 1 bits ago. (E.g. the preceding bits could have been ++−.)

==B3ZS (North American T3) ==
At the North American T3 rate (44.736 Mbit/s), bipolar violations are inserted if 3 or more consecutive zeros occur. This line code is called bipolar with three-zero substitution (B3ZS), and is very similar to HDB3. Each run of 3 consecutive zeros is replaced by &quot; or &quot;. The choice is made to ensure that consecutive violations are of differing polarity, i.e. separated by an odd number of normal marks.

<doc id="41382" wikidata="Q311989" url="?curid=41382" title="Μ-law algorithm">
<text>The μ-law algorithm (sometimes written [[Mu (letter)|mu]]-law, often abbreviated as u-law) is a companding algorithm, primarily used in 8-bit PCM digital telecommunications systems in North America and Japan. It is one of the two companding algorithms in the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other being the similar A-law. A-law is used in regions where digital telecommunication signals are carried on E-1 circuits, e.g. Europe.

The terms PCMU, G711u or G711MU are used for G711 μ-law.

Companding algorithms reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal. In analog systems, this can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achieved during transmission; in the digital domain, it can reduce the quantization error (hence increasing the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio). These SNR increases can be traded instead for reduced bandwidth for equivalent SNR.

At the cost of a reduced peak SNR, it can be mathematically shown that μ-law&#x27;s non-linear quantization effectively increases dynamic range by 33 dB or bits over a linearly-quantized signal, hence 13.5 bits (which rounds up to 14 bits) is the most resolution required for an input digital signal to be compressed for 8-bit μ-law.

==Algorithm types==
The μ-law algorithm may be described in an analog form and in a quantized digital form.

===Continuous===

For a given input , the equation for μ-law encoding is
formula_1

where in the North American and Japanese standards, and is the sign function. The range of this function is −1 to 1.

μ-law expansion is then given by the inverse equation:
formula_2

===Discrete===
The discrete form is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.711.

G.711 is unclear about how to code the values at the limit of a range (e.g. whether +31 codes to 0xEF or 0xF0).
However, G.191 provides example code in the C language for a μ-law encoder. The difference between the positive and negative ranges, e.g. the negative range corresponding to +30 to +1 is −31 to −2. This is accounted for by the use of 1&#x27;s complement (simple bit inversion) rather than 2&#x27;s complement to convert a negative value to a positive value during encoding.

==Implementation==
The μ-law algorithm may be implemented in several ways:
; Analog: Use an amplifier with non-linear gain to achieve companding entirely in the analog domain.
; Non-linear ADC: Use an analog-to-digital converter with quantization levels which are unequally spaced to match the μ-law algorithm.
; Digital: Use the quantized digital version of the μ-law algorithm to convert data once it is in the digital domain.

; Software/DSP
: Use the continuous version of the μ-law algorithm to calculate the companded values.

==Usage justification==
μ-law encoding is used because speech has a wide dynamic range. In analog signal transmission, in the presence of relatively constant background noise, the finer detail is lost. Given that the precision of the detail is compromised anyway, and assuming that the signal is to be perceived as audio by a human, one can take advantage of the fact that the perceived acoustic intensity level or loudness is logarithmic by compressing the signal using a logarithmic-response operational amplifier (Weber–Fechner law). In telecommunications circuits, most of the noise is injected on the lines, thus after the compressor, the intended signal is perceived as significantly louder than the static, compared to an uncompressed source. This became a common solution, and thus, prior to common digital usage, the μ-law specification was developed to define an interoperable standard.

This pre-existing algorithm had the effect of significantly lowering the amount of bits required to encode a recognizable human voice in digital systems. A sample could be effectively encoded using μ-law in as little as 8 bits, which conveniently matched the symbol size of the majority of common computers.

μ-law encoding effectively reduced the dynamic range of the signal, thereby increasing the coding efficiency while biasing the signal in a way that results in a signal-to-distortion ratio that is greater than that obtained by linear encoding for a given number of bits.
The μ-law algorithm is also used in the .au format, which dates back at least to the SPARCstation 1 by Sun Microsystems as the native method used by the /dev/audio interface, widely used as a de facto standard for sound on Unix systems. The au format is also used in various common audio APIs such as the classes in the sun.audio Java package in Java 1.1 and in some C# methods.

This plot illustrates how μ-law concentrates sampling in the smaller (softer) values. The horizontal axis represents the byte values 0-255 and the vertical axis is the 16-bit linear decoded value of μ-law encoding.

==Comparison with A-law==
The μ-law algorithm provides a slightly larger dynamic range than the A-law at the cost of worse proportional distortions for small signals. By convention, A-law is used for an international connection if at least one country uses it.

<doc id="41383" wikidata="Q17156927" url="?curid=41383" title="Multicast address">
<text>A multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service. Multicast addressing can be used in the link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model), such as Ethernet multicast, and at the internet layer (layer 3 for OSI) for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Version 6 (IPv6) multicast.

==IPv4==
IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the most-significant bit pattern of &quot;1110&quot;. This originates from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as &quot;Class D&quot;. The CIDR notation for this group is . The group includes the addresses from to .

The address range is divided into blocks each assigned a specific purpose or behavior.
;Local subnetwork
:Addresses in the range of to are individually assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on the local subnetwork only. For example, the Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2) uses , Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses and , and Multicast DNS uses . Routers must not forward these messages outside the subnet from which they originate.

;Internetwork control block
:Addresses in the range to are individually assigned by IANA and designated as the &quot;internetwork control block&quot;. This block of addresses is used for traffic that must be routed through the public Internet, such as for applications of the Network Time Protocol using .

;AD-HOC block 
:Addresses in three separate blocks are not individually assigned by IANA. These addresses are globally routed and are used for applications that don&#x27;t fit either of the previously described purposes.

;SDP/SAP block
:Addresses in the reserved range are not individually assigned by IANA. Fallen out of use for security considerations, experimental Session Announcement Protocol was the primary means of supplying addresses through Session Description Protocol, which now is mostly used in the establishment of private sessions.

;Source-specific multicast
:The (IPv4) and (IPv6) blocks are reserved for use by source-specific multicast.

;GLOP
:The range was originally assigned as an experimental, public statically-assigned multicast address space for publishers and Internet service providers that wished to source content on the Internet. The allocation method is termed GLOP addressing and provides implementers a block of 255 addresses that is determined by their 16-bit autonomous system number (ASN) allocation. In a nutshell, the middle two octets of this block are formed from assigned ASNs, giving any operator assigned an ASN 256 globally unique multicast group addresses. The method is not applicable to the newer 32-bit ASNs. In , the IETF envisioned a broader use of the range for many-to-many multicast applications. Unfortunately, with only 256 multicast addresses available to each autonomous system, GLOP is not adequate for large-scale broadcasters.

;Unicast-prefix-based
:The range is assigned as a range of global IPv4 multicast address space provided to each organization that has or larger globally routed unicast address space allocated; one multicast address is reserved per of unicast space. A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the unicast-prefix mechanism resembles the unicast-prefix capabilities of IPv6.

;Administratively scoped
:The range is assigned for private use within an organization. Packets destined to administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses do not cross administratively defined organizational boundaries, and administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses are locally assigned and do not have to be globally unique. The range may be structured to be loosely similar to the scoped IPv6 multicast address.

;Ethernet-specific
:In support of link-local multicasts which do not use IGMP, any IPv4 multicast address that falls within the and ranges will be broadcast to all ports on many Ethernet switches, even if IGMP snooping is enabled, so addresses within these ranges should be avoided on Ethernet networks where the functionality of IGMP snooping is desired.

===Notable IPv4 multicast addresses===
The following table is a list of notable well-known IPv4 addresses that are reserved for IP multicasting and that are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

==IPv6==

Multicast addresses in IPv6 use the prefix .
Based on the value of the flag bits, IPv6 multicast addresses can be Unicast-Prefix-based Multicast Addresses, Source-Specific Multicast Addresses, or Embedded RP IPv6 Multicast Addresses. Each of these types of multicast addresses have their own format and follow specific rules.

Similar to a unicast address, the &quot;prefix&quot; of an IPv6 multicast address specifies its scope, however, the set of possible scopes for a multicast address is different. The 4-bit &quot;scope&quot; field (bits 12 to 15) is used to indicate where the address is valid and unique.

The service is identified in the &quot;group ID&quot; field. For example, if refers to all Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers on the local network segment, then refers to all NTP servers in an organization&#x27;s networks. The &quot;group ID&quot; field may be further divided for special multicast address types.

===Notable IPv6 multicast addresses===
The following table is a list notable IPv6 multicast addresses that are registered with IANA.
To be included in some of the below multicast groups a client must send a Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), a component of ICMPv6 suite, to join that group. For example, to listen to , a client must send a MLD report to the router, containing the multicast address, to indicate that it wants to listen to that group.

==Ethernet==
Ethernet frames with a value of 1 in the least-significant bit of the first octet of the destination MAC address are treated as multicast frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the destination address () are sometimes referred to as broadcasts, Ethernet generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast destination address in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received.

The IEEE has allocated the address block to for group addresses for use by standard protocols. Of these, the MAC group addresses in the range of to are not forwarded by 802.1D-conformant MAC bridges.

==802.11==
802.11 wireless networks use the same MAC addresses for multicast as Ethernet.

<text>In radio communication, multipath is the propagation phenomenon that results in radio signals reaching the receiving antenna by two or more paths. Causes of multipath include atmospheric ducting, ionospheric reflection and refraction, and reflection from water bodies and terrestrial objects such as mountains and buildings. When the same signal is received over more than one path, it can create interference and phase shifting of the signal. Destructive interference causes fading; this may cause a radio signal to become too weak in certain areas to be received adequately. For this reason, this effect is also known as multipath interference or multipath distortion.

Where the magnitudes of the signals arriving by the various paths have a distribution known as the Rayleigh distribution, this is known as Rayleigh fading. Where one component (often, but not necessarily, a line of sight component) dominates, a Rician distribution provides a more accurate model, and this is known as Rician fading. Where two components dominate, the behavior is best modeled with the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) distribution. All of these descriptions are commonly used and accepted and lead to results. However, they are generic and abstract/hide/approximate the underlying physics. 

==Interference==

Multipath interference is a phenomenon in the physics of waves whereby a wave from a source travels to a detector via two or more paths and the two (or more) components of the wave interfere constructively or destructively. Multipath interference is a common cause of &quot;ghosting&quot; in analog television broadcasts and of fading of radio waves.


The condition necessary is that the components of the wave remain coherent throughout the whole extent of their travel.

The interference will arise owing to the two (or more) components of the wave having, in general, travelled a different length (as measured by optical path length – geometric length and refraction (differing optical speed)), and thus arriving at the detector out of phase with each other.

The signal due to indirect paths interferes with the required signal in amplitude as well as phase which is called multipath fading.

==Examples==

In analog facsimile and television transmission, multipath causes jitter and ghosting, seen as a faded duplicate image to the right of the main image. Ghosts occur when transmissions bounce off a mountain or other large object, while also arriving at the antenna by a shorter, direct route, with the receiver picking up two signals separated by a delay.

In radar processing, multipath causes ghost targets to appear, deceiving the radar receiver. These ghosts are particularly bothersome since they move and behave like the normal targets (which they echo), and so the receiver has difficulty in isolating the correct target echo. These problems can be minimized by incorporating a ground map of the radar&#x27;s surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below the ground or above a certain height (altitude).

In digital radio communications (such as GSM) multipath can cause errors and affect the quality of communications. The errors are due to intersymbol interference (ISI). Equalizers are often used to correct the ISI. Alternatively, techniques such as orthogonal frequency division modulation and rake receivers may be used.
In a Global Positioning System receiver, multipath effects can cause a stationary receiver&#x27;s output to indicate as if it were randomly jumping about or creeping. When the unit is moving the jumping or creeping may be hidden, but it still degrades the displayed accuracy of location and speed.

==In wired media==
Multipath propagation is similar in power line communication and in telephone local loops. In either case, impedance mismatch causes signal reflection. 

High-speed power line communication systems usually employ multi-carrier modulations (such as OFDM or wavelet OFDM) to avoid the intersymbol interference that multipath propagation would cause. The ITU-T G.hn standard provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit per second) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines, and coaxial cables). G.hn uses OFDM with a cyclic prefix to avoid ISI. Because multipath propagation behaves differently in each kind of wire, G.hn uses different OFDM parameters (OFDM symbol duration, guard interval duration) for each media.

DSL modems also use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing to communicate with their DSLAM despite multipath. In this case the reflections may be caused by mixed wire gauges, but those from bridge taps are usually more intense and complex. Where OFDM training is unsatisfactory, bridge taps may be removed.

==Mathematical modeling==

The mathematical model of the multipath can be presented using the method of the impulse response used for studying linear systems.

Suppose you want to transmit a single, ideal Dirac pulse of electromagnetic power at time 0, i.e.

:formula_1

At the receiver, due to the presence of the multiple electromagnetic paths, more than one pulse will be received, and each one of them will arrive at different times. In fact, since the electromagnetic signals travel at the speed of light, and since every path has a geometrical length possibly different from that of the other ones, there are different air travelling times (consider that, in free space, the light takes 3 μs to cross a 1 km span). Thus, the received signal will be expressed by

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the number of received impulses (equivalent to the number of electromagnetic paths, and possibly very large), formula_4 is the time delay of the generic formula_5 impulse, and formula_6 represent the complex amplitude (i.e., magnitude and phase) of the generic received pulse. As a consequence, formula_7 also represents the impulse response function formula_8 of the equivalent multipath model.

More in general, in presence of time variation of the geometrical reflection conditions, this impulse response is time varying, and as such we have

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

Very often, just one parameter is used to denote the severity of multipath conditions: it is called the multipath time, formula_12, and it is defined as the time delay existing between the first and the last received impulses

:formula_13
In practical conditions and measurement, the multipath time is computed by considering as last impulse the first one which allows receiving a determined amount of the total transmitted power (scaled by the atmospheric and propagation losses), e.g. 99%.

Keeping our aim at linear, time invariant systems, we can also characterize the multipath phenomenon by the channel transfer function formula_14, which is defined as the continuous time Fourier transform of the impulse response formula_8

:formula_16

where the last right-hand term of the previous equation is easily obtained by remembering that the Fourier transform of a Dirac pulse is a complex exponential function, an eigenfunction of every linear system.

The obtained channel transfer characteristic has a typical appearance of a sequence of peaks and valleys (also called &quot;notches&quot;); it can be shown that, on average, the distance (in Hz) between two consecutive valleys (or two consecutive peaks), is roughly inversely proportional to the multipath time. The so-called coherence bandwidth is thus defined as

:formula_17

For example, with a multipath time of 3 μs (corresponding to a 1 km of added on-air travel for the last received impulse), there is a coherence bandwidth of about 330 kHz.

<text>In telecommunications, the term multiplex baseband has the following meanings: 
#In frequency-division multiplexing, the frequency band occupied by the aggregate of the signals in the line interconnecting the multiplexing and radio or line equipment.
#In frequency division multiplexed carrier systems, at the input to any stage of frequency translation, the frequency band occupied. 

For example, the output of a group multiplexer consists of a band of frequencies from 60 kHz to 108 kHz. This is the group-level baseband that results from combining 12 voice-frequency input channels, having a bandwidth of 4 kHz each, including guard bands. In turn, 5 groups are multiplexed into a super group having a baseband of 312 kHz to 552 kHz. This baseband, however, does not represent a group-level baseband. Ten super groups are in turn multiplexed into one master group, the output of which is a baseband that may be used to modulate a microwave-frequency carrier.

<text>In telecommunications and computer networking, multiplexing (sometimes contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to share a scarce resource a physical transmission medium. For example, in telecommunications, several telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited with the development of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.

The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.

A device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer (MUX), and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer (DEMUX or DMX).

Inverse multiplexing (IMUX) has the opposite aim as multiplexing, namely to break one data stream into several streams, transfer them simultaneously over several communication channels, and recreate the original data stream.

In computing, I/O multiplexing can also be used to refer to the concept of processing multiple input/output events from a single event loop, with system calls like poll and select (Unix).

==Types==
Multiple variable bit rate digital bit streams may be transferred efficiently over a single fixed bandwidth channel by means of statistical multiplexing. This is an asynchronous mode time-domain multiplexing which is a form of time-division multiplexing.

Digital bit streams can be transferred over an analog channel by means of code-division multiplexing techniques such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS).

In wireless communications, multiplexing can also be accomplished through alternating polarization (horizontal/vertical or clockwise/counterclockwise) on each adjacent channel and satellite, or through phased multi-antenna array combined with a multiple-input multiple-output communications (MIMO) scheme.

===Space-division multiplexing===

In wired communication, space-division multiplexing, also known as space-division multiple access (SDMA) is the use of separate point-to-point electrical conductors for each transmitted channel. Examples include an analog stereo audio cable, with one pair of wires for the left channel and another for the right channel, and a multi-pair telephone cable, a switched star network such as a telephone access network, a switched Ethernet network, and a mesh network.

In wireless communication, space-division multiplexing is achieved with multiple antenna elements forming a phased array antenna. Examples are multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO), single-input and multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input and single-output (MISO) multiplexing. An IEEE 802.11g wireless router with &quot;k&quot; antennas makes it in principle possible to communicate with &quot;k&quot; multiplexed channels, each with a peak bit rate of 54 Mbit/s, thus increasing the total peak bit rate by the factor &quot;k&quot;. Different antennas would give different multi-path propagation (echo) signatures, making it possible for digital signal processing techniques to separate different signals from each other. These techniques may also be utilized for space diversity (improved robustness to fading) or beamforming (improved selectivity) rather than multiplexing.

===Frequency-division multiplexing===

Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is inherently an analog technology. FDM achieves the combining of several signals into one medium by sending signals in several distinct frequency ranges over a single medium. In FDM the signals are electrical signals.
One of the most common applications for FDM is traditional radio and television broadcasting from terrestrial, mobile or satellite stations, or cable television. Only one cable reaches a customer&#x27;s residential area, but the service provider can send multiple television channels or signals simultaneously over that cable to all subscribers without interference. Receivers must tune to the appropriate frequency (channel) to access the desired signal.
A variant technology, called wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is used in optical communications.

===Time-division multiplexing===

Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a digital (or in rare cases, analog) technology that uses time, instead of space or frequency, to separate the different data streams. TDM involves sequencing groups of a few bits or bytes from each individual input stream, one after the other, and in such a way that they can be associated with the appropriate receiver. If done sufficiently quickly, the receiving devices will not detect that some of the circuit time was used to serve another logical communication path.

Consider an application requiring four terminals at an airport to reach a central computer. Each terminal communicated at 2400 baud, so rather than acquire four individual circuits to carry such a low-speed transmission, the airline has installed a pair of multiplexers. A pair of 9600 baud modems and one dedicated analog communications circuit from the airport ticket desk back to the airline data center are also installed. Some web proxy servers (e.g. polipo) use TDM in HTTP pipelining of multiple HTTP transactions onto the same TCP/IP connection.

Carrier-sense multiple access and multidrop communication methods are similar to time-division multiplexing in that multiple data streams are separated by time on the same medium, but because the signals have separate origins instead of being combined into a single signal, are best viewed as channel access methods, rather than a form of multiplexing.

TD is a legacy multiplexing technology still providing the backbone of most National fixed-line telephony networks in Europe, providing the 2 Mbit/s voice and signaling ports on narrow-band telephone exchanges such as the DMS100. Each E1 or 2 Mbit/s TDM port provides either 30 or 31 speech timeslots in the case of CCITT7 signaling systems and 30 voice channels for customer-connected Q931, DASS2, DPNSS, V5 and CASS signaling systems.

===Polarization-division multiplexing===
Polarization-division multiplexing uses the polarization of electromagnetic radiation to separate orthogonal channels. It is in practical use in both radio and optical communications, particularly in 100 Gbit/s per channel fiber-optic transmission systems.

Differential Cross-Polarized Wireless Communications is a novel method for polarized antenna transmission utilizing a differential technique.

===Orbital angular momentum multiplexing===

Orbital angular momentum multiplexing is a relatively new and experimental technique for multiplexing multiple channels of signals carried using electromagnetic radiation over a single path. It can potentially be used in addition to other physical multiplexing methods to greatly expand the transmission capacity of such systems. it is still in its early research phase, with small-scale laboratory demonstrations of bandwidths of up to 2.5 Tbit/s over a single light path. This is a controversial subject in the academic community, with many claiming it is not a new method of multiplexing, but rather a special case of space-division multiplexing.

===Code-division multiplexing===
Code-division multiplexing (CDM), code-division multiple access (CDMA) or spread spectrum is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same frequency spectrum, and this spectral bandwidth is much higher than the bit rate or symbol rate. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the spreading factor. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in statistical multiplexing), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to Shannon–Hartley theorem, and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by rake receivers.

A significant application of CDMA is the Global Positioning System (GPS).

==Multiple access method==
A multiplexing technique may be further extended into a multiple access method or channel access method, for example, TDM into time-division multiple access (TDMA) and statistical multiplexing into carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). A multiple-access method makes it possible for several transmitters connected to the same physical medium to share their capacity.

Multiplexing is provided by the physical layer of the OSI model, while multiple access also involves a media access control protocol, which is part of the data link layer.

The Transport layer in the OSI model, as well as TCP/IP model, provides statistical multiplexing of several application layer data flows to/from the same computer.

Code-division multiplexing (CDM) is a technique in which each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses. This coded transmission is typically accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber and asynchronously demultiplexed. Other widely used multiple access techniques are time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA).
Code-division multiplex techniques are used as an access technology, namely code-division multiple access (CDMA), in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) standard for the third-generation (3G) mobile communication identified by the ITU.

==Application areas==

===Telegraphy===
The earliest communication technology using electrical wires, and therefore sharing an interest in the economies afforded by multiplexing, was the electric telegraph. Early experiments allowed two separate messages to travel in opposite directions simultaneously, first using an electric battery at both ends, then at only one end.

Émile Baudot developed a time-multiplexing system of multiple Hughes machines in the 1870s. In 1874, the quadruplex telegraph developed by Thomas Edison transmitted two messages in each direction simultaneously, for a total of four messages transiting the same wire at the same time. Several researchers were investigating acoustic telegraphy, a frequency-division multiplexing technique, which led to the invention of the telephone.

===Telephony===
In telephony, a customer&#x27;s telephone line now typically ends at the remote concentrator box, where it is multiplexed along with other telephone lines for that neighborhood or other similar area. The multiplexed signal is then carried to the central switching office on significantly fewer wires and for much further distances than a customer&#x27;s line can practically go. This is likewise also true for digital subscriber lines (DSL).

Fiber in the loop (FITL) is a common method of multiplexing, which uses optical fiber as the backbone. It not only connects POTS phone lines with the rest of the PSTN, but also replaces DSL by connecting directly to Ethernet wired into the home. Asynchronous Transfer Mode is often the communications protocol used.

Cable TV has long carried multiplexed television channels, and late in the 20th century began offering the same services as telephone companies. IPTV also depends on multiplexing.

===Video processing===

In video editing and processing systems, multiplexing refers to the process of interleaving audio and video into one coherent data stream.

In digital video, such a transport stream is normally a feature of a container format which may include metadata and other information, such as subtitles. The audio and video streams may have variable bit rate. Software that produces such a transport stream and/or container is commonly called a multiplexer or muxer. A demuxer is software that extracts or otherwise makes available for separate processing the components of such a stream or container.

===Digital broadcasting===
In digital television systems, several variable bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bit-rate transport stream by means of statistical multiplexing. This makes it possible to transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. This may involve several standard-definition television (SDTV) programs (particularly on DVB-T, DVB-S2, ISDB and ATSC-C), or one HDTV, possibly with a single SDTV companion channel over one 6 to 8 MHz-wide TV channel. The device that accomplishes this is called a statistical multiplexer. In several of these systems, the multiplexing results in an MPEG transport stream. The newer DVB standards DVB-S2 and DVB-T2 has the capacity to carry several HDTV channels in one multiplex.

In digital radio, a multiplex (also known as an ensemble) is a number of radio stations that are grouped together. A multiplex is a stream of digital information that includes audio and other data.

On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as multiple channel per carrier or MCPC. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single transponder), single channel per carrier mode is used.

===Analog broadcasting===
In FM broadcasting and other analog radio media, multiplexing is a term commonly given to the process of adding subcarriers to the audio signal before it enters the transmitter, where modulation occurs. (In fact, the stereo multiplex signal can be generated using time-division multiplexing, by switching between the two (left channel and right channel) input signals at an ultrasonic rate (the subcarrier), and then filtering out the higher harmonics.) Multiplexing in this sense is sometimes known as MPX, which in turn is also an old term for stereophonic FM, seen on stereo systems since the 1960s.

==Other meanings==
In spectroscopy the term is used to indicate that the experiment is performed with a mixture of frequencies at once and their respective response unraveled afterward using the Fourier transform principle.

In computer programming, it may refer to using a single in-memory resource (such as a file handle) to handle multiple external resources (such as on-disk files).

Some electrical multiplexing techniques do not require a physical &quot;multiplexer&quot; device, they refer to a &quot;keyboard matrix&quot; or &quot;Charlieplexing&quot; design style:
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a multiplexed display (non-multiplexed displays are immune to break up).
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a &quot;switch matrix&quot; (non-multiplexed buttons are immune to &quot;phantom keys&quot; and also immune to &quot;phantom key blocking&quot;).

In high-throughput DNA sequencing, the term is used to indicate that some artificial sequences (often called &quot;barcodes&quot; or &quot;indexes&quot;) have been added to link given sequence reads to a given sample, and thus allow for the sequencing of multiple samples in the same reaction.

In sociolinguistics, multiplexity is used to describe the number of distinct connections between individuals who are part of a social network. A multiplex network is one in which members share a number of ties stemming from more than one social context, such as workmates, neighbors, or relatives.

<text>The National Communications System (NCS) was an office within the United States Department of Homeland Security charged with enabling national security and emergency preparedness communications (NS/EP telecommunications) using the national telecommunications system. The NCS was disbanded by on July 6, 2012.

==Background and history==
The genesis of the NCS began in 1962 after the Cuban Missile Crisis when communications problems among the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and foreign heads of state threatened to complicate the crisis further. After the crisis, President John F. Kennedy ordered an investigation of national security communications, and the National Security Council (NSC) formed an interdepartmental committee to examine the communications networks and institute changes. This interdepartmental committee recommended the formation of a single unified communications system to serve the President, Department of Defense, diplomatic and intelligence activities, and civilian leaders. Consequently, in order to provide better communications support to critical government functions during emergencies, President Kennedy established the National Communications System by a Presidential Memorandum on August 21, 1963. The NCS mandate included linking, improving, and extending the communications facilities and components of various Federal agencies, focusing on interconnectivity and survivability.

On April 3, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed which broadened the NCS&#x27; national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) capabilities and superseded President Kennedy&#x27;s original 1963 memorandum. The NCS expanded from its original six members to an interagency group of 23 federal departments and agencies, and began coordinating and planning NS/EP telecommunications to support crises and disasters.

With the addition of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on September 30, 2007, the NCS membership stood at 24 members.

Each NCS member organization was represented on the NCS through the Committee of Principals (COP) – and its subordinate Council of Representatives (COR). The COP, formed as a result of Executive Order 12472, provided advice and recommendations to the NCS and the National Security Council through the President&#x27;s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board on NS/EP telecommunications and its ties to other critical infrastructures. The NCS also participated in joint industry-Government planning through its work with the President&#x27;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), with the NCS&#x27;s National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC) and the NCC&#x27;s subordinate Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC).

After nearly forty years with the Secretary of Defense serving as its Executive Agent, President George W. Bush transferred the National Communications System to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The NCS was one of 22 federal agencies transferred to the department on March 1, 2003, in accordance with . A revised Executive Order 12472 reflects the changes of E.O. 13286. On November 15, 2005, the NCS became part of the department&#x27;s Directorate for Preparedness after nearly two years under the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. In March 2007 the NCS became an entity of the National Protection and Programs Directorate. The DHS Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate served as the NCS Manager.

On July 6, 2012, President Barack Obama signed , which replaced Executive Order 12472, thus eliminating the NCS as a separate organization; it was merged into the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) of DHS&#x27; National Preparedness and Programs Directorate (NPPD) which had been created in 2007. A ceremony to retire the colors of the NCS and to celebrate the legacy of the organization was held on August 30, 2012 in Arlington, VA. Upon establishment of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the OEC was renamed the Emergency Communications Division (ECD).

The President&#x27;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee helps strengthen United States national security, enhancing cybersecurity, maintaining the global communications infrastructure, assuring communications for disaster response, and addressing critical infrastructure interdependencies and dependencies. On September 29, 2017, President Donald Trump renewed several committees including the &quot;President&#x27;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee&quot;.

==Services ==
In fulfillment of their mission to enable emergency communications, the NCS has created a number of different services.
*NS/EP Priority Telecommunications
**Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) - provides emergency access and priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the public switched wireline network. Used in an emergency or crisis situation during which the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has significantly decreased.
**Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) - provides service vendors with a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate for prioritizing service requests by identifying those services critical to NS/EP. A telecommunications service with a TSP assignment is assured of receiving full attention by the service vendor before a non-TSP service. 
** Wireless Priority Service (WPS) - provides priority cellular network access. The WPS was approved by the FCC for NS/EP requirements on a call-by-call priority basis. The NCS executes the program on behalf of the Executive Office of the President. Only individuals in NS/EP key leadership positions are authorized use of WPS.
*National Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications
**Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN) - The Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN) provides a stable emergency voice communications network connecting telecommunications service providers’ Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and Network Operations Centers (NOCs) to support national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications network restoration coordination, transmission of telecommunications requirements and priorities, and incident reporting when the Public Switched Network (PSN) is inoperable, stressed or congested. It is engineered to provide a reliable and survivable network capability, and, as such, has no logical dependency on the PSN. As a result, if the PSN suffers disruptions, the ACN will not be affected.
**Shared Resources High Frequency Radio Program (SHARES) - The SHARES HF Radio Program brings together the assets of over 1,000 HF radio stations worldwide to voluntarily pass emergency messages when normal communications are destroyed or unavailable. SHARES uses common radio operating and message formatting procedures and more than 250 designated frequencies. Participation in SHARES is open to all Federal departments and agencies and their designated affiliates on a voluntary basis. More than 90 Federal, state, and industry organizations currently contribute resources throughout the United States and in 26 countries and U.S. possessions
**Telecom ISAC - In January 2000, the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism designated the NCC-ISAC as the ISAC for telecommunications. On March 1, 2000, the NCC-ISAC commenced operations. The initial NCC-ISAC membership is based on NCC membership, which is evolving to reflect a broader base of technologies comprising the telecommunications infrastructure. NCC-ISAC will support the mission assigned by Executive Order 12472 and the national critical infrastructure protection goals of government and industry. The NCC-ISAC will facilitate voluntary collaboration and information sharing among its participants gathering information on vulnerabilities, threats, intrusions, and anomalies from telecommunications industry, government, and other sources. The NCC-ISAC will analyze the data with the goal of averting or mitigating impact upon the telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, data will be used to establish baseline statistics and patterns and maintained to provide a library of historical data. Results will be sanitized and disseminated in accordance with sharing agreements established for that purpose by the NCC-ISAC participants.
*Emergency Response Training (ERT)
**Planning, Training, and Exercise Support (PTE) - Our mission is to ensure NCS readiness, enhance partnerships within government and industry, coordinate telecommunications operational planning among NCS elements, develop emergency response requirements, and to provide skilled civilians and reservists during crises and emergencies.
**Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) - The National Communications System (NCS) Augmentee Program was established in 1988 to provide a cadre of skilled civilian and military reservists to enhance the efforts of the Office of the Manager, NCS (OMNCS), the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC), and NCS Regional Managers (RMs) during national crises and emergencies. The NCS Augmentee Program consists of two components: the civilian members of the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER) and the U.S. Army reservists participating in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Program.

<text>The National Information Infrastructure (NII) was the product of the High Performance Computing Act of 1991. It was a telecommunications policy buzzword, which was popularized during the Clinton Administration under the leadership of Vice-President Al Gore.

It proposed to build communications networks, interactive services, interoperable computer hardware and software, computers, databases, and consumer electronics in order to put vast amounts of information available to both public and private sectors. NII was to have included more than just the physical facilities (more than the cameras, scanners, keyboards, telephones, fax machines, computers, switches, compact disks, video and audio tape, cable, wire, satellites, optical fiber transmission lines, microwave nets, switches, televisions, monitors, and printers) used to transmit, store, process, and display voice, data, and images; it was also to encompass a wide range of interactive functions, user-tailored services, and multimedia databases that were interconnected in a technology-neutral manner that will favor no one industry over any other.

<doc id="41402" wikidata="Q50094" url="?curid=41402" title="Neper">
<text>The neper (symbol: Np) is a logarithmic unit for ratios of measurements of physical field and power quantities, such as gain and loss of electronic signals. The unit&#x27;s name is derived from the name of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms. As is the case for the decibel and bel, the neper is a unit defined in the international standard ISO 80000. It is not part of the International System of Units (SI), but is accepted for use alongside the SI.

==Definition==
Like the decibel, the neper is a unit in a logarithmic scale. While the bel uses the decadic (base-10) logarithm to compute ratios, the neper uses the natural logarithm, based on Euler&#x27;s number (). The level of a ratio of two signal amplitudes or root-power quantities, with the unit neper, is given by
:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 are the signal amplitudes, and is the natural logarithm. The level of a ratio of two power quantities, with the unit neper, is given by
:formula_4

where formula_5 and formula_6 are the signal powers.

In the International System of Quantities, the neper is defined as .

==Units==
The neper is defined in terms of ratios of field quantities — also called &quot;root-power quantities&quot; — (for example, voltage or current amplitudes in electrical circuits, or pressure in acoustics), whereas the decibel was originally defined in terms of power ratios. A power ratio 10 log &quot;r&quot; dB is equivalent to a field-quantity ratio 20 log &quot;r&quot; dB, since power in a linear system is proportional to the square (Joule&#x27;s laws) of the amplitude. Hence the decibel and the neper have a fixed ratio to each other:
:formula_7
and
:formula_8

The (voltage) level ratio is
:formula_9

Like the decibel, the neper is a dimensionless unit. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recognizes both units. Only the neper is coherent with the SI.

==Applications==
The neper is a natural linear unit of relative difference, meaning in nepers (logarithmic units) relative differences add rather than multiply. This property is shared with logarithmic units in other bases, such as the bel.

The derived units decineper (1 dNp = 0.1 neper) and centineper (1 cNp = 0.01 neper) are also used. The centineper for root-power quantities corresponds to a log point or log percentage, see &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="41403" wikidata="Q6998464" url="?curid=41403" title="Net gain (telecommunications)">
<text>In telecommunications, net gain is the overall gain of a transmission circuit. Net gain is measured by applying a test signal at an appropriate power level at the input port of a circuit and measuring the power delivered at the output port. The net gain in dB is calculated by taking 10 times the common logarithm of the ratio of the output power to the input power.

The net gain expressed in dB may be positive or negative. If the net gain expressed in dB is negative, it is also called the net loss. If the net gain is expressed as a ratio, and the ratio is less than unity, a net loss is indicated.

The test signal must be chosen so that its power level is within the usual operating range of the circuit being tested.

<doc id="41404" wikidata="Q6998493" url="?curid=41404" title="Net operation">
<text>A radio net is three or more radio stations communicating with each other on a common channel or frequency. A net is essentially a moderated conference call conducted over two-way radio, typically in half-duplex operating conditions. The use of half-duplex operation requires a very particular set of operating procedures to be followed in order to avoid inefficiencies and chaos.

Nets operate either on schedule or continuously (continuous watch). Nets operating on schedule handle traffic only at definite, prearranged times and in accordance with a prearranged schedule of intercommunication. Nets operating continuously are prepared to handle traffic at any time; they maintain operators on duty at all stations in the net at all times. When practicable, messages relating to schedules will be transmitted by a means of signal communication other than radio.

Net operations:
* allow participants to conduct ordered conferences among participants who usually have common information needs or related functions to perform
* are characterized by adherence to standard formats and procedures, and
* are responsive to a common supervisory station, called the &quot;&quot;net control station&quot;,&quot; which permits access to the net and maintains net operational discipline.

== Net manager ==
A net manager is the person who supervises the creation and operation of a net over multiple sessions. This person will specify the format, date, time, participants, and the net control script. The net manager will also choose the Net Control Station for each net, and may occasionally take on that function, especially in smaller organizations.

== Net Control Station ==
Radio nets are like conference calls in that both have a moderator who initiates the group communication, who ensures all participants follow the standard procedures, and who determines and directs when each other station may talk. The moderator in a radio net is called the Net Control Station, formally abbreviated NCS, and has the following duties:
* Establishes the net and closes the net;
* Directs Net activities, such as passing traffic, to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Chooses net frequency, maintains circuit discipline and frequency accuracy;
* Maintains a net log and records participation in the net and movement of messages; (always knows who is on and off net)
* Appoints one or more Alternate Net Control Stations (ANCS);
* Determines whether and when to conduct network continuity checks;
* Determines when full procedure and full call signs may enhance communications;
* Subject to Net Manager guidance, directs a net to be directed or free.
The Net Control Station will, for each net, appoint at least one Alternate Net Control Station, formally abbreviated ANCS (abbreviated NC2 in WWII procedures), who has the following duties:
* Assists the NCS to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Assumes NCS duties in event that the NCS develops station problems;
* Assumes NCS duties for a portion of the net, as directed or as needed;
* Serves as a resource for the NCS; echoes transmissions of the NCS if, and only if, directed to do so by the NCS;
* Maintains a duplicate net log

== Structure of the net ==
Nets can be described as always having a net opening and a net closing, with a roll call normally following the net opening, itself followed by regular net business, which may include announcements, official business, and message passing. Military nets will follow a very abbreviated and opaque version of the structure outlined below, but will still have the critical elements of opening, roll call, late check-ins, and closing.

A net should always operate on the same principle as the inverted pyramid used in journalism—the most important communications always come first, followed by content in ever lower levels of priority.
# Net opening
## Identification of the NCS
## Announcement of the regular date, time, and frequency of the net
## Purpose of the net
# Roll call
## A call for stations to check in, oftentimes from a roster of regular stations
## A call for late check-ins (stations on the roster who did not respond to the first check-in period)
## A call for guest stations to check in
# Net business
# Optional conversion to a free net
# Net closing
Each net will typically have a main purpose, which varies according to the organization conducting the net, which occurs during the net business phase. For amateur radio nets, it&#x27;s typically for the purpose of allowing stations to discuss their recent operating activities (stations worked, antennas built, etc.) or to swap equipment. For Military Auxiliary Radio System and National Traffic System nets, net business will involve mainly the passing of formal messages, known as radiograms.

== Two modes of net operation ==
* Directed Net
** A net in which no station other than the net control station can communicate with any other station, except for the transmission of urgent messages, without first obtaining the permission of the net control station.
* Free net
** A net in which any station may communicate with any other station in the same net without first obtaining permission from the net control station to do so.

== Net-control procedure words ==
U.S. Army Field Manual ACP 125(G) has the most complete set of procedure words used in radio nets:
== Types of radio nets ==
Maritime mobile nets serve the needs of seagoing vessels.

=== Civil Air Patrol nets ===
The Civil Air Patrol defines a different set of nets:
=== Amateur radio nets ===
The International Amateur Radio Union defines six different types of nets in its IARU Emergency Telecommunications Guide:

Other Amateur radio net types

=== U.S. Military radio nets ===
The U.S. Army Field Manual FM 6-02.53, Tactical Radio Operations, defines the following types of radio nets:
== Maritime radio nets ==

When boats or ships are in distress, they will operate a maritime broadcast communications net to communicate among the vessel in distress and all the other vessels, aircraft, and shore stations assisting in the distress response.

<doc id="41406" wikidata="Q639681" url="?curid=41406" title="Network architecture">
<text>Network architecture is the design of a computer network. It is a framework for the specification of a network&#x27;s physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as communication protocols used.

In telecommunications, the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network, as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated.

The network architecture of the Internet is predominantly expressed by its use of the Internet protocol suite, rather than a specific model for interconnecting networks or nodes in the network, or the usage of specific types of hardware links.

== OSI model ==
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) defines and codifies the concept of layered network architecture. Abstraction layers are used to subdivide a communications system further into smaller manageable parts. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests services from the layer below.

== Distributed computing ==
In distributed computing, the &quot;network architecture&quot; often describes the structure and classification of a distributed application architecture, as the participating nodes in a distributed application are often referred to as a &quot;network&quot;. For example, the applications architecture of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) has been termed the Intelligent Network. There are a number of specific classifications but all lie on a continuum between the dumb network (e.g. the Internet) and the intelligent network (e.g. the PSTN).

A popular example of such usage of the term in distributed applications, as well as permanent virtual circuits, is the organization of nodes in peer-to-peer (P2P) services and networks. P2P networks usually implement overlay networks running over an underlying physical or logical network. These overlay networks may implement certain organizational structures of the nodes according to several distinct models, the network architecture of the system.

<text>In telecommunications, a network interface device (NID; also known by several other names) is a device that serves as the demarcation point between the carrier&#x27;s local loop and the customer&#x27;s premises wiring. Outdoor telephone NIDs also provide the subscriber with access to the station wiring and serve as a convenient test point for verification of loop integrity and of the subscriber&#x27;s inside wiring.

== Naming ==
Generically, an NID may also be called a network interface unit (NIU), telephone network interface (TNI), system network interface (SNI), or telephone network box.

Australia&#x27;s National Broadband Network uses the term &quot;network termination device&quot; or NTD.

A smartjack is a type of NID with capabilities beyond simple electrical connection, such as diagnostics.

An optical network terminal (ONT) is a type of NID used with fiber-to-the-premises applications.

== Wiring termination ==
The simplest NIDs are essentially just a specialized set of wiring terminals. These will typically take the form of a small, weather-proof box, mounted on the outside of the building. The telephone line from the telephone company will enter the NID and be connected to one side. The customer connects their wiring to the other side. A single NID enclosure may contain termination for a single line or multiple lines.

In its role as the demarcation point (dividing line), the NID separates the telephone company&#x27;s equipment from the customer&#x27;s wiring and equipment. The telephone company owns the NID and all wiring up to it. Anything past the NID is the customer&#x27;s responsibility. To facilitate this, there is typically a test jack inside the NID. Accessing the test jack disconnects the customer premises wiring from the public switched telephone network and allows the customer to plug a &quot;known good&quot; telephone into the jack to isolate trouble. If the telephone works at the test jack, the problem is the customer&#x27;s wiring, and the customer is responsible for repair. If the telephone does not work, the line is faulty and the telephone company is responsible for repair.

Most NIDs also include &quot;circuit protectors&quot;, which are surge protectors for a telephone line. They protect customer wiring, equipment, and personnel from any transient energy on the line, such as from a lightning strike to a utility pole.

Simple NIDs are &quot;dumb&quot; devices, as they contain no digital logic. They have no capabilities beyond wiring termination, circuit protection, and providing a place to connect test equipment.

== Smartjack ==
Several types of NIDs provide more than just a terminal for the connection of wiring. Such NIDs are colloquially called &quot;smartjacks&quot; or Intelligent Network Interface Devices (INIDs) as an indication of their built-in &quot;intelligence&quot;, as opposed to a simple NID, which is just a wiring device. Smartjacks are typically used for more complicated types of telecommunications service, such as T1 lines. Plain old telephone service lines generally cannot be equipped with smartjacks.

Despite the name, most smartjacks are much more than a simple telephone jack. One common form for a smartjack is a printed circuit board with a face plate on one edge, mounted in an enclosure.

A smartjack may provide signal conversion, converting codes and protocols, &quot;e.g.&quot;, framing types, to the type needed by the customer equipment. It may buffer and/or regenerate the signal, to compensate for signal degradation from line transmission, similar to what a repeater does.

Smartjacks also typically provide diagnostic capabilities. A very common capability provided by a smartjack is loopback, such that the signal from the telephone company is transmitted back to the telephone company. This allows the company to test the line from the central telephone exchange, without the need to have test equipment at the customer site. The telephone company usually has the ability to remotely activate loopback, without even needing personnel at the customer site. When looped back, the customer equipment is disconnected from the line.

Additional smartjack diagnostic capabilities include alarm indication signal, which reports trouble at one end of the line to the far end. This helps the telephone company know if trouble is present in the line, the smartjack, or customer equipment. Indicator lights to show configuration, status, and alarms are also common.

Smartjacks typically derive their operating power from the telephone line, rather than relying on premises electrical power, although this is not a universal rule.

== Optical network terminals ==

In fiber-to-the-premises systems, the signal is transmitted to the customer premises using optical fiber technologies. Unlike many conventional telephone technologies, this does not provide power for premises equipment, nor is it suitable for direct connection to customer equipment. An optical network terminal (ONT, an ITU-T term), also known as an optical network unit (ONU, an IEEE term), is used to terminate the optical fiber line, demultiplex the signal into its component parts (voice telephone, television, and Internet access), and provide power to customer telephones. If the device combines all these services into one it is known as an IAD. As the ONT must derive its power from the customer premises electrical supply, many ONTs have the option for a battery backup in order to maintain service in the event of a power outage. These terminals are used in both active optical networks and passive optical networks. An ONT can work in Single Family Unit/SFU mode (modem/bridge) or Home Gateway Unit/HGU mode (router).

== Environmental conditions ==
According to Telcordia GR-49 requirements for telecommunications, NIDs vary based on three categories of environmental conditions:
# Normal conditions: This refers to a normal environment that is expected in most areas of any service provider. Temperatures are expected to be in the range of , and humidity is expected to be less than 90% RH. No unusual contamination is expected.
# Severe climatic conditions: These cover environments more severe than those of a normal environment (i.e., higher humidity, high lightning activity, exposure to salt-laden atmosphere, and exposure to contaminants). Temperatures are expected to be in the range of , and humidity may exceed 90% RH. Jacks installed in NIDs in such environments are known to become contaminated and develop low insulation resistances and low dielectric breakdown voltages when subjected to high humidity. These problems can cause noisy lines or even service outages.
# Flooded conditions: These cover areas of a service provider prone to flooding, such as in coastal or flood plain locations. After a flooding incident, temperature is expected to be in the range of , and humidity may exceed 90% RH. The requirements are not to determine if the NID will function during a flood, but to review the ability of the NID to function after the flood has subsided.

Service providers must decide which condition best suits their application.

<text>Network management is the process of administering and managing computer networks. Services provided by this discipline include fault analysis, performance management, provisioning of networks and maintaining quality of service. Network management software is used by network administrators to help perform these functions.

==Technologies==
A small number of accessory methods exist to support network and network device management. Network management allows IT professionals to monitor network components within large network area. Access methods include the SNMP, command-line interface (CLI), custom XML, CMIP, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Transaction Language 1 (TL1), CORBA, NETCONF, RESTCONF and the Java Management Extensions (JMX).

Schemas include the Structure of Management Information (SMI), YANG, WBEM, the Common Information Model (CIM Schema), and MTOSI amongst others.

== Value ==
Effective network management can provide positive strategic impacts. For example, in the case of developing an infrastructure, providing participants with some interactive space allows them to collaborate with each other, thereby promoting overall benefits. At the same time, the value of network management to the strategic network is also affected by the relationship between participants. Active participation, interaction and collaboration can make them more trusting of each other and enhance cohesion.

<text>A network operating system (NOS) is a specialized operating system for a network device such as a router, switch or firewall.

Historically operating systems with networking capabilities were described as network operating systems, because they allowed personal computers (PCs) to participate in computer networks and shared file and printer access within a local area network (LAN). This description of operating systems is now largely historical, as common operating systems include a network stack to support a client–server model.

==Key Functions==
Network Operating Systems (NOS) are responsible for managing various network activities. Key functions include creating and managing user accounts, controlling access to resources such as files and printers, and facilitating communication between devices. NOS also monitors network performance, addresses issues, and manages resources to ensure efficient and secure operation of the network.

==History==
Packet switching networks were developed to share hardware resources, such as a mainframe computer, a printer or a large and expensive hard disk.

Historically, a network operating system was an operating system for a computer which implemented network capabilities. Operating systems with a network stack allowed personal computers to participate in a client-server architecture in which a server enables multiple clients to share resources, such as printers.

These limited client/server networks were gradually replaced by Peer-to-peer networks, which used networking capabilities to share resources and files located on a variety of computers of all sizes. A peer-to-peer network sets all connected computers equal; they all share the same abilities to use resources available on the network.

Today, distributed computing and groupware applications have become the norm. Computer operating systems include a networking stack as a matter of course. During the 1980s the need to integrate dissimilar computers with network capabilities grew and the number of networked devices grew rapidly. Partly because it allowed for multi-vendor interoperability, and could route packets globally rather than being restricted to a single building, the Internet protocol suite became almost universally adopted in network architectures. Thereafter, computer operating systems and the firmware of network devices tended to support Internet protocols.

==Network device operating systems== 
Network operating systems can be embedded in a router or hardware firewall that operates the functions in the network layer (layer 3). Notable network operating systems include:

===Proprietary network operating systems===
* Cisco IOS, a family of network operating systems used on Cisco Systems routers and network switches. (Earlier switches ran the Catalyst operating system, or CatOS)
* RouterOS by MikroTik
* ZyNOS, used in network devices made by ZyXEL

=== FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux-based operating systems ===
* Cisco NX-OS, IOS XE, and IOS XR; families of network operating systems used across various Cisco Systems device including the Cisco Nexus and Cisco ASR platforms
* Junos OS; a network operating system that runs on Juniper Networks platforms
* Cumulus Linux distribution, which uses the full TCP/IP stack of Linux
* DD-WRT, a Linux kernel-based firmware for wireless routers and access points as well as low-cost networking device platforms such as the Linksys WRT54G
* Dell Networking Operating System; DNOS9 is NetBSD based, while OS10 uses the Linux kernel
* Extensible Operating System runs on switches from Arista and uses an unmodified Linux kernel 
* ExtremeXOS (EXOS), used in network devices made by Extreme Networks
* FTOS (Force10 Operating System), the firmware family used on Force10 Ethernet switches
* ONOS, an open source SDN operating system (hosted by Linux Foundation) for communications service providers that is designed for scalability, high performance and high availability.
* OpenBSD, an open source operating system which includes its own implementations of BGP, RPKI, OSPF, MPLS, VXLAN, and other IETF standardized networking protocols, as well as firewall (PF) and load-balancing functionality.
* OpenWrt used to route IP packets on embedded devices
* pfSense, a fork of M0n0wall, which uses PF
* OPNsense, a fork of pfSense
* SONiC, a Linux-based network operating system developed by Microsoft

<text>Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks, industrial fieldbusses and computer networks.

Network topology is the topological structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically. It is an application of graph theory wherein communicating devices are modeled as nodes and the connections between the devices are modeled as links or lines between the nodes. Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), while logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. Distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal types may differ between two different networks, yet their logical topologies may be identical. A network&#x27;s physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model. 

Examples of network topologies are found in local area networks (LAN), a common computer network installation. Any given node in the LAN has one or more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison, Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology.

==Topologies==
Two basic categories of network topologies exist, physical topologies and logical topologies.

The transmission medium layout used to link devices is the physical topology of the network. For conductive or fiber optical mediums, this refers to the layout of cabling, the locations of nodes, and the links between the nodes and the cabling. The physical topology of a network is determined by the capabilities of the network access devices and media, the level of control or fault tolerance desired, and the cost associated with cabling or telecommunication circuits.

In contrast, logical topology is the way that the signals act on the network media, or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices. A network&#x27;s logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology. For example, the original twisted pair Ethernet using repeater hubs was a logical bus topology carried on a physical star topology. Token Ring is a logical ring topology, but is wired as a physical star from the media access unit. Physically, Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) can be a cascaded star topology of multiple dual redundant Ethernet switches; however, the AFDX virtual links are modeled as time-switched single-transmitter bus connections, thus following the safety model of a single-transmitter bus topology previously used in aircraft. Logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and protocols. Some networks are able to dynamically change their logical topology through configuration changes to their routers and switches.

==Links==

The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the &quot;physical media&quot;) used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cables (Ethernet, HomePNA, power line communication, G.hn), optical fiber (fiber-optic communication), and radio waves (wireless networking). In the OSI model, these are defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer.

A widely adopted &quot;family&quot; of transmission media used in local area network (LAN) technology is collectively known as Ethernet. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables. Wireless LAN standards (e.g. those defined by IEEE 802.11) use radio waves, or others use infrared signals as a transmission medium. Power line communication uses a building&#x27;s power cabling to transmit data.

===Wired technologies===

The orders of the following wired technologies are, roughly, from slowest to fastest transmission speed.

*&quot;Coaxial cable&quot; is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. The cables consist of copper or aluminum wire surrounded by an insulating layer (typically a flexible material with a high dielectric constant), which itself is surrounded by a conductive layer. The insulation between the conductors helps maintain the characteristic impedance of the cable which can help improve its performance. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.
*&quot;ITU-T G.hn&quot; technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network.
* &quot;Signal traces&quot; on printed circuit boards are common for board-level serial communication, particularly between certain types integrated circuits, a common example being SPI.
*&quot;Ribbon cable&quot; (untwisted and possibly unshielded) has been a cost-effective media for serial protocols, especially within metallic enclosures or rolled within copper braid or foil, over short distances, or at lower data rates. Several serial network protocols can be deployed without shielded or twisted pair cabling, that is, with flat or ribbon cable, or a hybrid flat and twisted ribbon cable, should EMC, length, and bandwidth constraints permit: RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN, GPIB, SCSI, etc.
*&quot;Twisted pair wire&quot; is the most widely used medium for all telecommunication. Twisted-pair cabling consist of copper wires that are twisted into pairs. Ordinary telephone wires consist of two insulated copper wires twisted into pairs. Computer network cabling (wired Ethernet as defined by IEEE 802.3) consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.
*An &quot;optical fiber&quot; is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity from electrical interference. Optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent, and helps enable data rates of up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea communications cables to interconnect continents.

Price is a main factor distinguishing wired- and wireless technology options in a business. Wireless options command a price premium that can make purchasing wired computers, printers and other devices a financial benefit. Before making the decision to purchase hard-wired technology products, a review of the restrictions and limitations of the selections is necessary. Business and employee needs may override any cost considerations.

===Wireless technologies===
*&quot;Terrestrial microwave&quot; – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately apart.
*&quot;Communications satellites&quot; – Satellites communicate via microwave radio waves, which are not deflected by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geostationary orbit above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.
*&quot;Cellular and PCS systems&quot; use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area has a low-power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area.
*&quot;Radio and spread spectrum technologies&quot; – Wireless local area networks use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low-frequency radio technology. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.
*&quot;Free-space optical communication&quot; uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.

===Exotic technologies===
There have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media:

* IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool&#x27;s Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.
* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the Interplanetary Internet.

Both cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication, but does not prevent sending large amounts of information.

==Nodes==
Network nodes are the points of connection of the transmission medium to transmitters and receivers of the electrical, optical, or radio signals carried in the medium. Nodes may be associated with a computer, but certain types may have only a microcontroller at a node or possibly no programmable device at all. In the simplest of serial arrangements, one RS-232 transmitter can be connected by a pair of wires to one receiver, forming two nodes on one link, or a Point-to-Point topology. Some protocols permit a single node to only either transmit or receive (e.g., ARINC 429). Other protocols have nodes that can both transmit and receive into a single channel (e.g., CAN can have many transceivers connected to a single bus). While the conventional system building blocks of a computer network include network interface controllers (NICs), repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, gateways, and firewalls, most address network concerns beyond the physical network topology and may be represented as single nodes on a particular physical network topology.
===Network interfaces===

A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.

The NIC responds to traffic addressed to a network address for either the NIC or the computer as a whole.

In Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller&#x27;s permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.

===Repeaters and hubs===
A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal may be reformed or retransmitted at a higher power level, to the other side of an obstruction possibly using a different transmission medium, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. Commercial repeaters have extended RS-232 segments from 15 meters to over a kilometer. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.

Repeaters work within the physical layer of the OSI model, that is, there is no end-to-end change in the physical protocol across the repeater, or repeater pair, even if a different physical layer may be used between the ends of the repeater, or repeater pair. Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule.

A repeater with multiple ports is known as hub, an Ethernet hub in Ethernet networks, a USB hub in USB networks.
* USB networks use hubs to form tiered-star topologies.
* Ethernet hubs and repeaters in LANs have been mostly obsoleted by modern switches.

===Bridges===
A network bridge connects and filters traffic between two network segments at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to form a single network. This breaks the network&#x27;s collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.

Bridges come in three basic types:
*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs
*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.
*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.

===Switches===
A network switch is a device that forwards and filters OSI layer 2 datagrams (frames) between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame.
A switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge. It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.

Multi-layer switches are capable of routing based on layer 3 addressing or additional logical levels. The term &quot;switch&quot; is often used loosely to include devices such as routers and bridges, as well as devices that may distribute traffic based on load or based on application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier).

===Routers===

A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3). The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table). A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a black hole because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.

===Modems===
Modems (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology.

===Firewalls===
A firewall is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.

==Classification==
The study of network topology recognizes eight basic topologies: point-to-point, bus, star, ring or circular, mesh, tree, hybrid, or daisy chain.

===Point-to-point===

The simplest topology with a dedicated link between two endpoints. Easiest to understand, of the variations of point-to-point topology, is a point-to-point communication channel that appears, to the user, to be permanently associated with the two endpoints. A child&#x27;s tin can telephone is one example of a &quot;physical dedicated&quot; channel.

Using circuit-switching or packet-switching technologies, a point-to-point circuit can be set up dynamically and dropped when no longer needed. Switched point-to-point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony.

The value of a permanent point-to-point network is unimpeded communications between the two endpoints. The value of an on-demand point-to-point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as Metcalfe&#x27;s Law.

===Daisy chain===
Daisy chaining is accomplished by connecting each computer in series to the next. If a message is intended for a computer partway down the line, each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination. A daisy-chained network can take two basic forms: linear and ring.

* A linear topology puts a two-way link between one computer and the next. However, this was expensive in the early days of computing, since each computer (except for the ones at each end) required two receivers and two transmitters.
* By connecting the computers at each end of the chain, a ring topology can be formed. When a node sends a message, the message is processed by each computer in the ring. An advantage of the ring is that the number of transmitters and receivers can be cut in half. Since a message will eventually loop all of the way around, transmission does not need to go both directions. Alternatively, the ring can be used to improve fault tolerance. If the ring breaks at a particular link then the transmission can be sent via the reverse path thereby ensuring that all nodes are always connected in the case of a single failure.

===Bus===
In local area networks using bus topology, each node is connected by interface connectors to a single central cable. This is the &#x27;bus&#x27;, also referred to as the backbone, or trunk – all data transmission between nodes in the network is transmitted over this common transmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.

A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in both directions to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient, which then accepts the data. If the machine address does not match the intended address for the data, the data portion of the signal is ignored. Since the bus topology consists of only one wire it is less expensive to implement than other topologies, but the savings are offset by the higher cost of managing the network. Additionally, since the network is dependent on the single cable, it can be the single point of failure of the network. In this topology data being transferred may be accessed by any node.

====Linear bus====
In a linear bus network, all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has just two endpoints. When the electrical signal reaches the end of the bus, the signal is reflected back down the line, causing unwanted interference. To prevent this, the two endpoints of the bus are normally terminated with a device called a terminator.

====Distributed bus====
In a distributed bus network, all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium with more than two endpoints, created by adding branches to the main section of the transmission medium – the physical distributed bus topology functions in exactly the same fashion as the physical linear bus topology because all nodes share a common transmission medium.

===Star===
In star topology (also called hub-and-spoke), every peripheral node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node called a hub or switch. The hub is the server and the peripherals are the clients. The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network, but all of the peripheral nodes on the network must be connected to one central hub. All traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub, which acts as a signal repeater. 

The star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement. One advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional nodes. The primary disadvantage of the star topology is that the hub represents a single point of failure. Also, since all peripheral communication must flow through the central hub, the aggregate central bandwidth forms a network bottleneck for large clusters.

====Extended star====
The extended star network topology extends a physical star topology by one or more repeaters between the central node and the peripheral (or &#x27;spoke&#x27;) nodes. The repeaters are used to extend the maximum transmission distance of the physical layer, the point-to-point distance between the central node and the peripheral nodes. Repeaters allow greater transmission distance, further than would be possible using just the transmitting power of the central node. The use of repeaters can also overcome limitations from the standard upon which the physical layer is based.

A physical extended star topology in which repeaters are replaced with hubs or switches is a type of hybrid network topology and is referred to as a physical hierarchical star topology, although some texts make no distinction between the two topologies.

A physical hierarchical star topology can also be referred as a tier-star topology. This topology differs from a tree topology in the way star networks are connected together. A tier-star topology uses a central node, while a tree topology uses a central bus and can also be referred as a star-bus network.

====Distributed star====
A distributed star is a network topology that is composed of individual networks that are based upon the physical star topology connected in a linear fashion – i.e., &#x27;daisy-chained&#x27; – with no central or top level connection point (e.g., two or more &#x27;stacked&#x27; hubs, along with their associated star connected nodes or &#x27;spokes&#x27;).

===Ring===

A ring topology is a daisy chain in a closed loop. Data travels around the ring in one direction. When one node sends data to another, the data passes through each intermediate node on the ring until it reaches its destination. The intermediate nodes repeat (retransmit) the data to keep the signal strong. Every node is a peer; there is no hierarchical relationship of clients and servers. If one node is unable to retransmit data, it severs communication between the nodes before and after it in the bus.

Advantages:
* When the load on the network increases, its performance is better than bus topology.
* There is no need of network server to control the connectivity between workstations.

Disadvantages:
* Aggregate network bandwidth is bottlenecked by the weakest link between two nodes.

===Mesh===

The value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers, assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints, up to and including all the endpoints, is approximated by Reed&#x27;s Law.

====Fully connected network====
In a &quot;fully connected network&quot;, all nodes are interconnected. (In graph theory this is called a complete graph.) The simplest fully connected network is a two-node network. A fully connected network doesn&#x27;t need to use packet switching or broadcasting. However, since the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes:

formula_1

This makes it impractical for large networks. This kind of topology does not trip and affect other nodes in the network.

====Partially connected network====

In a partially connected network, certain nodes are connected to exactly one other node; but some nodes are connected to two or more other nodes with a point-to-point link. This makes it possible to make use of some of the redundancy of mesh topology that is physically fully connected, without the expense and complexity required for a connection between every node in the network.

===Hybrid===
Hybrid topology is also known as hybrid network. Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies (e.g., bus, star, ring, etc.). For example, a tree network (or &quot;star-bus network&quot;) is a hybrid topology in which star networks are interconnected via bus networks. However, a tree network connected to another tree network is still topologically a tree network, not a distinct network type. A hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected.

A &quot;star-ring&quot; network consists of two or more ring networks connected using a multistation access unit (MAU) as a centralized hub.

&quot;Snowflake&quot; topology is meshed at the core, but tree shaped at the edges.

Two other hybrid network types are &quot;hybrid mesh&quot; and &quot;hierarchical star&quot;.

==Centralization==
The star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node. When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet, this central node (traditionally a hub) rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes.

If the central node is &quot;passive&quot;, the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission, delayed by the two-way round trip transmission time (i.e. to and from the central node) plus any delay generated in the central node. An &quot;active&quot; star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems.

A tree topology (a.k.a. hierarchical topology) can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy. This tree structure has individual peripheral nodes (e.g. leaves) which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators. Unlike the star network, the functionality of the central node may be distributed.

As in the conventional star network, individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single-point failure of a transmission path to the node. If a link connecting a leaf fails, that leaf is isolated; if a connection to a non-leaf node fails, an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest.

To alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes, more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network. These network switches will &quot;learn&quot; the layout of the network by &quot;listening&quot; on each port during normal data transmission, examining the data packets and recording the address/identifier of each connected node and which port it is connected to in a lookup table held in memory. This lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only.

Daisy chain topology is a way of connecting network nodes in a linear or ring structure. It is used to transmit messages from one node to the next until they reach the destination node.

A daisy chain network can have two types: linear and ring. A linear daisy chain network is like an electrical series, where the first and last nodes are not connected. A ring daisy chain network is where the first and last nodes are connected, forming a loop.

==Decentralization==
In a partially connected mesh topology, there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths in case the link providing one of the paths fails. Decentralization is often used to compensate for the single-point-failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node (e.g., in star and tree networks). A special kind of mesh, limiting the number of hops between two nodes, is a hypercube. The number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement, but their decentralized nature makes them very useful.

This is similar in some ways to a grid network, where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions. A multidimensional ring has a toroidal topology, for instance.

A &quot;fully connected network&quot;, &quot;complete topology&quot;, or &quot;full mesh topology&quot; is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes. In a fully connected network with n nodes, there are formula_2 direct links. Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up, but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes. This topology is mostly seen in military applications.

<text>Noise is sound, chiefly unwanted, unintentional, or harmful sound considered unpleasant, loud, or disruptive to mental or hearing faculties. From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.

In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting. In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.

== Measurement ==

Sound is measured based on the amplitude and frequency of a sound wave. Amplitude measures how forceful the wave is. The energy in a sound wave is measured in decibels (dB), the measure of loudness, or intensity of a sound; this measurement describes the amplitude of a sound wave. Decibels are expressed in a logarithmic scale. On the other hand, pitch describes the frequency of a sound and is measured in hertz (Hz).

The main instrument to measure sounds in the air is the Sound Level Meter. There are many different varieties of instruments that are used to measure noise - Noise Dosimeters are often used in occupational environments, noise monitors are used to measure environmental noise and noise pollution, and recently smartphone-based sound level meter applications (apps) are being used to crowdsource and map recreational and community noise.

A-weighting is applied to a sound spectrum to represent the sound that humans are capable of hearing at each frequency. Sound pressure is thus expressed in terms of dBA. 0 dBA is the softest level that a person can hear. Normal speaking voices are around 65 dBA. A rock concert can be about 120 dBA.

== Recording and reproduction ==
In audio, recording, and broadcast systems, audio noise refers to the residual low-level sound (four major types: hiss, rumble, crackle, and hum) that is heard in quiet periods of program. This variation from the expected pure sound or silence can be caused by the audio recording equipment, the instrument, or ambient noise in the recording room.

In audio engineering it can refer either to the acoustic noise from loudspeakers or to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as hiss. This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting

Noise is often generated deliberately and used as a test signal for audio recording and reproduction equipment.

== Environmental noise ==

Environmental noise is the accumulation of all noise present in a specified environment. The principal sources of environmental noise are surface motor vehicles, aircraft, trains and industrial sources. These noise sources expose millions of people to noise pollution that creates not only annoyance, but also significant health consequences such as elevated incidence of hearing loss, cardiovascular disease, and many others. Urban noise is generally not of an intensity that causes hearing loss but it interrupts sleep, disturbs communication and interferes with other human activities. There are a variety of mitigation strategies and controls available to reduce sound levels including source intensity reduction, land-use planning strategies, noise barriers and sound baffles, time of day use regimens, vehicle operational controls and architectural acoustics design measures.

== Regulation ==
Certain geographic areas or specific occupations may be at a higher risk of being exposed to constantly high levels of noise; regulation may prevent negative health outcomes. Noise regulation includes statutes or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and municipal levels of government. Environmental noise is governed by laws and standards which set maximum recommended levels of noise for specific land uses, such as residential areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, or schools. These standards usually specify measurement using a weighting filter, most often A-weighting.

=== United States ===
In 1972, the Noise Control Act was passed to promote a healthy living environment for all Americans, where noise does not pose a threat to human health. This policy&#x27;s main objectives were: (1) establish coordination of research in the area of noise control, (2) establish federal standards on noise emission for commercial products, and (3) promote public awareness about noise emission and reduction.

The Quiet Communities Act of 1978 promotes noise control programs at the state and local level and developed a research program on noise control. Both laws authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to study the effects of noise and evaluate regulations regarding noise control.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provides recommendation on noise exposure in the workplace. In 1972 (revised in 1998), NIOSH published a document outlining recommended standards relating to the occupational exposure to noise, with the purpose of reducing the risk of developing permanent hearing loss related to exposure at work. This publication set the recommended exposure limit (REL) of noise in an occupation setting to 85 dBA for 8 hours using a 3-dB exchange rate (every 3-dB increase in level, duration of exposure should be cut in half, i.e., 88 dBA for 4 hours, 91 dBA for 2 hours, 94 dBA for 1 hour, etc.). However, in 1973 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) maintained the requirement of an 8-hour average of 90 dBA. The following year, OSHA required employers to provide a hearing conservation program to workers exposed to 85 dBA average 8-hour workdays.

=== Europe ===
The European Environment Agency regulates noise control and surveillance within the European Union. The Environmental Noise Directive was set to determine levels of noise exposure, increase public access to information regarding environmental noise, and reduce environmental noise. Additionally, in the European Union, underwater noise is a pollutant according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The MSFD requires EU Member States to achieve or maintain Good Environmental Status, meaning that the &quot;introduction of energy, including underwater noise, is at levels that do not adversely affect the marine environment&quot;.

== Health effects ==

Exposure to noise is associated with several negative health outcomes. Depending on duration and level of exposure, noise may cause or increase the likelihood of hearing loss, high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, sleep disturbances, injuries, and even decreased school performance. When noise is prolonged, the body&#x27;s stress responses can be triggered; which can include increased heartbeat, and rapid breathing. There are also causal relationships between noise and psychological effects such as annoyance, psychiatric disorders, and effects on psychosocial well-being.

Noise exposure has increasingly been identified as a public health issue, especially in an occupational setting, as demonstrated with the creation of NIOSH&#x27;s Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention program. Noise has also proven to be an occupational hazard, as it is the most common work-related pollutant. Noise-induced hearing loss, when associated with noise exposure at the workplace is also called occupational hearing loss. For example, some occupational studies have shown a relation between those who are regularly exposed to noise above 85 decibels to have higher blood pressure than those who are not exposed.

=== Hearing loss prevention ===
While noise-induced hearing loss is permanent, it is also preventable. Particularly in the workplace, regulations may exist limiting permissible exposure limit to noise. This can be especially important for professionals working in settings with consistent exposure to loud sounds, such as musicians, music teachers and audio engineers. Examples of measures taken to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace include engineering noise control, the Buy-Quiet initiative, creation of the Safe-In-Sound award, and noise surveillance.

OSHA requires the use of hearing protection. But the HPD (without individual selection, training and fit testing) does not significantly reduce the risk of hearing loss. For example, one study covered more than 19 thousand workers, some of whom usually used hearing protective devices, and some did not use them at all. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of noise-induced hearing loss.

== Literary views ==

Roland Barthes distinguishes between physiological noise, which is merely heard, and psychological noise, which is actively listened to. Physiological noise is felt subconsciously as the vibrations of the noise (sound) waves physically interact with the body while psychological noise is perceived as our conscious awareness shifts its attention to that noise.

Luigi Russolo, one of the first composers of noise music, wrote the essay &quot;The Art of Noises.&quot; He argued that any kind of noise could be used as music, as audiences become more familiar with noises caused by technological advancements; noise has become so prominent that pure sound no longer exists.

Avant-garde composer Henry Cowell claimed that technological advancements have reduced unwanted noises from machines, but have not managed so far to eliminate them.

Felix Urban sees noise as a result of cultural circumstances. In his comparative study on sound and noise in cities, he points out that noise regulations are only one indicator of what is considered as harmful. It is the way in which people live and behave (acoustically) that determines the way how sounds are perceived.

<text>Noise-equivalent power (NEP) is a measure of the sensitivity of a photodetector or detector system. It is defined as the signal power that gives a signal-to-noise ratio of one in a one hertz output bandwidth. An output bandwidth of one hertz is equivalent to half a second of integration time. The units of NEP are watts per square root hertz. The NEP is equal to the noise amplitude spectral density (expressed in units of formula_1 or formula_2) divided by the responsivity (expressed in units of formula_3 or formula_4, respectively). The fundamental equation is formula_5.

A smaller NEP corresponds to a more sensitive detector. For example, a detector with an NEP of formula_6 can detect a signal power of one picowatt with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of one after one half second of averaging. The SNR improves as the square root of the averaging time, and hence the SNR in this example can be improved by a factor of 10 by averaging 100-times longer, i.e. for 50 seconds.

If the NEP refers to the signal power absorbed in the detector, it is known as the electrical NEP. If instead it refers to the signal power incident on the detector system, it is called the optical NEP. The optical NEP is equal to the electrical NEP divided by the optical coupling efficiency of the detector system.

These figures of merit are used to evaluate the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver, with lower values indicating better performance.

The noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output noise power of a device to the portion thereof attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature &quot;T&quot;0 (usually 290 K). The noise factor is thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the device itself did not introduce noise, which is equivalent to the ratio of input SNR to output SNR.

The noise &quot;factor&quot; and noise &quot;figure&quot; are related, with the former being a unitless ratio and the latter being the logarithm of the noise factor, expressed in units of decibels (dB).

== General ==
The noise figure is the difference in decibel (dB) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an &quot;ideal&quot; receiver with the same overall gain and bandwidth when the receivers are connected to matched sources at the standard noise temperature &quot;T&quot;0 (usually 290 K). The noise power from a simple load is equal to &quot;kTB&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature of the load (for example a resistor), and &quot;B&quot; is the measurement bandwidth.

This makes the noise figure a useful figure of merit for terrestrial systems, where the antenna effective temperature is usually near the standard 290 K. In this case, one receiver with a noise figure, say 2 dB better than another, will have an output signal-to-noise ratio that is about 2 dB better than the other. However, in the case of satellite communications systems, where the receiver antenna is pointed out into cold space, the antenna effective temperature is often colder than 290 K. In these cases a 2 dB improvement in receiver noise figure will result in more than a 2 dB improvement in the output signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason, the related figure of &quot;effective noise temperature&quot; is therefore often used instead of the noise figure for characterizing satellite-communication receivers and low-noise amplifiers.

In heterodyne systems, output noise power includes spurious contributions from image-frequency transformation, but the portion attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature includes only that which appears in the output via the principal frequency transformation of the system and excludes that which appears via the image frequency transformation.

== Definition ==
The noise factor of a system is defined as
{\mathrm{SNR}_\text{o}}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where and are the input and output signal-to-noise ratios respectively. The quantities are unitless power ratios. Note that this specific definition is only valid for an input signal of which the noise is &quot;Ni=kT0B&quot;.

The noise figure is defined as the noise factor in units of decibels (dB):
{\mathrm{SNR}_\text{o}}\right) = \mathrm{SNR}_\text{i, dB} - \mathrm{SNR}_\text{o, dB}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where and are in units of (dB).
These formulae are only valid when the input termination is at standard noise temperature , although in practice small differences in temperature do not significantly affect the values.

The noise factor of a device is related to its noise temperature :
:formula_1

Attenuators have a noise factor equal to their attenuation ratio when their physical temperature equals . More generally, for an attenuator at a physical temperature , the noise temperature is , giving a noise factor
:formula_2

== Noise factor of cascaded devices ==

If several devices are cascaded, the total noise factor can be found with Friis&#x27; formula:
:formula_3
where is the noise factor for the -th device, and is the power gain (linear, not in dB) of the -th device. The first amplifier in a chain usually has the most significant effect on the total noise figure because the noise figures of the following stages are reduced by stage gains. Consequently, the first amplifier usually has a low noise figure, and the noise figure requirements of subsequent stages is usually more relaxed.

==Noise factor as a function of additional noise==

The noise factor may be expressed as a function of the additional output referred noise power formula_4 and the power gain formula_5 of an amplifier.
===Derivation===
From the definition of noise factor

:formula_6

and assuming a system which has a noisy single stage amplifier. The signal to noise ratio of this amplifier would include its own output referred noise formula_4, the amplified signal formula_8 and the amplified input noise formula_9,

:formula_10

Substituting the output SNR to the noise factor definition,

:formula_11

In cascaded systems formula_12 does not refer to the output noise of the previous component. An input termination at the standard noise temperature is still assumed for the individual component. This means that the additional noise power added by each component is independent of the other components.

==Optical noise figure==
The above describes noise in electrical systems. The optical noise figure is discussed in multiple sources. Electric sources generate noise with a power spectral density, or energy per mode, equal to , where is the Boltzmann constant and is the absolute temperature. One mode has two quadratures, i.e. the amplitudes of formula_13 and formula_13 oscillations of voltages, currents or fields. However, there is also noise in optical systems. In these, the sources have no fundamental noise. Instead the energy quantization causes notable shot noise in the detector. In an optical receiver which can output one available mode or two available quadratures this corresponds to a noise power spectral density, or energy per mode, of where is the Planck constant and is the optical frequency. In an optical receiver with only one available quadrature the shot noise has a power spectral density, or energy per mode, of only . 

In the 1990s, an optical noise figure has been defined. This has been called for &quot;p&quot;hoton &quot;n&quot;umber &quot;f&quot;luctuations. The powers needed for SNR and noise factor calculation are the electrical powers caused by the current in a photodiode. SNR is the square of mean photocurrent divided by variance of photocurrent. Monochromatic or sufficiently attenuated light has a Poisson distribution of detected photons. If, during a detection interval the expectation value of detected photons is then the variance is also and one obtains = = . Behind an optical amplifier with power gain there will be a mean of detectable signal photons. In the limit of large the variance of photons is where is the spontaneous emission factor. One obtains = = . Resulting optical noise factor is = = .

 is in conceptual conflict with the &quot;e&quot;lectrical noise factor, which is now called :

Photocurrent is proportional to optical power . is proportional to squares of a field amplitude (electric or magnetic). So, the receiver is nonlinear in amplitude. The &quot;Power&quot; needed for calculation is proportional to the 4th power of the signal amplitude. But for in the electrical domain the power is proportional to the square of the signal amplitude.

If is a noise factor then its definition must be independent of measurement apparatus and frequency. Consider the signal &quot;Power&quot; in the sense of definition. Behind an amplifier it is proportional to . We may replace the photodiode by a thermal power meter, and measured photocurrent by measured temperature change formula_15. &quot;Power&quot;, being proportional to or , is also proportional to formula_16. Thermal power meters can be built at all frequencies. Hence it is possible to lower the frequency from optical (say 200 THz) to electrical (say 200 MHz). Still there, &quot;Power&quot; must be proportional to formula_16 or . Electrical power is proportional to the square of voltage . But &quot;Power&quot; is proportional to .

These implications are in obvious conflict with ~150 years of physics. They are compelling consequence of calling a noise factor, or noise figure when expressed in dB.

At any given electrical frequency, noise occurs in both quadratures, i.e. in phase (I) and in quadrature (Q) with the signal. Both these quadratures are available behind the electrical amplifier. The same holds in an optical amplifier. But the direct detection photoreceiver needed for measurement of takes mainly the in-phase noise into account whereas quadrature noise can be neglected for high . Also, the receiver outputs only one baseband signal, corresponding to quadrature. So, one quadrature or degree-of-freedom is lost.

For an optical amplifier with large it holds ≥ 2 whereas for an &quot;e&quot;lectrical amplifier it holds ≥ 1.

Moreover, today&#x27;s long-haul optical fiber communication is dominated by coherent optical I&amp;Q receivers but does not describe the SNR degradation observed in these.

Another optical noise figure for &quot;a&quot;mplified &quot;s&quot;pontaneous &quot;e&quot;mission has been defined. But the noise factor is not the SNR degradation factor in any optical receiver.

All the above conflicts are resolved by the optical in-phase and quadrature noise factor and figure . It can be measured using a coherent optical I&amp;Q receiver. In these, power of the output signal is proportional to the square of an optical field amplitude because they are linear in amplitude. They pass both quadratures. For an optical amplifier it holds = ≥ 1. Quantity is the input-referred number of added noise photons per mode.

 and can easily be converted into each other. For large it holds = or, when expressed in dB, is 3 dB less than . The ideal in dB equals 0 dB. This describes the known fact that the sensitivity of an ideal optical I&amp;Q receiver is not improved by an ideal optical preamplifier.

<text>In electronics, noise temperature is one way of expressing the level of available noise power introduced by a component or source. The power spectral density of the noise is expressed in terms of the temperature (in kelvins) that would produce that level of Johnson–Nyquist noise, thus:

:formula_1
where:

*formula_2 is the noise power (in W, watts)
*formula_3 is the total bandwidth (Hz, hertz) over which that noise power is measured
*formula_4 is the Boltzmann constant (, joules per kelvin)
*formula_5 is the noise temperature (K, kelvin)

Thus the noise temperature is proportional to the power spectral density of the noise, formula_6. That is the power that would be absorbed from the component or source by a matched load. Noise temperature is generally a function of frequency, unlike that of an ideal resistor which is simply equal to the actual temperature of the resistor at all frequencies.

==Noise voltage and current==
A noisy component may be modelled as a noiseless component in series with a noisy voltage source producing a voltage of , or as a noiseless component in parallel with a noisy current source producing a current of . This equivalent voltage or current corresponds to the above power spectral density formula_7, and would have a mean squared amplitude over a bandwidth of:

:formula_8

where is the resistive part of the component&#x27;s impedance or is the conductance (real part) of the component&#x27;s admittance. Speaking of noise temperature therefore offers a fair comparison between components having different impedances rather than specifying the noise voltage and qualifying that number by mentioning the component&#x27;s resistance. It is also more accessible than speaking of the noise&#x27;s power spectral density (in watts per hertz) since it is expressed as an ordinary temperature which can be compared to the noise level of an ideal resistor at room temperature (290 K).

Note that one can only speak of the noise temperature of a component or source whose impedance has a substantial (and measurable) resistive component. Thus it does not make sense to talk about the noise temperature of a capacitor or of a voltage source. The noise temperature of an amplifier refers to the noise that would be added at the amplifier&#x27;s &quot;input&quot; (relative to the input impedance of the amplifier) in order to account for the added noise observed following amplification.

==System noise temperature==
An RF receiver system is typically made up of an antenna and a receiver, and the transmission line(s) that connect the two together. Each of these is a source of additive noise. The additive noise in a receiving system can be of thermal origin (thermal noise) or can be from other external or internal noise-generating processes. The contributions of all noise sources are typically lumped together and regarded as a level of thermal noise. The noise power spectral density generated by any source (formula_9) can be described by assigning to the noise a temperature formula_10 as defined above:

:formula_11

In an RF receiver, the overall system noise temperature formula_12 equals the sum of the effective noise temperature of the receiver and transmission lines and that of the antenna.

:formula_13

The antenna noise temperature formula_14 gives the noise power seen at the output of the antenna. The composite noise temperature of the receiver and transmission line losses formula_15 represents the noise contribution of the rest of the receiver system. It is calculated as the effective noise that would be present at the antenna input terminals if the receiver system were perfect and created no noise. In other words, it is a cascaded system of amplifiers and losses where the internal noise temperatures are referred to the antenna input terminals. Thus, the summation of these two noise temperatures represents the noise input to a &quot;perfect&quot; receiver system.

==Noise factor and noise figure==

One use of noise temperature is in the definition of a system&#x27;s noise factor or noise figure. The noise factor specifies the increase in noise power (referred to the input of an amplifier) due to a component or system when its input noise temperature is formula_16.

:formula_17

formula_18 is customarily taken to be room temperature, 290 K.

The noise factor (a linear term) is more often expressed as the &quot;noise figure&quot; (in decibels) using the conversion:
:formula_19

The noise figure can also be seen as the decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by passing a signal through a system if the original signal had a noise temperature of 290 K. This is a common way of expressing the noise contributed by a radio frequency amplifier regardless of the amplifier&#x27;s gain. For instance, assume an amplifier has a noise temperature 870 K and thus a noise figure of 6 dB. If that amplifier is used to amplify a source having a noise temperature of about room temperature (290 K), as many sources do, then the insertion of that amplifier would reduce the SNR of a signal by 6 dB. This simple relationship is frequently applicable where the source&#x27;s noise is of thermal origin since a passive transducer will often have a noise temperature similar to 290 K.

However, in many cases the input source&#x27;s noise temperature is much higher, such as an antenna at lower frequencies where atmospheric noise dominates. Then there will be little degradation of the SNR. On the other hand, a good satellite dish looking through the atmosphere into space (so that it sees a much lower noise temperature) would have the SNR of a signal degraded by &quot;more&quot; than 6 dB. In those cases a reference to the amplifier&#x27;s noise temperature itself, rather than the noise figure defined according to room temperature, is more appropriate.

== Effective noise temperature ==

The noise temperature of an amplifier is commonly measured using the Y-factor method. If there are multiple amplifiers in cascade, the noise temperature of the cascade can be calculated using the Friis equation:

:formula_20

where
*formula_21 = resulting noise temperature referred to the input
*formula_22 = noise temperature of the first component in the cascade
*formula_23 = noise temperature of the second component in the cascade
*formula_24 = noise temperature of the third component in the cascade
*formula_25 = power gain of the first component in the cascade
*formula_26 = power gain of the second component in the cascade

Therefore, the amplifier chain can be modelled as a black box having a gain of formula_27 and a noise figure given by formula_28. In the usual case where the gains of the amplifier&#x27;s stages are much greater than one, then it can be seen that the noise temperatures of the earlier stages have a much greater influence on the resulting noise temperature than those later in the chain. One can appreciate that the noise introduced by the first stage, for instance, is amplified by all of the stages whereas the noise introduced by later stages undergoes lesser amplification. Another way of looking at it is that the signal applied to a later stage already has a high noise level, due to amplification of noise by the previous stages, so that the noise contribution of that stage to that already amplified signal is of less significance.

This explains why the quality of a preamplifier or RF amplifier is of particular importance in an amplifier chain. In most cases only the noise figure of the first stage need be considered. However one must check that the noise figure of the second stage is not so high (or that the gain of the first stage is so low) that there is SNR degradation due to the second stage anyway. That will be a concern if the noise figure of the first stage plus that stage&#x27;s gain (in decibels) is not much greater than the noise figure of the second stage.

One corollary of the Friis equation is that an attenuator prior to the first amplifier will degrade the noise figure due to the amplifier. For instance, if stage 1 represents a 6 dB attenuator so that formula_29, then formula_30. Effectively the noise temperature of the amplifier formula_31 has been quadrupled, in addition to the (smaller) contribution due to the attenuator itself formula_32 (usually room temperature if the attenuator is composed of resistors). An antenna with poor efficiency is an example of this principle, where formula_33 would represent the antenna&#x27;s efficiency.

<text>A noise weighting is a specific amplitude-vs.-frequency characteristic that is designed to allow subjectively valid measurement of noise. It emphasises the parts of the spectrum that are most important.

Usually, noise means audible noise, in audio systems, broadcast systems or telephone circuits. In this case the weighting is sometimes referred to as Psophometric weighting, though this term is best avoided because, although strictly a general term, the word Psophometric is sometimes assumed to refer to a particular weighting used in telecommunications.

A major use of noise weighting is in the measurement of residual noise in audio equipment, usually present as hiss or hum in quiet moments of programme material. The purpose of weighting here is to emphasise the parts of the audible spectrum that our ears perceive most readily, and attenuate the parts that contribute less to our perception of loudness, in order to get a measured figure that correlates well with subjective effect. 

The ITU-R 468 noise weighting was devised specifically for this purpose, and is widely used in broadcasting, especially in the UK and Europe. A-weighting is also used, especially in the United States, though this is only really valid for the measurement of tones, not noise, and is widely incorporated into sound level meters. 

In telecommunications, noise weightings are used by agencies concerned with public telephone service, and various standard curves are based on the characteristics of specific commercial telephone instruments, representing successive stages of technological development. The coding of commercial apparatus appears in the nomenclature of certain weightings. The same weighting nomenclature and units are used in military versions of commercial noise measuring sets.

Telecommunication measurements are made in lines terminated either by the measuring set or an instrument of the relevant class.

<doc id="41425" wikidata="Q1377934" url="?curid=41425" title="Non-return-to-zero">
<text>In telecommunications, a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line code is a binary code in which ones are represented by one significant condition, usually a positive voltage, while zeros are represented by some other significant condition, usually a negative voltage, with no other neutral or rest condition.

For a given data signaling rate, i.e., bit rate, the NRZ code requires only half the baseband bandwidth required by the Manchester code (the passband bandwidth is the same). The pulses in NRZ have more energy than a return-to-zero (RZ) code, which also has an additional rest state beside the conditions for ones and zeros.

When used to represent data in an asynchronous communication scheme, the absence of a neutral state requires other mechanisms for bit synchronization when a separate clock signal is not available. Since NRZ is not inherently a self-clocking signal, some additional synchronization technique must be used for avoiding bit slips; examples of such techniques are a run-length-limited constraint and a parallel synchronization signal.

==Variants==
NRZ can refer to any of the following serializer line codes:

The NRZ code also can be classified as a polar or non-polar, where polar refers to a mapping to voltages of +V and −V, and non-polar refers to a voltage mapping of +V and 0, for the corresponding binary values of 0 and 1.

===Unipolar non-return-to-zero level===

&quot;On&quot; is represented by a DC bias on the transmission line (conventionally positive), while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by the absence of bias – the line at 0 volts or grounded. For this reason it is also known as &quot;on-off keying&quot;. In clock language, a &quot;one&quot; transitions to or remains at a biased level on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit, while &quot;zero&quot; transitions to or remains at no bias on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit. Among the disadvantages of unipolar NRZ is that it allows for long series without change, which makes synchronization difficult, although this is not unique to the unipolar case. One solution is to not send bytes without transitions. More critically, and unique to unipolar NRZ, are issues related to the presence of a transmitted DC level – the power spectrum of the transmitted signal does not approach zero at zero frequency. This leads to two significant problems: first, the transmitted DC power leads to higher power losses than other encodings, and second, the presence of a DC signal component requires that the transmission line be DC-coupled.

===Bipolar non-return-to-zero level===
&quot;One&quot; is represented by one physical level (usually a positive voltage), while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by another level (usually a negative voltage). In clock language, in bipolar NRZ-level the voltage &quot;swings&quot; from positive to negative on the trailing edge of the previous bit clock cycle.

An example of this is RS-232, where &quot;one&quot; is −12 V to −5 V and &quot;zero&quot; is +5 V to +12 V.

===Non-return-to-zero space===
&quot;One&quot; is represented by no change in physical level, while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by a change in physical level. In clock language, the level transitions on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit to represent a &quot;zero&quot;.

This &quot;change-on-zero&quot; is used by High-Level Data Link Control and USB. They both avoid long periods of no transitions (even when the data contains long sequences of 1 bits) by using zero-bit insertion. HDLC transmitters insert a 0 bit after 5 contiguous 1 bits (except when transmitting the frame delimiter 01111110). USB transmitters insert a 0 bit after 6 consecutive 1 bits. The receiver at the far end uses every transition — both from 0 bits in the data and these extra non-data 0 bits — to maintain clock synchronization. The receiver otherwise ignores these non-data 0 bits.

=== Non-return-to-zero inverted===

Non-return-to-zero, inverted (NRZI, also known as &quot;non-return to zero IBM&quot;, &quot;inhibit code&quot;, or &quot;IBM code&quot;) was devised by Bryon E. Phelps (IBM) in 1956. It is a method of mapping a binary signal to a physical signal for transmission over some transmission medium. The two-level NRZI signal distinguishes data bits by the presence or absence of a transition at a clock boundary. The NRZI encoded signal can be decoded unambiguously after passing through a data path that doesn’t preserve polarity.

&quot;Which&quot; bit value corresponds to a transition varies in practice, NRZI applies equally to both. Magnetic storage generally uses the NRZ-M, non-return-to-zero mark convention: a logical 1 is encoded as a transition, and a logical 0 is encoded as no transition. The HDLC and Universal Serial Bus protocols use the opposite NRZ-S, non-return-to-zero space convention: a logical 0 is a transition, and a logical 1 is no transition. Neither NRZI encoding guarantees that the encoded bitstream has transitions.

An asynchronous receiver uses an independent bit clock that is phase synchronized by detecting bit transitions. When an asynchronous receiver decodes a block of bits without a transition longer than the period of the difference between the frequency of the transmitting and receiving bit clocks, the decoder’s bit clock is either 1 bit earlier than the encoder resulting in a duplicated bit being inserted in the decoded data stream, or the decoder’s bit clock is 1 bit later than the encoder resulting in a duplicated bit being removed from the decoded data stream. Both are referred to as &quot;bit slip&quot; denoting that the phase of the bit clock has slipped a bit period.

Forcing transitions at intervals shorter than the bit clock difference period allows an asynchronous receiver to be used for NRZI bit streams. Additional transitions necessarily consume some of the data channel’s rate capacity. Consuming no more of the channel capacity than necessary to maintain bit clock synchronization without increasing costs related to complexity is a problem with many possible solutions.

Run-length limited (RLL) encodings have been used for magnetic disk and tape storage devices using fixed-rate RLL codes that increase the channel data rate by a known fraction of the information data rate. HDLC and USB use bit stuffing: inserting an additional 0 bit before NRZ-S encoding to force a transition in the encoded data sequence after 5 (HLDC) or 6 (USB) consecutive 1 bits. Bit stuffing consumes channel capacity only when necessary but results in a variable information data rate.

===Synchronized non-return-to-zero===
Synchronized NRZI (SNRZI) and &quot;group-coded recording&quot; (&quot;GCR&quot;) are modified forms of NRZI. In SNRZI-M each 8-bit group is extended to 9 bits by a 1 in order to insert a transition for synchronisation.

==Comparison with return-to-zero==
Return-to-zero describes a line code used in telecommunications in which the signal drops (returns) to zero between each pulse. This takes place even if a number of consecutive 0s or 1s occur in the signal. The signal is self-clocking. This means that a separate clock does not need to be sent alongside the signal, but suffers from using twice the bandwidth to achieve the same data-rate as compared to non-return-to-zero format.

The &quot;zero&quot; between each bit is a neutral or rest condition, such as a zero amplitude in pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM), zero phase shift in phase-shift keying (PSK), or mid-frequency in frequency-shift keying (FSK). That &quot;zero&quot; condition is typically halfway between the significant condition representing a 1 bit and the other significant condition representing a 0 bit.

Although return-to-zero contains a provision for synchronization, it still may have a DC component resulting in &quot;baseline wander&quot; during long strings of 0 or 1 bits, just like the line code non-return-to-zero.

<doc id="41432" wikidata="Q898896" url="?curid=41432" title="Numerical aperture">
<text>In optics, the numerical aperture (NA) of an optical system is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. By incorporating index of refraction in its definition, has the property that it is constant for a beam as it goes from one material to another, provided there is no refractive power at the interface. The exact definition of the term varies slightly between different areas of optics. Numerical aperture is commonly used in microscopy to describe the acceptance cone of an objective (and hence its light-gathering ability and resolution), and in fiber optics, in which it describes the range of angles within which light that is incident on the fiber will be transmitted along it.

==General optics==

In most areas of optics, and especially in microscopy, the numerical aperture of an optical system such as an objective lens is defined by

formula_1

where is the index of refraction of the medium in which the lens is working (1.00 for air, 1.33 for pure water, and typically 1.52 for immersion oil; see also list of refractive indices), and is the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can enter or exit the lens. In general, this is the angle of the real marginal ray in the system. Because the index of refraction is included, the of a pencil of rays is an invariant as a pencil of rays passes from one material to another through a flat surface. This is easily shown by rearranging Snell&#x27;s law to find that is constant across an interface.

In air, the angular aperture of the lens is approximately twice this value (within the paraxial approximation). The is generally measured with respect to a particular object or image point and will vary as that point is moved. In microscopy, generally refers to object-space numerical aperture unless otherwise noted.

In microscopy, is important because it indicates the resolving power of a lens. The size of the finest detail that can be resolved (the &quot;resolution&quot;) is proportional to , where is the wavelength of the light. A lens with a larger numerical aperture will be able to visualize finer details than a lens with a smaller numerical aperture. Assuming quality (diffraction-limited) optics, lenses with larger numerical apertures collect more light and will generally provide a brighter image, but will provide shallower depth of field.

Numerical aperture is used to define the &quot;pit size&quot; in optical disc formats.

Increasing the magnification and the numerical aperture of the objective reduces the working distance, i.e. the distance between front lens and specimen.

=== Numerical aperture versus f-number ===
Numerical aperture is not typically used in photography. Instead, the angular aperture of a lens (or an imaging mirror) is expressed by the f-number, written , where is the f-number given by the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil :

formula_2

This ratio is related to the image-space numerical aperture when the lens is focused at infinity. Based on the diagram at the right, the image-space numerical aperture of the lens is:

formula_3

thus , assuming normal use in air ().

The approximation holds when the numerical aperture is small, but it turns out that for well-corrected optical systems such as camera lenses, a more detailed analysis shows that is almost exactly equal to even at large numerical apertures. As Rudolf Kingslake explains, &quot;It is a common error to suppose that the ratio [] is actually equal to , and not ... The tangent would, of course, be correct if the principal planes were really plane. However, the complete theory of the Abbe sine condition shows that if a lens is corrected for coma and spherical aberration, as all good photographic objectives must be, the second principal plane becomes a portion of a sphere of radius centered about the focal point&quot;. In this sense, the traditional thin-lens definition and illustration of f-number is misleading, and defining it in terms of numerical aperture may be more meaningful.

===Working (effective) f-number===
The f-number describes the light-gathering ability of the lens in the case where the marginal rays on the object side are parallel to the axis of the lens. This case is commonly encountered in photography, where objects being photographed are often far from the camera. When the object is not distant from the lens, however, the image is no longer formed in the lens&#x27;s focal plane, and the f-number no longer accurately describes the light-gathering ability of the lens or the image-side numerical aperture. In this case, the numerical aperture is related to what is sometimes called the &quot;working f-number&quot; or &quot;effective f-number&quot;.

The working f-number is defined by modifying the relation above, taking into account the magnification from object to image:

formula_4

where is the working f-number, is the lens&#x27;s magnification for an object a particular distance away, is the pupil magnification, and the is defined in terms of the angle of the marginal ray as before. The magnification here is typically negative, and the pupil magnification is most often assumed to be 1 — as Allen R. Greenleaf explains, &quot;Illuminance varies inversely as the square of the distance between the exit pupil of the lens and the position of the plate or film. Because the position of the exit pupil usually is unknown to the user of a lens, the rear conjugate focal distance is used instead; the resultant theoretical error so introduced is insignificant with most types of photographic lenses.&quot;

In photography, the factor is sometimes written as , where represents the absolute value of the magnification; in either case, the correction factor is 1 or greater. The two equalities in the equation above are each taken by various authors as the definition of working f-number, as the cited sources illustrate. They are not necessarily both exact, but are often treated as if they are.

Conversely, the object-side numerical aperture is related to the f-number by way of the magnification (tending to zero for a distant object):

formula_5

==Laser physics==
In laser physics, numerical aperture is defined slightly differently. Laser beams spread out as they propagate, but slowly. Far away from the narrowest part of the beam, the spread is roughly linear with distance—the laser beam forms a cone of light in the &quot;far field&quot;. The relation used to define the of the laser beam is the same as that used for an optical system,

but is defined differently. Laser beams typically do not have sharp edges like the cone of light that passes through the aperture of a lens does. Instead, the irradiance falls off gradually away from the center of the beam. It is very common for the beam to have a Gaussian profile. Laser physicists typically choose to make the &quot;divergence&quot; of the beam: the far-field angle between the beam axis and the distance from the axis at which the irradiance drops to times the on-axis irradiance. The of a Gaussian laser beam is then related to its minimum spot size (&quot;beam waist&quot;) by

formula_7

where is the vacuum wavelength of the light, and is the diameter of the beam at its narrowest spot, measured between the irradiance points (&quot;Full width at maximum of the intensity&quot;). This means that a laser beam that is focused to a small spot will spread out quickly as it moves away from the focus, while a large-diameter laser beam can stay roughly the same size over a very long distance. See also: Gaussian beam width.

==Fiber optics==
A multi-mode optical fiber will only propagate light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles, known as the acceptance cone of the fiber. The half-angle of this cone is called the acceptance angle, . For step-index multimode fiber in a given medium, the acceptance angle is determined only by the indices of refraction of the core, the cladding, and the medium:
formula_8
where is the refractive index of the medium around the fiber, is the refractive index of the fiber core, and is the refractive index of the cladding. While the core will accept light at higher angles, those rays will not totally reflect off the core–cladding interface, and so will not be transmitted to the other end of the fiber. The derivation of this formula is given below.

When a light ray is incident from a medium of refractive index to the core of index at the maximum acceptance angle, Snell&#x27;s law at the medium–core interface gives
formula_9

From the geometry of the above figure we have:
formula_10

where
formula_11

is the critical angle for total internal reflection.

Substituting for in Snell&#x27;s law we get:
formula_12

By squaring both sides
formula_13

Solving, we find the formula stated above:

formula_8

This has the same form as the numerical aperture in other optical systems, so it has become common to &quot;define&quot; the of any type of fiber to be
formula_15

where is the refractive index along the central axis of the fiber. Note that when this definition is used, the connection between the numerical aperture and the acceptance angle of the fiber becomes only an approximation. In particular, &quot;&quot; defined this way is not relevant for single-mode fiber. One cannot define an acceptance angle for single-mode fiber based on the indices of refraction alone.

The number of bound modes, the mode volume, is related to the normalized frequency and thus to the numerical aperture.

In multimode fibers, the term &quot;equilibrium numerical aperture&quot; is sometimes used. This refers to the numerical aperture with respect to the extreme exit angle of a ray emerging from a fiber in which equilibrium mode distribution has been established.

<doc id="41435" wikidata="Q6273772" url="?curid=41435" title="Nyquist rate">
<text>In signal processing, the Nyquist rate, named after Harry Nyquist, is a value equal to twice the highest frequency (bandwidth) of a given function or signal. It has units of samples per unit time, conventionally expressed as samples per second, or hertz (Hz). When the signal is sampled at a higher sample rate , the resulting discrete-time sequence is said to be free of the distortion known as aliasing. Conversely, for a given sample rate the corresponding Nyquist frequency is one-half the sample rate. Note that the &quot;Nyquist rate&quot; is a property of a continuous-time signal, whereas &quot;Nyquist frequency&quot; is a property of a discrete-time system.

The term &quot;Nyquist rate&quot; is also used in a different context with units of symbols per second, which is actually the field in which Harry Nyquist was working. In that context it is an upper bound for the symbol rate across a bandwidth-limited baseband channel such as a telegraph line or passband channel such as a limited radio frequency band or a frequency division multiplex channel.

==Relative to sampling==

When a continuous function, formula_1 is sampled at a constant rate, formula_2 &quot;samples/second&quot;, there is always an unlimited number of other continuous functions that fit the same set of samples. But only one of them is bandlimited to formula_3 &quot;cycles/second&quot; (hertz), which means that its Fourier transform, formula_4 is formula_5 for all formula_6  The mathematical algorithms that are typically used to recreate a continuous function from samples create arbitrarily good approximations to this theoretical, but infinitely long, function. It follows that if the original function, formula_1 is bandlimited to formula_8 which is called the &quot;Nyquist criterion&quot;, then it is the one unique function the interpolation algorithms are approximating. In terms of a function&#x27;s own bandwidth formula_9 as depicted here, the Nyquist criterion is often stated as formula_10  And formula_11 is called the Nyquist rate for functions with bandwidth formula_12 When the Nyquist criterion is not met a condition called aliasing occurs, which results in some inevitable differences between formula_13 and a reconstructed function that has less bandwidth. In most cases, the differences are viewed as distortion.

===Intentional aliasing===

Figure 3 depicts a type of function called baseband or lowpass, because its positive-frequency range of significant energy is [0, &quot;B&quot;). When instead, the frequency range is (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;+&quot;B&quot;), for some &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot;, it is called bandpass, and a common desire (for various reasons) is to convert it to baseband. One way to do that is frequency-mixing (heterodyne) the bandpass function down to the frequency range (0, &quot;B&quot;). One of the possible reasons is to reduce the Nyquist rate for more efficient storage. And it turns out that one can directly achieve the same result by sampling the bandpass function at a sub-Nyquist sample-rate that is the smallest integer-sub-multiple of frequency &quot;A&quot; that meets the baseband Nyquist criterion:  fs &gt; 2&quot;B&quot;. For a more general discussion, see bandpass sampling.

==Relative to signaling==

Long before Harry Nyquist had his name associated with sampling, the term &quot;Nyquist rate&quot; was used differently, with a meaning closer to what Nyquist actually studied. Quoting Harold S. Black&#x27;s 1953 book &quot;Modulation Theory,&quot; in the section Nyquist Interval of the opening chapter &quot;Historical Background:&quot;

:&quot;If the essential frequency range is limited to &quot;B&quot; cycles per second, 2&quot;B&quot; was given by Nyquist as the maximum number of code elements per second that could be unambiguously resolved, assuming the peak interference is less than half a quantum step. This rate is generally referred to as signaling at the Nyquist rate and 1/(2&quot;B&quot;) has been termed a &quot;Nyquist interval&quot;.&quot; (bold added for emphasis; italics from the original)

According to the OED, Black&#x27;s statement regarding 2&quot;B&quot; may be the origin of the term &quot;Nyquist rate&quot;.

Nyquist&#x27;s famous 1928 paper was a study on how many pulses (code elements) could be transmitted per second, and recovered, through a channel of limited bandwidth.
&quot;Signaling at the Nyquist rate&quot; meant putting as many code pulses through a telegraph channel as its bandwidth would allow. Shannon used Nyquist&#x27;s approach when he proved the sampling theorem in 1948, but Nyquist did not work on sampling per se.

Black&#x27;s later chapter on &quot;The Sampling Principle&quot; does give Nyquist some of the credit for some relevant math:

:&quot;Nyquist (1928) pointed out that, if the function is substantially limited to the time interval &quot;T&quot;, 2&quot;BT&quot; values are sufficient to specify the function, basing his conclusions on a Fourier series representation of the function over the time interval &quot;T&quot;.&quot;

<text>An off-axis optical system is an optical system in which the optical axis of the aperture is not coincident with the mechanical center of the aperture. The principal applications of off-axis optical systems are to avoid obstruction of the primary aperture by secondary optical elements, instrument packages, or sensors, and to provide ready access to instrument packages or sensors at the focus. The engineering tradeoff of an off-axis optical system is an increase in image aberrations.

There are various theoretical models for aberration in off-axis optical systems. This involves various techniques including different types of equations for ray-tracing, and a goal can be optimizing the design.

An example of an off-axis optical system is a three mirror design as optics for a hyperspectral imager.

<doc id="41438" wikidata="Q7078890" url="?curid=41438" title="On- and off-hook">
<text>In telephony, on-hook and off-hook are two states of a communication circuit. On subscriber telephones the states are produced by placing the handset onto or off the hookswitch. Placing the circuit into the off-hook state is also called &quot;seizing the line&quot;. &quot;Off-hook&quot; originally referred to the condition that prevailed when telephones had a separate earpiece (&quot;receiver&quot;), which hung from its switchhook until the user initiated a telephone call by removing it. When off hook the weight of the receiver no longer depresses the spring-loaded switchhook, thereby connecting the instrument to the telephone line.

==Off-hook==

The term off-hook has the following meanings:
* The condition that exists when a telephone or other user instrument is in use, i.e., during dialing or communicating.
* A general description of one of two possible signaling states at an interface between telecommunications systems, such as tone or no tone and ground connection versus battery connection. Note that if off-hook pertains to one state, on-hook pertains to the other.
* The active state (i.e., a closed loop (short circuit between the wires) of a subscriber line or PBX user loop)
* An operating state of a communications link in which data transmission is enabled either for (a) voice or data communications or (b) network signaling.

On an ordinary two-wire telephone line, off-hook status is communicated to the telephone exchange by a resistance short across the pair. When an off-hook condition persists without dialing, for example because the handset has fallen off or the cable has been flooded, it is treated as a &quot;permanent loop&quot; or permanent signal.

The act of &quot;going off-hook&quot; is also referred to as &quot;seizing&quot; the line or channel.

==On-hook==

The term on-hook has the following meanings: 
* The condition that exists when a telephone or other user instrument is not in use, i.e., when idle waiting for a call. Note: on-hook originally referred to the storage of an idle telephone receiver, i.e., separate earpiece, on a switchhook. The weight of the receiver depresses the spring-loaded switchhook thereby disconnecting the idle instrument (except its bell) from the telephone line.
* One of two possible signaling states, such as tone or no tone, or ground connection versus battery connection. Note: if on-hook pertains to one state, off-hook pertains to the other.
* The idle state, i.e., an open loop of a subscriber line or PBX user loop. 
* An operating state of a telecommunication circuit in which transmission is disabled and a high impedance, or &quot;open circuit&quot;, is presented to the link by the end instrument(s). Note: during the on-hook condition, the link is responsive to ringing signals.

The act of &quot;going on-hook&quot; is also referred to as &quot;releasing the line&quot; or &quot;channel&quot;, and may initiate the process of clearing.

<text>In computer technology and telecommunications, online indicates a state of connectivity, and offline indicates a disconnected state. In modern terminology, this usually refers to an Internet connection, but (especially when expressed as &quot;on line&quot; or &quot;on the line&quot;) could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system. Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.

&quot;Online&quot; has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet, for example: &quot;online identity&quot;, &quot;online predator&quot;, &quot;online gambling&quot;, &quot;online game&quot;, &quot;online shopping&quot;, &quot;online banking&quot;, and &quot;online learning&quot;. A Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, as in words &quot;cyberspace&quot;, &quot;cybercrime&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, and &quot;e-commerce&quot;. In contrast, &quot;offline&quot; can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores). The term &quot;offline&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym &quot;IRL&quot;, meaning &quot;in real life&quot;.

==History==
During the 19th century, the term &quot;on line&quot; was commonly used in both the railroad and telegraph industries. For railroads, a signal box would send messages down the line (track), via a telegraph line (cable), indicating the track&#x27;s status: &quot;Train on line&quot; or &quot;Line clear&quot;. Telegraph linemen would refer to sending current through a line as &quot;direct on line&quot; or &quot;battery on line&quot;; or they may refer to a problem with the circuit as being &quot;on line&quot;, as opposed to the power source or end-point equipment.

Since at least 1950, in computing, the terms &quot;on-line&quot; and &quot;off-line&quot; have been used to refer to whether machines, including computers and peripheral devices, are connected or not. Here is an excerpt from the 1950 book &quot;High-Speed Computing Devices&quot;:

: The use of automatic computing equipment for large-scale reduction of data will be strikingly successful only if means are provided for the automatic transcription of these data to a form suitable for automatic entry into the machine. For some applications, of which the most prominent are those in which the reduced data are used to control the process being measured, the input must be developed for &quot;on-line&quot; operation. In on-line operation the input is communicated directly and without delay to the data-reduction device. For other applications, &quot;off-line&quot; operation, involving automatic transcription of data in a form suitable for later introduction to the machine, may be tolerated. These requirements may be compared with teleprinter operating requirements. For example, some teletype machines operate on line. Their operators are in instantaneous communication. Other teletype machines are operated off line, through the intervention of punched paper tape. The message is preserved by means of holes punched in the tape and is transmitted later by feeding the tape to another machine.

==Examples==

===Offline e-mail===
One example of a common use of these concepts with email is a mail user agent (MUA) that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. One such MUA is Microsoft Outlook. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it will not attempt to make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the connection status between the computer on which it is running and the Internet i.e. the computer itself may be online—connected to the Internet via a cable modem or other means—while Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a dial-up connection on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make a connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.

===Offline media playing===
Another example of the use of these concepts is digital audio technology. A tape recorder, digital audio editor, or other device that is online is one whose clock is under the control of the clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its own internal clock. When many devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization. (For related discussion, see MIDI timecode, Word clock, and recording system synchronization.)

===Offline browsing===

A third example of a common use of these concepts is a web browser that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. The browser attempts to fetch pages from servers while only in the online state. In the offline state, or &quot;offline mode&quot;, users can perform offline browsing, where pages can be browsed using local copies of those pages that have previously been downloaded while in the online state. This can be useful when the computer is offline and connection to the Internet is impossible or undesirable. The pages are downloaded either implicitly into the web browser&#x27;s own cache as a result of prior online browsing by the user or explicitly by a browser configured to keep local copies of certain web pages, which are updated when the browser is in the online state, either by checking that the local copies are up-to-date at regular intervals or by checking that the local copies are up-to-date whenever the browser is switched to the online. One such web browser is Internet Explorer. When pages are added to the Favourites list, they can be marked to be &quot;available for offline browsing&quot;. Internet Explorer will download local copies of both the marked page and, optionally, all of the pages that it links to. In Internet Explorer version 6, the level of direct and indirect links, the maximum amount of local disc space allowed to be consumed, and the schedule on which local copies are checked to see whether they are up-to-date, are configurable for each individual Favourites entry.

For communities that lack adequate Internet connectivity—such as developing countries, rural areas, and prisons—offline information stores such as WiderNet&#x27;s eGranary Digital Library (a collection of approximately thirty million educational resources from more than two thousand web sites and hundreds of CD-ROMs) provide offline access to information. More recently, the Internet Archive announced an offline server project intended to provide access to material on inexpensive servers that can be updated using USB sticks and SD cards.

===Offline storage===
Likewise, offline storage is computer data storage that has no connection to the other systems until a connection is deliberately made. Additionally, an otherwise online system that is powered down may be considered offline.

===Offline messages===
With the growing communication tools and media, the words offline and online are used very frequently. If a person is active over a messaging tool and is able to accept the messages it is termed as online message and if the person is not available and the message is left to view when the person is back, it is termed as offline message. In the same context, the person&#x27;s availability is termed as online and non-availability is termed as offline.

=== File systems ===
In the context of file systems, &quot;online&quot; and &quot;offline&quot; are synonymous with &quot;mounted&quot; and &quot;not mounted&quot;. For example, in file systems&#x27; resizing capabilities, &quot;online grow&quot; and &quot;online shrink&quot; respectively mean the ability to increase or decrease the space allocated to that file system without needing to unmount it.

==Generalisations==
Online and offline distinctions have been generalised from computing and telecommunication into the field of human interpersonal relationships. The distinction between what is considered online and what is considered offline has become a subject of study in the field of sociology.

The distinction between online and offline is conventionally seen as the distinction between computer-mediated communication and face-to-face communication (e.g., face time), respectively. Online is virtuality or cyberspace, and offline is reality (i.e., real life or &quot;meatspace&quot;). Slater states that this distinction is &quot;obviously far too simple&quot;. To support his argument that the distinctions in relationships are more complex than a simple dichotomy of online versus offline, he observes that some people draw no distinction between an online relationship, such as indulging in cybersex, and an offline relationship, such as being pen pals. He argues that even the telephone can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as PDA versus mobile phone, internet television versus internet, and telephone versus Voice over Internet Protocol) has made it &quot;impossible to use the term &quot;online&quot; meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research&quot;.

Slater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a &quot;general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction,&quot; stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to &quot;pre-existing&quot; offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as &quot;real&quot; as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding palimony to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as &quot;rather quaint and not quite comprehensible&quot; within 10 years.

This distinction between &quot;online&quot; and &quot;offline&quot; is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the desktop metaphor with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; have satirized this. One includes Saint Peter asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates &quot;the offline store&quot; where &quot;All items are actual size!&quot;, shoppers may &quot;Take it home as soon as you pay for it!&quot;, and &quot;Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!&quot;

<text>In telecommunications, a one-way trunk is a trunk between two switching centers, over which traffic may be originated from one preassigned location only.

The traffic may consist of two-way communications; the expression &quot;one way&quot; refers only to the origin of the demand for a connection. At the originating end, the one-way trunk is known as an &quot;outgoing trunk&quot;; at the other end, it is known as an &quot;incoming trunk&quot;.

<doc id="41445" wikidata="Q17072578" url="?curid=41445" title="On-premises wiring">
<text>On-premises wiring (customer premises wiring) is customer-owned transmission or distribution lines. The transmission lines may be metallic (copper) or optical fiber, and may be installed within or between buildings.

Premises wiring may consist of horizontal wiring, vertical wiring, and backbone cabling. It may extend from the point-of-entry to user work areas. Any type of telecommunications or data wiring is considered premises wiring, including telephone, computer/data, intercom, closed-circuit television.

Premises networks are wired worldwide, across every industry, in both small and large-scale applications. Any type or number of topologies may be used – star, bus, ring, etc. In 1989, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated charges for maintaining at home &quot;inside wiring&quot;; the corresponding monthly charge was dropped January 1990.

==Ownership==
The ownership of on-premises wiring varies between jurisdictions: It depends on the location of the demarcation point. The location determines ownership and responsibility for maintenance and repair.

In the United States and Canada, most premises wiring is owned by the customer. There generally is a demarcation point &quot;as close to the poles&quot; as possible. For many installations, this is a network interface device mounted on the outside of the building. In some cases, it is a minimum-point-of-entry (MPOE) location inside the building.

In the United Kingdom, the demarcation point is the wall jack, and hence most of the on-premises wiring is the property of the telephone company.

<text>Open systems architecture is a system design approach which aims to produce systems that are inherently interoperable and connectable without recourse to retrofit and redesign.

==Concept==
Systems design is a process of defining and engineering the architecture, methods, and interfaces necessary to accomplish a goal or fulfill a set of requirements. In open systems architecture, the design includes intentional provisions to make it possible to expand or modify the system at a later stage after initial operation. There is no one specific universal OSA, but it is essential the specific OSA applicable to a system is rigorously defined and documented. For example, in information technology and telecommunication, such design principles lead to open systems.

==Telecommunications==
In telecommunications, open systems architecture (OSA) is a standard that describes the layered hierarchical structure, configuration, or model of a communications or distributed data processing system. It enables system description, design, development, installation, operation, improvement, and maintenance to be performed at the abstraction layers in the hierarchical structure. Each layer provides a set of accessible functions that can be controlled and used by the functions in the layer above it. Each layer can be implemented without affecting the implementation of other layers. The alteration of system performance by the modification of one or more layers may be accomplished without altering the existing equipment, procedures, and protocols at the remaining layers.

Examples of independent alterations include the conversion from wire to optical fiber at a physical layer without affecting the data link layer or the network layer, except to provide more traffic capacity, and the altering of the operational protocols at the network level without altering the physical layer.

<doc id="41455" wikidata="Q7098828" url="?curid=41455" title="Optical attenuator">
<text>An optical attenuator, or fiber optic attenuator, is a device used to reduce the power level of an optical signal, either in free space or in an optical fiber. The basic types of optical attenuators are fixed, step-wise variable, and continuously variable.

==Applications==
Optical attenuators are commonly used in fiber-optic communications, either to test power level margins by temporarily adding a calibrated amount of signal loss, or installed permanently to properly match transmitter and receiver levels. Sharp bends stress optic fibers and can cause losses. If a received signal is too strong a temporary fix is to wrap the cable around a pencil until the desired level of attenuation is achieved. However, such arrangements are unreliable, since the stressed fiber tends to break over time.
Generally, multimode systems do not need attenuators as the multimode sources, rarely have enough power output to saturate receivers. Instead, single-mode systems, especially the long-haul DWDM network links, often need to use fiber optic attenuators to adjust the optical power during the transmission.

==Principles of operation==
The power reduction is done by such means as absorption, reflection, diffusion, scattering, deflection, diffraction, and dispersion, etc. Optical attenuators usually work by absorbing the light, like sunglasses absorb extra light energy. They typically have a working wavelength range in which they absorb all light energy equally. They should not reflect the light or scatter the light in an air gap, since that could cause unwanted back reflection in the fiber system. Another type of attenuator utilizes a length of high-loss optical fiber, that operates upon its input optical signal power level in such a way that its output signal power level is less than the input level.

==Types==
Optical attenuators can take a number of different forms and are typically classified as fixed or variable attenuators. What&#x27;s more, they can be classified as LC, SC, ST, FC, MU, E2000 etc. according to the different types of connectors.

===Fixed Attenuators===
Fixed optical attenuators used in fiber optic systems may use a variety of principles for their functioning. Preferred attenuators use either doped fibers, or mis-aligned splices, or total power since both of these are reliable and inexpensive.
&quot;Inline&quot; style attenuators are incorporated into patch cables. The alternative &quot;build out&quot; style attenuator is a small male-female adapter that can be added onto other cables.

Non-preferred attenuators often use gap loss or reflective principles. Such devices can be sensitive to: modal distribution, wavelength, contamination, vibration, temperature, damage due to power bursts, may cause back reflections, may cause signal dispersion etc.

===Loopback attenuators===
Loopback fiber optic attenuator is designed for testing, engineering and the burn-in stage of boards or other equipment. Available in SC/UPC, SC/APC, LC/UPC, LC/APC, MTRJ, MPO for singlemode application.900 um fiber cable inside of the black shell for LC and SC type.
No black shell for MTRJ and MPO type.

===Built-in variable attenuators===
Built-in variable optical attenuators may be either manually or electrically controlled. A manual device is useful for one-time set up of a system, and is a near-equivalent to a fixed attenuator, and may be referred to as an &quot;adjustable attenuator&quot;. In contrast, an electrically controlled attenuator can provide adaptive power optimization.

Attributes of merit for electrically controlled devices, include speed of response and avoiding degradation of the transmitted signal. Dynamic range is usually quite restricted, and power feedback may mean that long term stability is a relatively minor issue. Speed of response is a particularly major issue in dynamically reconfigurable systems, where a delay of one millionth of a second can result in the loss of large amounts of transmitted data. Typical technologies employed for high speed response include liquid crystal variable attenuator (LCVA), or lithium niobate devices. There is a class of built-in attenuators that is technically indistinguishable from test attenuators, except they are packaged for rack mounting, and have no test display.

===Variable optical test attenuators===
Variable optical test attenuators generally use a variable neutral density filter. Despite relatively high cost, this arrangement has the advantages of being stable, wavelength insensitive, mode insensitive, and offering a large dynamic range. Other schemes such as LCD, variable air gap etc. have been tried over the years, but with limited success.

They may be either manually or motor controlled. Motor control give regular users a distinct productivity advantage, since commonly used test sequences can be run automatically.

Attenuator instrument calibration is a major issue. The user typically would like an absolute port to port calibration. Also, calibration should usually be at a number of wavelengths and power levels, since the device is not always linear. However a number of instruments do not in fact offer these basic features, presumably in an attempt to reduce cost. The most accurate variable attenuator instruments have thousands of calibration points, resulting in excellent overall accuracy in use.

==Test automation==
Test sequences that use variable attenuators can be very time-consuming. Therefore, automation is likely to achieve useful benefits. Both bench and handheld-style devices are available that offer such features.

<text>An optical axis is an imaginary line that passes through the geometrical center of an optical system such as a camera lens, microscope or telescopic sight. Lens elements often have rotational symmetry about the axis.

The optical axis defines the path along which light propagates through the system, up to first approximation. For a system composed of simple lenses and mirrors, the axis passes through the center of curvature of each surface, and coincides with the axis of rotational symmetry. The optical axis is often coincident with the system&#x27;s mechanical axis, but not always, as in the case of off-axis optical systems.

For an optical fiber, the optical axis is along the center of the fiber core, and is also known as the &quot;fiber axis&quot;.

<doc id="41458" wikidata="Q234870" url="?curid=41458" title="Optical disc">
<text>An optical disc is a flat, usually disc-shaped object that stores information in the form of physical variations on its surface that can be read with the aid of a beam of light. Optical discs can be reflective, where the light source and detector are on the same side of the disc, or transmissive, where light shines through the disc to be detected on the other side.

Optical discs can store analog information (e.g. Laserdisc), digital information (e.g. DVD), or store both on the same disc (e.g. CD Video).

Their main uses are the distribution of media and data, and long-term archival.

== Design and technology ==
The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) that makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track.

The data are stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive that spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (outer tracks are read at a higher data speed due to higher linear velocities at the same angular velocities).

Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by their grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer.

The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. Blu-rays have a coating called durabis that mitigates these problems.

Optical discs are usually between in diameter, with being the most common size. The so-called &quot;program area&quot; that contains the data commonly starts 25 millimetres away from the center point. A typical disc is about thick, while the track pitch (distance from the center of one track to the center of the next) ranges from 1.6 μm (for CDs) to 320 nm (for Blu-ray discs).

=== Recording types ===
An optical disc is designed to support one of three recording types: read-only (such as CD and CD-ROM), recordable (write-once, like CD-R), or re-recordable (rewritable, like CD-RW). Write-once optical discs commonly have an organic dye (may also be a (phthalocyanine) azo dye, mainly used by Verbatim, or an oxonol dye, used by Fujifilm) recording layer between the substrate and the reflective layer. Rewritable discs typically contain an alloy recording layer composed of a phase change material, most often AgInSbTe, an alloy of silver, indium, antimony, and tellurium. Azo dyes were introduced in 1996 and phthalocyanine only began to see wide use in 2002. The type of dye and the material used on the reflective layer on an optical disc may be determined by shining a light through the disc, as different dye and material combinations have different colors.

Blu-ray Disc recordable discs do not usually use an organic dye recording layer, instead using an inorganic recording layer. Those that do are known as low-to-high (LTH) discs and can be made in existing CD and DVD production lines, but are of lower quality than traditional Blu-ray recordable discs.

=== File systems ===
File systems specifically created for optical discs are ISO9660 and the Universal Disk Format (UDF).

ISO9660 can be extended using the &quot;Joliet&quot; extension to store longer file names than standalone ISO9660. The &quot;Rock Ridge&quot; extension can store even longer file names and Unix/Linux-style file permissions, but is not recognized by Windows and by DVD players and similar devices that can read data discs.

For cross-platform compatibility, multiple file systems can co-exist on one disc and reference the same files.

=== Usage ===
Optical discs are most commonly used for digital preservation, storing music (particularly for use in a CD player), video (such as for use in a Blu-ray player), or data and programs for personal computers (PC), as well as offline hard copy data distribution due to lower per-unit prices than other types of media. The Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA) promoted standardized optical storage formats.

Libraries and archives enact optical media preservation procedures to ensure continued usability in the computer&#x27;s optical disc drive or corresponding disc player.

File operations of traditional mass storage devices such as flash drives, memory cards and hard drives can be simulated using a UDF live file system.

For computer data backup and physical data transfer, optical discs such as CDs and DVDs are gradually being replaced with faster, smaller solid-state devices, especially the USB flash drive. This trend is expected to continue as USB flash drives continue to increase in capacity and drop in price.

Additionally, music, movies, games, software and TV shows purchased, shared or streamed over the Internet has significantly reduced the number of audio CDs, video DVDs and Blu-ray discs sold annually. However, audio CDs and Blu-rays are still preferred and bought by some, as a way of supporting their favorite works while getting something tangible in return and also since audio CDs (alongside vinyl records and cassette tapes) contain uncompressed audio without the artifacts introduced by lossy compression algorithms like MP3, and Blu-rays offer better image and sound quality than streaming media, without visible compression artifacts, due to higher bitrates and more available storage space. However, Blu-rays may sometimes be torrented over the internet, but torrenting may not be an option for some, due to restrictions put in place by ISPs on legal or copyright grounds, low download speeds or not having enough available storage space, since the content may weigh up to several dozen gigabytes. Blu-rays may be the only option for those looking to play large games without having to download them over an unreliable or slow internet connection, which is the reason why they are still (as of 2020) widely used by gaming consoles, like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One X. As of 2020, it is unusual for PC games to be available in a physical format like Blu-ray.

Optical discs are typically stored in special cases, sometimes called &quot;jewel cases&quot;. Discs should not have any stickers and should not be stored together with paper; papers must be removed from the jewel case before storage. Discs should be handled by the edges to prevent scratching, with the thumb on the inner edge of the disc. The ISO Standard 18938:2014 is about best optical disc handling techniques. Optical disc cleaning should never be done in a circular pattern, to avoid concentric cirles from forming on the disc. Improper cleaning can scratch the disc. Recordable discs should not be exposed to light for extended periods of time. Optical discs should be stored in dry and cool conditions to increase longevity, with temperatures between -10 and 23 °C, never exceeding 32 °C, and with humidity never falling below 10%, with recommended storage at 20 to 50% of humidity without fluctuations of more than ±10%.

=== Durability ===

Although optical discs are more durable than earlier audio-visual and data storage formats, they are susceptible to environmental and daily-use damage, if handled improperly.

Optical discs are not prone to uncontrollable catastrophic failures such as head crashes, power surges, or exposure to water like hard disk drives and flash storage, since optical drives&#x27; storage controllers are not tied to optical discs themselves like with hard disk drives and flash memory controllers, and a disc is usually recoverable from a defective optical drive by pushing an unsharp needle into the emergency ejection pinhole, and has no point of immediate water ingress and no integrated circuitry.

=== Security ===
As the media itself only is accessed through a laser beam and has no internal control circuitry, it cannot contain malicious hardware in the same way as so-called &quot;rubber-duckies&quot; or &quot;USB killers&quot;. Like any data storage media, optical discs can contain malicious &quot;data,&quot; they are able to contain and spread malware - as happened in the case of the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal in 2005 where Sony misused discs by pre-loading them with malware.

Many types of optical discs are factory-pressed or finalized write once read many storage devices and would therefore not be effective at spreading computer worms that are designed to spread by copying themselves onto optical media, because data on those discs can not be modified once pressed or written. However, re-writable disc technologies (such as CD-RW) &quot;are&quot; able to spread this type of malware.

== History ==
 

The first recorded historical use of an optical disc was in 1884 when Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter recorded sound on a glass disc using a beam of light.

Optophonie is a very early (1931) example of a recording device using light for both recording and playing back sound signals on a transparent photograph.

An early analogue optical disc system existed in 1935, used on Welte&#x27;s sampling organ.

An early analog optical disc used for video recording was invented by David Paul Gregg in 1958 and patented in the US in 1961 and 1969. This form of optical disc was a very early form of the DVD (). It is of special interest that , filed 1989, issued 1990, generated royalty income for Pioneer Corporation&#x27;s DVA until 2007 —then encompassing the CD, DVD, and Blu-ray systems. In the early 1960s, the Music Corporation of America bought Gregg&#x27;s patents and his company, Gauss Electrophysics.

American inventor James T. Russell has been credited with inventing the first system to record a digital signal on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp. Russell&#x27;s patent application was first filed in 1966 and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell&#x27;s patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.

Both Gregg&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s disc are floppy media read in transparent mode, which imposes serious drawbacks, after this were developed four generations of optical drive that includes Laserdisc (1969), WORM (1979), Compact Discs (1984), DVD (1995), Blu-ray (2005), HD-DVD (2006), more formats are currently under development.

===First-generation===
From the start optical discs were used to store broadcast-quality analog video, and later digital media such as music or computer software. The LaserDisc format stored analog video signals for the distribution of home video, but commercially lost to the VHS videocassette format, due mainly to its high cost and non-re-recordability; other first-generation disc formats were designed only to store digital data and were not initially capable of use as a digital video medium.

Most first-generation disc devices had an infrared laser reading head. The minimum size of the laser spot is proportional to the wavelength of the laser, so wavelength is a limiting factor upon the amount of information that can be stored in a given physical area on the disc. The infrared range is beyond the long-wavelength end of the visible light spectrum, so it supports less density than shorter-wavelength visible light. One example of high-density data storage capacity, achieved with an infrared laser, is 700 MB of net user data for a 12 cm compact disc.

Other factors that affect data storage density include: the existence of multiple layers of data on the disc, the method of rotation (Constant linear velocity (CLV), Constant angular velocity (CAV), or zoned-CAV), the composition of lands and pits, and how much margin is unused is at the center and the edge of the disc.

====Laserdisc====
In the Netherlands in 1969, Philips Research physicist, Pieter Kramer invented an optical videodisc in reflective mode with a protective layer read by a focused laser beam , filed 1972, issued 1991. Kramer&#x27;s physical format is used in all optical discs. 

In 1975, Philips and MCA began to work together, and in 1978, commercially much too late, they presented their long-awaited Laserdisc in Atlanta. MCA delivered the discs and Philips the players. However, the presentation was a commercial failure, and the cooperation ended.

In Japan and the U.S., Pioneer succeeded with the Laserdisc until the advent of the DVD. In 1979, Philips and Sony, in consortium, successfully developed the audio compact disc.

====WORM drive====

In 1979, Exxon STAR Systems in Pasadena, CA built a computer controlled WORM drive that utilized thin film coatings of Tellurium and Selenium on a 12&quot; diameter glass disk. The recording system utilized blue light at 457 nm to record and red light at 632.8 nm to read. STAR Systems was bought by Storage Technology Corporation (STC) in 1981 and moved to Boulder, CO. Development of the WORM technology was continued using 14&quot; diameter aluminum substrates. Beta testing of the disk drives, originally labeled the Laser Storage Drive 2000 (LSD-2000), was only moderately successful. Many of the disks were shipped to RCA Laboratories (now David Sarnoff Research Center) to be used in the Library of Congress archiving efforts. The STC disks utilized a sealed cartridge with an optical window for protection .

====CD-ROM====

The CD-ROM format was developed by Sony and Philips, introduced in 1984, as an extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio and adapted to hold any form of digital data. The same year, Sony demonstrated a LaserDisc data storage format, with a larger data capacity of 3.28 GB.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Optex, Inc. of Rockville, MD, built an erasable optical digital video disc system using Electron Trapping Optical Media (ETOM). Although this technology was written up in Video Pro Magazine&#x27;s December 1994 issue promising &quot;the death of the tape&quot;, it was never marketed.

Magnetic disks found limited applications in storing the data in large amount. So, there was the need of finding some more data storing techniques. As a result, it was found that by using optical means large data storing devices can be made that in turn gave rise to the optical discs. The very first application of this kind was the compact disc (CD), which was used in audio systems.

Sony and Philips developed the first generation of the CDs in the mid-1980s with the complete specifications for these devices. With the help of this kind of technology the possibility of representing the analog signal into digital signal was exploited to a great level. For this purpose, the 16-bit samples of the analog signal were taken at the rate of 44,100 samples per second. This sample rate was based on the Nyquist rate of 40,000 samples per second required to capture the audible frequency range to 20 kHz without aliasing, with an additional tolerance to allow the use of less-than-perfect analog audio pre-filters to remove any higher frequencies. The first version of the standard allowed up to 74 minutes of music or 650 MB of data storage.

===Second-generation===
Second-generation optical discs were for storing great amounts of data, including broadcast-quality digital video. Such discs usually are read with a visible-light laser (usually red); the shorter wavelength and greater numerical aperture allow a narrower light beam, permitting smaller pits and lands in the disc. In the DVD format, this allows 4.7 GB storage on a standard 12 cm, single-sided, single-layer disc; alternatively, smaller media, such as the DataPlay format, can have capacity comparable to that of the larger, standard compact 12 cm disc.

* Wii Optical Disc (DVD derivative)
* Super Audio CD (SACD)
* Enhanced Versatile Disc

* Hi-MD
* Universal Media Disc (UMD)

====DVD-ROM====

In 1995, a consortium of manufacturers (Sony, Philips, Toshiba, Panasonic) developed the second generation of the optical disc, the DVD. The DVD disc appeared after the CD-ROM had become widespread in society.

===Third-generation===
Third-generation optical discs are used for distributing high-definition video and videogames and support greater data storage capacities, accomplished with short-wavelength visible-light lasers and greater numerical apertures. Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD uses blue-violet lasers and focusing optics of greater aperture, for use with discs with smaller pits and lands, thereby greater data storage capacity per layer.
In practice, the effective multimedia presentation capacity is improved with enhanced video data compression codecs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1.

* Forward Versatile Disc

====Blu-ray and HD-DVD====

The third generation optical disc was developed in 2000–2006 and was introduced as Blu-ray Disc. First movies on Blu-ray Discs were released in June 2006. Blu-ray eventually prevailed in a high definition optical disc format war over a competing format, the HD DVD. A standard Blu-ray disc can hold about 25 GB of data, a DVD about 4.7 GB, and a CD about 700 MB.

===Fourth-generation===
The following formats go beyond the current third-generation discs and have the potential to hold more than one terabyte (1 TB) of data and at least some are meant for cold data storage in data centers:
* Archival Disc
* Holographic Versatile Disc
Announced but not released:
* LS-R
* Protein-coated disc
* Stacked Volumetric Optical Disc
* 5D DVD
* 3D optical data storage (not a single technology, examples are Hyper CD-ROM and Fluorescent Multilayer Disc)

In 2004, development of the Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD) commenced, which promised the storage of several terabytes of data per disc. However, development stagnated towards the late 2000s due to lack of funding.

In 2006, it was reported that Japanese researchers developed ultraviolet ray lasers with a wavelength of 210 nanometers, which would enable a higher bit density than Blu-ray discs. As of 2022, no updates on that project have been reported.

===Overview of optical types===

;Notes
==Recordable and writable optical discs==

There are numerous formats of optical direct to disk recording devices on the market, all of which are based on using a laser to change the reflectivity of the digital recording medium in order to duplicate the effects of the pits and lands created when a commercial optical disc is pressed. Formats such as CD-R and DVD-R are &quot;Write once read many&quot; or write-once, while CD-RW and DVD-RW are rewritable, more like a magnetic recording hard disk drive (HDD).

Media technologies vary, for example, M-DISC media uses a rock-like layer to retain data for longer than conventional recordable media. While being read-only compatible with existing DVD and Blu-ray drives, M-DISC media can only be written to using a stronger laser specifically made for this purpose, which is built into fewer optical drive models.

==Surface error scanning==
Optical media can predictively be scanned for errors and media deterioration well before any data becomes unreadable. Optical formats include some redundancy for error correction, which works until the amount of error exceeds a threshold. A higher rate of errors may indicate deteriorating and/or low quality media, physical damage, an unclean surface and/or media written using a defective optical drive.

Precise error scanning requires access to the raw, uncorrected readout of a disc, which is not always provided by a drive. As a result, support of this functionality varies per optical drive manufacturer and model. On ordinary drives without this functionality, it is possible to still look for unexpected reduction in read speed as an indirect, much less reliable measure.

Optical media, such as CDs and DVDs, can be scanned to detect errors and signs of deterioration well before data becomes unreadable. These formats include built-in error correction mechanisms, which function by adding redundant data. However, once the rate of errors surpasses the correction threshold, the media becomes vulnerable to failure. A high error rate can signal physical deterioration, low-quality manufacturing, surface contamination, or data recorded by a faulty optical drive.

Accurate error scanning requires access to a disc&#x27;s raw, uncorrected readout. However, not all optical drives provide this capability, and support for this feature can vary significantly between manufacturers and drive models. On drives lacking raw data access, users may rely on a less precise method: monitoring unexpected reductions in read speed, though this is a far less reliable indicator of disc health.

Several specialized tools are available for performing error scans on optical media. Popular programs include Nero DiscSpeed, K-Probe, Opti Drive Control (previously known as &quot;CD Speed 2000&quot;), and DVD Info Pro for Windows. For cross-platform users, QPxTool is available to help monitor and maintain optical media integrity. Each of these tools allows for detailed analysis of the error rates and conditions affecting optical discs.

=== Error types ===
There are different types of error measurements, including so-called &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C2&quot; and &quot;CU&quot; errors on CDs, and &quot;PI/PO (parity inner/outer) errors&quot; and the more critical &quot;PI/PO failures&quot; on DVDs. Finer-grain error measurements on CDs supported by very few optical drives are called &quot;E11&quot;, &quot;E21&quot;, &quot;E31&quot;, &quot;E21&quot;, &quot;E22&quot;, &quot;E32&quot;.

&quot;CU&quot; and &quot;POF&quot; represent uncorrectable errors on data CDs and DVDs respectively, thus data loss, and can be a result of too many consecutive smaller errors.

Due to the weaker error correction used on Audio CDs (Red Book standard) and Video CDs (White Book standard), C2 errors already lead to data loss. However, even with C2 errors, the damage is inaudible to some extent.

Blu-ray discs use so-called &quot;LDC&quot; (&quot;Long Distance Code&quot;s) and &quot;BIS&quot; (&quot;Burst Indication Subcode&quot;s) error parameters. According to the developer of the &quot;Opti Drive Control&quot; software, a disc can be considered healthy at an &quot;LDC&quot; error rate below 13 and &quot;BIS&quot; error rate below 15.

==Optical disc manufacturing==

Optical discs are made using replication. This process can be used with all disc types. Recordable discs have pre-recorded vital information, like manufacturer, disc type, maximum read and write speeds, etc. In replication, a cleanroom with yellow light is necessary to protect the light-sensitive photoresist and to prevent dust from corrupting the data on the disc.

A glass master is used in replication. The master is placed in a machine that cleans it as much as possible using a rotating brush and deionized water, preparing it for the next step. In the next step, a surface analyzer inspects the cleanliness of the master before photoresist is applied on the master.
The photoresist is then baked in an oven to solidify it. Then, in the exposure process, the master is placed in a turntable where a laser selectively exposes the resist to light. At the same time, a developer and deionized water are applied to the disc to remove the exposed resist. This process forms the pits and lands that represent the data on the disc.

A thin coating of metal is then applied to the master, making a negative of the master with the pits and lands in it. The negative is then peeled off the master and coated in a thin layer of plastic. The plastic protects the coating while a punching press punches a hole into the center of the disc, and punches excess material.

The negative is now a stamper - a part of the mold that will be used for replication. It is placed on one side of the mold with the data side containing the pits and lands facing out. This is done inside an injection molding machine. The machine then closes the mold and injects polycarbonate in the cavity formed by the walls of the mold, which forms or molds the disc with the data on it.

The molten polycarbonate fills the pits or spaces between the lands on the negative, acquiring their shape when it solidifies. This step is somewhat similar to record pressing.

The polycarbonate disc cools quickly and is promptly removed from the machine, before forming another disc. The disc is then metallized, covered with a thin reflective layer of aluminum. The aluminum fills the space once occupied by the negative.

A layer of varnish is then applied to protect the aluminum coating and provide a surface suitable for printing. The varnish is applied near the center of the disc, and the disc is spun, evenly distributing the varnish on the surface of the disc. The varnish is hardened using UV light. The discs are then silkscreened or a label is otherwise applied.

Recordable discs add a dye layer, and rewritable discs add a phase change alloy layer instead, which is protected by upper and lower dielectric (electrically insulating) layers. The layers may be sputtered. The additional layer is between the grooves and the reflective layer of the disc. Grooves are made in recordable discs in place of the traditional pits and lands found in replicated discs, and the two can be made in the same exposure process. In DVDs, the same processes as in CDs are carried out, but in a thinner disc. The thinner disc is then bonded to a second, equally thin but blank, disc using UV-curable Liquid optically clear adhesive, forming a DVD disc. This leaves the data in the middle of the disc, which is necessary for DVDs to achieve their storage capacity. In multi layer discs, semi reflective instead of reflective coatings are used for all layers except the last layer, which is the deepest one and uses a traditional reflective coating.

Dual layer DVDs are made slightly differently. After metallization (with a thinner metal layer to allow some light to pass through), base and pit transfer resins are applied and pre-cured in the center of the disc. Then the disc is pressed again using a different stamper, and the resins are completely cured using UV light before being separated from the stamper. Then the disc receives another, thicker metallization layer, and is then bonded to the blank disc using LOCA glue. DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL discs receive a dye layer after curing, but before metallization. CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R discs receive the dye layer after pressing but before metallization. CD-RW, DVD-RW and DVD+RW receive a metal alloy layer sandwiched between 2 dielectric layers. HD-DVD is made in the same way as DVD. In recordable and rewritable media, most of the stamper is composed of grooves, not pits and lands. The grooves contain a wobble frequency that is used to locate the position of the reading or writing laser on the disc. DVDs use pre-pits instead, with a constant frequency wobble.

===Blu-ray===
&quot;HTL&quot; (high-to-low type) Blu-ray discs are made differently. First, a silicon wafer is used instead of a glass master. The wafer is processed in the same way a glass master would.

The wafer is then electroplated to form a 300-micron thick nickel stamper, which is peeled off from the wafer. The stamper is mounted onto a mold inside a press or embosser.

The polycarbonate discs are molded in a similar fashion to DVD and CD discs. If the discs being produced are BD-Rs or BD-REs, the mold is fitted with a stamper that stamps a groove pattern onto the discs, in lieu of the pits and lands found on BD-ROM discs.

After cooling, a 35 nanometre-thick layer of silver alloy is applied to the disc using sputtering. Then the second layer is made by applying base and pit transfer resins to the disc, and are pre-cured in its center.

After application and pre-curing, the disc is pressed or embossed using a stamper and the resins are immediately cured using intense UV light, before the disc is separated from the stamper. The stamper contains the data that will be transferred to the disc. This process is known as embossing and is the step that engraves the data onto the disc, replacing the pressing process used in the first layer, and it is also used for multi layer DVD discs.

Then, a 30 nanometre-thick layer of silver alloy is then sputtered onto the disc and the process is repeated as many times as required. Each repetition creates a new data layer. (The resins are applied again, pre-cured, stamped (with data or grooves) and cured, silver alloy is sputtered and so on)

BD-R and BD-RE discs receive (through sputtering) a metal (recording layer) alloy (that is sandwiched between two dielectric layers, also sputtered, in BD-RE), before receiving the 30 nanometre metallization (silver alloy, aluminum or gold) layer, which is sputtered. Alternatively, the silver alloy may be applied before the recording layer is applied. Silver alloys are usually used in Blu-rays, and aluminum is usually used on CDs and DVDs. Gold is used in some &quot;Archival&quot; CDs and DVDs, since it is more chemically inert and resistant to corrosion than aluminum, which corrodes into aluminum oxide, which can be seen in disc rot as transparent patches or dots in the disc, that prevent the disc from being read, since the laser light passes through the disc instead of being reflected back into the laser pickup assembly to be read. Normally, aluminum does not corrode since it has a thin oxide layer that forms on contact with oxygen. In this case, it can corrode due to its thinness.

Then, the 98 micron-thick cover layer is applied using UV-curable liquid optically clear adhesive, and a 2 micron-thick hard coat (such as Durabis) is also applied and cured using UV light. In the last step, a 10 nanometre-thick silicon nitride barrier layer is applied to the label side of the disc to protect against humidity. Blu-rays have their data very close to the read surface of the disc, which is necessary for Blu-rays to achieve their capacity.

Discs in large quantities can either be replicated or duplicated. In replication, the process explained above is used to make the discs, while in duplication, CD-R, DVD-R or BD-R discs are recorded and finalized to prevent further recording and allow for wider compatibility. (See Optical disc authoring). The equipment is also different: replication is carried out by fully automated purpose-built machinery whose cost is in the hundreds of thousands of US dollars in the used market, while duplication can be automated (using what&#x27;s known as an autoloader) or be done by hand, and only requires a small tabletop duplicator.

<text>An optical isolator, or optical diode, is an optical component which allows the transmission of light in only one direction. It is typically used to prevent unwanted feedback into an optical oscillator, such as a laser cavity.

The operation of conventional optical isolators relies on the Faraday effect (which in turn is produced by magneto-optic effect), which is used in the main component, the Faraday rotator. However, integrated isolators which do not rely on magnetism have been made in recent years too. 

==Theory==

The main component of the optical isolator is the Faraday rotator. The magnetic field, formula_1, applied to the Faraday rotator causes a rotation in the polarization of the light due to the Faraday effect. The angle of rotation, formula_2, is given by,
:formula_3,
where, formula_4 is the Verdet constant of the material (amorphous or crystalline solid, or liquid, or crystalline liquid, or vaprous, or gaseous) of which the rotator is made, and formula_5 is the length of the rotator. This is shown in Figure 2. Specifically for an optical isolator, the values are chosen to give a rotation of 45°.

It has been shown that a crucial requirement for any kind of optical isolator (not only the Faraday isolator) is some kind of non-reciprocal optics 

==Polarization dependent isolator==

The polarization dependent isolator, or Faraday isolator, is made of three parts, an input polarizer (polarized vertically), a Faraday rotator, and an output polarizer, called an analyzer (polarized at 45°).

Light traveling in the forward direction becomes polarized vertically by the input polarizer. The Faraday rotator will rotate the polarization by 45°. The analyzer then enables the light to be transmitted through the isolator.

Light traveling in the backward direction becomes polarized at 45° by the analyzer. The Faraday rotator will again rotate the polarization by 45°. This means the light is polarized horizontally (the direction of rotation is not sensitive to the direction of propagation). Since the polarizer is vertically aligned, the light will be extinguished.

Figure 2 shows a Faraday rotator with an input polarizer, and an output analyzer. For a polarization dependent isolator, the angle between the polarizer and the analyzer, formula_2, is set to 45°. The Faraday rotator is chosen to give a 45° rotation.

Polarization dependent isolators are typically used in free space optical systems. This is because the polarization of the source is typically maintained by the system. In optical fibre systems, the polarization direction is typically dispersed in non polarization maintaining systems. Hence the angle of polarization will lead to a loss.

==Polarization independent isolator==

The polarization independent isolator is made of three parts, an input birefringent wedge (with its ordinary polarization direction vertical and its extraordinary polarization direction horizontal), a Faraday rotator, and an output birefringent wedge (with its ordinary polarization direction at 45°, and its extraordinary polarization direction at −45°).

Light traveling in the forward direction is split by the input birefringent wedge into its vertical (0°) and horizontal (90°) components, called the ordinary ray (o-ray) and the extraordinary ray (e-ray) respectively. The Faraday rotator rotates both the o-ray and e-ray by 45°. This means the o-ray is now at 45°, and the e-ray is at −45°. The output birefringent wedge then recombines the two components.

Light traveling in the backward direction is separated into the o-ray at 45, and the e-ray at −45° by the birefringent wedge. The Faraday Rotator again rotates both the rays by 45°. Now the o-ray is at 90°, and the e-ray is at 0°. Instead of being focused by the second birefringent wedge, the rays diverge.

Typically collimators are used on either side of the isolator. In the transmitted direction the beam is split and then combined and focused into the output collimator. In the isolated direction the beam is split, and then diverged, so it does not focus at the collimator.

Figure 3 shows the propagation of light through a polarization independent isolator. The forward travelling light is shown in blue, and the backward propagating light is shown in red. The rays were traced using an ordinary refractive index of 2, and an extraordinary refractive index of 3. The wedge angle is 7°.

==The Faraday rotator==

The most important optical element in an isolator is the Faraday rotator. The characteristics that one looks for in a Faraday rotator optic include a high Verdet constant, low absorption coefficient, low non-linear refractive index and high damage threshold. Also, to prevent self-focusing and other thermal related effects, the optic should be as short as possible. The two most commonly used materials for the 700–1100 nm range are terbium doped borosilicate glass and terbium gallium garnet crystal (TGG). For long distance fibre communication, typically at 1310 nm or 1550 nm, yttrium iron garnet crystals are used (YIG). Commercial YIG based Faraday isolators reach isolations higher than 30 dB.

Optical isolators are different from 1/4 wave plate based isolators because the Faraday rotator provides non-reciprocal rotation while maintaining linear polarization. That is, the polarization rotation due to the Faraday rotator is always in the same relative direction. So in the forward direction, the rotation is positive 45°. In the reverse direction, the rotation is −45°. This is due to the change in the relative magnetic field direction, positive one way, negative the other. This then adds to a total of 90° when the light travels in the forward direction and then the negative direction. This allows the higher isolation to be achieved.

==Optical isolators and thermodynamics==
It might seem at first glance that a device that allows light to flow in only one direction would violate Kirchhoff&#x27;s law and the second law of thermodynamics, by allowing light energy to flow from a cold object to a hot object and blocking it in the other direction, but the violation is avoided because the isolator must absorb (not reflect) the light from the hot object and will eventually reradiate it to the cold one. Attempts to re-route the photons back to their source unavoidably involve creating a route by which other photons can travel from the hot body to the cold one, avoiding the paradox.

<text>In optics, optical path length (OPL, denoted Λ in equations), also known as optical length or optical distance, is the length that light needs to travel through a vacuum to create the same phase difference as it would have when traveling through a given medium. It is calculated by taking the product of the geometric length of the optical path followed by light and the refractive index of the homogeneous medium through which the light ray propagates; for inhomogeneous optical media, the product above is generalized as a path integral as part of the ray tracing procedure. A difference in OPL between two paths is often called the optical path difference (OPD). OPL and OPD are important because they determine the phase of the light and govern interference and diffraction of light as it propagates.

In a medium of constant refractive index, &quot;n&quot;, the OPL for a path of geometrical length &quot;s&quot; is just

:formula_1

If the refractive index varies along the path, the OPL is given by a line integral

:formula_2

where &quot;n&quot; is the local refractive index as a function of distance along the path &quot;C&quot;.

An electromagnetic wave propagating along a path &quot;C&quot; has the phase shift over &quot;C&quot; as if it was propagating a path in a vacuum, length of which, is equal to the optical path length of &quot;C&quot;. Thus, if a wave is traveling through several different media, then the optical path length of each medium can be added to find the total optical path length. The optical path difference between the paths taken by two identical waves can then be used to find the phase change. Finally, using the phase change, the interference between the two waves can be calculated.

Fermat&#x27;s principle states that the path light takes between two points is the path that has the minimum optical path length.

== Optical path difference ==

The OPD corresponds to the phase shift undergone by the light emitted from two previously coherent sources when passed through mediums of different refractive indices. For example, a wave passing through air appears to travel a shorter distance than an identical wave traveling the same distance in glass. This is because a larger number of wavelengths fit in the same distance due to the higher refractive index of the glass.

The OPD can be calculated from the following equation:

:formula_3
where &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2 are the distances of the ray passing through medium 1 or 2, &quot;n&quot;1 is the greater refractive index (e.g., glass) and &quot;n&quot;2 is the smaller refractive index (e.g., air).

<text>The optical power budget (also fiber-optic link budget and loss budget) in a fiber-optic communication link is the allocation of available optical power (launched into a given fiber by a given source) among various loss-producing mechanisms such as launch coupling loss, fiber attenuation, splice losses, and connector losses, in order to ensure that adequate signal strength (optical power) is available at the receiver. In optical power budget attenuation is specified in decibel (dB) and optical power in dBm.

The amount of optical power launched into a given fiber by a given transmitter depends on the nature of its active optical source (LED or laser diode) and the type of fiber, including such parameters as core diameter and numerical aperture. Manufacturers sometimes specify an optical power budget only for a fiber that is optimum for their equipment—or specify only that their equipment will operate over a given distance, without mentioning the fiber characteristics. The user must first ascertain, from the manufacturer or by testing, the transmission losses for the type of fiber to be used, and the required signal strength for a given level of performance.

In addition to transmission loss, including those of any splices and connectors, allowance should be made for at least several dB of optical power margin losses, to compensate for component aging and to allow for future splices in the event of a severed cable.

:&quot;L&quot;T = &quot;αL&quot; + &quot;L&quot;c + &quot;L&quot;s

Definitions:
*&quot;L&quot;T - Total loss
*&quot;α&quot; - Fiber attenuation
*&quot;L&quot; - Length of fiber
*&quot;L&quot;c - Connector loss
*&quot;L&quot;s - Splice loss

Passive optical networks use optical splitters to divide the downstream signal into up to 32 streams, most often a power of two. Each division in two halves the transmitted power and therefore causes a minimum attenuation of 3 dB (formula_1 ≈ 10−0.3).

<doc id="41464" wikidata="Q76299" url="?curid=41464" title="Visible spectrum">
<text>The visible spectrum is the band of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called &quot;visible light&quot; (or simply light).
The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well, known collectively as &quot;optical radiation&quot;.

A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400–790 terahertz. These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual. Under optimal conditions, these limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (ultraviolet) and 1100 nm (near infrared).

The spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human visual system can distinguish. &quot;Unsaturated colors&quot; such as pink, or purple variations like magenta, for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called &quot;pure colors&quot; or spectral colors.

Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere via the &quot;optical window&quot; region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the Sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much). The optical window is also referred to as the &quot;visible window&quot; because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The near infrared (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long-wavelength or far-infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may perceive them.

==Spectral colors==
Colors that can be produced by visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (monochromatic light) are called pure spectral colors. The various color ranges indicated in the illustration are an approximation: The spectrum is continuous, with no clear boundaries between one color and the next.

==History==
In the 13th century, Roger Bacon theorized that rainbows were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.

In the 17th century, Isaac Newton discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book &quot;Opticks&quot;. He was the first to use the word &quot;spectrum&quot; (Latin for &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;apparition&quot;) in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his experiments in optics. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of sunlight strikes the face of a glass prism at an angle, some is reflected and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of &quot;corpuscles&quot; (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent (refracted) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.

 Newton originally divided the spectrum into six named colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. He later added indigo as the seventh color since he believed that seven was a perfect number as derived from the ancient Greek sophists, of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the Solar System, and the days of the week. The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo&#x27;s frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including Isaac Asimov, have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. Evidence indicates that what Newton meant by &quot;indigo&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton&#x27;s observation of prismatic colors with a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that &quot;indigo&quot; corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas his &quot;blue&quot; corresponds to cyan.

In the 18th century, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote about optical spectra in his &quot;Theory of Colours&quot;. Goethe used the word &quot;spectrum&quot; (&quot;Spektrum&quot;) to designate a ghostly optical afterimage, as did Schopenhauer in &quot;On Vision and Colors&quot;. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with white between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.

In the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by William Herschel (infrared) and Johann Wilhelm Ritter (ultraviolet), Thomas Young, Thomas Johann Seebeck, and others.
Young was the first to measure the wavelengths of different colors of light, in 1802.

The connection between the visible spectrum and color vision was explored by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early 19th century. Their theory of color vision correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.
==Limits to visible range==

The visible spectrum is limited to wavelengths that can both reach the retina and trigger visual phototransduction (excite a visual opsin). Insensitivity to UV light is generally limited by transmission through the lens. Insensitivity to IR light is limited by the spectral sensitivity functions of the visual opsins. The range is defined psychometrically by the luminous efficiency function, which accounts for all of these factors. In humans, there is a separate function for each of two visual systems, one for photopic vision, used in daylight, which is mediated by cone cells, and one for scotopic vision, used in dim light, which is mediated by rod cells. Each of these functions have different visible ranges. However, discussion on the visible range generally assumes photopic vision.

===Atmospheric transmission===
The visible range of most animals evolved to match the optical window, which is the range of light that can pass through the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbs almost all UV light (below 315 nm). However, this only affects cosmic light (e.g. sunlight), not terrestrial light (e.g. Bioluminescence).

===Ocular transmission===

Before reaching the retina, light must first transmit through the cornea and lens. UVB light (&lt; 315 nm) is filtered mostly by the cornea, and UVA light (315–400 nm) is filtered mostly by the lens. The lens also yellows with age, attenuating transmission most strongly at the blue part of the spectrum. This can cause xanthopsia as well as a slight truncation of the short-wave (blue) limit of the visible spectrum. Subjects with aphakia are missing a lens, so UVA light can reach the retina and excite the visual opsins; this expands the visible range and may also lead to cyanopsia.

===Opsin absorption===
Each opsin has a spectral sensitivity function, which defines how likely it is to absorb a photon of each wavelength. The luminous efficiency function is approximately the superposition of the contributing visual opsins. Variance in the position of the individual opsin spectral sensitivity functions therefore affects the luminous efficiency function and the visible range. For example, the long-wave (red) limit changes proportionally to the position of the L-opsin. The positions are defined by the peak wavelength (wavelength of highest sensitivity), so as the L-opsin peak wavelength blue shifts by 10 nm, the long-wave limit of the visible spectrum also shifts 10 nm. Large deviations of the L-opsin peak wavelength lead to a form of color blindness called protanomaly and a missing L-opsin (protanopia) shortens the visible spectrum by about 30 nm at the long-wave limit. Forms of color blindness affecting the M-opsin and S-opsin do not significantly affect the luminous efficiency function nor the limits of the visible spectrum.

===Different definitions===
Regardless of actual physical and biological variance, the definition of the limits is not standard and will change depending on the industry. For example, some industries may be concerned with practical limits, so would conservatively report 420–680 nm, while others may be concerned with psychometrics and achieving the broadest spectrum would liberally report 380–750, or even 380–800 nm. The luminous efficiency function in the NIR does not have a hard cutoff, but rather an exponential decay, such that the function&#x27;s value (or vision sensitivity) at 1,050 nm is about 109 times weaker than at 700 nm; much higher intensity is therefore required to perceive 1,050 nm light than 700 nm light.

=== Vision outside the visible spectrum ===
Under ideal laboratory conditions, subjects may perceive infrared light up to at least 1,064 nm. While 1,050 nm NIR light can evoke red, suggesting direct absorption by the L-opsin, there are also reports that pulsed NIR lasers can evoke green, which suggests two-photon absorption may be enabling extended NIR sensitivity.

Similarly, young subjects may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310–313 nm, but detection of light below 380 nm may be due to fluorescence of the ocular media, rather than direct absorption of UV light by the opsins. As UVA light is absorbed by the ocular media (lens and cornea), it may fluoresce and be released at a lower energy (longer wavelength) that can then be absorbed by the opsins. For example, when the lens absorbs 350 nm light, the fluorescence emission spectrum is centered on 440 nm.

===Non-visual light detection===
In addition to the photopic and scotopic systems, humans have other systems for detecting light that do not contribute to the primary visual system. For example, melanopsin has an absorption range of 420–540 nm and regulates circadian rhythm and other reflexive processes. Since the melanopsin system does not form images, it is not strictly considered vision and does not contribute to the visible range.

==In non-humans==

The visible spectrum is defined as that visible to humans, but the variance between species is large. Not only can cone opsins be spectrally shifted to alter the visible range, but vertebrates with 4 cones (tetrachromatic) or 2 cones (dichromatic) relative to humans&#x27; 3 (trichromatic) will also tend to have a wider or narrower visible spectrum than humans, respectively.

Vertebrates tend to have 1-4 different opsin classes:
* longwave sensitive (LWS) with peak sensitivity between 500–570 nm,
* middlewave sensitive (MWS) with peak sensitivity between 480–520 nm,
* shortwave sensitive (SWS) with peak sensitivity between 415–470 nm, and
* violet/ultraviolet sensitive (VS/UVS) with peak sensitivity between 355–435 nm.
Testing the visual systems of animals behaviorally is difficult, so the visible range of animals is usually estimated by comparing the peak wavelengths of opsins with those of typical humans (S-opsin at 420 nm and L-opsin at 560 nm).

===Mammals===
Most mammals have retained only two opsin classes (LWS and VS), due likely to the nocturnal bottleneck. However, old world primates (including humans) have since evolved two versions in the LWS class to regain trichromacy. Unlike most mammals, rodents&#x27; UVS opsins have remained at shorter wavelengths. Along with their lack of UV filters in the lens, mice have a UVS opsin that can detect down to 340 nm. While allowing UV light to reach the retina can lead to retinal damage, the short lifespan of mice compared with other mammals may minimize this disadvantage relative to the advantage of UV vision. Dogs have two cone opsins at 429 nm and 555 nm, so see almost the entire visible spectrum of humans, despite being dichromatic. Horses have two cone opsins at 428 nm and 539 nm, yielding a slightly more truncated red vision.

===Birds===

Most other vertebrates (birds, lizards, fish, etc.) have retained their tetrachromacy, including UVS opsins that extend further into the ultraviolet than humans&#x27; VS opsin. The sensitivity of avian UVS opsins vary greatly, from 355–425 nm, and LWS opsins from 560–570 nm. This translates to some birds with a visible spectrum on par with humans, and other birds with greatly expanded sensitivity to UV light. The LWS opsin of birds is sometimes reported to have a peak wavelength above 600 nm, but this is an effective peak wavelength that incorporates the filter of avian oil droplets. The peak wavelength of the LWS opsin alone is the better predictor of the long-wave limit. A possible benefit of avian UV vision involves sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.

===Fish===

Teleosts (bony fish) are generally tetrachromatic. The sensitivity of fish UVS opsins vary from 347-383 nm, and LWS opsins from 500-570 nm. However, some fish that use alternative chromophores can extend their LWS opsin sensitivity to 625 nm. The popular belief that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light is incorrect, because goldfish cannot see infrared light.

===Invertebrates===
The visual systems of invertebrates deviate greatly from vertebrates, so direct comparisons are difficult. However, UV sensitivity has been reported in most insect species.
Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them find nectar in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Bees&#x27; long-wave limit is at about 590 nm. Mantis shrimp exhibit up to 14 opsins, enabling a visible range of less than 300 nm to above 700 nm.

===Thermal vision===

Some snakes can &quot;see&quot; radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes, and other snakes with the organ may detect warm bodies from a meter away. It may also be used in thermoregulation and predator detection.

==Spectroscopy==

Spectroscopy is the study of objects based on the spectrum of color they emit, absorb or reflect. Visible-light spectroscopy is an important tool in astronomy (as is spectroscopy at other wavelengths), where scientists use it to analyze the properties of distant objects. Chemical elements and small molecules can be detected in astronomical objects by observing emission lines and absorption lines. For example, helium was first detected by analysis of the spectrum of the Sun. The shift in frequency of spectral lines is used to measure the Doppler shift (redshift or blueshift) of distant objects to determine their velocities towards or away from the observer. Astronomical spectroscopy uses high-dispersion diffraction gratings to observe spectra at very high spectral resolutions.

<text>An optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) is an optoelectronic instrument used to characterize an optical fiber. 
It is the optical equivalent of an electronic time domain reflectometer which measures the impedance of the cable or transmission line under test. 
An OTDR injects a series of optical pulses into the fiber under test and extracts, from the same end of the fiber, light that is scattered (Rayleigh backscatter) or reflected back from points along the fiber. The scattered or reflected light that is gathered back is used to characterize the optical fiber. The strength of the return pulses is measured and integrated as a function of time, and plotted as a function of length of the fiber.

==Reliability and quality of OTDR equipment==

The reliability and quality of an OTDR is based on its accuracy, measurement range, ability to resolve and measure closely spaced events, measurement speed, and ability to perform satisfactorily under various environmental extremes and after various types of physical abuse. The instrument is also judged on the basis of its cost, features provided, size, weight, and ease of use.

Some of the terms often used in specifying the quality of an OTDR are as follows:
:Accuracy: Defined as the correctness of the measurement i.e., the difference between the measured value and the true value of the event being measured.

:Measurement range: Defined as the maximum attenuation that can be placed between the instrument and the event being measured, for which the instrument will still be able to measure the event within acceptable accuracy limits.

:Instrument resolution: Is a measure of how close two events can be spaced and still be recognized as two separate events. The duration of the measurement pulse and the data sampling interval create a resolution limitation for OTDRs. The shorter the pulse duration and the shorter the data sampling interval, the better the instrument resolution, but the shorter the measurement range. Resolution is also often limited when powerful reflections return to the OTDR and temporarily overload the detector. When this occurs, some time is required before the instrument can resolve a second fiber event. Some OTDR manufacturers use a “masking” procedure to improve resolution. The procedure shields or “masks” the detector from high-power fiber reflections, preventing detector overload and eliminating the need for detector recovery.

Industry requirements for the reliability and quality of OTDRs are specified in the Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment.

==Types of OTDR-like test equipment==

The common types of OTDR-like test equipment are:
# Full-feature OTDR: 
#:Full-feature OTDRs are traditional, optical time domain reflectometers. They are feature-rich and usually larger, heavier, and less portable than either the hand-held OTDR or the fiber break locator. Despite being characterized as large, their size and weight is only a fraction of that of early generation OTDRs. Often a full-feature OTDR has a main frame that can be fitted with multi-function plug-in units to perform many fiber measurement tasks. Larger color displays are common. The full-feature OTDR often has a greater measurement range than the other types of OTDR-like equipment. Often it is used in laboratories and in the field for difficult fiber measurements. Most full-feature OTDRs are powered from AC and/or a battery.
# Hand-held OTDR and Fiber break locator: 
#:Hand-held (formerly mini) OTDRs and fiber break locators are designed to troubleshoot fiber networks in a field environment, often using battery power. The two types of instruments cover the spectrum of approaches to fiber optic plant taken by communication providers. Hand-held, inexpensive OTDRs are intended to be easy-to-use, light-weight, sophisticated OTDRs that collect field data and perform rudimentary data analysis. They may be less feature rich than full-feature OTDRs. Often they can be used in conjunction with PC-based software to perform data collection and sophisticated data analysis. Hand-held OTDRs are commonly used to measure fiber links and locate fiber breaks, points of high loss, high reflectance, end-to-end loss, and Optical Return Loss (ORL).
#:Fiber break locators are intended to be low-cost instruments specifically designed to determine the location of a catastrophic fiber event, e.g., fiber break, point of high reflectance, or high loss. The fiber break locator is an opto-electronic tape measure designed to measure only distance to catastrophic fiber events.
#:In general, hand-held OTDRs and fiber break locators are lighter and smaller, simpler to operate, and more likely to employ battery power than full-feature OTDRs. The intent with hand-held OTDRs and fiber break locators is to be inexpensive enough for field technicians to be equipped with one as part of a standard tool kit.
# RTU in RFTSs: 
#:The RTU is the testing module of the RFTS described in Generic Requirements for Remote Fiber Testing Systems (RFTSS). An RFTS enables fiber to be automatically tested from a central location. A central computer is used to control the operation of OTDR-like test components located at key points in the fiber network. The test components scan the fiber to locate problems. If a problem is found, its location is noted and the appropriate personnel are notified to begin the repair process. The RFTS can also provide direct access to a database that contains historical information of the OTDR fiber traces and any other fiber records for the physical fiber plant.
#:Since OTDRs and OTDR-like equipment have many uses in the communications industry, operating environments vary widely, both indoors and outdoors. Most often, however, these test sets are operated in controlled environments, accessing the fibers at their termination points on fiber distribution frames. Indoor environments include controlled areas such as central offices (COs), equipment huts, or Controlled Environment Vaults (CEVs). Use in outside environments is rarer, but may include use in a manhole, aerial platform, open trench, or splicing vehicle.

==OTDR data format==
In the late 1990s, OTDR industry representatives and the OTDR user community developed a unique data format to store and analyze OTDR fiber data. This data was based on the specifications in GR-196, Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment. The goal was for the data format to be truly universal, in that it was intended to be implemented by all OTDR manufacturers. OTDR suppliers developed the software to implement the data format. As they proceeded, they identified inconsistencies in the format, along with areas of misunderstanding among users.

From 1997 to 2000, a group of OTDR supplier software specialists attempted to resolve problems and inconsistencies in what was then called the “Bellcore” OTDR Data Format. This group, called the OTDR Data Format Users Group (ODFUG), made progress. Since then, many OTDR developers continued to work with other developers to solve individual interaction problems and enable cross use between manufacturers.
In 2011, Telcordia decided to compile industry comments on this data format into one document entitled Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Data Format. This Special Report (SR) summarizes the state of the Bellcore OTDR Data Format, renaming it as the Telcordia OTDR Data Format.
The data format is intended for all OTDR-related equipment designed to save trace data and analysis information. Initial implementations require standalone software to be provided by the OTDR supplier to convert existing OTDR trace files to the SR-4731 data format and to convert files from this universal format to a format that is usable by their older OTDRs. This file conversion software can be developed by the hardware supplier, the end user, or a third party. This software also provides backward compatibility of the OTDR data format with existing equipment.

The SR-4731 format describes binary data. While text information is contained in several fields, most numbers are represented as either 16-bit (2-byte) or 32-bit (4-byte) signed or unsigned integers stored as binary images. Byte ordering in this file format is explicitly low-byte ordering, as is common on Intel processor-based machines. String fields are terminated with a zero byte “\0”. OTDR waveform data are represented as short, unsigned integer data uniformly spaced in time, in units of decibels (dB) times 1000, referenced to the maximum power level. The maximum power level is set to zero, and all waveform data points are assumed to be zero or negative (the sign bit is implied), so that the minimum power level in this format is -65.535 dB, and the minimum resolution between power level steps is 0.001 dB. In some cases, this will not provide sufficient power range to represent all waveform points. For this reason, the use of a scale factor has been introduced to expand the data point power range.

<doc id="41472" wikidata="Q1562060" url="?curid=41472" title="Outside plant">
<text>In telecommunications, the term outside plant has the following meanings:

*In civilian telecommunications, outside plant refers to all of the physical cabling and supporting infrastructure (such as conduit, cabinets, tower or poles), and any associated hardware (such as repeaters) located between a demarcation point in a switching facility and a demarcation point in another switching center or customer premises.
*In the United States, the DOD defines outside plant as the communications equipment located between a main distribution frame (MDF) and a user end instrument.

The CATV industry divides its fixed assets between head end or inside plant, and outside plant. The electrical power industry also uses the term outside plant to refer to electric power distribution systems.

==Context==
Network connections between devices such as computers, printers, and phones require a physical infrastructure to carry and process signals. Typically, this infrastructure will consist of:
* Cables from wall outlets and jacks run to a communications closets, sometimes referred to as station cable.
* Cables connecting one communications closet to another, sometimes referred to as riser cable.
* Racks containing telecommunications hardware, such as switches, routers, and repeaters.
* Cables connecting one building to another.
* Exterior communications cabinets containing hardware outside of buildings.
* Radio transceivers used inside or outside buildings, such as wireless access points, and hardware associated with them, such as antennas and towers.

The portion of this infrastructure contained within a building is the inside plant, and the portion of this infrastructure connecting buildings or facilities is the outside plant. Where these two plants meet in a given structure is the demarcation point.

Outside plant cabling, whether copper or fiber, is generally installed as aerial cable between poles, in an underground conduit system, or by direct burial.
Hardware associated with the outside plant must be either protected from the elements (for example, distribution frames are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the outside plant elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults. In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While this is not a modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older cabling with sealed cabling is often prohibitively expensive. The cabling used in the outside plant must also be protected from electrical disturbances caused by lightning or voltage surges due to electrical shorts or induction.

==Example: copper access network==
In civilian telecommunications, the copper access network (also known as the local loop) providing basic telephone or DSL services typically consists of the following elements:
*In-house wiring that connects customer premises equipment to the demarcation point, usually in residential installations contained in a weather protected box.
*One or more twisted pairs, called a drop wire. The drop wires typically connect to a splice case, located in line for aerial cables, or in a small weather protected case for underground wiring, where the local cabling is connected to a secondary feeder line. These cables contain fifty or more twisted pairs.
*Secondary feeder lines run to a streetside cabinet containing a distribution frame called a Serving Area Interface (SAI).
*The SAI is connected to the main distribution frame, located at a Telephone exchange or other switching facility, by one or more primary feeder lines which contain hundreds of copper twisted pairs. An SAI may also contain a Digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) supporting DSL service.

Active equipment (such as a POTS or DSL line circuit) can then be connected to the line in order to provide service, but this is not considered part of outside plant.

==Protecting equipment in the outside plant==

The environment can play a large role in the quality and lifespan of equipment used in the outside plant. It is critical that environmental testing criteria as well as design and performance requirements be defined for this type of equipment.

There are generally four operating environments or classes covering all outside plant (OSP) applications, including wireless facilities.
:*Class 1: Equipment in a Controlled Environment
:*Class 2: Protected Equipment in Outside Environments
:*Class 3: Protected Equipment in Severe Outside Environments
:*Class 4: Products in an Unprotected Environment

Electronic equipment located in one or more of these environmental class locations is designed to withstand various environmental operating conditions resulting from climatic conditions that may include rain, snow, sleet, high winds, ice, salt spray, and sand storms. Since outside temperatures can possibly range from −40 °C (−40 °F) to 46 °C (115 °F), with varying degrees of solar loading, along with humidity levels ranging from below 10% up to 100%, significant environmental stresses within the enclosure or facility can be produced.

Telcordia GR-3108, Generic Requirements for Network Equipment in the Outside Plant (OSP), contains the most recent industry data regarding each Class described above. It also discusses what is currently happening in ATIS and Underwriters Laboratories (UL).

The document also includes 
:*Environmental criteria such as operating temperatures, humidity, particulate contamination, pollution exposure, and heat dissipation
:*Mechanical criteria such as structural requirements, packaging, susceptibility to vibration, earthquake, and handling
:*Electrical protection and safety including protection from lightning surges, AC power induction and faults, and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and DC power influences

===Handholes and other below-ground splice vaults===

Handholes and other below-ground splice vaults house telecommunications components used in an Outside Plant (OSP) environment.

Handholes are plastic or polymer concrete structures set below ground with their lids flush to the surrounding soil, turf, footpath, or road surface. They can be used to house and protect copper, coaxial, and optical fiber telephone cable splices and distribution elements. They safeguard and provide convenient access to cable termination and branch points, provide flexibility and access for installation operations (e.g., pulling or blowing cables), provide mechanical and environmental protection for splices, allow access for craftsperson work activities, and discourage access by unauthorized persons.

Handholes and other below-ground splice vaults are deployed in a variety of environments. The major distinctions in these environments focus on the strength and frequency of vehicular and foot traffic loading. There are four basic application environments:

:*Light Duty: Pedestrian Only 
:*Medium Duty: Pedestrian and Light Incidental Vehicular Traffic (Up to Class 5 Vehicles)
:*Heavy Duty: Non-Deliberate (Incidental) Vehicular Traffic (Up to Class 7 Vehicles)
:*Heavy Duty: Non-Deliberate (Incidental) Vehicular Traffic (Up to Class 8 Vehicles)

Handhole-type products deployed in any environment are subjected to the following types of traffic loading: Vertical Cover Load, Vertical Sidewall Load, Lateral Sidewall Load, and Long-Term Lateral Sidewall Load.

Telcordia GR-902, &quot;Generic Requirements for Handholes and Other Below-Ground Splice Vaults,&quot; contains detailed industry requirements for handholes, and includes specific loading requirements for the defined application environments. It provides explicit correlations to other standards such as ANSI/SCTE-77, AASHTO specifications, and ASTM C857.

===Corrosion resistance===
Corrosion in outside plant telecommunications network components is caused by exposure to the effects of temperature, humidity, electrical power, and contaminants. Corrosion resistance criteria for these network components are based on the environments to which they are exposed.

Outside plant environments can be above-ground, underground, buried, or underwater. Industry requirements document Telcordia GR-2836 defines these environments and provides corrosion resistance criteria for the telecommunications equipment in each. It also includes references to various associated ASTM Standards.

====Above-ground plant====
Above-ground plant includes all the telecommunications equipment physically located on or above the ground. This includes enclosures such as huts, cabinets, and pedestals, and the equipment mounted therein. It also includes pole-mounted equipment and cases, and pole-line hardware.

Above-ground plant can be exposed to extreme temperatures, and to humidity that varies with the seasons and with daily temperature changes. When humidity condenses on the surfaces of outdoor apparatus or equipment, the corrosivity of the moisture layer can be increased by industrial pollutants that render the condensate moisture corrosive. In sea coastal areas, wind-borne, salt-laden water droplets can deposit on exposed components.

Near large cultivated areas, where fertilizers are applied by airplanes, the wind may carry nitrates, phosphates, and ammonium compounds to settle on metallic components of the above-ground telephone plant. Similarly, in residential areas, lawn fertilizers and herbicides can cause corrosion. In regions with snow, the salts used to melt snow and ice on roadways can accelerate corrosion. Under extreme conditions, pedestals and cabinets may be flooded with water that contains mud and corrosive salts. Corrosion of these flooded components may be accelerated by the presence of dc voltages used to power the networks. Secretions from insects can also accelerate corrosion. Finally, chewing by rodents may expose metallic components, normally protected by a polymer or paint coating, to a corrosive environment.

====Underground plant====
Underground plant includes all the telecommunications equipment installed in underground structures such as utility holes, Controlled Environment Vaults (CEVs), and ducts, along with associated hardware. Underground plant can be exposed to waters containing water-soluble salts of the native soil. Utility holes often show evidence of corrosion of support hardware and bonding ribbons that is caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria. The environment in utility holes and ducts can be made corrosive by man-made chemicals such as industrial effluent, fertilizers, and de-icing salts. Protective plastic coatings and cable jackets can rapidly deteriorate from leaking steam pipes present in many urban areas and from gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks.

The most aggressive contributor to corrosion of underground plant is dc stray current from electrified rail transportation systems, cathodic protection rectifiers, or welding and mining operations. Although such dc currents are mostly dealt with “after the fact” using protective systems (e.g., low resistance bonds, reverse current switches, cathodic protection), some of the protection has to be included at the manufacturing stage. This protection may include insulating covers on cable shields, or nonmetallic components or coatings for apparatus.

====Buried plant====
Buried plant consists of telecommunications equipment such as cables, splice closures, lower parts of pedestals, and grounding systems directly buried in the soil. Buried plant can be exposed to the same corrosive environment as underground plant. In addition, attack by gophers can expose underlying components to corrosion attack.

====Underwater plant====
Underwater plant includes all telecommunications equipment located beneath the surface of a body of water. This includes cables and repeaters. The water can range from relatively pure, to brackish, to badly contaminated with industrial effluent.

<doc id="41473" wikidata="Q7113225" url="?curid=41473" title="Ovality">
<text>In telecommunications and fiber optics, ovality or noncircularity is the degree of deviation from perfect circularity of the cross section of the core or cladding of the fiber.

The cross-sections of the core and cladding are assumed to a first approximation to be elliptical, and ovality is defined to be twice the third flattening of the ellipse, formula_1, where &quot;a&quot; is the length of the major axis and &quot;b&quot; is the length of the minor axis. This dimensionless quantity is between and , and may be multiplied by to express ovality as a percentage. Alternatively, ovality of the core or cladding may be specified by a tolerance field consisting of two concentric circles, within which the cross section boundaries must lie.

In measurements, ovality is the amount of out-of-roundness of a hole or cylindrical part in the typical form of an oval.

==In chemistry==
In computational chemistry, especially in QSAR studies, ovality refers to, a measure of how the shape of a molecule approaches a sphere (at one extreme) or a cigar shape (at the other). 
Ovality is described by a ratio of volume to area:

formula_2

where:

:O = Ovality
:A = Area
:V = Volume

The ovality of the He atom is 1.0 and that of HC24H (12 triple bonds) is ~1.7.

<text>In telecommunications, overfill is the condition that prevails when the numerical aperture or the beam diameter of an optical source, such as a laser, light-emitting diode, or optical fiber, exceeds that of the driven element, e.g. an optical fiber core. In optical communications testing, overfill in both numerical aperture and mean diameter (core diameter or spot size) is usually required.
In polygonal mirror scanners, an overfilled type is one which uses each mirror facet at least in one dimension completely.

<text>Overmodulation is the condition that prevails in telecommunication when the instantaneous level of the modulating signal exceeds the value necessary to produce 100% modulation of the carrier. In the sense of this definition, it is almost always considered a fault condition. In layman&#x27;s terms, the signal is going &quot;off the scale&quot;. Overmodulation results in spurious emissions by the modulated carrier, and distortion of the recovered modulating signal. This means that the envelope of the output waveform is distorted. 

Although overmodulation is sometimes considered permissible, it should not occur in practice; a distorted waveform envelope will result in a distorted output signal of the receiving medium.

<text>An overtone is any resonant frequency above the fundamental frequency of a sound. (An overtone may or may not be a harmonic) In other words, overtones are all pitches higher than the lowest pitch within an individual sound; the fundamental is the lowest pitch. While the fundamental is usually heard most prominently, overtones are actually present in any pitch except a true sine wave. The relative volume or amplitude of various overtone partials is one of the key identifying features of timbre, or the individual characteristic of a sound.

Using the model of Fourier analysis, the fundamental and the overtones together are called partials. Harmonics, or more precisely, harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are numerical integer multiples of the fundamental (including the fundamental, which is 1 times itself). These overlapping terms are variously used when discussing the acoustic behavior of musical instruments. (See etymology below.) The model of Fourier analysis provides for the inclusion of inharmonic partials, which are partials whose frequencies are not whole-number ratios of the fundamental (such as 1.1 or 2.14179).


When a resonant system such as a blown pipe or plucked string is excited, a number of overtones may be produced along with the fundamental tone. In simple cases, such as for most musical instruments, the frequencies of these tones are the same as (or close to) the harmonics. Examples of exceptions include the circular drum – a timpano whose first overtone is about 1.6 times its fundamental resonance frequency, gongs and cymbals, and brass instruments. The human vocal tract is able to produce highly variable amplitudes of the overtones, called formants, which define different vowels.

== Explanation ==
Most oscillators, from a plucked guitar string to a flute that is blown, will naturally vibrate at a series of distinct frequencies known as normal modes. The lowest normal mode frequency is known as the fundamental frequency, while the higher frequencies are called overtones. Often, when an oscillator is excited — for example, by plucking a guitar string — it will oscillate at several of its modal frequencies at the same time. So when a note is played, this gives the sensation of hearing other frequencies (overtones) above the lowest frequency (the fundamental).

Timbre is the quality that gives the listener the ability to distinguish between the sound of different instruments. The timbre of an instrument is determined by which overtones it emphasizes. That is to say, the relative volumes of these overtones to each other determines the specific &quot;flavor&quot;, &quot;color&quot; or &quot;tone&quot; of sound of that family of instruments. The intensity of each of these overtones is rarely constant for the duration of a note. Over time, different overtones may decay at different rates, causing the relative intensity of each overtone to rise or fall independent of the overall volume of the sound. A carefully trained ear can hear these changes even in a single note. This is why the timbre of a note may be perceived differently when played staccato or legato.

A driven non-linear oscillator, such as the vocal folds, a blown wind instrument, or a bowed violin string (but not a struck guitar string or bell) will oscillate in a periodic, non-sinusoidal manner. This generates the impression of sound at integer multiple frequencies of the fundamental known as harmonics, or more precisely, harmonic partials. For most string instruments and other long and thin instruments such as a bassoon, the first few overtones are quite close to integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, producing an approximation to a harmonic series. Thus, in music, overtones are often called harmonics. Depending upon how the string is plucked or bowed, different overtones can be emphasized.

However, some overtones in some instruments may not be of a close integer multiplication of the fundamental frequency, thus causing a small dissonance. &quot;High quality&quot; instruments are usually built in such a manner that their individual notes do not create disharmonious overtones. In fact, the flared end of a brass instrument is not to make the instrument sound louder, but to correct for tube length “end effects” that would otherwise make the overtones significantly different from integer harmonics. This is illustrated by the following:

Consider a guitar string. Its idealized 1st overtone would be exactly twice its fundamental if its length were shortened by ½, perhaps by lightly pressing a guitar string at the 12th fret; however, if a vibrating string is examined, it will be seen that the string does not vibrate flush to the bridge and nut, but it instead has a small “dead length” of string at each end. This dead length actually varies from string to string, being more pronounced with thicker and/or stiffer strings. This means that halving the physical string length does not halve the actual string vibration length, and, hence, the overtones will not be exact multiples of a fundamental frequency. The effect is so pronounced that properly set up guitars will angle the bridge such that the thinner strings will progressively have a length up to few millimeters shorter than the thicker strings. Not doing so would result in inharmonious chords made up of two or more strings. Similar considerations apply to tube instruments.

== Musical usage term ==

An overtone is a partial (a &quot;partial wave&quot; or &quot;constituent frequency&quot;) that can be either a harmonic partial (a harmonic) other than the fundamental, or an inharmonic partial. A harmonic frequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. An inharmonic frequency is a non-integer multiple of a fundamental frequency.

An example of harmonic overtones: (absolute harmony)

Some musical instruments produce overtones that are slightly sharper or flatter than true harmonics. The sharpness or flatness of their overtones is one of the elements that contributes to their sound. Due to phase inconsistencies between the fundamental and the partial harmonic, this also has the effect of making their waveforms not perfectly periodic.

Musical instruments that can create notes of any desired duration and definite pitch have harmonic partials.
A tuning fork, provided it is sounded with a mallet (or equivalent) that is reasonably soft, has a tone that consists very nearly of the fundamental, alone; it has a sinusoidal waveform. Nevertheless, music consisting of pure sinusoids was found to be unsatisfactory in the early 20th century.

== Etymology ==
In Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s classic &quot;On The Sensations Of Tone&quot; he used the German &quot;Obertöne&quot; which was a contraction of &quot;Oberpartialtöne&quot;, or in English: &quot;upper partial tones&quot;. According to Alexander Ellis (in pages 24–25 of his English translation of Helmholtz), the similarity of German &quot;ober&quot; to English &quot;over&quot; caused a Prof. Tyndall to mistranslate Helmholtz&#x27; term, thus creating &quot;overtone&quot;. Ellis disparages the term &quot;overtone&quot; for its awkward implications. Because &quot;overtone&quot; makes the upper partials seem like such a distinct phenomena, it leads to the mathematical problem where the first overtone is the second partial. Also, unlike discussion of &quot;partials&quot;, the word &quot;overtone&quot; has connotations that have led people to wonder about the presence of &quot;undertones&quot; (a term sometimes confused with &quot;difference tones&quot; but also used in speculation about a hypothetical &quot;undertone series&quot;).

===&quot;Overtones&quot; in choral music===
In barbershop music, a style of four-part singing, the word &quot;overtone&quot; is often used in a related but particular manner. It refers to a psychoacoustic effect in which a listener hears an audible pitch that is higher than, and different from, the fundamentals of the four pitches being sung by the quartet. The barbershop singer&#x27;s &quot;overtone&quot; is created by the interactions of the upper partial tones in each singer&#x27;s note (and by sum and difference frequencies created by nonlinear interactions within the ear). Similar effects can be found in other &quot;a cappella&quot; polyphonic music such as the music of the Republic of Georgia and the Sardinian &quot;cantu a tenore&quot;. Overtones are naturally highlighted when singing in a particularly resonant space, such as a church; one theory of the development of polyphony in Europe holds that singers of Gregorian chant, originally monophonic, began to hear the overtones of their monophonic song and to imitate these pitches - with the fifth, octave, and major third being the loudest vocal overtones, it is one explanation of the development of the triad and the idea of consonance in music.

The first step in composing choral music with overtone singing is to discover what the singers can be expected to do successfully without extensive practice. The second step is to find a musical context in which those techniques could be effective, not mere special effects. It was initially hypothesized that beginners would be able to:

*glissando through the partials of a given fundamental, ascending or descending, fast, or slow
*use vowels/text for relative pitch gestures on indeterminate partials specifying the given shape without specifying particular partials
*improvise on partials of the given fundamental, &quot;ad lib.&quot;, freely, or in giving style or manner
*find and sustain a particular partial (requires interval recognition)
*by extension, move to an adjacent partial, above or below, and alternate between the two

Singers should not be asked to change the fundamental pitch while overtone singing and changing partials should always be to an adjacent partial. When a particular partial is to be specified, time should be allowed (a beat or so) for the singers to get the harmonics to &quot;speak&quot; and find the correct one.

===String instruments===
String instruments can also produce multiphonic tones when strings are divided in two pieces or the sound is somehow distorted. The sitar has sympathetic strings which help to bring out the overtones while one is playing. The overtones are also highly important in the tanpura, the drone instrument in traditional North and South Indian music, in which loose strings tuned at octaves and fifths are plucked and designed to buzz to create sympathetic resonance and highlight the cascading sound of the overtones.

Western string instruments, such as the violin, may be played close to the bridge (a technique called &quot;sul ponticello&quot; or &quot;am Steg&quot;) which causes the note to split into overtones while attaining a distinctive glassy, metallic sound. Various techniques of bow pressure may also be used to bring out the overtones, as well as using string nodes to produce natural harmonics. On violin family instruments, overtones can be played with the bow or by plucking. Scores and parts for Western violin family instruments indicate where the performer is to play harmonics. The most well-known technique on a guitar is playing flageolet tones or using distortion effects. The ancient Chinese instrument the guqin contains a scale based on the knotted positions of overtones. The Vietnamese đàn bầu functions on flageolet tones. Other multiphonic extended techniques used are prepared piano, prepared guitar and 3rd bridge.

===Wind instruments===
Wind instruments manipulate the overtone series significantly in the normal production of sound, but various playing techniques may be used to produce multiphonics which bring out the overtones of the instrument. On many woodwind instruments, alternate fingerings are used. &quot;Overblowing&quot;, or adding intensely exaggerated air pressure, can also cause notes to split into their overtones. In brass instruments, multiphonics may be produced by singing into the instrument while playing a note at the same time, causing the two pitches to interact - if the sung pitch is at specific harmonic intervals with the played pitch, the two sounds will blend and produce additional notes by the phenomenon of sum and difference tones.

Non-western wind instruments also exploit overtones in playing, and some may highlight the overtone sound exceptionally. Instruments like the didgeridoo are highly dependent on the interaction and manipulation of overtones achieved by the performer changing their mouth shape while playing, or singing and playing simultaneously. Likewise, when playing a harmonica or pitch pipe, one may alter the shape of their mouth to amplify specific overtones. Though not a wind instrument, a similar technique is used for playing the jaw harp: the performer amplifies the instrument&#x27;s overtones by changing the shape, and therefore the resonance, of their vocal tract.

===Brass Instruments===

Brass instruments originally had no valves, and could only play the notes in the natural overtone, or harmonic series.

Brass instruments still rely heavily on the overtone series to produce notes: the tuba typically has 3-4 valves, the tenor trombone has 7 slide positions, the trumpet has 3 valves, and the French horn typically has 4 valves. Each instrument can play (within their respective ranges) the notes of the overtone series in different keys with each fingering combination (open, 1, 2, 12, 123, etc). The role of each valve or rotor (excluding trombone) is as follows: 1st valve lowers major 2nd, 2nd valve lowers minor 2nd, 3rd valve-lowers minor 3rd, 4th valve-lowers perfect 4th (found on piccolo trumpet, certain euphoniums, and many tubas). The French horn has a trigger key that opens other tubing and is pitched a perfect fourth higher; this allows for greater ease between different registers of the instrument. Valves allow brass instruments to play chromatic notes, as well as notes within the overtone series (open valve = C overtone series, 2nd valve = B overtone series on the C Trumpet) by changing air speed and lip vibrations.

The tuba, trombone, and trumpet play notes within the first few octaves of the overtone series, where the partials are farther apart. The French horn sounds notes in a higher octave of the overtone series, so the partials are closer together and make it more difficult to play the correct pitches and partials.

===Overtone singing===
Overtone singing is a traditional form of singing in many parts of the Himalayas and Altay; Tibetans, Mongols and Tuvans are known for their overtone singing. In these contexts it is often referred to as throat singing or khoomei, though it should not be confused with Inuit throat singing, which is produced by different means. There is also the possibility to create the overtone out of fundamental tones without any stress on the throat.

Also, the overtone is very important in singing to take care of vocal tract shaping, to improve color, resonance, and text declamation. During practice overtone singing, it helps the singer to remove unnecessary pressure on the muscle, especially around the throat. So if one can &quot;find&quot; a single overtone, then one will know where the sensation needs to be in order to bring out vocal resonance in general, helping to find the resonance in one&#x27;s own voice on any vowel and in any register.

== Overtones in music composition ==
The primacy of the triad in Western harmony comes from the first four partials of the overtone series. The eighth through fourteenth partials resemble the equal tempered acoustic scale:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4^\markup { Acoustic scale on C } d e fis g a bes c
&lt;/score&gt;

When this scale is rendered as a chord, it is called the lydian dominant thirteenth chord. This chord appears throughout Western music, but is notably used as the basis of jazz harmony, features prominently in the music of Franz Liszt, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and appears as the Mystic chord in the music of Alexander Scriabin.

Because the overtone series rises infinitely from the fundamental with no periodicity, in Western music the equal temperament scale was designed to create synchronicity between different octaves. This was achieved by de-tuning certain intervals, such as the perfect fifth. A true perfect fifth is 702 cents above the fundamental, but equal temperament flattens it by two cents. The difference is only barely perceptible, and allows both for the illusion of the scale being in-tune with itself across multiple octaves, and for tonalities based on all 12 chromatic notes to sound in-tune.

Western classical composers have also made use of the overtone series through orchestration. In his treatise &quot;Principles of Orchestration,&quot; Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov says the overtone series &quot;may serve as a guide to the orchestral arrangement of chords&quot;. Rimsky-Korsakov then demonstrates how to voice a C major triad according to the overtone series, using partials 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16.

In the 20th century, exposure to non-Western music and further scientific acoustical discoveries led some Western composers to explore alternate tuning systems. Harry Partch for example designed a tuning system that divides the octave into 43 tones, with each tone based on the overtone series. The music of Ben Johnston uses many different tuning systems, including his String Quartet No. 5 which divides the octave into more than 100 tones.

Spectral music is a genre developed by Gérard Grisey and Tristan Murail in the 1970s and 80s, under the auspices of IRCAM. Broadly, spectral music deals with resonance and acoustics as compositional elements. For example, in Grisey&#x27;s seminal work &quot;Partiels&quot;, the composer used a sonogram to analyze the true sonic characteristics of the lowest note on a tenor trombone (E2). The analysis revealed which overtones were most prominent from that sound, and &quot;Partiels&quot; was then composed around the analysis. Another seminal spectral work is Tristan Murail&#x27;s &quot;Gondwana&quot; for orchestra. This work begins with a spectral analysis of a bell, and gradually transforms it into the spectral analysis of a brass instrument. Other spectralists and post-spectralists include Jonathan Harvey, Kaija Saariaho, and Georg Friedrich Haas.

John Luther Adams is known for his extensive use of the overtone series, as well as his tendency to allow musicians to make their own groupings and play at their own pace to alter the sonic experience. For example, his piece &quot;Sila: The Breath of the World&quot; can be played by 16 to 80 musicians and are separated into their own groups. The piece is set on sixteen &quot;harmonic clouds&quot; that are grounded on the first sixteen overtones of low B-flat. Another example is John Luther Adam&#x27;s piece &quot;Everything That Rises&quot;, which grew out of his piece &quot;Sila: The Breath of the World&quot;. &quot;Everything That Rises&quot; is a piece for string quartet that has sixteen harmonic clouds that are built off of the fundamental tone (C0)

<doc id="41482" wikidata="Q7125134" url="?curid=41482" title="Paired disparity code">
<text>In telecommunications, a paired disparity code is a line code in which at least one of the data characters is represented by two codewords of opposite that are used in sequence so as to minimize the total disparity of a longer sequence of digits.

A particular codeword of any line code can either have no disparity (the average weight of the codeword is zero), negative disparity (the average weight of the codeword is negative), or positive disparity (the average weight of the codeword is positive).

In a paired disparity code, every codeword that averages to a negative level (negative disparity) is paired with some other codeword that averages to a positive level (positive disparity).

In a system that uses a paired disparity code, the transmitter must keep track of the running DC buildup the running disparity and always pick the codeword that pushes the DC level back towards zero. The receiver is designed so that either codeword of the pair decodes to the same data bits.

Most line codes use either a paired disparity code or a constant-weight code.

The simplest paired disparity code is alternate mark inversion signal. Other paired disparity codes include 8b/10b, 8B12B, the modified AMI codes, coded mark inversion, and 4B3T.

The digits may be represented by disparate physical quantities, such as two different frequencies, phases, voltage levels, magnetic polarities, or electrical polarities, each one of the pair representing a 0 or a 1.

<text>Title 47 CFR Part 68 is a section of the Code of Federal Regulations of the United States that regulates the direct electrical connection of telecommunications equipment and customer premises wiring with the public switched telephone network, certain private line services, and connection of private branch exchange (PBX) equipment to certain telecommunication interfaces.

==Scope==
*The direct connection of telecommunications equipment and customer premises wiring with the public switched telephone network and certain private line services, such as
**foreign exchange lines at the customer premises end
**the station end of off-premises stations associated with PBX and Centrex services
**trunk-to-station tie lines at the trunk end only
**switched service network station lines, &quot;i.e.&quot;, common control switching arrangements
*The direct connection of
**all PBX and similar systems to private line services for tie trunk type interfaces,
**off-premises station lines, and (3) automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) and message registration. 

Part 68 rules provide the technical and procedural standards under which direct electrical connection of customer-provided telephone equipment, systems, and protective apparatus may be made to the nationwide network without causing harm and without a requirement for protective circuit arrangements in the service-provider networks.

The equivalent European regulation is called TBR21.

<doc id="41488" wikidata="Q254758" url="?curid=41488" title="Passband">
<text>A passband is the range of frequencies or wavelengths that can pass through a filter. For example, a radio receiver contains a bandpass filter to select the frequency of the desired radio signal out of all the radio waves picked up by its antenna. The passband of a receiver is the range of frequencies it can receive when it is tuned into the desired frequency (channel).

A bandpass-filtered signal (that is, a signal with energy only in a passband), is known as a bandpass signal, in contrast to a baseband signal. The bandpass filter usually has two band-stop filters.

== Filters ==


In telecommunications, optics, and acoustics, a passband (a band-pass filtered signal) is the portion of the frequency spectrum that is transmitted (with minimum relative loss or maximum relative gain) by some filtering device. In other words, it is a &quot;band&quot; of frequencies which &quot;pass&quot;es through some filter or a set of filters.
The accompanying figure shows a schematic of a waveform being filtered by a bandpass filter consisting of a highpass and a lowpass filter.

Radio receivers generally include a tunable band-pass filter with a passband that is wide enough to accommodate the bandwidth of the radio signal transmitted by a single station.

== Digital transmission ==
There are two main categories of digital communication transmission methods: baseband and passband.

* In baseband transmission, line coding is utilized, resulting in a pulse train or digital pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) signal. This is typically used over non-filtered wires such as fiber optical cables and short-range copper links, for example: V.29 (EIA/TIA-232), V.35, IEEE 802.3, SONET/SDH.
* In passband transmission, digital modulation methods are employed so that only a limited frequency range is used in some bandpass filtered channel. Passband transmission is typically utilized in wireless communication and in bandpass filtered channels such as POTS lines. It also allows for frequency-division multiplexing. The digital bitstream is converted first into an equivalent baseband signal, and then to a RF signal. On the receiver side a demodulator is used to detect the signal and reverse the modulation process. A combined equipment for modulation and demodulation is called a modem.

== Details ==

In general, there is an inverse relationship between the width of a filter&#x27;s passband and the time required for the filter to respond to new inputs. Broad passbands yield faster response times. This is a consequence of the mathematics of Fourier analysis.

The limiting frequencies of a passband are defined as those at which the relative intensity or power decreases to a specified fraction of the maximum intensity or power. This decrease in power is often specified to be the half-power points, &quot;i.e.&quot;, 3 dB below the maximum power.

The difference between the limiting frequencies is called the bandwidth, and is expressed in hertz (in the optical regime, in nanometers or micrometers of differential wavelength).

The related term &quot;bandpass&quot; is an adjective that describes a type of filter or filtering process; it is frequently confused with &quot;passband&quot;, which refers to the actual portion of affected spectrum. These two words are both compound words that follow the English rules of formation: the primary meaning is the latter part of the compound, while the modifier is the first part. Hence, one may correctly say &#x27;A dual bandpass filter has two passbands&#x27;.

<text>Path loss, or path attenuation, is the reduction in power density (attenuation) of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space. Path loss is a major component in the analysis and design of the link budget of a telecommunication system.

This term is commonly used in wireless communications and signal propagation. Path loss may be due to many effects, such as free-space loss, refraction, diffraction, reflection, aperture-medium coupling loss, and absorption. Path loss is also influenced by terrain contours, environment (urban or rural, vegetation and foliage), propagation medium (dry or moist air), the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and the height and location of antennas.

== Overview ==
In wireless communications, path loss is the reduction in signal strength as the signal travels from a transmitter to a receiver, and is an application for verifying the loss. There are several factors that affect this:

*Free-space path loss: This is the fundamental loss that occurs due to the spreading of the radio wave as it propagates through space. It follows an inverse square law, meaning the signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of the distance between the transmitter and receiver.

* Diffraction: When a radio wave encounters an obstacle, it can be diffracted, or bent around the edge of the obstacle. This can cause additional signal loss, especially in urban environments with many buildings. 

*Absorption: Certain atmospheric gases and obstacles like buildings and foliage can absorb radio waves, reducing their strength.

* Reflection and scattering: Radio waves can be reflected off surfaces like buildings and the ground, and scattered by objects like trees and lampposts. This can lead to multipath propagation, where the receiver receives multiple copies of the signal that may interfere with each other. 

In understanding path loss and minimizing it, there are four key factors to consider in designing a wireless communication system:

1) Determining the required transmitter power: The transmitter must have enough power to overcome the path loss in order for the signal to reach the receiver with sufficient strength.

2) Determine the appropriate antenna design and gain: Antennas with higher gain can focus the waves in a specific direction, reducing the path loss.

3) Optimize modulation scheme: The choice of modulation scheme can affect the robustness of the signal to path loss.

4) Set the receiver sensitivity appropriately: The receiver must be sensitive enough to detect weak signals.

==Causes==

Path loss normally includes &quot;propagation losses&quot; caused by the natural expansion of the radio wave front in free space (which usually takes the shape of an ever-increasing sphere), &quot;absorption losses&quot; (sometimes called penetration losses), when the signal passes through media not transparent to electromagnetic waves, &quot;diffraction losses&quot; when part of the radiowave front is obstructed by an opaque obstacle, and losses caused by other phenomena.

The signal radiated by a transmitter may also travel along many and different paths to a receiver simultaneously; this effect is called multipath. Multipath waves combine at the receiver antenna, resulting in a received signal that may vary widely, depending on the distribution of the intensity and relative propagation time of the waves and bandwidth of the transmitted signal. The total power of interfering waves in a Rayleigh fading scenario varies quickly as a function of space (which is known as &quot;small scale fading&quot;). Small-scale fading refers to the rapid changes in radio signal amplitude in a short period of time or distance of travel.

==Loss exponent==
In the study of wireless communications, path loss can be represented by the path loss exponent, whose value is normally in the range of 2 to 4 (where 2 is for propagation in free space, 4 is for relatively lossy environments and for the case of full specular reflection from the earth surface—the so-called flat earth model). In some environments, such as buildings, stadiums and other indoor environments, the path loss exponent can reach values in the range of 4 to 6. On the other hand, a tunnel may act as a waveguide, resulting in a path loss exponent less than 2.

Path loss is usually expressed in dB. In its simplest form, the path loss can be calculated using the formula

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the path loss in decibels, formula_3 is the path loss exponent, formula_4 is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, usually measured in meters, and formula_5 is a constant which accounts for system losses.

==Radio engineer formula==
Radio and antenna engineers use the following simplified formula (derived from the Friis Transmission Formula) for the signal path loss between the feed points of two isotropic antennas in free space:

Path loss in dB: 
:formula_6

where formula_2 is the path loss in decibels, formula_8 is the wavelength and formula_4 is the transmitter-receiver distance in the same units as the wavelength. Note the power density in space has no dependency on formula_8; The variable formula_8 exists in the formula to account for the effective capture area of the isotropic receiving antenna.

==Prediction==

Calculation of the path loss is usually called &quot;prediction&quot;. Exact prediction is possible only for simpler cases, such as the above-mentioned &quot;free space&quot; propagation or the &quot;flat-earth model&quot;. For practical cases the path loss is calculated using a variety of approximations.

&quot;Statistical&quot; methods (also called &quot;stochastic&quot; or &quot;empirical&quot;) are based on measured and averaged losses along typical classes of radio links. Among the most commonly used such methods are Okumura–Hata, the COST Hata model, W.C.Y.Lee, etc. These are also known as &quot;radio wave propagation models&quot; and are typically used in the design of cellular networks and public land mobile networks (PLMN). For wireless communications in the very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) frequency band (the bands used by walkie-talkies, police, taxis and cellular phones), one of the most commonly used methods is that of Okumura–Hata as refined by the COST 231 project. Other well-known models are those of Walfisch–Ikegami, W. C. Y. Lee, and Erceg. For FM radio and TV broadcasting the path loss is most commonly predicted using the ITU model as described in P.1546 (successor to P.370) recommendation.

Deterministic methods based on the physical laws of wave propagation are also used; ray tracing is one such method. These methods are expected to produce more accurate and reliable predictions of the path loss than the empirical methods; however, they are significantly more expensive in computational effort and depend on the detailed and accurate description of all objects in the propagation space, such as buildings, roofs, windows, doors, and walls. For these reasons they are used predominantly for short propagation paths. Among the most commonly used methods in the design of radio equipment such as antennas and feeds is the finite-difference time-domain method.

The path loss in other frequency bands (medium wave (MW), shortwave (SW or HF), microwave (SHF)) is predicted with similar methods, though the concrete algorithms and formulas may be very different from those for VHF/UHF. Reliable prediction of the path loss in the SW/HF band is particularly difficult, and its accuracy is comparable to weather predictions.

Easy approximations for calculating the path loss over distances significantly shorter than the distance to the radio horizon:

* In free space the path loss increases with 20 dB per &quot;decade&quot; (one decade is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases ten times) or 6 dB per &quot;octave&quot; (one octave is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver doubles). This can be used as a very rough first-order approximation for (microwave) communication links;
* For signals in the UHF/VHF band propagating over the surface of the Earth the path loss increases with roughly 35–40 dB per decade (10–12 dB per octave). This can be used in cellular networks as a first guess.

==Examples==

In cellular networks, such as UMTS and GSM, which operate in the UHF band, the value of the path loss in built-up areas can reach 110–140 dB for the first kilometer of the link between the base transceiver station (BTS) and the mobile. The path loss for the first ten kilometers may be 150–190 dB (&quot;Note&quot;: These values are very approximate and are given here only as an illustration of the range in which the numbers used to express the path loss values &quot;can eventually be&quot;, these are not definitive or binding figures—the path loss may be very different for the same distance along two different paths and it can be different even along the same path if measured at different times.)

In the radio wave environment for mobile services the mobile antenna is close to the ground. Line-of-sight propagation (LOS) models are highly modified. The signal path from the BTS antenna normally elevated above the roof tops is refracted down into the local physical environment (hills, trees, houses) and the LOS signal seldom reaches the antenna. The environment will produce several deflections of the direct signal onto the antenna, where typically 2–5 deflected signal components will be vectorially added.

These refraction and deflection processes cause loss of signal strength, which changes when the mobile antenna moves (Rayleigh fading), causing instantaneous variations of up to 20 dB. The network is therefore designed to provide an excess of signal strength compared to LOS of 8–25 dB depending on the nature of the physical environment, and another 10 dB to overcome the fading due to movement.

<text>Payload is the object or the entity that is being carried by an aircraft or launch vehicle. Sometimes payload also refers to the carrying capacity of an aircraft or launch vehicle, usually measured in terms of weight. Depending on the nature of the flight or mission, the payload of a vehicle may include cargo, passengers, flight crew, munitions, scientific instruments or experiments, or other equipment. Extra fuel, when optionally carried, is also considered part of the payload.

In a commercial context (i.e., an airline or air freight carrier), payload may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers. A payload of ordnance carried by a combat aircraft is sometimes alternatively referred to as the aircraft&#x27;s warload.

For a rocket, the payload can be a satellite, space probe, or spacecraft carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a ballistic missile, the payload is one or more warheads and related systems; their total weight is referred to as the throw-weight.

The fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the &quot;payload fraction&quot;. When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the &quot;useful load fraction&quot;. In spacecraft, &quot;mass fraction&quot; is normally used, which is the ratio of payload to everything else, including the rocket structure.

==Relationship of range and payload==

There is a natural trade-off between the payload and the range of an aircraft. A payload range diagram (also known as the &quot;elbow chart&quot;) illustrates the trade-off.

The top horizontal line represents the maximum payload. It is limited structurally by maximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW) of the aircraft. Maximum payload is the difference between maximum zero-fuel weight and operational empty weight (OEW). Moving left-to-right along the line shows the constant maximum payload as the range increases. More fuel needs to be added for more range.

The vertical line represents the range at which the combined weight of the aircraft, maximum payload and needed fuel reaches the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of the aircraft. If the range is increased beyond that point, payload has to be sacrificed for fuel.

The maximum take-off weight is limited by a combination of the maximum net power of the engines and the lift/drag ratio of the wings. The diagonal line after the range-at-maximum-payload point shows how reducing the payload allows increasing the fuel (and range) when taking off with the maximum take-off weight.

The second kink in the curve represents the point at which the maximum fuel capacity is reached. Flying further than that point means that the payload has to be reduced further, for an even lesser increase in range. The absolute range is thus the range at which an aircraft can fly with maximum possible fuel without carrying any payload.

==Structural capacity==
For aircraft, the weight of fuel in wing tanks does not contribute as significantly to the bending moment of the wing as does weight in the fuselage. So even when the airplane has been loaded with its maximum payload that the wings can support, it can still carry a significant amount of fuel.

==Payload constraints==
Launch and transport system differ not only on the payload that can be carried but also in the stresses and other factors placed on the payload. The payload must not only be lifted to its target, it must also arrive safely, whether elsewhere on the surface of the Earth or a specific orbit. To ensure this the payload, such as a warhead or satellite, is designed to withstand certain amounts of various types of &quot;punishment&quot; on the way to its destination. Most rocket payloads are fitted within a payload fairing to protect them against dynamic pressure of high-velocity travel through the atmosphere, and to improve the overall aerodynamics of the launch vehicle. Most aircraft payloads are carried within the fuselage for similar reasons. Outsize cargo may require a fuselage with unusual proportions, such as the Super Guppy.

The various constraints placed on the launch system can be roughly categorized into those that cause physical damage to the payload and those that can damage its electronic or chemical makeup. Examples of physical damage include extreme accelerations over short time scales caused by atmospheric buffeting or oscillations, extreme accelerations over longer time scales caused by rocket thrust and gravity, and sudden changes in the magnitude or direction of the acceleration caused by how quick engines are throttled and shut down, etc. Electrical, chemical, or biological payloads can be damaged by extreme temperatures (hot or cold), rapid changes in temperature or pressure, contact with fast moving air streams causing ionization, and radiation exposure from cosmic rays, the van Allen belt, or solar wind.

<text>Pseudo bit error ratio (PBER) in adaptive high-frequency (HF) radio, is a bit error ratio derived by majority logic decoding to processes redundant transmissions. 

&quot;Note:&quot; In adaptive HF radio automatic link establishment, PBER is determined by the extent of error correction, such as by using the fraction of non-unanimous votes in the 2-of-3 majority decoder. </text><links>
