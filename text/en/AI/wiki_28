<text>Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) is an annual herbaceous plant widely grown as a cereal crop in the arid and semiarid areas in Africa and Asia. It is a tetraploid and self-pollinating species probably evolved from its wild relative &quot;Eleusine africana&quot;.

Finger millet is native to the Ethiopian and Ugandan highlands. Interesting crop characteristics of finger millet are the ability to withstand cultivation at altitudes over above sea level, its high drought tolerance, and the long storage time of the grains.

== History ==
Finger millet originated in East Africa (Ethiopian and Ugandan highlands). It was claimed to have been found in an Indian archaeological site dated to 1800 BCE (Late Bronze Age); however, this was subsequently demonstrated to be incorrectly identified cleaned grains of hulled millets. The oldest record of finger millet comes from an archaeological site in Africa dating to the 3rd millennium B.C.

By 1996, cultivation of finger millet in Africa was declining rapidly because of the large amount of labor it required, with farmers preferring to grow nutritionally-inferior but less labor-intensive crops such as maize, sorghum, and cassava. Such a decline was not seen in Asia, however.

== Taxonomy and botanical description ==
Finger millet is under the genus &quot;Eleusine&quot; Gaertn.

== Growing regions ==
Main cultivation areas are parts of eastern and southern Africaparticularly Uganda, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzaniaand parts of India and Nepal. It is also grown in southern Sudan and &quot;as far south&quot; in Africa as Mozambique.

== Climate requirements ==
Finger millet is a short-day plant with a growing optimum 12 hours of daylight for most varieties. Its main growing area ranges from 20°N to 20°S, meaning mainly the semiarid to arid tropics. Nevertheless, finger millet is found to be grown at 30°N in the Himalaya region (India and Nepal). It is generally considered as a drought-tolerant crop, but compared with other millets, such as pearl millet and sorghum, it prefers moderate rainfall ( annually). The majority of worldwide finger millet farmers grow it rainfed, although yields often can be significantly improved when irrigation is applied. In India, finger millet is a typical&quot; rabi&quot; (dry-winter season) crop. Heat tolerance of finger millet is high. For Ugandan finger millet varieties, for instance, the optimal average growth temperature ranges at about 27 °C, while the minimal temperatures should not be lower than 18 °C. Relative to other species (pearl millet and sorghum), finger millet has a higher tolerance to cool temperatures. It is grown from about above sea level (e.g. in Himalaya region). Hence, it can be cultivated on higher elevations than most tropical crops. Finger millet can grow on various soils, including highly weathered tropical lateritic soils. It thrives in free-draining soils with steady moisture levels. Furthermore, it can tolerate soil salinity up to a certain extent. Its ability to bear waterlogging is limited, so good drainage of the soils and moderate water-holding capacity are optimal. Finger millet can tolerate moderately acidic soils (pH 5), but also moderately alkaline soils (pH 8.2).

== Cropping systems ==
Finger millet monocrops grown under rainfed conditions are most common in drier areas of Eastern Africa. In addition, intercropping with legumes, such as cowpea or pigeon pea, are also quite common in East Africa. Tropical Central Africa supports scattered regions of finger millet intercropping mostly with legumes, but also with cassava, plantain, and vegetables.

Most common finger millet intercropping systems in South India are as follows:
*With legumes: Finger millet/dolichos, finger millet/pigeonpea, finger millet/black gram, finger millet/castor
*With cereals: Finger millet/maize, finger millet/foxtail millet, finger millet/jowar, finger millet/little millet
*With other species: Finger millet/brassicas, finger millet/mustard

== Weeds ==
Weeds are the major biotic stresses for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, which leads to a relatively slow development in early growing stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water, and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species &quot;Eleusine indica&quot; (common name Indian goose grass) is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides &quot;Eleusine indica&quot;, the species &quot;Xanthium strumarium,&quot; which is animal dispersed and the stolon-owning species &quot;Cyperus rotondus&quot; and &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical, and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and &quot;E. indica&quot; easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to disrupt the growing cycle of the weeds. Physical weed control in financial resource-limited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a hand hoe.

== Diseases and pests ==
Finger millet is generally seen as not very prone to diseases and pests. Nonetheless, finger millet blast, caused by the fungal pathogen &quot;Magnaporthe grisea&quot; (anamorph &quot;Pyricularia grisea&quot;), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck rots, and ear rots. These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates, and grain filling, so reduce yield and grain quality. Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related &quot;E. indica&quot;, &quot;E. africana&quot;, &quot;Digitaria &quot;spp., &quot;Setaria&quot; spp., and &quot;Doctylocterium spp&quot;. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments, and the use of resistant varieties. Researchers in Kenya have screened wild relatives of finger millet and landraces for resistance to blast. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with nonhost crops such as legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to uninfected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts, and avoiding of high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or seed dressings with fungicides, such as trycyclozole.

&quot;Striga,&quot; a parasitic weed which occurs naturally in parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, can severely affect the crop and yield losses in finger millet and other cereals by 20 to 80%. &quot;Striga&quot; can be controlled with limited success by hand weeding, herbicide application, crop rotations, improved soil fertility, intercropping and biological control. The most economically feasible and environmentally friendly control measure would be to develop and use &quot;Striga&quot;-resistant cultivars. &quot;Striga&quot; resistant genes have not been identified yet in cultivated finger millet but could be found in crop wild relatives of finger millet. Another pathogen in finger millet cultivation is the fungus &quot;Helminthosporium nodulosum&quot;, causing leaf blight. Finger millet pests are bird predators, such as quelea in East Africa.

===Insects===
The pink stem borer (&quot;Sesamia inferens&quot;) and the finger millet shoot fly (&quot;Atherigona miliaceae&quot;) are considered as the most relevant insect pests in finger millet cultivation. Measures to control &quot;Sesamia inferens&quot; are uprooting of infected plants, destroying of stubbles, having a crop rotation, chemical control with insecticides, biological measures such as pheromone traps, or biological pest control with the use of antagonistic organisms (e.g. &quot;Sturmiopsis inferens&quot;).

Other insect pests include:

;Root feeders
*root aphid &quot;Tetraneura nigriabdominalis&quot;

;Shoot and stem feeders
*&quot;Atherigona miliaceae&quot; and &quot;Atherigona soccata&quot;
*&quot;Sesamia inferens&quot;
*stem weevil &quot;Listronotus bonariensis&quot;

;Leaf feeders
*hairy caterpillars, &quot;Amsacta albistriga&quot;, &quot;Amsacta transiens&quot;, and &quot;Amsacta moorei&quot;
*cutworms, &quot;Agrotis ipsilon&quot;
*armyworm larvae of &quot;Spodoptera exempta&quot;, &quot;Spodoptera mauritia&quot;, and &quot;Mythimna separata&quot;
*leaf-folder &quot;Cnaphalocrocis medinalis&quot; larvae
*skipper &quot;Pelopidas mathias&quot; larvae
*grasshoppers, &quot;Chrotogonus hemipterus&quot;, &quot;Nomadacris septemfasciata&quot;, and &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;
*beetle grubs of &quot;Chnootriba similis&quot;
*thrip, &quot;Heliothrips indicus&quot;

;Sucking pests
*aphids, &quot;Hysteroneura setariae&quot;, &quot;Metopolophium dirhodum&quot;, &quot;Rhopalosiphum maidis&quot;, and &quot;Sitobion miscanthi&quot;
*mealy bug, &quot;Brevennia rehi&quot;
*leaf hoppers &quot;Cicadulina bipunctella&quot; and &quot;Cicadulina chinai&quot;

== Propagation and sowing ==

Propagation in finger millet farming is done mainly by seeds. In rainfed cropping, four sowing methods are used:
*Broadcasting: Seeds are directly sown in the field. This is the common method because it is the easiest way and no special machinery is required. The organic weed management with this method is a problem, because it is difficult to distinguish between weed and crop.
*Line Sowing: Improved sowing compared to broadcasting. Facilitates organic weed management due to better distinction of weed and crop. In this method, spacing of 22 cm to 30 cm between lines and 8 cm to 10 cm within lines should be maintained. The seeds should be sown about 3 cm deep in the soil.
*Drilling in rows: Seeds are sown directly in the untreated soil by using a direct-seed drill. This method is used in conservation agriculture.
*Transplanting the seedlings: Raising the seedlings in nursery beds and transplant to the main field. Leveling and watering of beds is required during transplanting. Seedlings with 4 weeks age should be transplanted in the field. For early Rabi and Kharif season, seedlings should be transplanted at 25 cm x 10 cm and for late Kharif season at 30 cm x 10 cm. Planting should be done 3 cm depth in the soil

== Harvest ==

Crop does not mature uniformly and hence the harvest is to be taken up in two stages. When the earhead on the main shoot and 50% of the earheads on the crop turn brown, the crop is ready for the first harvest. At the first harvest, all earheads that have turned brown should be cut. After this drying, threshing and cleaning the grains by winnowing. The second harvest is around seven days after the first. All earheads, including the green ones, should be cut. The grains should then be cured to obtain maturity by heaping the harvested earheads in shade for one day without drying, so that the humidity and temperature increase and the grains get cured. After this drying, threshing and cleaning as after the first harvesting.

== Storage ==
Once harvested, the seeds keep extremely well and are seldom attacked by insects or moulds. Finger millet can be kept for up to 10 years when it is unthreshed. Some sources report a storage duration up to 50 years under good storage conditions. The long storage capacity makes finger millet an important crop in risk-avoidance strategies as a famine crop for farming communities.

== Processing ==

=== Milling ===
As a first step of processing finger millet can be milled to produce flour. However, finger millet is difficult to mill due to the small size of the seeds and because the bran is bound very tightly to the endosperm. Furthermore, the delicate seed can get crushed during the milling. The development of commercial mechanical milling systems for finger millet is challenging. Therefore, the main product of finger millet is whole grain flour. This has disadvantages, such as reduced storage time of the flour due to the high oil content. Furthermore, the industrial use of whole grain finger millet flour is limited. Moistening the millet seeds prior to grinding helps to remove the bran mechanically without causing damage to the rest of the seed. The mini millet mill can also be used to process other grains such as wheat and sorghum.

=== Malting ===
Another method to process the finger millet grain is germinating the seed. This process is also called malting and is very common in the production of brewed beverages such as beer. When finger millet is germinated, enzymes are activated, which transfer starches into other carbohydrates such as sugars. Finger millet has a good malting activity. The malted finger millet can be used as a substrate to produce for example gluten-free beer or easily digestible food for infants.
==Nutrition==

Finger millet is 11% water, 7% protein, 54% carbohydrates, and 2% fat (table). In a 100 gram (3.5 oz) reference amount, finger millet supplies 305 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber and several dietary minerals, especially iron at 87% DV (table).

===Growing finger millet to improve nutrition===
The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), a member of the CGIAR consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, including finger millet. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. For example, the Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (HOPE) project is increasing yields of finger millet in Tanzania by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties.

==Use==

Finger millet can be ground into a flour and cooked into cakes, puddings or porridge. The flour is made into a fermented drink (or beer) in Nepal and in many parts of Africa. The straw from finger millet is used as animal fodder.

===In India===
Finger millet is a staple grain in many parts of India, especially Karnataka, where it is known as ragi (from Kannada ರಾಗಿ &quot;rāgi&quot;). It is malted and its grain is ground into flour.

There are numerous ways to prepare finger millet, including dosa, idli, and laddu. In southern India, on pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation, finger millet is used in preparing baby food, because of millet&#x27;s high nutritional content, especially iron and calcium. &quot;Satva&quot;, &quot;pole&quot; (dosa), &quot;bhakri&quot;, &quot;ambil&quot; (a sour porridge), and pappad are common dishes made using finger millet. In Karnataka, finger millet is generally consumed in the form of a porridge called &quot;ragi mudde&quot; in Kannada. It is the staple diet of many residents of South Karnataka. Mudde is prepared by cooking the ragi flour with water to achieve a dough-like consistency. This is then rolled into balls of desired size and consumed with sambar (huli), saaru (ಸಾರು), or curries. Ragi is also used to make roti, idli, dosa and conjee. In the Malnad region of Karnataka, the whole ragi grain is soaked and the milk is extracted to make a dessert known as &quot;keelsa&quot;. A type of flat bread is prepared using finger millet flour (called &quot;ragi rotti&quot; in Kannada) in Northern districts of Karnataka.

In Tamil Nadu, ragi is called &quot;kezhvaragu&quot; (கேழ்வரகு) and also has other names like keppai, ragi, and ariyam. Ragi is dried, powdered, and boiled to form a thick mass that is allowed to cool. This is the famed &quot;kali&quot; or &quot;keppai kali&quot;. This is made into large balls to quantify the intake. It is taken with sambar or kuzhambu. For children, ragi is also fed with milk and sugar (malt). It is also made in the form of pancakes with chopped onions and tomatoes. &quot;Kezhvaragu&quot; is used to make puttu with jaggery or sugar. Ragi is called &quot;koozh&quot; – a staple diet in farming communities, eaten along with raw onions and green chillies. In Andhra Pradesh, &quot;ragi sankati&quot; or &quot;ragi muddha&quot; – ragi balls – are eaten in the morning with chilli, onions, and sambar. In Kerala, puttu, a traditional breakfast dish, can be made with ragi flour and grated coconut, which is then steamed in a cylindrical steamer. In the tribal and western hilly regions of Odisha, ragi or &quot;mandiaa&quot; is a staple food. In the Garhwal and Kumaon regions of Uttarakhand, &quot;koda&quot; or &quot;maduwa&quot; is made into thick rotis (served with ghee), and also made into &quot;badi&quot;, which is similar to halwa but without sugar. In the Kumaon region, ragi is traditionally fed to women after child birth. In some parts of Kumaon region the ragi flour is used to make various snacks like &quot;namkeen sev&quot;, &quot;mathri&quot; and &quot;chips&quot;.

====Ragi flour====
To make the flour, ragi is graded and washed. It is allowed to dry naturally in sunlight for 5 to 8 hours. It is then powdered. Ragi porridge, ragi halwa, ragi ela ada, and ragi kozhukatta can be made with ragi flour. All-purpose flour can be replaced with ragi flour during baking. Ragi cake and ragi biscuits can be prepared. The flour is consumed with milk, boiled water, or yogurt. The flour is made into flatbreads, including thin, leavened dosa and thicker, unleavened roti.

=== In South and Far East Asia ===

In Nepal, a thick dough (&quot;ḍhĩḍo&quot;) made of millet flour (&quot;kōdō&quot;) is cooked and eaten by hand. The dough, on other hand, can be made into thick bread (&quot;rotee&quot;) spread over flat utensil and heating it. Fermented millet is used to make a beer chhaang and the mash is distilled to make a liquor (&quot;rakśi&quot;शी). Whole grain millet is fermented to make tongba. Its use in holy Hindu practices is barred especially by upper castes. In Nepal, the National Plant Genetic Resource Centre at Khumaltar maintains 877 accessions (samples) of Nepalese finger millet (kodo).

In Sri Lanka, finger millet is called &quot;kurakkan&quot; and is made into &quot;kurakkan roti&quot; – an earthy brown thick roti with coconut and &quot;thallapa&quot; – a thick dough made of ragi by boiling it with water and some salt until like a dough ball. It is then eaten with a spicy meat curry and is usually swallowed in small balls, rather than chewing. It is also eaten as a porridge (kurrakan kenda) and as a sweet called &#x27;Halape&#x27;. In northwest Vietnam, finger millet is used as a medicine for women at childbirth. A minority use finger millet flour to make alcohol.

===As beverage===
Ragi malt porridge is made from finger millet which is soaked and shadow dried, then roasted and ground. This preparation is boiled in water and used as a substitute for milk powder-based beverages.

<doc id="39672" wikidata="Q5526362" url="?curid=39672" title="Gas sculpture">
<text>Gas sculpture is a concept introduced by Joan Miró to make sculptures out of gaseous materials. The idea of a gas sculpture also appeared in the book &quot;Gog&quot;, by Giovanni Papini (1881–1956).

An example of pure water fog sculpture is in the sculpture garden at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. A large bank of very small nozzles is arrayed on the edge of a small rush-filled pond, and when the power is switched on a fine mist of fog billows out. The &quot;sculpture&quot; has a continuously changing shape as it is affected by the water, the rushes, and the air currents in the area.

==Technology==
Cold water fog nozzle technologies were developed by industry in the late 1960s for factory air particulate control and agricultural orchard freeze prevention. These high pressure systems force filtered water at through custom nozzles to atomize the water into billions of ultra-fine droplets below in size. In industrial applications this also provides cooling due to rapid evaporation.

Artists use this cold water fog technology to make experimental artworks that allow the viewer to safely interact and become fully immersed in the fog.

High temperature steam fog from underground steam utility lines used for commercial heat transfer, and small boiler sources, are also used by artists for atmospheric visual displays, and as a dynamic projection surfaces.

In the commercial entertainment industry these various water fog systems are used for special effects in movies, and for theme park atmospherics.

Some kinetic sculptures contain other gaseous elements, such as the sculptures of Jean-Paul Riopelle&#x27;s &quot;La Joute&quot;, which includes natural gas fire jets, a water fountain, and bronze sculptural elements.

==Contemporary fog sculptures==

A large scale use of cold water fog is the Blur Building (2002), an exhibition pavilion built for Swiss Expo.02 on Lake Neuchatel by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro. This is an architecture described as &quot;an inhabitable cloud whirling above a lake&quot;, built with an atmosphere of fog surrounding a lightweight tensegrity structure .

The primary visible building material is water. Water pumped from the lake is filtered and atomized to a fine mist through an array of 31,400 high-pressure nozzles. The nozzle pressures are regulated by a computer processor and a smart weather system that reads temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. The fog created is thus in constant change, an interplay of natural and man-made forces.

Two bridges connect the building with the shore, four hundred visitors at a time can enter the building and be within the fog mass. Inside the fog, one&#x27;s normal spatial references are lost when immersed within an optical “whiteout”, and the “white noise” of hissing nozzles.

Artistic use of steam fog was pioneered in the collaborative &quot;Center Beam&quot; artwork by the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT. First shown in 1977 at documenta 6 in Kassel, Germany, it included steam works by Joan Brigham, Otto Piene, and Paul Earls. For &quot;Center Beam&quot;, a low pressure hot water steam fog became a medium to project lasers, holograms, films and text onto.

The Children&#x27;s Museum of Pittsburgh is planning a new park with a fog sculpture created by Ned Kahn. Set for completion in 2012, the sculpture will be a grid of stainless steel poles outfitted with fog nozzles. Kahn said of the sculpture, &quot;When the fog is on, it will appear like a 20-foot-diameter sphere [] of fog spinning inside the poles.&quot;

In 1998 polish artist Zuzanna Janin did the installation “What a Hell, What a Heaven” in Foksal Gallery in Warsaw, Poland, also in 1999 &quot;Memory&quot; in Center for CONTEMPORARY ART Zamek Ujazdowski in Warsaw, Poland. In 2002 she have done work “Synagogue /Memory” in Center of Contemporary Art (old synagogue building) in Trnava, Slovakia. The work was done from artificial fog used in disco or concerts. 

Other contemporary sculptures in which fog is used as a medium of expression are: &quot;Harbor Fog&quot;, a viewer responsive artwork in the parkland above Boston&#x27;s Big Dig highway; &quot;Cloud RIngs&quot; (2006) by Ned Kahn at the 21c Museum Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky; and the interactive landscape of Dilworth Plaza at Philadelphia City Hall (completion date 2013).

<text>Berengar of Tours (died 6 January 1088), in Latin Berengarius Turonensis, was an 11th-century French Christian theologian and archdeacon of Angers, a scholar whose leadership of the cathedral school at Chartres set an example of intellectual inquiry through the revived tools of dialectic that was soon followed at cathedral schools of Laon and Paris. Berengar of Tours was distinguished from mainline Catholic theology by two views: his assertion of the supremacy of Scripture and his denial of transubstantiation.

==Biography==
Berengar of Tours was born perhaps at Tours, probably in the early years of the 11th century. His education began in the school of Bishop Fulbert of Chartres, who represented the traditional theology of the early Middle Ages, but did not succeed in imparting it to his pupil. Berengar was less attracted by pure theology than by secular learning, and brought away a knowledge of Latin literature, dialectic, and general knowledge and freedom of thought. Later he paid more attention to the Bible and early Christian writers, especially Gregory of Tours and Augustine of Hippo; and thus he came to formal theology.

After the death of Fulbert in 1028, Berengar returned to Tours, where he became a canon of the cathedral. In about 1040 he became head of its school, improving its efficiency and attracting students from far and near. He acquired his fame as much from his blameless and ascetic life as from the success of his teaching. His reputation was such that a number of monks requested him to write a book to kindle their zeal; and his letter to Joscelin, later archbishop of Bordeaux, who had asked him to decide a dispute between Bishop Isembert of Poitiers and his chapter, is evidence of the authority attributed to his judgment. He became archdeacon of Angers, but remained in Tours to direct the school. He enjoyed the confidence of not a few bishops and of the powerful Count Geoffrey of Anjou.

Amid this chorus of praise, a discordant voice began to be heard; it was asserted that Berengar held heretical views on the Eucharist. The first controversies on the nature of the Eucharistic Presence date from the earlier Middle Ages. In the ninth century Paschasius Radbertus claimed that Christ&#x27;s Eucharistic body was identical with his body in heaven, but he won practically no support. His doctrine was sharply attacked by Ratramnus and Rabanus Maurus, who opposed his emphatic realism, which was sometimes marred by unfortunate comparisons and illustrations, and proposed a more spiritual conception of the Divine Presence. As for Berengar, by one account, &quot;Considerably greater stir was provoked ... by the teaching of Berengar, who opposed the doctrine of the Real Presence.&quot; But in reality, there are diverse opinions among theologians and historians on this point, and it is not clear that Berengar actually denies the Real Presence, though he does deny transubstantiation. The first to take formal notice of this was his former fellow student Adelmann, who begged him to abandon his opposition to the Church&#x27;s teaching.

Probably in the early part of 1050, Berengar addressed a letter to Lanfranc, then prior of Bec Abbey in Normandy, in which he expressed his regret that Lanfranc adhered to the Eucharistic teaching of Paschasius and considered the treatise of Ratramnus on the subject (which Berengar supposed to have been written by Johannes Scotus Eriugena) to be heretical. He declared his own agreement with Eriugena, and believed himself to be supported by Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Augustine, and other authorities. This letter was received by Lanfranc in Rome, where it was read before a council and Berengar&#x27;s view was condemned. Berengar was summoned to appear at another council to be held at Vercelli in September. Berengar sought permission to go to the council from King Henry I of France, in his capacity as nominal abbot of St. Martin at Tours. Instead, for unclear reasons, the king imprisoned him. The council at Vercelli examined Berengar&#x27;s doctrine and again condemned it and he was excommunicated.

On his release from prison, probably affected by the influence of Geoffrey of Anjou, the king still pursued him, and called a synod to meet in Paris in October 1051. Berengar, fearing its purpose, avoided appearing, and the king&#x27;s threats after its session had no effect, since Berengar was sheltered by Geoffrey and by his former student, Eusebius, now Bishop of Angers. He also found numerous partisans among less prominent people.

In 1054, a Council was held at Tours presided over by Cardinal Hildebrand as papal legate. Berengar wrote a profession of faith wherein he confessed that after the consecration the bread and wine were truly the body and blood of Christ. The French bishops indicated that they wished a speedy settlement of the controversy and the synod declared itself satisfied by Berengar&#x27;s written declaration. 

In 1059, Berengar went to Rome, fortified by a letter of commendation from Count Geoffrey to Hildebrand. At a council held in the Lateran, he could get no hearing, and a formula representing what seemed to him the most carnal view of the sacrament was offered for his acceptance. Overwhelmed by the forces against him, he took this document in his hand and threw himself on the ground in the silence of apparent submission.

Berengar returned to France full of remorse for this desertion of his faith and of bitterness against the pope and his opponents; his friends were growing fewer—Geoffrey was dead and his successor hostile. Eusebius Bruno was gradually withdrawing from him. Rome, however, was disposed to give him a chance; Pope Alexander II wrote him an encouraging letter, at the same time warning him to give no further offence.

He was still firm in his convictions, and in about 1069 he published a treatise in which he gave vent to his resentment against Pope Nicholas II and his antagonists in the Roman council. Lanfranc answered it, and Berengar rejoined. Bishop Hugo of Langres also wrote a treatise, &quot;De corpore et sanguine Christi&quot;, against Berengar. Even his namesake Berengar, Bishop of Venosa, was drawn into the quarrel and wrote against him at Rome in the years of his second summons there.

But the feeling against him in France was growing so hostile that it almost came to open violence at the Synod of Poitiers in 1076. Hildebrand, now Pope Gregory VII, tried yet to save him; he summoned him once more to Rome (1078), and undertook to silence his enemies by getting him to assent to a vague formula, something like the one which he had signed at Tours. But Berengar&#x27;s enemies were not satisfied, and three months later at another synod they forced on him a formula which could mean nothing but what was later called transubstantiation, except by utterly indefensible sophistry. He was indiscreet enough to claim the sympathy of Gregory VII, who commanded him to acknowledge his errors and pursue them no further. Berengar confessed that he had erred, and was sent home.

Once back in France, he published his own account of the proceedings in Rome, retracting his recantation. The consequence was another trial before a synod at Bordeaux (1080), and another recantation.

After this he kept silence, retiring to the island of Saint-Cosme near Tours to live in ascetic solitude. It was there that he died, in union with the Roman Catholic Church.

===Selection from his 1059 confession===
&quot;...the bread and wine which are placed on the altar are after consecration not only a sacrament but also the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the senses not only sacramentally but in truth are taken and broken by the hands of the priests and crushed by the teeth of the faithful.&quot;

===Text of his 1079 confession===
&quot;I, Berengarius, believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine that are placed on the altar are through the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of our Redeemer substantially changed into the true and proper life-giving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord; and that after the consecration is the true body of Christ, which was born of the Virgin, as an offering for the salvation of the world hung on the cross, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and (is) the true blood of Christ which flowed from his side; not only through the sign and power of the sacrament but in his proper nature and true substance; as it is set down in this summary and as I read it and you understand it. Thus I believe, and I will not teach any more against this faith. So help me God and this holy Gospel of God.&quot;

== Berengar&#x27;s theory of the Eucharist ==
Berengar&#x27;s theory of the Eucharist had four points:

# The elements remain in substance as well as in appearance, after the consecration, although they acquire a new significance.
# However the wine and bread are not mere symbols, but in some sense, they still are the body and blood of Jesus which they represent.
# Christ is spiritually present and is spiritually received by faith.
# The communion in the Eucharist is a communion with the whole undivided person of Jesus Christ, and not the blood and body of Jesus as separate elements. As the whole body of Christ was sacrificed in death, it is received in a spiritual manner as the whole body; and as Christ’s body is now glorified in heaven, we must spiritually ascend to heaven.

The views of Berengar on the Eucharist had very much in common with the views of John Calvin.

==Significance==
Berengar of Tours can be seen as a forerunner of Christian rationalism, as he criticized Church authority.

Berengar&#x27;s position was never diametrically opposed to that of his critics. But the controversy that he aroused forced people to reconsider the ninth-century discussion of the Eucharist, as Paschasius Radbertus had left it, and to clarify the doctrine of transubstantiation. Further, when both Berengar and his critics used the secular disciplines of logic and grammar to express a matter of Christian doctrine, the way was open to the scholasticism of the twelfth century.

Berengar of Tours was a forerunner of the Reformers, especially of Zwingli and John Calvin.

<text>A planetary nebula is a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives.

The term &quot;planetary nebula&quot; is a misnomer because they are unrelated to planets. The term originates from the planet-like round shape of these nebulae observed by astronomers through early telescopes. The first usage may have occurred during the 1780s with the English astronomer William Herschel who described these nebulae as resembling planets; however, as early as January 1779, the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix described in his observations of the Ring Nebula, &quot;very dim but perfectly outlined; it is as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet&quot;.
Though the modern interpretation is different, the old term is still used.

All planetary nebulae form at the end of the life of a star of intermediate mass, about 1-8 solar masses. It is expected that the Sun will form a planetary nebula at the end of its life cycle. They are relatively short-lived phenomena, lasting perhaps a few tens of millennia, compared to considerably longer phases of stellar evolution. Once all of the red giant&#x27;s atmosphere has been dissipated, energetic ultraviolet radiation from the exposed hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (P.N.N.), ionizes the ejected material. Absorbed ultraviolet light then energizes the shell of nebulous gas around the central star, causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula.

Planetary nebulae probably play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way by expelling elements into the interstellar medium from stars where those elements were created. Planetary nebulae are observed in more distant galaxies, yielding useful information about their chemical abundances.

Starting from the 1990s, Hubble Space Telescope images revealed that many planetary nebulae have extremely complex and varied morphologies. About one-fifth are roughly spherical, but the majority are not spherically symmetric. The mechanisms that produce such a wide variety of shapes and features are not yet well understood, but binary central stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields may play a role.

== Observations ==

=== Discovery ===

The first planetary nebula discovered (though not yet termed as such) was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula. It was observed by Charles Messier on July 12, 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae resembled the giant planets like Uranus. As early as January 1779, the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix described in his observations of the Ring Nebula, &quot;a very dull nebula, but perfectly outlined; as large as Jupiter and looks like a fading planet&quot;. 

The nature of these objects remained unclear. In 1782, William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, found the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009) and described it as &quot;A curious nebula, or what else to call it I do not know&quot;. He later described these objects as seeming to be planets &quot;of the starry kind&quot;. As noted by Darquier before him, Herschel found that the disk resembled a planet but it was too faint to be one. In 1785, Herschel wrote to Jérôme Lalande:

These are celestial bodies of which as yet we have no clear idea and which are perhaps of a type quite different from those that we are familiar with in the heavens. I have already found four that have a visible diameter of between 15 and 30 seconds. These bodies appear to have a disk that is rather like a planet, that is to say, of equal brightness all over, round or somewhat oval, and about as well defined in outline as the disk of the planets, of a light strong enough to be visible with an ordinary telescope of only one foot, yet they have only the appearance of a star of about ninth magnitude.

He assigned these to Class IV of his catalogue of &quot;nebulae&quot;, eventually listing 78 &quot;planetary nebulae&quot;, most of which are in fact galaxies.

Herschel used the term &quot;planetary nebulae&quot; for these objects. The origin of this term not known. The label &quot;planetary nebula&quot; became ingrained in the terminology used by astronomers to categorize these types of nebulae, and is still in use by astronomers today.

=== Spectra ===

The nature of planetary nebulae remained unknown until the first spectroscopic observations were made in the mid-19th century. Using a prism to disperse their light, William Huggins was one of the earliest astronomers to study the optical spectra of astronomical objects.

On August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula. His observations of stars had shown that their spectra consisted of a continuum of radiation with many dark lines superimposed. He found that many nebulous objects such as the Andromeda Nebula (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. However, when Huggins looked at the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula, he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of emission lines. Brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7 nanometres, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.

At first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named nebulium. A similar idea had led to the discovery of helium through analysis of the Sun&#x27;s spectrum in 1868. While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, &quot;nebulium&quot; was not. In the early 20th century, Henry Norris Russell proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7 nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.

Physicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, electrons can occupy excited metastable energy levels in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities. Electron transitions from these levels in nitrogen and oxygen ions (,  (a.k.a. O ), and ) give rise to the 500.7 nm emission line and others. These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low-density gases, are called &quot;forbidden lines&quot;. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.

=== Central stars ===

The central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot. Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to a small size. Planetary nebulae are understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star&#x27;s outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.

=== Modern observations ===

Towards the end of the 20th century, technological improvements helped to further the study of planetary nebulae. Space telescopes allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere transmits. The first UV observations of PNe (IC 2149) were performed from space, with the Orion 2 Space Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories) on board the Soyuz 13 spacecraft in December 1973, two photon emission from nebulae was detected for the first time.
Infrared and ultraviolet studies of planetary nebulae allowed much more accurate determinations of nebular temperatures, densities and elemental abundances. Charge-coupled device technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high optical resolution achievable by telescopes above the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere reveals extremely complex structures.

Under the Morgan-Keenan spectral classification scheme, planetary nebulae are classified as &quot;Type-P&quot;, although this notation is seldom used in practice.

==Origins==
Stars greater than 8 solar masses (M⊙) will probably end their lives in dramatic supernovae explosions, while planetary nebulae seemingly only occur at the end of the lives of intermediate and low mass stars between 0.8 M⊙ to 8.0 M⊙. Progenitor stars that form planetary nebulae will spend most of their lifetimes converting their hydrogen into helium in the star&#x27;s core by nuclear fusion at about 15 million K. This generates energy in the core, which creates outward pressure that balances the crushing inward pressures of gravity. This state of equilibrium is known as the main sequence, which can last for tens of millions to billions of years, depending on the mass.

When the hydrogen in the core starts to run out, nuclear fusion generates less energy and gravity starts compressing the core, causing a rise in temperature to about 100 million K. Such high core temperatures then make the star&#x27;s cooler outer layers expand to create much larger red giant stars. This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the released energy is distributed over a much larger surface area, which in fact causes the average surface temperature to be lower. In stellar evolution terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). During this phase, the star can lose 50–70% of its total mass from its stellar wind.

For the more massive asymptotic giant branch stars that form planetary nebulae, whose progenitors exceed about 0.6M⊙, their cores will continue to contract. When temperatures reach about 100 million K, the available helium nuclei fuse into carbon and oxygen, so that the star again resumes radiating energy, temporarily stopping the core&#x27;s contraction. This new helium burning phase (fusion of helium nuclei) forms a growing inner core of inert carbon and oxygen. Above it is a thin helium-burning shell, surrounded in turn by a hydrogen-burning shell. However, this new phase lasts only 20,000 years or so, a very short period compared to the entire lifetime of the star.

The venting of atmosphere continues unabated into interstellar space, but when the outer surface of the exposed core reaches temperatures exceeding about 30,000 K, there are enough emitted ultraviolet photons to ionize the ejected atmosphere, causing the gas to shine as a planetary nebula.

==Lifetime==
After a star passes through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity, while at the same time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000 K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000 years passes between its formation and recombination of the resulting plasma.

==Role in galactic enrichment==
Planetary nebulae may play a very important role in galactic evolution. Newly born stars consist almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, but as stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch phase, they create heavier elements via nuclear fusion which are eventually expelled by strong stellar winds. Planetary nebulae usually contain larger proportions of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and these are recycled into the interstellar medium via these powerful winds. In this way, planetary nebulae greatly enrich the Milky Way and their nebulae with these heavier elements – collectively known by astronomers as &quot;metals&quot; and specifically referred to by the metallicity parameter &quot;Z&quot;.

Subsequent generations of stars formed from such nebulae also tend to have higher metallicities. Although these metals are present in stars in relatively tiny amounts, they have marked effects on stellar evolution and fusion reactions. When stars formed earlier in the universe they theoretically contained smaller quantities of heavier elements. Known examples are the metal poor Population II stars. (See Stellar population.) Identification of stellar metallicity content is found by spectroscopy.

==Characteristics==

===Physical characteristics===

A typical planetary nebula is roughly one light year across, and consists of extremely rarefied gas, with a density generally from 100 to 10,000 particles . (The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, by comparison, contains 2.5 particles .) Young planetary nebulae have the highest densities, sometimes as high as 106 particles . As nebulae age, their expansion causes their density to decrease. The masses of planetary nebulae range from 0.1 to 1 solar masses.

Radiation from the central star heats the gases to temperatures of about 10,000 K. The gas temperature in central regions is usually much higher than at the periphery reaching 16,000–25,000 K. The volume in the vicinity of the central star is often filled with a very hot (coronal) gas having the temperature of about 1,000,000 K. This gas originates from the surface of the central star in the form of the fast stellar wind.

Nebulae may be described as &quot;matter bounded&quot; or &quot;radiation bounded&quot;. In the former case, there is not enough matter in the nebula to absorb all the UV photons emitted by the star, and the visible nebula is fully ionized. In the latter case, there are not enough UV photons being emitted by the central star to ionize all the surrounding gas, and an ionization front propagates outward into the circumstellar envelope of neutral atoms.

===Numbers and distribution===
About 3000 planetary nebulae are now known to exist in our galaxy, out of 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to total stellar lifetime accounts for their rarity. They are found mostly near the plane of the Milky Way, with the greatest concentration near the Galactic Center.

===Morphology===
Only about 20% of planetary nebulae are spherically symmetric (for example, see Abell 39). A wide variety of shapes exist with some very complex forms seen. Planetary nebulae are classified by different authors into: stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, bipolar, quadrupolar, and other types, although the majority of them belong to just three types: spherical, elliptical and bipolar. Bipolar nebulae are concentrated in the galactic plane, probably produced by relatively young massive progenitor stars; and bipolars in the galactic bulge appear to prefer orienting their orbital axes parallel to the galactic plane. On the other hand, spherical nebulae are probably produced by old stars similar to the Sun.

The huge variety of the shapes is partially the projection effect—the same nebula when viewed under different angles will appear different. Nevertheless, the reason for the huge variety of physical shapes is not fully understood. Gravitational interactions with companion stars if the central stars are binary stars may be one cause. Another possibility is that planets disrupt the flow of material away from the star as the nebula forms. It has been determined that the more massive stars produce more irregularly shaped nebulae. In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two planetary nebulae, predicted already in 1960s, and hypothesized that the fields might be partly or wholly responsible for their remarkable shapes.

==Membership in clusters==
Planetary nebulae have been detected as members in four Galactic globular clusters: Messier 15, Messier 22, NGC 6441 and Palomar 6. Evidence also points to the potential discovery of planetary nebulae in globular clusters in the galaxy M31. However, there is currently only one case of a planetary nebula discovered in an open cluster that is agreed upon by independent researchers. That case pertains to the planetary nebula PHR 1315-6555 and the open cluster Andrews-Lindsay 1. Indeed, through cluster membership, PHR 1315-6555 possesses among the most precise distances established for a planetary nebula (i.e., a 4% distance solution). The cases of NGC 2818 and NGC 2348 in Messier 46, exhibit mismatched velocities between the planetary nebulae and the clusters, which indicates they are line-of-sight coincidences. A subsample of &quot;tentative&quot; cases that may potentially be cluster/PN pairs includes Abell 8 and Bica 6, and He 2-86 and NGC 4463.

Theoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between one and eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star&#x27;s age at greater than 40 million years. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within. For one reason, the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars is on the order of millennia, which is a blink of the eye in astronomic terms. Also, partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion and tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically from 100 to 600 million years.

==Current issues in planetary nebula studies==

The distances to planetary nebulae are generally poorly determined, but the &quot;Gaia&quot; mission is now measuring direct parallactic distances between their central stars and neighboring stars. It is also possible to determine distances to nearby planetary nebula by measuring their expansion rates. High resolution observations taken several years apart will show the expansion of the nebula perpendicular to the line of sight, while spectroscopic observations of the Doppler shift will reveal the velocity of expansion in the line of sight. Comparing the angular expansion with the derived velocity of expansion will reveal the distance to the nebula.

The issue of how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be produced is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material moving away from the star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes. However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae. Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields, and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.

There are two main methods of determining metal abundances in nebulae. These rely on recombination lines and collisionally excited lines. Large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. This may be explained by the presence of small temperature fluctuations within planetary nebulae. The discrepancies may be too large to be caused by temperature effects, and some hypothesize the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations. However, such knots have yet to be observed.

<text>DeCSS is one of the first free computer programs capable of decrypting content on a commercially produced DVD video disc. Before the release of DeCSS, free and open source operating systems (such as BSD and Linux) could not play encrypted video DVDs.

DeCSS&#x27;s development was done without a license from the DVD Copy Control Association (CCA), the organization responsible for DVD copy protection—namely, the Content Scramble System (CSS) used by commercial DVD publishers. The release of DeCSS resulted in a Norwegian criminal trial and subsequent acquittal of one of the authors of DeCSS. The DVD CCA launched numerous lawsuits in the United States in an effort to stop the distribution of the software.

== Origins and history ==

DeCSS was devised by three people, two of whom remain anonymous. It was on the Internet mailing list LiViD in October 1999. The one known author of the trio is Norwegian programmer Jon Lech Johansen, whose home was raided in 2000 by Norwegian police. Still a teenager at the time, he was put on trial in a Norwegian court for violating Norwegian Criminal Code section 145, and faced a possible jail sentence of two years and large fines, but was acquitted of all charges in early 2003. On 5 March 2003, a Norwegian appeals court ruled that Johansen would have to be retried. The court said that arguments filed by the prosecutor and additional evidence merited another trial. On 22 December 2003, the appeals court agreed with the acquittal, and on 5 January 2004, Norway&#x27;s Økokrim (Economic Crime Unit) decided not to pursue the case further.

The program was first released on 6 October 1999 when Johansen posted an announcement of DeCSS 1.1b, a closed source Windows-only application for DVD ripping, on the livid-dev mailing list. The source code was leaked before the end of the month. The first release of DeCSS was preceded by a few weeks by a program called DoD DVD Speed Ripper from a group called DrinkOrDie, which didn&#x27;t include source code and which apparently did not work with all DVDs. DrinkOrDie reportedly disassembled the object code of the Xing DVD player to obtain a player key. The group that wrote DeCSS, including Johansen, came to call themselves Masters of Reverse Engineering and may have obtained information from DrinkOrDie.

The CSS decryption source code used in DeCSS was mailed to Derek Fawcus before DeCSS was released. When the DeCSS source code was leaked, Fawcus noticed that DeCSS included his css-auth code in violation of the GNU GPL. When Johansen was made aware of this, he contacted Fawcus to solve the issue and was granted a license to use the code in DeCSS under non-GPL terms.

On 22 January 2004, the DVD CCA dropped the case against Jon Johansen.

===Jon Lech Johansen&#x27;s involvement===
The DeCSS program was a collaborative project, in which Johansen wrote the graphical user interface. The transcripts from the Borgarting Court of Appeal, published in the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot;, contain the following description of the process which led to the release of DeCSS:

Through Internet Relay Chat (henceforth IRC), [Jon Lech Johansen] made contact with like-minded [people seeking to develop a DVD-player under the Linux operating system]. 11 September 1999, he had a conversation with &quot;mdx&quot; about how the encryption algorithm in CSS could be found, by using a poorly secured software-based DVD-player. In a conversation [between Jon Lech Johansen and &quot;mdx&quot;] 22 September, &quot;mdx&quot; informs that &quot;the nomad&quot; had found the code for CSS decryption, and that &quot;mdx&quot; now would send this [code] to Jon Lech Johansen. &quot;The nomad&quot; allegedly found this decryption algorithm through so-called reverse engineering of a Xing DVD-player, where the [decryption] keys were more or less openly accessible. Through this, information that made it possible [for &quot;mdx&quot;] to create the code CSS_scramble.cpp was retrieved. From chat logs dated 4 November 1999 and 25 November 1999, it appears that &quot;the nomad&quot; carried through the reverse engineering process on a Xing player, which he characterized as illegal. As the case is presented for the High Court, this was not known by Jon Lech Johansen before 4 November [1999].

Regarding the authentication code, the High Court takes for its basis that &quot;the nomad&quot; obtained this code through the electronic mailing list LiVid (Linux Video) on the Internet, and that it was created by Derek Fawcus. It appears through a LiVid posting dated 6 October 1999 that Derek Fawcus on this date read through the DeCSS source code and compared it with his own. Further, it appears that &quot;the creators [of DeCSS] have taken [Derek Fawcus&#x27; code] almost verbatim - the only alteration was the removal of [Derek Fawcus&#x27;] copyright header and a paragraph containing commentaries, and a change of the function names.&quot; The name [of the code] was CSS_auth.cpp.

The High Court takes for its basis that the program Jon Lech Johansen later programmed, the graphical user interface, consisted of &quot;the nomad&#x27;s&quot; decryption algorithm and Derek Fawcus&#x27; authentication package. The creation of a graphical user interface made the program accessible, also for users without special knowledge in programming. The program was published on the Internet for the first time 6 October 1999, after Jon Lech Johansen had tested it on the movie &quot;The Matrix.&quot; In this, he downloaded approximately 2.5%. 200 megabytes, of the movie to the hard drive on his computer. This file is the only film fragment Jon Lech Johansen has saved on his computer.

== Technology and derived works ==

When the release of the DeCSS source code made the CSS algorithm available for public scrutiny, it was soon found to be susceptible to a brute-force attack quite different from DeCSS. The encryption is only 40-bit, and does not use all keys; a high-end home computer in 1999 running optimized code could brute-force it within 24 hours, and modern computers can brute-force it in a few seconds or less.

Programmers around the world created hundreds of programs equivalent to DeCSS, some merely to demonstrate the trivial ease with which the system could be bypassed, and others to add DVD support to open source movie players. The licensing restrictions on CSS make it impossible to create an open source implementation through official channels, and closed source drivers are unavailable for some operating systems, so some users need DeCSS or a similar tool to watch even legally obtained movies.

== Legal response ==

The first legal threats against sites hosting DeCSS, and the beginning of the DeCSS mirroring campaign, began in early November 1999 (&quot;Universal v. Reimerdes&quot;). The preliminary injunction in &quot;DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Bunner&quot; followed soon after, in January 2000. As a response to these threats a program also called DeCSS but with an unrelated function was developed. This program can be used to strip Cascading Style Sheets tags from HTML pages. In one case, a school removed a student&#x27;s webpage that included a copy of this program, mistaking it for the original DeCSS program, and received a great deal of negative media attention. The CSS stripping program had been specifically created to bait the MPAA in this manner.

In protest against legislation that prohibits publication of copy protection circumvention code in countries that implement the WIPO Copyright Treaty (such as the United States&#x27; Digital Millennium Copyright Act), some have devised clever ways of distributing descriptions of the DeCSS algorithm, such as through steganography, through various Internet protocols, on T-shirts and in dramatic readings, as MIDI files, as a haiku poem (DeCSS haiku), and even as a so-called illegal prime number.

<text>Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary is the most frequently used legal dictionary in the United States. Henry Campbell Black (1860–1927) was the author of the first two editions of the dictionary.

==History==
The first edition was published in 1891 by West Publishing, with the full title &quot;A Dictionary of Law: containing definitions of the terms and phrases of American and English jurisprudence, ancient and modern, including the principal terms of international constitutional and commercial law, with a collection of legal maxims and numerous select titles from the civil law and other foreign systems&quot;. A second edition was published in 1910 as &quot;A Law Dictionary&quot;. Black died in 1927 and future editions were titled &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot;.

The sixth and earlier editions of the book additionally provided case citations for the term cited, which was viewed by lawyers as its most useful feature, providing a useful starting point with leading cases. The development of the Internet made legal research easier therefore many state- or circuit-specific case citations and outdated or overruled case citations were omitted from the seventh edition in 1999. The eighth edition introduced a unique system of perpetually updated case citations and cross-references to legal encyclopedias. The current edition is the twelfth, published in 2024.

As many legal terms are derived from a Latin root word, the dictionary provides a pronunciation guide for such terms. In addition, the applicable entries provide pronunciation transcriptions pursuant to those found among North American practitioners of law or medicine.

==Availability==
An online version of the tenth edition can be accessed through the paid Westlaw legal information service, and is available as an application for iOS devices.

The second edition of &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot;, published in 1910, is now in the public domain and is widely reproduced online. References to case law are out-of-date, and that edition of the dictionary omits legal terms that have since come into use and does not reflect contemporary changes in how legal terms are used.

<text>The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe ( ; ), also known as the Muckleshoot Tribe, is a federally-recognized tribe located in Auburn, Washington. The tribe governs the Muckleshoot Reservation and is composed of descendants of the Duwamish, Stkamish, Smulkamish, Skopamish, Yilalkoamish, and Upper Puyallup peoples. The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe was formally established in 1936, after the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, but its origins lie in the creation of the Muckleshoot Reservation in 1874 and the treaties of Medicine Creek (1854) and Point Elliott (1855).

== Name ==
The name &quot;Muckleshoot&quot; is an anglicization of the Lushootseed word .

 originally referred only to a prairie, located between the White and Green rivers, and never as a word to refer to the peoples living in this area. Prior to the establishment of the Muckleshoot reservation, the Indigenous peoples of the Green-White river systems were variously called &quot;Green River Indians&quot;, &quot;White River Indians&quot;, or by their native village terms (such as Skopamish). The name &quot;Muckleshoot&quot; was first recorded in a survey conducted by George Gibbs from 1853-1856, where he recorded &quot;Mukl-shootl&quot;, as being a &quot;prairie between the White and Green [rivers]. U.S. Military Station&quot;.

The term evolved from referring to a prairie, to referring to a military outpost on the prairie. After the reservation was established at the fort, it took the name of the prairie, and later, was applied to the Indians living at the reservation. The earliest recorded use of &quot;Muckleshoot&quot; to refer to a people was in 1864, by one John Montgomery, who described his wife as &quot;an Indian woman of the Muckleshute Band of the Klikitat Tribe.&quot; Montgomery, like other settlers at the time, evidently referred to peoples east of the Cascade mountains indiscriminately as &quot;Klikitats,&quot; and likely thought that the &quot;Muckleshutes&quot; of the Muckleshoot Reservation were a sub-group of the &quot;Klikitats&quot;, due to close ties between the peoples of the Green and White rivers and the interior peoples. In 1868 and 1870, reports from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs described the &quot;Muckleshoots&quot; and the &quot;Muckleshoot Tribe&quot; living at the Muckleshoot reservation.

== History ==

The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe is the successor of various groups which lived along the Duwamish River&#x27;s watershed, and parts of the upper Puyallup River&#x27;s watershed. These include the:

* Duwamish
* Stkamish
* Smulkamish
* Skopamish, the name for all peoples living along the Green River. This term covered eight to ten independent villages along the river, such as the Yilalkoamish.
* Upper Puyallup peoples
** Tkwakwamish

=== The Muckleshoot reservation ===

The origins of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe lie in the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek and the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. Although the Stkamish, Skopamish, and Smulkamish bands are mentioned in the preamble to the Treaty of Point Elliott, they did not sign the treaty directly. Along with the Sammamish, they were assumed by the territorial governor of Washington Territory, Isaac Stevens, to be under the control of the Duwamish and Seattle. It was Stevens&#x27; desire to alter the traditional political organization of the Indigenous peoples in the area by appointing single &quot;chiefs&quot; as leaders of entire groups, noting the &quot;difficulties in trying to control an indigenous population without strong chiefs and centralized authority.&quot; The decision of creating these political officices was not based on the indigenous social organization, and as such, Seattle was appointed as a &quot;head chief&quot; of a Duwamish Tribe that included all the peoples living along the Duwamish watershed, including the Green and White rivers&#x27; population. For this reason, the Muckleshoot Tribe has variously claimed that they have both a treaty and non-treaty status. Furthermore, the Muckleshoot Reservation exists on territory ceded by the Treaty of Point Elliott, but was dictated by the Treaty of Medicine Creek (and only the Medicine Creek treaty was ratified at the time), further contributing to the confusion.

The treaties were unpopular with many, and due to the continuing hostility, the Puget Sound War began shortly after, in 1855. The ancestral bands of the Muckleshoot joined the war against the American government. At the war&#x27;s conclusion, during the Fox Island Council, governor Stevens agreed to the establishment of a new reservation for groups who had not received a reservation under the prior treaties. At Fox Island, Stevens agreed that a reservation would be created in all the lands between the White and Green rivers, including Muckleshoot Prairie.

The Muckleshoot Reservation was eventually established on January 20, 1857 by an executive order from U.S. president Franklin Pierce. However, the reservation did not include all the land previously promised at the Fox Island Council, including traditional fishing and village sites. The reservation would be later expanded in 1874 by president Ulysses S. Grant.

=== Establishment of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe ===
In 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act allowed Native Americans living on reservations to establish their own governments. The peoples of the Muckleshoot Reservation voted to establish the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe. In 1936, they established a constitution and bylaws. Around this time, in 1937, the Muckleshoot Tribe had 194 enrolled members.

=== Fights for treaty rights ===

The Muckleshoot Tribe were denied their land claims in &quot;Duwamish Indians v. United States&quot;, on the basis that there was no treaty with the &quot;Muckleshoot&quot;. Later, however, in 1959, the Indian Claims Commission found that the ancestors of the Muckleshoot had possessed of land, valued at $86,377. On March 8, 1959, the Commission ordered that the Muckleshoot Tribe be paid that amount by the United States.

A large Army quartermaster depot was established in the Green River Valley at the south end of Auburn to take advantage of railways. It served the ports along Puget Sound, supporting the US war effort in the Pacific. In the post-World War II era, Auburn began to be more industrialized. Together with rapid population growth in the region, which developed many suburbs, these changes put pressure on the Muckleshoot and their reservation holdings. Many private land owners tried to prevent them from fishing and hunting in traditional territories.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Muckleshoot engaged in a series of protests, intended at protecting their fragile ecosystem. Known as the Fish Wars, these protests attempted to preserve Muckleshoot fishing rights in nearby rivers that were not within the official reservation. County and state authorities had tried to regulate their fishing off-reservation. Similarly, the state tried to regulate other tribes in their fishing along the coastal waters.

In the Boldt Decision, the federal district court upheld the right of the Muckleshoot and other Treaty peoples to fish from the rivers of the region and hunt in these territories. It ruled that the Native Americans had rights to half the catch in their traditional areas. It designated the Muckleshoot as co-managers of the King County watershed, with control over fishing and hunting in their &quot;Usual and Accustomed&quot; historical fishing and hunting grounds.

While this improved the tribe&#x27;s economic standing, the Muckleshoot were soon forced to contend with a sharp decline in the salmon population, due to the adverse effects on the environment, especially river water quality, of urbanization and industrialization. Dams on rivers had decreased the fish populations that could get upstream to spawn, and water quality in the rivers had declined. While they continue to fight for the preservation of the ancient salmon runs, the Muckleshoot also found other venues to improve their economy.

==Government and politics==
The Muckleshoot Tribe is beholden to their constitution, which was approved on May 13, 1936 and was ratified later that year, on October 21, 1936. The primary governing body is the Muckleshoot Tribal Council, a nine-member elected body. The Tribal Council is subject to the General Council, which is composed of all citizens of the Muckleshoot Tribe.

The Muckleshoot Tribe is a member of an intertribal court system, which was formed in 1978.

===Police===
The reservation falls under Public Law 280 jurisdiction, with police services supplied by both King County and Auburn. The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe contracts with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for police services. As an unincorporated jurisdiction, the Tribe already receives base-level police services from the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Deputies assigned to the Muckleshoot reservation include six patrol officers, one school resource officer, a storefront deputy, a Muckleshoot Housing Authority deputy and one police chief assigned full-time to the reservation.

== Muckleshoot Reservation ==
Most Muckleshoot citizens live on or near the Muckleshoot Reservation. The reservation is located between the White and Green rivers on Muckleshoot Prairie (), southeast of Auburn, Washington. The reservation is situated in parts of King and Pierce counties. Approximately 1,201 acres of the land on the reservation was in trust in 1975.

On November 6, 2013, the Muckleshoot Tribe bought of forest in Washington state to add to its landholdings.

== Demographics ==
As of 2023, the Muckleshoot Tribe has 3,353 enrolled members, of which 1,522 (±337) are of Muckleshoot ancestry alone. As of 2023, the Muckleshoot Reservation has a population of around 3,959 (±569), of which 1,421 (±194) are White, 73 (±50) are Black or African American, 1,103 (±290) are American Indian and Alaska Native, 171 (±114) are Asian, 96 (±102) are Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 373 (±151) are Some Other Race, and 722 (±216) are Two or More Races.

== Culture ==

The Muckleshoot speak the southern dialect of Lushootseed, called Whulshootseed. The specific variety of Southern Lushootseed spoken at Muckleshoot is called . Use of the language has declined, and English is now the majority language. However, the tribe has been engaging in revitalizing the language. Muckleshoot citizens Earnie Barr, Eva Jerry, Bertha McJoe, Bernice Tanewasha, and Ellen Williams were involved in creating a written form for Lushootseed.

The Muckleshoot Tribe holds Skopabsh Days each August, which is a three-day festival that features traditional arts, crafts, cooking, and clothing. Additionally, each July, the Muckleshoot Tribe hosts the Muckleshoot Sobriety Powwow.

In the First Salmon Ceremony, the entire community shares the flesh of a Spring Chinook. They return its remains to the river where it was caught. This is so the salmon can inform the other fish of how well it was received. The other ceremony for the first salmon is to roast it until it becomes ashes. The Muckleshoot toss the bones and ashes back into the water or stream where they took the salmon, believing that the fish would come alive again (be part of a round of new propagation).

== Economy and services ==
Most Muckleshoot citizens are employed by industries in the nearby city of Auburn, as well as by the tribal government. Others engage in fishing, logging, or agriculture on the reservation. The tribe manages fisheries and hatcheries, as well as a community center, community housing, a library, a medical and dental clinic, an educational training program, and a youth group program. In total, the tribe employs 1,200, and is the second-largest employer in southern King County.

=== Economic developments ===
The tribe won settlements from Puget Sound Power &amp; Light for the long-term effects of dam construction and the state government for imposing sales taxes on the reservation. It used proceeds from the settlements, as well as revenue from a bingo hall, to purchase more than of land on the reservation by 1995.

In 2006, the tribe made a $42 million agreement with the Seattle City Council for the conservation and protection of the Cedar River.

The Muckleshoot Tribe acquired the Salish Lodge at Snoqualmie Falls for $62.5 million in 2007. It sold the site to the Snoqualmie Tribe for $125 million in 2019.

Since 2019, the tribe has signed sponsorship agreements with the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners that include naming rights and jersey sponsorships. The Seattle Kraken began wearing a sponsorship patch with the Muckleshoot Tribe&#x27;s logo during the 2023–24 NHL season. It is believed to be the first sponsorship of a tribe—rather than an Indian casino—in major professional American sports.

=== Muckleshoot Casino ===
The Muckleshoot Tribe opened the Muckleshoot Casino in April 1995, following changes to Native American gaming laws. The casino and bingo parlor, built with a tropical theme, included an off-track horse racing betting area. Since then, the facility has been expanded four times. The White River Amphitheatre was developed by the tribe on land adjacent to the casino and opened in June 2003. Revenue from these ventures funded the construction of a new tribal medical facility, tribal administrative offices, and a new Indian Shaker church in the early 2000s. Twenty percent of all revenue from tribal gaming is spent on education.

The Muckleshoot Casino was expanded in January 2024 with the opening of an 18-story hotel with 401 rooms. The casino itself was expanded to ; a parking garage at the site opened in 2021.

=== Transportation ===
Since 2017, Muckleshoot Tribal Transit has offered free bus service on the reservation. The transit is funded by grants from the Federal Transit Administration and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

=== Education ===
Education for the tribe is conducted by Muckleshoot Child Care, Muckleshoot Tribal Schools, and the Muckleshoot Tribal College. Muckleshoot Tribal Schools started in 1984, and provides education which emphasizes Indigenous history, art, dance, and culture, as well as language. In 1997, MTS began offering all high-school grades. A modern, K-12 school opened in 2009, providing access to academic and cultural learning as well as 21st century technology. Students can earn an associates degree at Muckleshoot Tribal College.

<doc id="39683" wikidata="Q131258" url="?curid=39683" title="Banksia">
<text>Banksia is a genus of around 170 species of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These Australian wildflowers and popular garden plants are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes, and woody fruiting &quot;cones&quot; and heads. &quot;Banksias&quot; range in size from prostrate woody shrubs to trees up to 30 metres (100 ft) tall. They are found in a wide variety of landscapes: sclerophyll forest, (occasionally) rainforest, shrubland, and some more arid landscapes, though not in Australia&#x27;s deserts.

Heavy producers of nectar, banksias are a vital part of the food chain in the Australian bush. They are an important food source for nectarivorous animals, including birds, bats, rats, possums, stingless bees and a host of invertebrates. Further, they are of economic importance to Australia&#x27;s nursery and cut flower industries. However, these plants are threatened by a number of processes including land clearing, frequent burning and disease, and a number of species are rare and endangered.

==Description==

Banksias grow as trees or woody shrubs. Trees of the largest species, &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; (coast banksia) and &quot;B. seminuda&quot; (river banksia), often grow over 15 metres tall, some even grow to standing 30 metres tall. &quot;Banksia&quot; species that grow as shrubs are usually erect, but there are several species that are prostrate, with branches that grow on or below the soil.

The leaves of &quot;Banksia&quot; vary greatly between species. Sizes vary from the narrow, 1– centimetre long needle-like leaves of &quot;B. ericifolia&quot; (heath-leaved banksia), to the very large leaves of &quot;B. grandis&quot; (bull banksia), which may be up to 45 centimetres long. The leaves of most species have serrated edges, but a few, such as &quot;B. integrifolia&quot;, do not. Leaves are usually arranged along the branches in irregular spirals, but in some species they are crowded together in whorls. Many species have differing juvenile and adult leaves (e.g., &quot;Banksia integrifolia&quot; has large serrated juvenile leaves).

The flowers are arranged in flower spikes or capitate flower heads. The character most commonly associated with &quot;Banksia&quot; is the flower spike, an elongated inflorescence consisting of a woody axis covered in tightly packed pairs of flowers attached at right angles. A single flower spike generally contains hundreds or even thousands of flowers; the most recorded is around 6000 on inflorescences of &quot;B. grandis&quot;. Not all &quot;Banksia&quot; have an elongate flower spike, however: the members of the small &quot;Isostylis&quot; complex have long been recognised as &quot;banksias&quot; in which the flower spike has been reduced to a head; and recently the large genus &quot;Dryandra&quot; has been found to have arisen from within the ranks of &quot;Banksia&quot;, and sunk into it as &quot;B.&quot; ser. &quot;Dryandra&quot;. They similarly have capitate flower heads rather than spikes.
&quot;Banksia&quot; flowers are usually a shade of yellow, but orange, red, pink and even violet flowers also occur. The colour of the flowers is determined by the colour of the perianth parts and often the style. The style is much longer than the perianth, and is initially trapped by the upper perianth parts. These are gradually released over a period of days, either from top to bottom or from bottom to top. When the styles and perianth parts are different colours, the visual effect is of a colour change sweeping along the spike. This can be most spectacular in &quot;B. prionotes&quot; (acorn banksia) and related species, as the white inflorescence in bud becomes a brilliant orange. In most cases, the individual flowers are tall, thin saccate (sack-shaped) in shape.
Occasionally, multiple flower spikes can form. This is most often seen in &quot;Banksia marginata&quot; and &quot;B. ericifolia&quot; &quot;(pictured right)&quot;.
As the flower spikes or heads age, the flower parts dry up and may turn shades of orange, tan or dark brown colour, before fading to grey over a period of years. In some species, old flower parts are lost, revealing the axis; in others, the old flower parts may persist for many years, giving the fruiting structure a hairy appearance. Old flower spikes are commonly referred to as &quot;cones&quot;, although they are not technically cones according to the botanical definition of the term: cones only occur in conifers and cycads.

Despite the large number of flowers per inflorescence, only a few of them ever develop fruit, and in some species a flower spike will set no fruit at all. The fruit of &quot;Banksia&quot; is a woody follicle embedded in the axis of the inflorescence. In many species, the resulting structure is a massive woody structure commonly called a cone. Each follicle consists of two horizontal valves that tightly enclose the seeds. The follicle opens to release the seed by splitting along the suture. In some species, each valve splits too. In some species the follicles open as soon as the seed is mature, but in most species most follicles open only after stimulated to do so by bushfire. Each follicle usually contains one or two small seeds, each with a wedge-shaped papery wing that causes it to spin as it falls to the ground.

==Taxonomy==

Specimens of &quot;Banksia&quot; were first collected by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the &quot;Endeavour&quot; during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Cook landed on Australian soil for the first time on 29 April 1770, at a place that he later named Botany Bay in recognition of &quot;the great quantity of plants Mr Banks and Dr Solander found in this place&quot;. Over the next seven weeks, Banks and Solander collected thousands of plant specimens, including the first specimens of a new genus that would later be named &quot;Banksia&quot; in Banks&#x27; honour. Four species were present in this first collection: &quot;B. serrata&quot; (Saw Banksia), &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; (Coast Banksia), &quot;B. ericifolia&quot; (Heath-leaved Banksia) and &quot;B. robur&quot; (Swamp Banksia). In June the ship was careened at Endeavour River, where specimens of &quot;B. dentata&quot; (Tropical Banksia) were collected.

The genus &quot;Banksia&quot; was finally described and named by Carolus Linnaeus the Younger in his April 1782 publication &quot;Supplementum Plantarum&quot;; hence the full name for the genus is &quot;&quot;Banksia&quot; L.f.&quot;. Linnaeus placed the genus in class Tetrandra, order Monogynia of his father&#x27;s classification, and named it in honour of Banks. The name &quot;Banksia&quot; had in fact already been published in 1775 as &quot;Banksia&quot; J.R.Forst &amp; G.Forst, referring to some New Zealand species that the Forsters had collected during Cook&#x27;s second voyage. However Linnaeus incorrectly attributed the Forsters&#x27; specimens to the genus &quot;Passerina&quot;, and therefore considered the name &quot;Banksia&quot; available for use. By the time Joseph Gaertner corrected Banks&#x27; error in 1788, &quot;Banksia&quot; L.f. was widely known and accepted, so Gaertner renamed &quot;Banksia&quot; J.R.Forst, &amp; G.Forst to &quot;Pimelea&quot;, a name previously chosen for the genus by Banks and Solander.

The first specimens of a &quot;Dryandra&quot; were collected by Archibald Menzies, surgeon and naturalist to the Vancouver Expedition. At the request of Joseph Banks, Menzies collected natural history specimens wherever possible during the voyage. During September and October 1791, while the expedition were anchored at King George Sound, he collected numerous plant specimens, including the first specimens of &quot;Dryandra (&quot;now&quot; Banksia) sessilis&quot; (Parrotbush) and &quot;D. (&quot;now&quot; Banksia) pellaeifolia&quot;. Upon Menzies&#x27; return to England, he turned his specimens over to Banks; as with most other specimens in Banks&#x27; library, they remained undescribed for many years. Robert Brown gave a lecture, naming the new genus &quot;Dryandra&quot; in 1809, however Joseph Knight published the name &quot;Josephia&quot; before Brown published his paper with the description of &quot;Dryandra&quot;. Brown ignored Knight&#x27;s name, as did subsequent botanists.

In 1891, Otto Kuntze, strictly applying the principle of priority, argued that &quot;Pimelea&quot; should revert to the name &quot;Banksia&quot; J.R.Forst &amp; G.Forst. He proposed the new genus &quot;Sirmuellera&quot; to replaced &quot;Banksia&quot; L.f. and transferred its species to the new genus. This arrangement was largely ignored by Kuntze&#x27;s contemporaries.&quot;Banksia&quot; L.f. was formally conserved and &quot;Sirmuellera&quot; rejected in 1940.

&quot;Banksia&quot; belongs to the family Proteaceae, subfamily Grevilleoideae, and tribe Banksieae. There are around 170 species. The closest relatives of &quot;Banksia&quot; are two genera of rainforest trees in North Queensland (&quot;Musgravea&quot; and &quot;Austromuellera&quot;).

===Subgeneric arrangement===
Alex George arranged the genus into two subgenera—subgenus &quot;Isostylis&quot; (containing &quot;B. ilicifolia&quot;, &quot;B. oligantha&quot; and &quot;B. cuneata&quot;) and subgenus &quot;Banksia&quot; (containing all other species except those he considered dryandras)—in his 1981 monograph and 1999 treatment for the Flora of Australia series. He held that flower morphology was the key to relationships in the genus. Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele published the official merging of &quot;Dryandra&quot; within &quot;Banksia&quot; in 2007, recalibrating the genus into subgenus &quot;Banksia&quot; and subgenus &quot;Spathulatae&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
All but one of the living &quot;Banksia&quot; species are endemic to Australia. The exception is &quot;B. dentata&quot; (tropical banksia), which occurs throughout northern Australia, and on islands to the north including New Guinea and the Aru Islands. An extinct species, &quot;B. novae-zelandiae&quot;, was found in New Zealand. The other species occur in two distinct geographical regions: southwest Western Australia and eastern Australia. Southwest Western Australia is the main centre of biodiversity; over 90% of all &quot;Banksia&quot; species occur only there, from Exmouth in the north, south and east to beyond Esperance on the south coast. Eastern Australia has far fewer species, but these include some of best known and most widely distributed species, including &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; (coast banksia) and &quot;B. spinulosa&quot; (hairpin banksia). Here they occur from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia right around the east coast up to Cape York in Queensland.

The vast majority of &quot;Banksia&quot; are found in sandy or gravelly soils, though some populations of &quot;B. marginata&quot; (silver banksia) and &quot;B. spinulosa&quot; do occur on soil that is heavier and more clay-like. &quot;B. seminuda&quot; is exceptional for its preference for rich loams along watercourses.

Most occur in heathlands or low woodlands; of the eastern species, &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; and &quot;B. marginata&quot; occur in forests; many south-western species such as &quot;B. grandis&quot;, &quot;B. sphaerocarpa&quot;, &quot;B. sessilis&quot;, &quot;B. nobilis&quot; and &quot;B. dallanneyi&quot; grow as understorey plants in jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;), wandoo (&quot;E. wandoo&quot;) and karri (&quot;E. diversicolor&quot;) forests, with &quot;B. seminuda&quot; being one of the forest trees in suitable habitat.

Most species do not grow well near the coast, notable exceptions being the southern Western Australian species &quot;B. speciosa&quot;, &quot;B. praemorsa&quot; and &quot;B. repens&quot;. Only a few species, such as &quot;B. rosserae&quot; and &quot;B. elderiana&quot; (swordfish banksia), occur in arid areas. Most of the eastern Australian species survive in uplands, but only a few of the Western Australian species native to the Stirling Ranges – &quot;B. solandri&quot;, &quot;B. oreophila&quot;, &quot;B. brownii&quot; and &quot;B. montana&quot; – survive at high elevations.

Studies of the south-western species have found the distribution of &quot;Banksia&quot; species to be primarily constrained by rainfall. With the exception of &quot;B. rosserae&quot;, no species tolerates annual rainfall of less than 200 millimetres, despite many species surviving in areas that receive less than 400 millimetres. &quot;Banksia&quot; species are present throughout the region of suitable rainfall, with greatest speciation in cooler, wetter areas. Hotter, drier regions around the edges of its range tend to have fewer species with larger distributions. The greatest species richness occurs in association with uplands, especially the Stirling Range.

== Evolutionary history and fossil record ==
There are many fossils of &quot;Banksia&quot;. The oldest of these are fossil pollen between 65 and 59 million years old. There are fossil leaves between 59 and 56 million years old found in southern New South Wales. The oldest fossil cones are between 47.8 and 41.2 million years old, found in Western Australia. Although &quot;Banksia&quot; is now only native to Australia and New Guinea, there are fossils from New Zealand, between 21 and 25 million years old.

Evolutionary scientists Marcell Cardillo and Renae Pratt have proposed a southwest Australian origin for banksias despite their closest relatives being north Queensland rainforest species.

==Ecology==
Banksias are heavy producers of nectar, making them an important source of food for nectivorous animals, including honeyeaters and small mammals such as rodents, antechinus, honey possums, pygmy possums, gliders and bats. Many of these animals play a role in pollination of &quot;Banksia&quot;. Various studies have shown mammals and birds to be important pollinators. In 1978, Carpenter observed that some banksias had a stronger odour at night, possibly to attract nocturnal mammal pollinators. Other associated fauna include the larvae of moths (such as the Dryandra Moth) and weevils, which burrow into the &quot;cones&quot; to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and birds such as cockatoos, who break off the &quot;cones&quot; to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.

A number of &quot;Banksia&quot; species are considered rare or endangered. These include &quot;B. brownii&quot; (feather-leaved banksia), &quot;B. cuneata&quot; (matchstick banksia), &quot;B. goodii&quot; (Good&#x27;s banksia), &quot;B. oligantha&quot; (Wagin banksia), &quot;B. tricuspis&quot; (pine banksia), and &quot;B. verticillata&quot; (granite banksia).

===Response to fire===
&quot;Banksia&quot; plants are naturally adapted to the presence of regular bushfires in the Australian landscape. About half of &quot;Banksia&quot; species are killed by bushfire, but these regenerate quickly from seed, as fire also stimulates the opening of seed-bearing follicles and the germination of seed in the ground. The remaining species usually survive bushfire, either by resprouting from a woody base known as a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. In Western Australia, banksias of the first group are known as &#x27;seeders&#x27; and the second group as &#x27;sprouters&#x27;.
Infrequent bushfires at expected intervals pose no threat, and are in fact beneficial for regeneration of &quot;banksia&quot; populations. However, too frequent bushfires can seriously reduce or even eliminate populations from certain areas, by killing seedlings and young plants before they reach fruiting age. Many fires near urban areas are caused by arson, and thus the frequency is often much higher than fires would have been prior to human habitation. Furthermore, residents who live in areas near bushland may pressure local councils to burn areas near homes more frequently, to reduce fuel-load in the bush and thus reduce ferocity of future fires. Unfortunately there are often discrepancies in agreed frequency between these groups and conservation groups.

===Dieback===
Another threat to &quot;Banksia&quot; is the water mould &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, commonly known as &quot;dieback&quot;. Dieback attacks the roots of plants, destroying the structure of the root tissues, &quot;rotting&quot; the root, and preventing the plant from absorbing water and nutrients. &quot;Banksia&quot;&#x27;s proteoid roots, which help it to survive in low-nutrient soils, make it highly susceptible to this disease. All Western Australian species are vulnerable, although most eastern species are fairly resistant.

Vulnerable plants typically die within a few years of infection. In southwest Western Australia, where dieback infestation is widespread, infested areas of &quot;Banksia&quot; forest typically have less than 30% of the cover of uninfested areas. Plant deaths in such large proportions can have a profound influence on the makeup of plant communities. For example, in southwestern Australia &quot;Banksia&quot; often occurs as an understorey to forests of jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;), another species highly vulnerable to dieback. Infestation kills both the jarrah overstorey and the original &quot;Banksia&quot; understorey, and over time these may be replaced by a more open woodland consisting of an overstorey of the resistant marri (&quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;), and an understorey of the somewhat resistant &quot;Banksia sessilis&quot; (parrot bush).

A number of species of &quot;Banksia&quot; are threatened by dieback. Nearly every known wild population of &quot;B. brownii&quot; shows some signs of dieback infection, which could possibly wipe it out within years. Other vulnerable species include &quot;B. cuneata&quot;, and &quot;B. verticillata&quot;.

Dieback is notoriously difficult to treat, although there has been some success with phosphite and phosphorous acid, which are currently used to inoculate wild &quot;B. brownii&quot; populations. However this is not without potential problems as it alters the soil composition by adding phosphorus. Some evidence suggests that phosphorous acid may inhibit proteoid root formation.

Because dieback thrives in moist soil conditions, it can be a severe problem for banksias that are watered, such as in the cut flower industry and urban gardens.

==Uses==

===Gardening===
Most of species are shrubs, only few of them can be found as trees and they are very popular because of their size, the tallest species are: &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; having its subspecies &quot;B. integrifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;monticola&quot; notable for reaching the biggest size for the genus and it is the most frost tolerant in this genus, &quot;B. seminuda&quot;, &quot;B. littoralis&quot;, &quot;B. serrata&quot;; species that can grow as small trees or big shrubs: &quot;B. grandis&quot;, &quot;B. prionotes&quot;, &quot;B. marginata&quot;, &quot;B. coccinea&quot;, &quot;B. speciosa&quot; and &quot;B. menziesii&quot;. Due to their size these species are popularly planted in parks, gardens and streets, the remaining species in this genus are only shrubs.

Banksias are popular garden plants in Australia because of their large, showy flower heads, and because the large amounts of nectar they produce attracts birds and small mammals. Popular garden species include &quot;B. spinulosa&quot;, &quot;B. ericifolia&quot;, &quot;B. aemula&quot; (Wallum Banksia ), &quot;B. serrata&quot; (Saw Banksia), &quot;Banksia media&quot; (Southern Plains Banksia) and the cultivar &quot;Banksia&quot; &#x27;Giant Candles&#x27;. &quot;Banksia&quot; species are primarily propagated by seed in the home garden as cuttings can be difficult to strike. However, commercial nurserymen extensively utilize the latter method (indeed, cultivars by nature must be vegetatively propagated by cuttings or grafting).

Over time, dwarf cultivars and prostrate species are becoming more popular as urban gardens grow ever smaller. These include miniature forms under 50 cm high of &quot;B. spinulosa&quot; and &quot;B. media&quot;, as well as prostrate species such as &quot;B. petiolaris&quot; and &quot;B. blechnifolia&quot;.

Banksias possibly require more maintenance than other Australian natives, though are fairly hardy if the right conditions are provided (sunny aspect and well drained sandy soil).
They may need extra water during dry spells until established, which can take up to two years. If fertilised, only slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer should be used, as the proteoid roots may be damaged by high nutrient levels in the soil. All respond well to some form of pruning.

Within the Australian horticultural community there is an active subculture of &quot;Banksia&quot; enthusiasts who seek out interesting flower variants, breed and propagate cultivars, exchange materials and undertake research into cultivation problems and challenges. The main forum for exchange of information within this group is ASGAP&#x27;s &quot;Banksia Study Group&quot;.

===Cut flower industry===
With the exception of the nursery industry, &quot;Banksia&quot; have limited commercial use. Some species, principally &quot;B. coccinea&quot; (scarlet banksia), &quot;B. baxteri&quot;, &quot;B. hookeriana&quot; (Hooker&#x27;s banksia), &quot;B. sceptrum&quot; (sceptre banksia), and &quot;B. prionotes&quot; (acorn banksia), and less commonly &quot;B. speciosa&quot; (showy banksia), &quot;B. menziesii&quot; (Menzies&#x27; banksia), &quot;B. burdettii&quot; and &quot;B. ashbyi&quot; are grown on farms in Western and Southern Australia, as well as Israel and Hawaii, and the flower heads harvested for the cut flower trade. Eastern species, such as &quot;B. ericifolia&quot;, &quot;B. robur&quot; and &quot;B. plagiocarpa&quot;, are sometimes cultivated for this purpose. The nectar is also sought by beekeepers, not for the quality of the dark-coloured honey, which is often poor, but because the trees provide an abundant and reliable source of nectar at times when other sources provide little.
===Woodworking===
&quot;Banksia&quot; wood is reddish in color with an attractive grain but it is rarely used as it warps badly on drying. It is occasionally used for ornamental purposes in wood turning and cabinet paneling. It has also been used to make keels for small boats. Historically, the wood of certain species such as &quot;B. serrata&quot; was used for yokes and boat parts. The large &quot;cones&quot; or seed pods of &quot;B. grandis&quot; are used for woodturning projects. They are also sliced up and sold as drink coasters; these are generally marketed as souvenirs for international tourists. Woodturners throughout the world value &quot;Banksia&quot; pods for making ornamental objects.

===Indigenous uses===
The Indigenous people of south-western Australia would suck on the flower spikes to obtain the nectar, they also soaked the flower spikes in water to make a sweet drink. The Noongar people of southwest Western Australia also used infusions of the flower spikes to relieve coughs and sore throats. The Girai wurrung peoples of the western district of Victoria used the spent flower cones to strain water by placing the cones in their mouths and using them like a straw. &quot;Banksia&quot; trees are a reliable source of insect larvae which are extracted as food.

==Cultural references==
===Field guides and other technical resources===

A number of field guides and other semi-technical books on the genus have been published. These include:
;Field Guide to Banksias
:Written by Ivan Holliday and Geoffrey Watton and first published in 1975, this book contained descriptions and colour photographs of species known at the time. It was largely outdated by the publication of Alex George&#x27;s classic 1981 monograph, but a revised and updated second edition was released in 1990.

;&quot;The Banksias&quot;
:This three volume monograph contains watercolour paintings of every &quot;Banksia&quot; species by renowned botanical illustrator Celia Rosser, with accompanying text by Alex George. Its publication represents the first time that such a large genus has been entirely painted. Published by Academic Press in association with Monash University, the three volumes were published in 1981, 1988 and 2000 respectively.

;The &quot;Banksia&quot; Book
:Begun by Australian photographer Fred Humphreys and Charles Gardner, both of whom died before its completion, &quot;The Banksia Book&quot; was eventually completed by Alex George and first published in 1984. It included every species known at the time, with a second edition appearing in 1987 and third in 1996.

;The &quot;Banksia&quot; Atlas
:In 1983 the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) decided to pilot an Australia-wide distribution study of a significant plant genus. &quot;Banksia&quot; was chosen because it was a high-profile, widely distributed genus that was easily identified, but for which distribution and habitat was poorly known. The study mobilised over 400 volunteers, collecting over 25,000 field observations over a two-year period. Outcomes included the discovery of two new species, as well as new varieties and some rare colour variants, and discoveries of previously unknown populations of rare and threatened species. The collated data was used to create &quot;The Banksia Atlas&quot;, which was first published in 1988.

;Banksias, Waratahs and Grevilleas and all other plants in the Australian Proteaceae family
:Written by J. W. Wrigley and M. Fagg, this was published by Collins Publishers in 1989. A comprehensive text on all the Proteaceae genera with good historical notes and an overview of the 1975 Johnson &amp; Briggs classification. It is out of print and hard to find.

===May Gibb&#x27;s &quot;Banksia men&quot;===

Perhaps the best known cultural reference to &quot;Banksia&quot; is the &quot;big bad Banksia men&quot; of May Gibbs&#x27; children&#x27;s book &quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot;. Gibb&#x27;s &quot;Banksia men&quot; are modelled on the appearance of aged &quot;Banksia&quot; &quot;cones&quot;, with follicles for eyes and other facial features. There is some contention over which species actually provided the inspiration for the &quot;Banksia men&quot;: the drawings most resemble the old cones of &quot;B. aemula&quot; or &quot;B. serrata&quot;, but &quot;B. attenuata&quot; (slender banksia) has also been cited, as this was the species that Gibbs saw as a child in Western Australia.

===Other cultural references===
In 1989, the Banksia Environmental Foundation was created to support and recognise people and organizations that make a positive contribution to the environment. The Foundation launched the annual Banksia Environmental Awards in the same year.

Announced in June 2023, the exoplanet WASP-19b was named &quot;Banksia&quot; in the third NameExoWorlds competition. The approved name was proposed by a team from Brandon Park Primary School in Wheelers Hill (Melbourne, Australia), led by scientist Lance Kelly and teacher David Maierhofer, after various types of &quot;Banksia&quot; plants.

<text>Figure skating jumps are an element of three competitive figure skating disciplines: men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, and pair skatingbut not ice dancing. Jumping in figure skating is &quot;relatively recent&quot;. They were originally individual compulsory figures, and sometimes special figures; many jumps were named after the skaters who invented them or from the figures from which they were developed. It was not until the early part of the 20th century, well after the establishment of organized skating competitions, when jumps with the potential of being completed with multiple revolutions were invented and when jumps were formally categorized. In the 1920s Austrian skaters began to perform the first double jumps in practice. Skaters experimented with jumps, and by the end of the period, the modern repertoire of jumps had been developed. Jumps did not have a major role in free skating programs during international competitions until the 1930s. During the post-war period and into the 1950s and early 1960s, triple jumps became more common for both male and female skaters, and a full repertoire of two-revolution jumps had been fully developed. In the 1980s men were expected to complete four or five difficult triple jumps, and women had to perform the easier triples. By the 1990s, after compulsory figures were removed from competitions, multi-revolution jumps became more important in figure skating.

The six most common jumps can be divided into two groups: toe jumps (the toe loop, the flip, and the Lutz) and edge jumps (the Salchow, the loop, and the Axel). The Euler jump, which was known as a half-loop before 2018, is an edge jump. Jumps are also classified by the number of revolutions. Pair skaters perform two types of jumps: side-by-side jumps, in which jumps are accomplished side by side and in unison, and throw jumps, in which the woman performs the jump when assisted and propelled by her partner.

According to the International Skating Union (ISU), jumps must have the following characteristics to earn the most points: they must have &quot;very good height and very good length&quot;; they must be executed effortlessly, including the rhythm demonstrated during jump combinations; and they must have good takeoffs and landings. The following are not required, but also taken into consideration: there must be steps executed before the beginning of the jump, or it must have either a creative or unexpected entry; the jump must match the music; and the skater must have, from the jump&#x27;s takeoff to its landing, a &quot;very good body position&quot;. A jump combination is executed when a skater&#x27;s landing foot of the first jump is also the takeoff foot of the following jump. All jumps are considered in the order they are completed. Pair teams, both juniors and seniors, must perform one solo jump during their short programs.

Jumps are divided into eight parts: the set-up, load, transition, pivot, takeoff, flight, landing, and exit. All jumps except the Axel and waltz jumps are taken off while skating backward; Axels and waltz jumps are entered into by skating forward. A skater&#x27;s body absorbs up to 13–14 g-forces each time he or she lands from a jump, which may contribute to overuse injuries and stress fractures. Skaters add variations or unusual entries and exits to jumps to increase difficulty. Factors such as angular momentum, the moment of inertia, angular acceleration, and the skater&#x27;s center of mass determines if a jump is successfully completed.

==History==
According to figure skating historian James R. Hines, jumping in figure skating is &quot;relatively recent&quot;. Jumps were viewed as &quot;acrobatic tricks, not as a part of a skater&#x27;s art&quot; and &quot;had no place&quot; in the skating practices in England during the 19th century, although skaters experimented with jumps from the ice during the last 25 years of the 1800s. Hops, or jumps without rotations, were done for safety reasons, to avoid obstacles, such as hats, barrels, and tree logs, on natural ice. In 1881 &quot;Spuren Auf Dem Eise&quot; (&quot;Tracing on the Ice&quot;), &quot;a monumental publication describing the state of skating in Vienna&quot;, briefly mentioned jumps, describing three jumps in two pages. Jumping on skates was a part of the athletic side of free skating, and was considered inappropriate for female skaters.

Hines says free skating movements such as spirals, spread eagles, spins, and jumps were originally individual compulsory figures, and sometimes special figures. For example, Norwegian skater Axel Paulsen, whom Hines calls &quot;progressive&quot;, performed the first jump in competition, the Axel, which was named after him, at the first international competition in 1882, as a special figure. Jumps were also related to their corresponding figure; for example, the loop jump. Other jumps, such as the Axel and the Salchow, were named after the skaters who invented them. It was not until the early part of the 20th century, well after the establishment of organized skating competitions, when jumps with the potential of being completed with multiple revolutions were invented and when jumps were formally categorized. These jumps became elements in athletic free skating programs, but they were not worth more points than no-revolution jumps and half-jumps. In the 1920s Austrian skaters began to perform the first double jumps in practice and refine rotations in the Axel. Skaters experimented with jumps, and by the end of the period, the modern repertoire of jumps had been developed.

Jumps did not have a major role in free skating programs during international competitions until the 1930s. Athleticism in the sport increased between the world wars, especially by women like Norwegian world and Olympic champion Sonia Henie, who popularized short skirts which allowed female skaters to maneuver and perform jumps. When international competitions were interrupted by World WarII, double jumps by both men and women had become commonplace, and all jumps, except for the Axel, were being doubled. According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum the development of rotational technique required for Axels and double jumps continued, especially in the United States and Czechoslovakia. Post-war skaters, according to Hines, &quot;pushed the envelope of jumping to extremes that skaters of the 1930s would not have thought possible&quot;. For example, world champion Felix Kasper from Austria was well known for his athletic jumps, which were the longest and highest in the history of figure skating. Hines reported that his Axel measured four feet high and 25 feet from takeoff to landing. Both men and women, including women skaters from Great Britain, were doubling Salchows and loops in their competition programs.

During the post-war period, American skater Dick Button, who &quot;intentionally tried to bring a greater athleticism to men&#x27;s skating&quot;, performed the first double Axel in competition in 1948 and the first triple jump, a triple loop, in 1952. Triple jumps, especially triple Salchows, became more common for male skaters during the 1950s and early 1960s, and female skaters, especially in North America, included a full repertoire of two-revolution jumps. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, men commonly performed triple Salchows and women regularly performed double Axels in competitions. Men would also include more difficult multi-revolution jumps like triple flips, Lutzes, and loops; women included triple Salchows and toe loops. In the 1980s men were expected to complete four or five difficult triple jumps, and women had to perform the easier triples such as the loop jump. By the 1990s, after compulsory figures were removed from competitions, multi-revolution jumps became more important in figure skating. According to Kestnbaum, jumps like the triple Lutz became more important during women&#x27;s skating competitions. The last time a woman won a gold medal at the Olympics without a triple jump was Dorothy Hamill at the 1976 Olympics. 

Progress in women&#x27;s single skating in the 2010s is associated with the rapid increase in the technical complexity of programs. Alina Zagitova, representing Eteri Tutberidze&#x27;s team from Russia, claimed victory at the 2018 Winter Olympics with a performance that approached the theoretical limit of a program without triple axels and quadruple jumps. Following this, the next generation of figure skaters, such as Rika Kihira from Japan and Alena Kostornaia (Tutberidze team), began setting records by incorporating the triple axel into their programs. According to sports reporter Dvora Meyers, the &quot;quad revolution in women&#x27;s figure skating&quot; began in 2018, when Kostornaia&#x27;s timmate Alexandra Trusova began performing a quadruple Salchow when she was still competing as a junior. She became the first female skater to successfully land a quadruple Lutz, a quadruple flip, and a quadruple toe loop. As of current (February 2025), the International Skating Union continues to enforce its ban on Russian athletes from international competitions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Despite this, the ISU&#x27;s official press (ISU Figure Skating Media Guide 2024/25) acknowledges Russian figure skater Adeliia Petrosian, one more member of Eteri Tutberidze&#x27;s team, by listing her as the first female skater to land a quadruple Rittberger. However, it clarifies that this accomplishment was achieved in domestic competitions.

American skater Ilia Malinin is the first and only person to successfully land a fully rotated quadruple Axel in international competition, a jump widely regarded as the most difficult in figure skating.

==Types of jumps==
:Anomalies in the takeoff and landing are highlighted in bold and italic.
:All basic figure skating jumps are landed backwards.
The six most common jumps can be divided into two groups: toe jumps (the toe loop, the flip, and the Lutz) and edge jumps (the Salchow, the loop, and the Axel). The Euler jump, which was known as a half-loop before 2018, is an edge jump. Toe jumps tend to be higher than edge jumps because skaters press the toe pick of their skate into the ice on takeoff. Both feet are on the ice at the time of takeoff, and the toe-pick in the ice at takeoff acts as a pole vault. It is impossible to add a half-revolution to toe jumps.

Skaters accomplish edge jumps by leaving the ice from any of their skates&#x27; four possible edges; lift is &quot;achieved from the spring gained by straightening of a bent knee in combination with a swing of the free leg&quot;. They require precise rotational control of the skater&#x27;s upper body, arms, and free leg, and of how well he or she leans into the takeoff edge. The preparation going into the jump and its takeoff, as well as controlling the rotation of the preparation and takeoff, must be precisely timed. When a skater executes an edge jump, they must extend their leg and use their arms more than when they execute toe jumps.

Jumps are also classified by the number of revolutions. For example, all single jumps, except for the Axel, include one revolution, double jumps include two revolution, and so on. More revolutions earn skaters earn more points. Double and triple versions have increased in importance &quot;as a measure of technical and athletic ability, with attention paid to clean takeoffs and landings&quot;. Pair skaters perform two types of jumps: side-by-side jumps, in which jumps are accomplished side by side and in unison, and throw jumps, in which the woman performs the jump when assisted and propelled by her partner.

===Euler===
The Euler is an edge jump. It was known as the half-loop jump in International Skating Union (ISU) regulations prior to the 2018–2019 season, when the name was changed. In Europe, the Euler is also called the Thorén jump, after its inventor, Swedish figure skater Per Thorén. The Euler is executed when a skater takes off from the back outside edge of one skate and lands on the opposite foot and edge. It is most commonly done prior to the third jump during a three-jump combination, and serves as a way to put a skater on the correct edge in order to attempt a Salchow jump or a flip jump. It can be accomplished only as a single jump. The Euler has a base point value of 0.50 points, when used in combination between two listed jumps, and also becomes a listed jump.

===Toe loop===
The toe loop jump is the simplest jump in figure skating. It was invented in the 1920s by American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes. In competition the base value of a single toe loop is 0.40; the base value of a double toe loop is 1.30; the base value of a triple toe loop is 4.20; and the base value of a quadruple toe loop is 9.50.

The toe loop is considered the simplest jump because not only do skaters use their toe-picks to execute it, their hips are already facing the direction in which they will rotate. The toe loop is the easier jump to add multiple rotations to because the toe-assisted takeoff adds power to the jump and because a skater can turn his or her body towards the assisting foot at takeoff, which slightly reduces the rotation needed in the air. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations, and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump, as well as &quot;the most commonly cheated on take off jump&quot;, or a jump in which the first rotation starts on the ice rather than in the air. Adding a toe loop to combination jumps does not increase the difficulty of skaters&#x27; short or free skating programs.

===Flip===
The ISU defines a flip jump as &quot;a toe jump that takes off from a back inside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the opposite foot&quot;. It is executed with assistance from the toe of the free foot. In competition the base value of a single flip is 0.50; the base value of a double flip is 1.80; the base value of a triple flip is 5.30; and the base value of a quadruple flip is 11.00.

===Lutz===
The ISU defines the Lutz jump as &quot;a toe-pick assisted jump with an entrance from a back outside edge and landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot&quot;. It is the second-most difficult jump in figure skating and &quot;probably the second-most famous jump after the Axel&quot;. It is named after figure skater Alois Lutz from Vienna, Austria, who first performed it in 1913. In competition the base value of a single Lutz is 0.60; the base value of a double Lutz is 2.10; the base value of a triple Lutz is 5.90; and the base value of a quadruple Lutz is 11.50. A &quot;cheated&quot; Lutz jump without an outside edge is commonly called a &quot;flutz&quot;.
===Salchow===
The Salchow jump is an edge jump. It was named after its inventor, Ulrich Salchow, in 1909. The Salchow is accomplished with a takeoff from the back inside edge of one foot and a landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. It is &quot;usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple&quot;. Timing is critical because both the takeoff and the landing must be on the backward edge. A Salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice.

In competition the base value of a single Salchow is 0.40; the base value of a double Salchow is 1.30; the base value of a triple Salchow is 4.30; and the base value of a quadruple Salchow is 9.70.

===Loop===
The loop jump is an edge jump. It was believed to be created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is known as the Rittberger in Russian and German. It also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice. According to U.S. Figure Skating, the loop jump is &quot;the most fundamental of all the jumps&quot;. The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. It is often performed as the second jump in a combination.

In competition the base value of the single loop jump is 0.50; the base value of a double loop is 1.70; the base value of a triple loop is 4.90; and the base value of a quadruple loop is 10.50.

===Axel===
The Axel jump, also called the Axel Paulsen jump for its creator, Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen, is an edge jump. It is figure skating&#x27;s oldest and most difficult jump. The Axel jump is the most studied jump in figure skating. It is the only jump that begins with a forward takeoff, which makes it the easiest jump to identify. A double or triple Axel is required in the short program and an Axel is required in the free program for junior and senior single skaters in all ISU competitions. 

The Axel has an extra half-rotation which, as figure skating expert Hannah Robbins says, makes a triple Axel &quot;more a quadruple jump than a triple&quot;. Sports reporter Nora Princiotti says, about the triple Axel, &quot;It takes incredible strength and body control for a skater to get enough height and to get into the jump fast enough to complete all the rotations before landing with a strong enough base to absorb the force generated.&quot; According to American skater Mirai Nagasu, &quot;Falling on the triple Axel is really brutal.&quot;

In competition the base value of a single Axel is 1.10; the base value of a double Axel is 3.30; the base value of a triple Axel is 8.00; and the base value of a quadruple Axel is 12.50. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the triple Axel has become more common for male skaters to perform; however, as of 2022, the quadruple Axel has been landed at two international competitions by American skater Ilia Malinin.

==Rules and regulations==
===Single skating===
The International Skating Union defines a jump element for both single skating and pair skating disciplines as &quot;an individual jump, a jump combination or a jump sequence&quot;. Jumps are not allowed in ice dance.

Also according to the ISU, jumps must have the following characteristics to earn the most points: they must have &quot;very good height and very good length&quot;; they must be executed effortlessly, including the rhythm demonstrated during jump combinations; and they must have good takeoffs and landings. The following are not required, but also taken into consideration: there must be steps executed before the beginning of the jump, or it must have either a creative or unexpected entry; the jump must match the music; and the skater must have, from the jump&#x27;s takeoff to its landing, a &quot;very good body position&quot;. 

A jump sequence consists of &quot;two or three jumps of any number of revolutions, in which the second and/or the third jump is an Axel type jump with a direct step from the landing curve of the first/second jump in to the take-off curve of the Axel jump&quot;. The free foot can touch the ice, but there must be no weight transfer on it and if the skater makes one full revolution between the jumps, the element continues to be deemed a jump sequence and receives their full value. Prior to the 2022-23 rule changes, the skater received only 80% of the base value of the jumps executed in a jump sequence. Both a jump combination and jump sequence can &quot;consist of the same or another single, double, triple or quadruple jump&quot;. In their free skating programs, skaters can include up to three jump combinations in their free skating programs; one jump combination or jump sequence can include up to three jumps, while the other two can include up to two jumps each.
All jumps are considered in the order they are completed. If an extra jump or jumps are executed, the extra jump(s) not in accordance with requirements will have no value. The limitation on the number of jumps skaters can perform in their programs, called the &quot;Zayak Rule&quot; after American skater Elaine Zayak, has been in effect since 1983, after Zayak performed six triple jumps, four toe loop jumps, and two Salchows in her free skating program at the 1982 World Championships. Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum says the ISU established the rule &quot;in order to encourage variety and balance rather than allowing a skater to rack up credit for demonstrating the same skill over and over&quot;. Kestnbaum also says that as rotations in jumps for both men and women have increased skaters have increased the difficulty of jumps by adding more difficult combinations and by adding difficult steps immediately before or after their jumps, resulting in &quot;integrating the jumps more seamlessly into the flow of the program&quot;.

In the Short Program and Free Skating of Single Skating the Base Values (but not the GOEs) for jump Elements started in the second half of the program will be multiplied by a special factor 1.1 in order to give credit for even distribution of difficulties in the program. However, only the last jump element executed in the second half counts for the 1.1 factor in the Short Program, and the last three jump elements for Free Skating. &quot;International Figure Skating&quot; magazine called this regulation the &quot;Zagitova Rule&quot;, named for Alina Zagitova from Russia, who won the gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics by &quot;backloading&quot; her free skating program, or placing all her jumps in the second half of the program in order to take advantage of the rule in place at the time that awarded a ten percent bonus to jumps performed during the second half of the program. Also starting in 2018, single skaters could repeat the same two triple or quadruple jumps only in their free skating programs. They could repeat four-revolutions jumps only once, and the base value of the triple Axel and quadruple jumps were &quot;reduced dramatically&quot;. As of 2022, jump sequences consisted of two or three jumps, but the second or third jump had to be an Axel. Jump sequences began to be counted for their full value and skaters could include single jumps in their step sequences as choreographic elements without incurring a penalty.

Junior men and women single skaters are not allowed to perform quadruple jumps in their short programs. Senior and junior men and senior women must complete either a double or triple Axel jump in their short programs, but junior women must complete a double axel. Male and female junior and senior skaters must include a &quot;maximum of seven jump elements (one of which must be an Axel type jump)&quot; in their free skating programs. Both junior and senior skaters receive no points for jumps performed during their short programs that do not satisfy the requirements, including completing the wrong number of revolutions.

===Pair skating===

Pair teams, both juniors and seniors, must perform one solo jump during their short programs; it can include a double Lutz or double Axel for juniors, or any kind of double or triple jump for seniors. In the free skating program, for both juniors and seniors, skaters are limited to a maximum of one jump combination or sequence. A jump sequence consists of two or three jumps of any number of revolutions, in which the second and/or the third jump is an Axel type jump. Jumps during the short program which do not satisfy the requirements (including the wrong number of revolutions) will have no value. In the Free Skate, in case of unequal number of revolutions of partners in a jump performed as a solo jump or part of a combo or a sequence, this jump will be called as a jump with the lesser number of revolutions executed by the partners. The Judges will reflect the mistake in their GOE. In the Free Skate, all jumps executed with more than 2 revolutions (double Axel and all triple and quadruple jumps) must be of a different nature (different name); however the jump combination or sequence can include two same such jumps. The Short Program for the season 2023–24 must include one solo jump.

Throw jumps are &quot;partner-assisted jumps in which the woman is thrown into the air by the man on the takeoff and lands without assistance from her partner on a backward outside edge&quot;. Skate Canada says, &quot;The male partner assists the female into flight.&quot; The types of throw jumps include: the throw Axel, the throw Salchow, the throw toe loop, the throw loop, the throw flip, and the throw Lutz. The throw triple Axel is a difficult throw to accomplish because the woman must perform three-and-one-half revolutions after being thrown by the man, a half-revolution more than other triple jumps, and because it requires a forward takeoff. The speed of the team&#x27;s entry into the throw jump and the number of rotations performed increases its difficulty, as well as the height and/or distance they create. Pair teams must perform one throw jump during their short programs; senior teams can perform any double or triple throw jump, and junior teams must perform a double or triple toe loop. If the throw jump is not done correctly, including if it has the wrong number of revolutions, it receives no value. A well-balanced Free Skating program must contain a maximum of 2 different Throw Jumps (different name and/or different number of revolutions). A throw jump is judged as a jump with a higher number of revolution if it is over-rotated more than a quarter revolution; for example, if a pair attempts a double throw jump but over-rotates it, the judges record it as a downgraded triple throw jump.

==Execution==
According to Kestbaum, jumps are divided into eight parts: the set-up, load, transition, pivot, takeoff, flight, landing, and exit. All jumps, except for the Axel, are taken off while skating backward; Axels are entered into by skating forward. Skaters travel in three directions simultaneously while executing a jump: vertically (up off the ice and back down); horizontally (continuing along the direction of travel before leaving the ice); and around. They travel in an up and across, arc-like path while executing a jump, much like the projectile motion of a pole-vaulter. A jump&#x27;s height is determined by vertical velocity and its length is determined by vertical and horizontal velocity. The trajectory of the jump is established during takeoff, so the shape of the arc cannot be changed once a skater is in the air. Their body absorbs up to 13–14 g-forces each time they land from a jump, which sports researchers Lee Cabell and Erica Bateman say contributes to overuse injuries and stress fractures.

Skaters add variations or unusual entries and exits to jumps to increase difficulty. For example, they will perform a jump with one or both arms overhead or extended at the hips, which demonstrates that they are able to generate rotation from the takeoff edge and from their entire body instead of relying on their arms. It also demonstrates their back strength and technical ability to complete the rotation without relying on their arms. Unusual entries into jumps demonstrate that skaters are able to control both the jump and, with little preparation, the transition from the previous move to the jump. Skaters rotate more quickly when their arms are pulled in tightly to their bodies, which requires strength to keep their arms being pulled away from their bodies as they rotate.

According to scientist Deborah King from Ithaca College, there are basic physics common to all jumps, regardless of the skating techniques required to execute them. Factors such as angular momentum, the moment of inertia, angular acceleration, and the skater&#x27;s center of mass determines if a jump is successfully completed. Unlike jumping from dry land, which is fundamentally a linear movement, jumping on the ice is more complicated because of angular momentum. For example, most jumps involve rotation. Scientist James Richards from the University of Delaware says successful jumps depend upon &quot;how much angular momentum do you leave the ice with, how small can you make your moment of inertia in the air, and how much time you can spend in the air&quot;. Richards found that a skater tends to spend the same amount of time in the air when performing triple and quadruple jumps, but their angular momentum at the start of triples and quadruples is slightly higher than it is for double jumps. The key to completing higher-rotation jumps is how they control the moment of inertia. Richards also found that many skaters, although they were able to gain the necessary angular momentum for takeoff, had difficulty gaining enough rotational speed to complete the jump. King agrees, saying skaters must be in the air long enough, have enough jump height to complete the required revolutions, and the amount of vertical velocity they are able to gain as they jump off the ice, although different jumps require different patterns of movement. Skaters performing quadruple jumps tend to be in the air longer and have more rotational speed. King also found that most skaters &quot;actually tended to skate slower into their quads as compared to their triples&quot;, although the differences in the speed in which they approached triples and quadruples were small. King conjectured that slowing their approach into the jumps were due to skaters&#x27; &quot;confidence and a feeling of control and timing for the jump&quot;, rather than any difference in how they executed them. Vertical takeoff velocity, however, was higher for both quadruple and triple toe loops, resulting in &quot;higher jumps and more time in the air to complete the extra revolution for the quadruple toe-loop&quot;. As Tanya Lewis of &quot;Scientific American&quot; puts it, executing quadruple jumps, which as of 2022, has become more common in both male and female single skating competitions, requires &quot;exquisite strength, speed and grace&quot;.

For example, a skater could successfully complete a jump by making small changes to their arm position partway through the rotation, and a small bend in the hips and knees allows a skater &quot;to land with a lower center of mass than they started with, perhaps seeking out a few precious degrees of rotation and a better body position for landing&quot;. When they execute a toe jump, they must use their skate&#x27;s toe pick to complete a pole-vaulting-type motion off the ice, which along with extra horizontal speed, helps them store more energy in their leg. As they rotate over their leg, their horizontal motion converts into tangential velocity. King, who believes quintuple jumps are mathematically possible, says that in order to execute more rotations, they could improve their rotational momentum as they execute their footwork or approach into their takeoff, creating torque about the rotating axis as they come off the ice. She also says that if skaters can increase their rotational momentum while &quot;still exploding upward&quot; they can rotate faster and increase the number of revolutions they perform. Sports writer Dvora Meyers, reporting on Russian coaching techniques, says female skaters executing more quadruple jumps in competition use what experts call pre-rotation, or the practice of twisting their upper bodies before they take off from the ice, which allows them to complete four revolutions before landing. Meyers also says the technique depends on the skater&#x27;s being small, light, and young, and that it puts more strain on the back because they do not use as much leg strength. As a skater ages and goes through puberty, however, they tend to not be able to execute quadruple jumps because &quot;the technique wasn&#x27;t sound to start with&quot;. They also tend to retire before the age of 18 due to the increase of back injuries.

Since the tendency of an edge is toward the center of the circle created by that edge, a skater&#x27;s upper body, arms, and free leg also have a tendency to be pulled along by the force of the edge. If the upper body, arms, and free leg are allowed to follow passively, they will eventually overtake the edge&#x27;s rotational edge and will rotate faster, a principle that is also used to create faster spins. The inherent force of the edge and the force generated by a skater&#x27;s upper body, arms, and free leg tend to increase rotation, so successful jumping requires precise control of these forces. Leaning into the curvature of the edge is how skaters regulate the edge&#x27;s inherent angular momentum. Their upper body, arms, and free leg are controlled by what happens at the time of preparation for the jump and its takeoff, which are designed to produce the correct amount of rotation on the takeoff. If they do not have enough rotation, they will not be at the correct position at the takeoff; if they rotate too much, their upper body will not be high enough in the air. Skaters must keep track of the many different movements and body positions, as well as the timing of those movements relative to each other and to the jump itself, which requires hours of practice but once mastered, becomes natural.

The number of possible combinations jumps are limitless; if a turn or change of feet is permitted between combination jumps, any number of sequences is possible, although if the landing of one jump is the takeoff of the next, as is the case in loop combinations, how the skater lands will dictate the possibilities going into subsequent jumps. Rotational momentum tends to increase during combination jumps, so skaters should control rotation at the landing of each jump; if a skater does not control rotation, they will over-rotate on subsequent jumps and probably fall. The way skaters control rotation differs depending upon the nature of the landing and takeoff edges, and the way they use their arms, which regulate their shoulders and upper body position, and free leg, which dictates the positioning of their hips. If the landing on one jump leads directly into the takeoff of the jump that follows it, the bend on the landing leg of the first jump serves as preparation for the spring of the takeoff of the subsequent jump. If some time elapses between the completion of the first jump and the takeoff of the subsequent one, or if a series of movements serve as preparation for the subsequent jump, the leg bend for the spring can be separated from the bend of the landing leg.

<text>Spins are an element in figure skating in which the skater rotates, centered on a single point on the ice, while holding one or more body positions. They are performed by all disciplines of the sport, single skating, pair skating, and ice dance, and are a required element in most figure skating competitions. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; says, &quot;While jumps look like sport, spins look more like art. While jumps provide the suspense, spins provide the scenery, but there is so much more to the scenery than most viewers have time or means to grasp&quot;. According to world champion and figure skating commentator Scott Hamilton, spins are often used &quot;as breathing points or transitions to bigger things&quot;.

Figure skating spins, along with jumps, spirals, and spread eagles were originally individual compulsory figures, sometimes special figures. Unlike jumps, spins were a &quot;graceful and appreciated&quot; part of figure skating throughout the 19th century. They advanced between World War I and World War II; by the late 1930s, all three basic spin positions were used. 

There are two types of spins, the forward spin and the backward spin. There are three basic spin positions: the upright spin, the sit spin, and the camel spin. Skaters also perform flying spins and spin combinations. The International Skating Union (ISU), figure skating&#x27;s governing body, delineates rules, regulations, and scoring points for each type and variety of spin.

== Background ==

Figure skating spins, along with jumps, spirals, and spread eagles were originally individual compulsory figures, sometimes special figures. Unlike jumps, spins were a &quot;graceful and appreciated&quot; part of figure skating throughout the 19th century. Jean Garcin, who wrote one of the first books about figure skating in the early 1800s, recognizes their beauty, especially when used as a way to conclude a figure artistically. Figure skater and historian Irving Brokaw categorizes spin variations not into positions as they are categorized today, but into different changes of the skating foot. He writes in the early 1900s about the importance of spins and insists that advanced skaters should be able to execute one or more spin varieties on either foot. Spins were performed in the early days of pair skating by more skilled and experienced skaters, often as conclusions to their programs. Figure skating historian James Hines states that even in modern skating, spins are placed at the end of programs to make them more exciting.

Spins &quot;advanced greatly&quot; between World War I and World War II. The spins performed by Norwegian skater Sonja Henie, which can be viewed in her films made during the 1930s, often reached 40 or more revolutions and were &quot;usually well-centered, fast, and as exciting to watch today as they were then&quot;. By the late 1930s, all three basic spin positions were used. Skaters were expected to spin in both directions at the time, but as spins became faster and more difficult, they were only expected to spin in one direction. Skaters like American Ronnie Robertson in the 1950s, Swiss Denise Biellmann in the 1980s, and Swiss Lucinda Ruh in the 1990s, had &quot;an uncanny ability to perform spins&quot;, and were sometimes able to execute up to five revolutions per second in the upright position. Canadian figure skater Olivia Oliver holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest spin, 342 rotations per minute, which she completed in Warsaw in 2015. However, as researchers Lee Cabell and Erica Bateman stated in 2018, &quot;Unfortunately, modern figure skaters often do not achieve these types of revolutions because the rules require skaters to perform spins in different body positions&quot;.

World champion and commentator Scott Hamilton reported that Robertson would spin so fast that he would break blood vessels in his hands. Hamilton also stated that Robertson and Ruh were so good at executing spins that they &quot;would find that part of the blade that had no friction with the ice, and they would spin at the same speed forever. It just seemed like it would never end, and they could change positions and then recrank the spin and make it happen again&quot;. Ruh, however, suffered from chronic nausea and dizziness, and would regularly lose consciousness during practices or in hotel rooms. She was eventually diagnosed with miniconcussions that were probably linked to executing spins and the forces generated by them, especially during layback spins. Ruh also later stated that the rotational speeds she was able to maintain and the long hours practicing and performing them most likely contributed to the severity of her injuries.

Pair spins became part of competitive figure skating between the world wars; side-by-side spins, along with death spirals, lifts, throw jumps, side-by-side jumps, and side-by-side footwork sequences, were a part of pair skating by the 1930s. In ice dance, there were limitations to dance spins, as well as for other moves associated with pair skating like jumps and lifts, when ice dance became a competitive sport and throughout the 1950s. Spins were limited to a maximum of one-and-a-half revolutions when done by one partner and to two-and-a-half revolutions when they spun around each other. These limitations were put in place to ensure its distinction from pair skating.

== Execution ==

As &quot;The New York Times&quot; says, &quot;While jumps look like sport, spins look more like art. While jumps provide the suspense, spins provide the scenery, but there is so much more to the scenery than most viewers have time or means to grasp&quot;. According to Scott Hamilton, spins are often used &quot;as breathing points or transitions to bigger things&quot; and are more difficult to explain to the audience &quot;because there is so much going on&quot;. Hamilton stated that explaining the intricacies of spins, like edge changes, is challenging because they are difficult to see.

Most beginning skaters learn how to execute spins in the counter-clockwise direction, but some may execute them clockwise. Most spins are executed on one foot, except for the two-foot spin, which beginning skaters tend to learn first, and the cross-foot spin. The two-foot spin consists of three essential parts—the setup, the windup, and the spin—as well as the exit, which can be done by rotating in a closed spinning position until stopping or by using a back inside edge with a change of foot.

The effect of linear and rotational forces is most apparent and most powerful when performing spins. The successful accomplishment of spins depends upon the effective management of angular momentum, which occurs during the entrance of a spin and ends once a skater is in the spin and all linear force is translated into angular velocity. The skater rotates around the point at which their blade touches the ice, the most important point in the vertical axis made by their body, and a fixed vertical axis that extends from the blade on the ice to the highest point in their body. The absence of angular momentum means that fewer variables, or vectors, influence the resulting motion, so if the center of gravity is maintained, spins should be easier to perform than other elements such as jumps. The change from angular momentum to angular speed around a fixed vertical axis is difficult to control, though, as is the change from one force into another in general. Moving forward quickly also cannot be efficiently converted into fast angular speed, so the conversion of fast linear motion, which produces a lot of force, into fast rotational motion is small. Therefore, is it a waste of energy to build up speed going into a spin; entering a spin slowly achieves the same result and will probably be more consistent.

A spin consists of the following parts: preparation, entry, spin, and exit. During the preparation phase, skaters decrease the radius of the skating curve and velocity/speed, which means that the skater must increase how much they lean into the spin. As researchers Lee Cabell and Erica Bateman state, &quot;A step against the gliding edge exerts a force on the ice; the resultant torque about the axis of rotation results in the angular momentum that is used during the spin&quot;. Greater force during the initial push of the spin&#x27;s preparation phase results in greater torque and angular momentum, which will result in a faster spin. The International Skating Union defines a spin exit as &quot;the last phase of the spin and includes the phase immediately following the spin&quot;. The exit coming out of a spin occurs in two stages: breaking the spin&#x27;s rotational spin and the exit itself. There are many exit variations of spins. A difficult exit is any jump or movement a skater performs that makes the exit significantly more difficult.

The entry phase of a spin produces a logarithmic curve with an indefinite number of radii, smallest at the end and largest at the beginning. When the entry curve radius is decreased, the skater will change the angle of their ean towards the vertical axis, gradually reducing the velocity/speed. The curve ends with a 3 turn, then the center of gravity is slightly lower, resulting in the skater beginning to spin. After the initiation of the actual spin, they will exhibit a large moment of inertia. Their shoulders are square to the hips and rotating with each other at the same angular velocity. The skater&#x27;s center of gravity must be directly above theie base of support (for example, where the blade is in contact with the ice) in order for them to execute a balanced spin. If the spin is not balanced and centered, the vertical projection of the center of gravity moves away from their base of support, which results in the spinning blade making small loops on the ice.

The skater&#x27;s goal for most spins is to rotate as quickly as possible, to have a well-defined and pleasing body position, to maintain perfect balance before, during, and after the spin, and to remain in one place, called centering, while executing a spin. A good spin should rotate in one place on the ice, &quot;drawing a series of tiny overlapping circles on top of each other&quot; into the ice. A skater who executes a spin that is not centered will travel across the ice, &quot;producing a series of loops strung out along a curve or straight line, so that the skater will end the spin several feet away from the spot on the ice where she began it&quot;. In order to rotate rapidly, the skater must increase their speed (rotations per minute), which is accomplished by reducing the distance of the vertical axis from the parts of their body. This is done by bringing their arms and free leg closer to their body, in line with the vertical axis. Since the true center of gravity is at the point in which the blade meets the ice, the skater must also lower their arms and free leg toward that point. The force created by the spin is generated outward and upward, or via the path of least resistance, as their speed increases. When skaters allow the force to follow the path of least resistance, however, they will lose some of the force that contributes to rotational speed, so when they increase a spin&#x27;s speed, they must move their arms and free leg inward and downward. Exactly how this is done varies depending on the type of spin skaters perform.

Skaters experience dizziness during spins because as they spin, their eyes focus on an immobile object and follows it until the object passes beyond their peripheral vision. Then their eyes race ahead to focus on a new object and as the spin ends, their eyes continue to follow this pattern, causing dizziness. It takes practice to train the eyes to return to normal, which dissipates the experience of dizziness.

== Types/positions of spins ==
There are two types of spins, the forward spin and the backward spin. The forward spin is executed on the back inside edge of the skate and is entered into by the forward outside edge and 3 turn; the equivalent movement is ballet in the &quot;pirouette en dedans&quot;. The backward spin, which is executed on the back outside edge, is entered into by the forward inside edge and 3 turn; the equivalent movement in ballet is the &quot;pirouette en dehors&quot;.

There are three basic spin positions: the upright spin, the sit spin, and the camel spin.

=== Upright spin ===


The upright spin is one of the three basic figure skating spin positions. The ISU defines an upright spin as a spin with &quot;any position with the skating leg extended or slightly bent which is not a camel position&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2021-100&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by British figure skater Cecilia Colledge, who was the first to execute it. Variations of the upright spin include the layback spin, the Biellman spin (created by world champion Denise Biellmann), the full layback, the split, the back upright spin, the forward upright spin, the scratch spin (also called the blur spin), and the sideways leaning spin.

===Sit spin===
The sit spin, invented by American figure skater Jackson Haines, &quot;represents one of the most important spins in skating&quot;. It is executed on one foot, in a sitting position, with the knee of the skating leg bent in a one-legged crouch position and the free leg held in front, to the side or to the back. It is difficult to learn, requires a great deal of energy, and is not as exciting to perform as other elements, such as jumps, but it has variations that make it more creative and pleasurable to watch. Skaters increase the difficulty of the sit spin in several ways.

=== Camel spin ===

Colledge was also responsible for the invention of the camel spin (also called the parallel spin); she was the first to perform it, in the mid-1930s. Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum speculates that the camel and layback spins, which &quot;heightened the visual function of the skater creating interesting shapes with her body&quot;, were, for the first ten years after their inventions, performed mostly by women and not by men because it was easier for women to achieve the interesting shapes the camel spin creates than it is for men. American skater Dick Button, however, performed the first forward camel spin, a variation of the camel spin, and spins became a regular part of the repertoire of male skaters. The camel spin is executed on one foot and is an adaptation of the arabesque ballet pose to the ice. When executed well, the stretch of the body should create a slight arch or straight line. Skaters increase the difficulty of camel spins in a variety of ways.

===Flying spins===
A flying spin is the combination of a jump and a spin. A flying spin can be appealing for the audience to watch and exciting for the skater to perform. Petrovich describes three types of flying spins: the flying camel, the flying sit spin, and the butterfly. The flying camel consists of a jump from a left forward outside edge, about one revolution in the air, with the landing executed in a camel spin. Dick Button might have been the first skater to successfully execute the flying camel; for many years, it was called the &quot;Button camel&quot;. The flying sit spin was first performed by Buddy Vaughn and Bill Grimditch, who were students of figure skating coach Gustav Lussi, but Button and Ronnie Robertson made it famous. It consists of a take-off from a left forward outside edge, a sit spin position in the air during one-and-a-half revolutions, and a landing in a sit spin. According to Petkevich, &quot;When the jump is high, it can be an exhilarating maneuver for skater and audience alike&quot;. The butterfly spin is so named because it describes the position in the air. It consists of a take-off from both feet, a body position horizontal to the ice, and a landing in a back spin. It is often performed at the end of a skater&#x27;s program because although it adds to a program&#x27;s technical content, it does not require much precision or energy to execute.

The jump section of flying spins is executed at the beginning of the spin and is part of the entrance into it. The angular momentum on the entrance, like for all spins, must be converted into pure rotational momentum. In ordinary jumps, angular momentum allows the skater to travel a long distance across the rink and propel high into the air, but for flying spins, the principles that govern the spin dominate the jump portion of the spin. The goal is to minimize forward motion on the jump portion. Creating speed on the spin portion is also a goal, but a flying spin never achieves the speed of a basic spin because some of the forces assigned to achieving the speed in a basic spin must be used to achieve height on the flying spin&#x27;s jump portion. Centering the spin after the jump depends on converting all the angular momentum into rotational momentum. Mastering the flying spin takes less time and practice if skaters have already mastered basic spin techniques and good jumping ability.

===Spin combinations===
Spin combinations are required in the programs of all disciplines. Flying spins and basic spins can be combined in any number of variations. The maintenance, or acceleration, of the rotational momentum created on the entrance of the first spin is the most important principle governing the execution of spin combinations, which require quick movements during the spins&#x27; transitions. When a change of feet is required to successfully perform spin combinations, the center of rotation of subsequent spins should be as close as possible to the center of rotation of the first spin of the combination. Spin combinations must include more than one position and may or may not involve a change of foot.
== Rules and regulations ==

===Single skating===
If a skater performs a spin that has no basic position with only two revolutions, or with less than two revolutions, they do not fulfill the position requirement for the spin, and receives no points for it. A spin with less than three revolutions is not considered a spin; rather, it is considered a skating movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2018-103&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The flying spin and any spin that only has one position must have six revolutions; spin combinations must have 10 revolutions. Required revolutions are counted from when the skater enters the spin until they exit out of it, except for flying spins and the spins in which the final wind-up is in one position.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2018-110&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Skaters increase the difficulty of camel spins by grabbing their leg or blade while performing the spin.

A skater earns points for a spin change of edge only if they complete the spin in a basic position. Fluctuations in speed and variations in the positions of a skater&#x27;s arms, head, and free leg are permitted. A skater must execute at least three revolutions before and after a change of foot. If a skater tries to perform a spin and his or her change of foot is too far apart (thus creating two spins instead of one), only the part executed before the change of foot is included in the skater&#x27;s score. The change of foot is optional for spin combinations and for single-position spins. If they fall while entering a spin, the skater can fill the time lost by executing a spin or spinning movement immediately afterwards; however, this movement will not be counted as an element. Difficult spin variations increase the level of a spin and are worth more points. These variations include a movement of the body part, head, leg, arm, or hand that requires flexibility or physical strength and that effects the balance of the skater&#x27;s main body core. There are 11 categories of difficult spin variations; three are in the camel spin position, based on the direction of the skater&#x27;s shoulder line.

A spin combination must have at least &quot;two different basic positions with 2 revolutions in each of these positions anywhere within the spin&quot;. Skaters earn the full value of a spin combination when they include all three basic positions. The number of revolutions in non-basic positions are included in the total number of revolutions, but changing to a non-basic position is not considered a change of position. The change of foot and change of position can be made at the same time or separately, and can be performed as a jump or as a step-over movement. Non-basic positions are allowed during spins executed in one position or, for single skaters, during a flying spin. Difficult exits must have a significant impact on the spin&#x27;s execution, control, and balance.

===Pair skating===
====Solo spin combinations====
The solo spin combination must be performed once during the short program of pair skating competitions, with at least two revolutions in two basic positions. Both partners must include all three basic positions in order to earn the full points possible. There must be a minimum of five revolutions made on each foot. Spins can be commenced with jumps and must have at least two different basic positions, and both partners must include two revolutions in each position. A solo spin combination must have all three basic positions (the camel spin, the sit spin, and upright positions) performed by both partners, at any time during the spin to receive the full value of points, and must have all three basic positions performed by both partners to receive full value for the element. A spin with less than three revolutions is not counted as a spin; rather, it is considered a skating movement. If a skater changes to a non-basic position, it is not considered a change of position. The number of revolutions in non-basic positions, which may be considered difficult variations, are counted towards the team&#x27;s total number of revolutions. Only positions, whether basic or non-basic, must be performed by the partners at the same time.

If a skater falls while entering into the spin, they can perform another spin or spinning movement immediately after the fall, to fill the time lost from the fall, but it is not counted as a solo spin combination. A change of foot, in the form of a jump or step over, is allowed, and the change of position and change of foot can be performed separately or at the same time. Pair teams require &quot;significant strength, skill and control&quot; to perform a change from a basic position to a different basic position without performing a nonbasic position first. They also have to execute a continuous movement throughout the change, without jumps to execute it, and they must hold the basic position for two revolutions both before and after the change. They lose points if they take a long time to reach the necessary basic position.

Pair teams earn more points for performing difficult entrances into their spins. Difficult flying entrances count, although backward entry into the spin and a flying camel do not. All entrances must have a &quot;significant impact&quot; on the spin&#x27;s execution, balance, and control, and the intended spin position must be achieved within the team&#x27;s first two revolutions. The rules surrounding difficult variations, which also apply to single skaters and to both partners, are also worth more points. There are 11 categories of difficult solo spin variations.

====Pair spin combinations====
Both junior and senior pair teams must perform one pair spin combination, which may begin with a fly spin, during their free skating programs. Pair spin combinations must have at least eight revolutions, which must be counted from &quot;the entry of the spin until its exit&quot;. If spins are done with less than two revolutions, pairs receive zero points; if they have less than three revolutions, they are considered a skating movement, not a spin. Pair teams cannot, except for a short step when changing directions, stop while performing a rotation. Spins must have at least two different basic positions, with two revolutions in each position performed by both partners anywhere within the spin; full value for pair spin combinations are awarded only when both partners perform all three basic positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2018-113&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; A spin executed in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions is considered one spin. When a team simultaneously performs spins in both directions that immediately follow each other, they earn more points, but they must execute a minimum of three revolutions in each direction without any changes in position.

Both partners must execute at least one change of position and one change of foot (although not necessarily done simultaneously); if not, the element will have no value. Like the solo spin combination, the spin combination has three basic positions: the camel spin, the sit spin, and the upright spin. Also like the solo spin combination, changes to a non-basic position is counted towards the team&#x27;s total number of revolutions and are not considered a change of position. A change of foot must have at least three revolutions, before and after the change, and can be any basic or non-basic position, in order for the element to be counted.

Fluctuations of speed and variations of positions of the head, arms, or free leg are allowed. Difficult variations of a combined pair spin must have at least two revolutions. They receive more points if the spin contains three difficult variations, two of which can be non-basic positions, although each partner must have at least one difficult variation. The same rules apply for difficult entrances into pair spin combinations as they do for solo spin combinations, except that they must be executed by both partners for the element to count towards their final score. A difficult exit, in which the skaters exit the spin in a lift or spinning movement, is defined as &quot;an innovative move that makes the exit significantly more difficult&quot;. If one or both partners fall while entering a spin, they can execute a spin or a spinning movement to fill up time lost during the fall.


===Dance spins===
There are two types of dance spins: the solo spin and the combination spin.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2018-125&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The ISU defines a dance spin as &quot;a spin skated by the Couple together in any hold&quot;. The ISU also states, &quot;It should be performed on the spot around a common axis on one foot by each partner simultaneously&quot;. The combination spin is defined as &quot;a spin performed as above after which one change of foot is made by both partners simultaneously and further rotations occur&quot;. The solo spin, or pirouette, is allowed and defined as &quot;a spinning movement performed on one foot&quot;, with or without the partner&#x27;s assistance, performed by both partners at the same time but around separate centers. The ISU announces dance spin variations or combinations at the beginning of each season.

Dance spins have three positions. The upright position is done on one foot with the skating leg slightly bent or straight and with the upper body upright, bent to the side, or with an arched back. The sit position is done on one foot, with &quot;the skating leg bent in a one-legged crouch position and with the free leg forward, either to the back or the side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2018-126&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2021, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The camel position is done on one foot, with &quot;the skating leg straight or slightly bent forward, and with the free leg extended or bent forward horizontally or higher&quot;. Ice dancers increase the difficulty of their spins by varying the direction of their spinning rotation and by changing how they enter into and exit out of the spin. For the direction of their rotation, they must both change the direction at the same time and complete at least three rotations in each direction. Their entry into their spins must be unexpected, without any evident preparation. Both their entry into and out of their spin, immediately before entering and exiting the spin, must both include a &quot;continuous combination of different creative and/or difficult and/or intricate steps or movements or a continuous combination of both creative and/or difficult and/or intricate step(s)&quot;.

<text>Norwich is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 3,612 at the 2020 census. Home to some of the state of Vermont&#x27;s wealthiest residents, the municipality is a commuter town for nearby Hanover, New Hampshire across the Connecticut River. The town is part of the Dresden School District, the first interstate school district in the United States, signed into law by President John F. Kennedy. The town contains the Norwich Mid-Century Modern Historic District.

== History ==
The boundaries of Norwich were established on July 4, 1761, when Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire defined the boundaries of townships in Vermont. The first settlers reached the area in 1763 and began to clear the wilderness and erect the first hand-hewn log buildings, wintering over for the first time in 1765. Early settlements occurred along the Ompompanoosuc River. Later, the current village site became settled. The first town meeting occurred in April 1768. The first Congregational church was founded in 1770 and a structure built in 1778. The population grew from 206 in 1771 to 1,158 in 1791 and 2,316 in 1830.

The town was named after Norwich, Connecticut, the state from which the first settlers originated. In the original charter, the name was spelled &quot;Norwhich&quot;, but the additional &#x27;h&#x27; was dropped shortly after the town was chartered. Originally pronounced &quot;Norritch&quot; (similar to the English pronunciation of the city of Norwich, England), the town name has in more recent times become more commonly pronounced &quot;Nor-wich&quot;.

===Alden Partridge and the founding of Norwich University===
In 1819 native son, Alden Partridge, a former Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, founded the private &quot;American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy&quot; in Norwich. He hoped to establish a new &quot;American system&quot; for training cadets that included both humanities and science topics in the curriculum, in addition to military science. In his six years of Norwich residency, Partridge achieved an academy population of nearly 500 &quot;cadets&quot;. He moved that school back to Middletown, Connecticut, in 1825, but returned in 1835 with a charter from the U.S. Congress to found another military academy, which remained in Norwich until 1866, when it burned to the ground. The school then relocated to Northfield, Vermont, where it exists today as Norwich University.
==Geography==

Norwich lies on the western bank of the Connecticut River, which forms Vermont&#x27;s boundary with New Hampshire, opposite its companion town, Hanover, New Hampshire.

The Montshire Museum of Science and King Arthur Baking Company are located in Norwich.

==Education==
Norwich maintains one of the few interstate public school systems, the Dresden School District, commissioned by President John F. Kennedy, which is shared by the towns of Norwich and Hanover, New Hampshire. Students attend Marion Cross School in Norwich for kindergarten through sixth grade, Richmond Middle School in Hanover for grades seven and eight, and Hanover High School in Hanover for grades nine through twelve.

==Transportation==
Major transportation routes, which run parallel through the Connecticut River valley, include Interstate 91 (Exit 13 serves the town), U.S. Route 5 and the former Boston and Maine Railroad right of way, now owned by the State of Vermont. The Appalachian Trail passes south to east through the town from Hartford to Hanover, New Hampshire.

<text>Niihau (Hawaiian: ), anglicized as Niihau ( ), is the seventh largest island in Hawaii and the westernmost of the main islands. It is southwest of Kauaʻi across the Kaulakahi Channel. Its area is . Several intermittent playa lakes provide wetland habitats for the Hawaiian coot, the Hawaiian stilt, and the Hawaiian duck. The island is designated as critical habitat for &quot;Brighamia insignis&quot;, an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid. The United States Census Bureau defines Niʻihau and the neighboring island and State Seabird Sanctuary of Lehua as Census Tract 410 of Kauai County, Hawaii. Its 2000 census population was 160, most of whom are native Hawaiians; its 2010 census population was 170. At the 2020 census, the population had fallen to 84.

Elizabeth Sinclair purchased Niʻihau in 1864 for from the Kingdom of Hawaii. The island&#x27;s private ownership passed on to her descendants, the Robinsons. During World War II, the island was the site of the Niʻihau incident, in which, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a Japanese navy fighter pilot crashed on the island and received help from the island&#x27;s residents of Japanese descent.

The island, known as &quot;the Forbidden Isle&quot;, is off-limits to all outsiders except the Robinson family and their relatives, U.S. Navy personnel, government officials, and invited guests. From 1987 onward, a limited number of supervised activity tours and hunting safaris have opened to tourists. The island is currently managed by brothers Bruce and Keith Robinson. The people of Niʻihau are noted for their gemlike &quot;lei pūpū&quot; (shell lei) craftsmanship. They speak Hawaiian as a primary language. The island has attracted some controversy for the strict rules the Robinson family imposes on the island and its inhabitants.

==Geography==

Niʻihau is located about west of Kauaʻi, and the tiny, uninhabited island of Lehua lies north of Niʻihau. Niʻihau&#x27;s dimensions are 6.2 miles by 18.6 miles (10km × 30km). The maximum elevation (Paniau) is . The island is about 6 million years old, making it geologically older than the 5.8-million-year-old neighboring island of Kauaʻi to the northeast. Niʻihau is the remnant of the southwestern slope of what was once a much larger volcano. The entire summit and other slopes collapsed into the ocean in a giant prehistoric landslide.

===Climate===
The island is relatively arid because it lies in the rain shadow of Kauaʻi and lacks the elevation needed to catch significant amounts of trade wind rainfall. Niʻihau, therefore, depends on winter Kona storms for its rain, when more northerly weather systems intrude into the region. As such, the island is subject to long periods of drought. Historical droughts on Niʻihau have been recorded several times, one in 1792 by Captain James Cook&#x27;s former junior officer, George Vancouver, who had been told that the people of Niʻihau had abandoned the island because of a severe drought and had moved to Kauaʻi to escape famine.

===Flora and fauna===

As an arid island, Niʻihau was barren of trees for centuries – Captain James Cook reported it treeless in 1778. Aubrey Robinson, grandfather of current owners Bruce Robinson and Keith Robinson, planted 10,000 trees per year during much of his ownership of the island; Robinson&#x27;s afforestation efforts increased rainfall in the dry climate. Island co-owner Keith Robinson, a noted conservationist, preserved and documented many of Niʻihau&#x27;s natural plant resources. The island is designated as a critical habitat for the &quot;ʻōlulu&quot;, an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid. &quot;Pritchardia aylmer-robinsonii&quot;, a palm tree named for Keith Robinson&#x27;s uncle Aylmer Robinson, is an endangered species native to Niʻihau.

Several bird species thrive on Niʻihau. The largest lakes on the island are Hālaliʻi Lake, Halulu Lake and Nonopapa Lake. These intermittent playa lakes on the island provide wetland habitats for the &quot;ʻalae keʻokeʻo&quot; (Hawaiian coot), the &quot;āeʻo&quot; (Hawaiian subspecies of Black-necked Stilt), and the &quot;koloa maoli&quot; (Hawaiian duck). The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal (&quot;Monachus schauinslandi&quot;) is found in high numbers on Niʻihau&#x27;s shores. Robinson states that Niʻihau&#x27;s secluded shoreline offers them a safe haven from habitat encroachments. According to Robinson, conditions there are better than the government refuges of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. When the Robinsons originally purchased Niʻihau, no monk seals were present, because they lived in the northwestern part of the Hawaiian island chain, Necker and Midway islands. They have been relocated to the main Hawaiian island chain by NOAA fisheries over the past thirty years, and some have found homes on Niʻihau.

Big game herds, imported from stock on Molokaʻi Ranch in recent years, roam Niʻihau&#x27;s forests and flatlands. Eland and aoudad are abundant, along with oryxes, wild boars and feral sheep. These big game herds provide income from hunting safari tourism.

==History==

Prior to the unification of the Kingdom of Hawaii under Kamehameha I, Niʻihau was ruled by the . Kahelelani was the first of the Niʻihau aliʻi. His name is now used to refer to the &quot;Niʻihau kahelelani&quot;, the puka shell of the wart turbans (&quot;Leptothyra verruca&quot;), used to make exquisite Niʻihau shell jewelry. Kāʻeokūlani was a ruler of northern Niʻihau who unified the island after defeating his rival, a chief named Kawaihoa. A stone wall () across a quarter of the island&#x27;s southern end marked the boundaries of the two chiefs: Kāʻeo&#x27;s land was identified by black stones and Kawaihoa&#x27;s by white stones. Eventually, a great battle took place, known as Pali Kamakaui. Kāʻeo&#x27;s two brothers from the island of Maui, Kaʻiana and his half-brother Kahekili II, the King of Maui, fought for Kāʻeo, and Niʻihau was united under his rule. Kawaihoa was banished to the south end of the island and Kāʻeo moved to the middle of the island to govern. Kāʻeo married the Queen Kamakahelei, and a future king of Niʻihau and Kauaʻi named Kaumualiʻi was born in 1790. Kauaʻi and Niʻihau are said to have carried the &quot;highest blood lines&quot; in the Hawaiian Islands.

Kamehameha managed to unify all of the islands by 1795, except for Kauaʻi and Niʻihau. Two attempts to conquer those islands had failed, and Kamehameha lost many men: bodies covered the beaches on Kauaʻi&#x27;s eastern shores. Finally, in 1810, Kamehameha amassed a great fleet, and Kaumualiʻi, the last independent , surrendered rather than risk further bloodshed. Independence again became feasible after Kamehameha&#x27;s death in 1819, but was put down when Kamehameha&#x27;s widow Kaʻahumanu kidnapped Kaumualiʻi and forced him to marry her. Thereafter Niʻihau remained part of the unified Hawaiian Kingdom.
Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair (1800–1892) purchased Niʻihau and parts of Kauaʻi from Kamehameha V in 1864 for in gold. Sinclair chose Niʻihau over other options, including Waikīkī and Pearl Harbor. By around 1875, Niʻihau&#x27;s population consisted of about 350 Native Hawaiians, with 20,000 sheep. This era marked the end of the art of Hawaiian mat-weaving made famous by the people of Niʻihau. (&quot;Cyperus laevigatus&quot;), a native sedge, used to grow on the edges of Niʻihau&#x27;s three intermittent lakes. The stems were harvested and used to weave (mats), considered the &quot;finest sleeping mats in Polynesia&quot;. The mats were valued by and foreign visitors alike, but by the end of the 19th century, Hawaiians had stopped weaving due to changes in population, culture, economics, and the environment.

In 1915, Sinclair&#x27;s grandson Aubrey Robinson closed the island to most visitors. Even relatives of the inhabitants could visit only by special permission. Upon Aubrey&#x27;s death in 1939 the island passed to his son Aylmer, and in 1968 to Aylmer&#x27;s youngest brother Lester. Upon Lester&#x27;s wife Helen&#x27;s death, the island passed to his sons Bruce Robinson and Keith Robinson, the current co-owners. (See Sinclair-Robinson family tree)

The Robinson family has attracted controversy over the strict rules they have imposed on the island’s inhabitants, largely enforced by Bruce Robinson’s wife, Leiana Robinson. The rules include a ban on alcohol and cigarettes, being prohibited from talking about Ni’ihau to the media, a permanent ban from the island if a resident leaves for an extended amount of time, and a ban on long hair and beards for men. The island lacks electricity and running water.

==The Niʻihau Incident==
Niʻihau was the site of an event not long after the attack on Pearl Harbor that has come to be known as the Niʻihau Incident (or the Battle of Niʻihau). On December 7, 1941, a Japanese pilot whose Zero had been hit crash-landed on the island hoping to rendezvous with a rescue submarine. The pilot was apprehended and later escaped with the assistance of local Japanese residents, but he was killed shortly afterwards.

Despite its self-imposed isolation, Niʻihau has a long-standing relationship with the U.S. military dating from 1924. There is a small Navy installation on the island. No military personnel are permanently stationed there, but the U.S. military has used the island for training special operations units, which included hiring Hawaiians who live on Niʻihau as &quot;enemy&quot; trackers.

==Society==

===Politics===

The island of Niʻihau was considered as a possible location for the United Nations headquarters in 1944 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had visited Hawaii in 1934. Under Cordell Hull, Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State, the State Department seriously studied the proposal.


In 2004, President George W. Bush received all but one of the 40 votes cast on the island. The remaining vote was cast for Green Party nominee David Cobb. Fifty-one registered voters did not cast ballots. In 2006, Dan Akaka received 60% of votes in the 2006 Senate election to Cynthia Thielen&#x27;s 36%. In 2008, Niʻihau&#x27;s precinct was one of only 3 of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s 538 precincts to vote for John McCain over Barack Obama.

===Population===

The 2010 census states that there were 170 people living on the island. However, witness accounts estimate that the population actually ranges between 35 and 50 people. Some support themselves largely by subsistence fishing and farming, while others depend on welfare. All residents live rent-free, and meat is free. Niʻihau has no telephone services and no paved roads. Horses are the main form of transportation; bicycles are also used. There are no power lines; solar power provides all electricity. There is no plumbing or running water on the island. Water comes from rainwater catchment. The Robinson family established most of these conditions. There is no hotel, and barges deliver groceries from Kauaʻi, often purchased by relatives, with free shipping.

Residents generally speak the Niʻihau dialect of Hawaiian as their first language, in part encouraged by terms in the original purchase contract which obligated the new owners to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition. The Niʻihau dialect differs from modern standard Hawaiian in that, for example, and are the most common realizations of the phonemes and , respectively. Niʻihau is the only island where Hawaiian is spoken as a primary language. Oral tradition maintains that the Niʻihau dialect is closer to the Hawaiian register spoken during the time of contact with Europeans; there is linguistic evidence to support this claim, such as the pronunciation of k as . English is the second language.

Some residents have radio and television sets, although limited reception effectively limits the latter to watching pre-recorded media. Niʻihau is subject to regular droughts that occasionally force the population to evacuate to Kauaʻi temporarily, until rainfall replenishes their water supply. Residents commonly also commute to Kauaʻi for work, medical care, or school, and many of them call both islands home. To avoid a long boat ride, the island&#x27;s owners maintain an Agusta A109 helicopter for emergencies and for transporting Navy contractors and residents to and from Kauaʻi. Helicopter tours and safaris help offset the costs of this service.

A form of ipu art is known to have developed solely on the island of Niʻihau. In this method, after a design is carved in the skin of a fresh gourd, it is filled with dye which, after several weeks, changes the color of the uncarved portions of the surface where the skin is intact. Hawaiian music plays a central role on the island, with a cappella singers making use of only two or three tones and changing rhythms. Ukulele and guitar playing is nearly ubiquitous among the islanders, and there are three separate styles of slack-key music, with an older style originating from Kohala.

===Education===
The Hawaii Department of Education operates the Niʻihau School, a K–12 school. Academic subjects and computer literacy are combined with teaching students to &quot;thrive from the land&quot;. The school is powered entirely by solar power. The number of students varies from 25 to 50 since families often travel between Niʻihau and Kauaʻi. Schoolchildren may stay with relatives in west Kauaʻi, where they attend one of two Niʻihau-focused public charter schools. At the Ke Kula Niʻihau o Kekaha school, students speak primarily the Niʻihau dialect through the early elementary grades, and then Hawaiian and English through grade 12. The school has a digital recording and video system, which helps to preserve and teach traditional Niʻihau and Hawaiian culture. At the other west Kauaʻi school, Kula Aupuni Niʻihau a Kahelelani Aloha (KANAKA), English is used in all grades, while still supporting the Niʻihau dialect. Both schools foster the culture, values, and spirituality of Niʻihau. Efforts to establish KANAKA began in 1993 and its current version was established in 1999.

==Economy==
Approximately 80% of Niʻihau&#x27;s income comes from a small Navy installation atop 1,300-foot-high cliffs. Remote-controlled tracking devices are used for testing and training with Kaua&#x27;i&#x27;s Pacific Missile Range Facility. Modern missile defense tests are conducted at the site for the U.S. and its allies. The installation brings in millions of dollars a year, and provides the island with a stable economic base without the complexity of tourism or industrial development.

The sale of shells and shell jewelry is an additional source of income. Its beaches are known for their &quot;pūpū&quot;, tiny shells that wash onto shore during winter months. Species used for shell leis includes &quot;momi&quot; (&quot;Euplica varians&quot;), &quot;laiki&quot; or rice shells (&quot;Mitrella margarita&quot;) and &quot;kahelelani&quot; (&quot;Leptothyra verruca&quot;). The shells and jewelry are so popular that Governor Linda Lingle signed a bill in 2004 to protect &quot;lei pūpū o Niʻihau&quot; (Niʻihau shell leis) from counterfeiting. A single, intricate Niʻihau shell lei can sell for thousands of dollars.

Many residents of Niʻihau were once employees of Niʻihau Ranch, farming cattle and sheep until the Robinsons shut down the operation in 1999. It had not been profitable for most of the 20th century. Honey cultivation was also no longer viable by 1999. Kiawe charcoal was once a large-scale export, but aggressive Mexican price competition ended that as well. Mullet farming has been popular on Niʻihau, with ponds and lakes stocked with baby mullet, which reach apiece before being harvested and sold on Kauaʻi and Oʻahu.

Bruce Robinson, Niʻihau&#x27;s co-owner, is seeking and considering new forms of non-invasive income generation. Depending on feasibility, impact, and ecological footprint on the ecosystem and culture, possibilities include JP-8 (jet fuel) generation by the lignocellulose process; military, including a possible runway; and windmill energy production. Robinson has declined offers to purchase sand from Niʻihau&#x27;s beaches, because of adverse environmental effects.

===Tourism===
Niʻihau&#x27;s owners have offered half-day helicopter and beach tours of the island since 1987, although contact with residents is avoided and no accommodation exists. Since 1992, hunting safaris provide income from tourists who pay to visit the island to hunt eland, aoudad, and oryx, as well as wild sheep and boars. Any meat the hunters do not take with them is given to the village.

<doc id="39690" wikidata="Q697407" url="?curid=39690" title="Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)">
<text>Hawaii Five-O is an American police procedural drama series produced by CBS Productions and created by Leonard Freeman (not to be confused with the remake &quot;Hawaii Five-0,&quot; with a numeral zero as the last character in the title). Set in Hawaii, the show originally aired for 12 seasons on CBS from September 20, 1968, to April 5, 1980, and continues in reruns. At the airing of its last episode, it was the longest-running police drama in American television history, and the last scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1960s to leave the air.

The show starred Jack Lord as Detective Captain Stephen &quot;Steve&quot; McGarrett, the head of a fictional state police task force in Hawaii. The theme music composed by Morton Stevens became especially popular. Many episodes in the series would end with McGarrett&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Book &#x27;em, Danno!&quot;

==Overview==
The CBS television network produced &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, which aired from September 20, 1968, to April 5, 1980. The program continues to be broadcast in syndication worldwide. Created by Leonard Freeman, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; was shot on location in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, and throughout the island of Oʻahu and elsewhere in the Hawaiian Islands with occasional filming in locales such as Los Angeles, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

The show centers on a fictional state police force led by former U.S. naval officer Steve McGarrett (played by Jack Lord), a detective captain, who is appointed by the Governor, Paul Jameson. In the show, McGarrett oversees state police officers – the young Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams, veteran Chin Ho Kelly, and streetwise Kono Kalakaua for seasons one through four. Honolulu Police Department Officer Duke Lukela joined the team as a regular, as did Ben Kokua, who replaced Kono beginning with season five. Occasionally, McGarrett&#x27;s Five-O team is assisted by other officers as needed: Det. Frank Kamana (Douglas Mossman), P.O. Sandi Wells (Amanda McBroom), medical examiner Doc Bergman (Al Eben), forensic specialist Che Fong (Harry Endo), and a secretary. The first secretary was May, then Jenny, and later Malia, Lani, and Luana.

The title of the show refers to Hawaiʻi&#x27;s status as the fiftieth U.S. state. At the time of the show&#x27;s premier, Hawaiʻi had officially been a U.S. state for only nine years. The &quot;Five-O&quot; team consists of three to five members (small for a real state police unit), and is portrayed as occupying a suite of offices in ʻIolani Palace. Five-O lacks its own radio network, necessitating frequent requests by McGarrett to the Honolulu Police Department dispatchers.

For 12 seasons, McGarrett and his team pursued international secret agents, criminals, and organized crime syndicates plaguing the Hawaiian Islands. With the aid of District Attorney and later Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Attorney General John Manicote, McGarrett is successful in sending most of his enemies to prison. One such crime syndicate was led by crime family patriarch Honore Vashon, a character introduced in the fifth season. Other criminals and organized crime bosses on the islands were played by actors such as Ricardo Montalbán, Gavin MacLeod, and Ross Martin as Tony Alika.

By the 12th and final season, series regular James MacArthur had left the show (in 1996, he admitted that he had become tired of the role and wanted to do other things), as had Kam Fong. Unlike other characters before him, Fong&#x27;s character, Chin Ho Kelly, at Fong&#x27;s request, was killed off, murdered while working undercover to expose a protection ring in Chinatown in the last episode of season 10. New characters Jim &#x27;Kimo&#x27; Carew (William Smith), Lori Wilson (Sharon Farrell), and Truck (Moe Keale) were introduced in season 12 alongside returning regular character Duke Lukela.

Most episodes of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; ended with the arrest of criminals and McGarrett snapping, &quot;Book &#x27;em.&quot; The offense occasionally was added after this phrase, for example, &quot;Book &#x27;em, murder one.&quot; In many episodes, this was directed to Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams and became McGarrett&#x27;s catchphrase: &quot;Book &#x27;em, Danno.&quot; This catchphrase also expanded to sports in the mid-1970s with former Pittsburgh Penguins announcer Mike Lange, who would utter the line for some Penguins goals.

McGarrett&#x27;s tousled yet immaculate hairstyle, as well as his proclivity for wearing a dark suit and tie on all possible occasions (uncommon in the islands), rapidly entered popular culture. While the other members of &quot;Five-O&quot; &quot;dressed mainland&quot; much of the time, they also often wore local styles, such as the ubiquitous aloha shirt.

In many episodes (including the pilot), McGarrett is drawn into the world of international espionage and national intelligence. McGarrett&#x27;s nemesis is a rogue intelligence officer of the People&#x27;s Republic of China named Wo Fat. The communist rogue agent was played by veteran actor Khigh Dhiegh. In the show&#x27;s final episode in 1980, titled &quot;Woe to Wo Fat&quot;, McGarrett finally sees his foe go to jail.

Unlike the reboot, the show&#x27;s action and straightforward storytelling left little time for personal stories involving wives or girlfriends, though a two-part story in the first season dealt with the loss of McGarrett&#x27;s sister&#x27;s baby. Occasionally, a show would flash back to McGarrett&#x27;s younger years or to a romantic figure.

In the episode &quot;Number One with a Bullet, Part 2&quot;, McGarrett tells a criminal, &quot;It was a bastard like you who killed my father.&quot; His 42-year-old father had been run down and killed by someone who had just held up a supermarket. Because Steve McGarrett is also a commander in the Naval Reserve, he sometimes uses their resources to help investigate and solve crimes. The United States Navy as well as the U.S. Coast Guard provided some locations and resources for filming, hence the closing credits of some episodes acknowledge the assistance of the United States Navy. A 1975 episode involving Danno&#x27;s aunt, played by MacArthur&#x27;s mother Helen Hayes, provided a bit of Williams&#x27; back story.

==Creation of the show==
Sources differ on how the show came to be. Producer Leonard Freeman moved to Hawaiʻi to recuperate after suffering a heart attack. One source states the idea for the show may have come from a conversation Freeman had with Hawaiʻi&#x27;s then-Governor John A. Burns.

Another source instead claims that Freeman wanted to set a show in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California until his friend Richard Boone convinced him to shoot it entirely in Hawaiʻi. A third source claims Freeman discussed the show with Governor Burns only after pitching the idea to CBS. Before settling on the name &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, Freeman considered titling the show &quot;The Man&quot;.

===Casting===

Freeman offered Richard Boone the part of McGarrett, but Boone turned it down; Gregory Peck and Robert Brown were also considered. Ultimately, Jack Lord – then living in Beverly Hills – was asked at the last moment. Lord read for the part on a Wednesday, was cast, and flew to Hawaiʻi two days later. On the following Monday, Lord was in front of the cameras. Freeman and Lord had worked together previously on an unsold TV pilot called &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;.

Tim O&#x27;Kelly originated the role of Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams in the pilot episode, &quot;Cocoon&quot;. Test audiences apparently were not positive on O&#x27;Kelly, however, and the producers replaced him with James MacArthur.

Kam Fong Chun, an 18-year veteran of the Honolulu Police Department, auditioned for the part of the lead villain Wo Fat, but Freeman cast him in the part of Chin Ho Kelly instead. Freeman took the name Wo Fat from a restaurant in downtown Honolulu. The name Chin Ho came from Chinn Ho, the owner of the Ilikai Hotel where the penthouse shot of Steve McGarrett in the opening title sequence was taken. Richard Denning, who played the governor, had retired to Hawaiʻi and came out of retirement for the show. Zulu was a Waikīkī beach boy and local DJ with no acting experience when he was cast for the part of Kono, which he played for the next four years.

The first season was shot in a rusty military Quonset hut in Pearl City, which the various cast members quickly nicknamed &quot;Mongoose Manor&quot;. The roof tended to leak, and rats would often gnaw at the cables. The show then moved to a Fort Ruger location for seasons two to eight. A third studio was built at Diamond Head, and was used during the last four seasons.

A problem from the beginning was the lack of a movie industry in Hawaiʻi. Much of the crew and cast, including many locals who ended up participating in the show, had to learn their respective jobs as they went along. Jack Lord was known as a perfectionist who insisted on the best from everyone. His temper flared when he felt that others did not give their best, but in later reunions they admitted that Lord&#x27;s hard-driving force had made them better actors and made &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; a better show. Lord&#x27;s high standards helped the show last another six years after Leonard Freeman&#x27;s death from heart trouble during the sixth season.

To critics and viewers, there was no question that Jack Lord was the center of the show, and that the other actors frequently served as little more than props, standing and watching while McGarrett emoted and paced around his office, analyzing the crime. But occasionally episodes would focus on the other actors, and let them showcase their own talents, such as Danno defusing bombs in &quot;The Clock Struck Twelve&quot;.

Very few episodes were shot outside of Hawaiʻi. At least two episodes were shot on location in Los Angeles, one in Hong Kong, and one in Singapore as McGarrett traveled to those locales for Investigations.

==Credits==
The opening title sequence was created by television director Reza S. Badiyi. Early shows began with a cold open suggesting the sinister plot for that episode, then cut to a shot of a big ocean wave and the start of the theme song. A fast zoom-in to the top balcony of the Ilikai Hotel followed, showing McGarrett turning to face the camera, followed by many quick-cuts and freeze-frames of Hawaiian scenery, including Punchbowl Cemetery, and Hawaiian-Chinese-English model Elizabeth Malamalamaokalani Logue turning to face the camera. A grass-skirted hula dancer from the pilot episode was also included, played by Helen Kuoha-Torco, who later became a business professor at Windward Community College. The opening scene ended with shots of the supporting players, and the flashing blue light of a police motorcycle racing through a Honolulu street.

At the conclusion of each episode, Jack Lord narrated a promo for the next episode, often emphasizing the &quot;guest villain&quot;, especially if the villain is a recurring character, such as that played by actor Hume Cronyn (2 episodes). The line he spoke was, &quot;This is Jack Lord inviting you to be with us next week for &lt;name of episode&gt;&quot; and then, &quot;Be here. Aloha.&quot; The promos were removed from the syndicated episodes but most have been restored in DVD releases from the second season through the ninth. Most of the promos are slightly edited to remove references to &quot;next week&quot;.

This tradition has been continued in the 2010 version of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, but is not limited to Alex O&#x27;Loughlin. All of the primary cast members take turns with the &quot;Be here. Aloha.&quot; line at the end of the preview segment.

There were two versions of the closing credits portion of the show. During the first season, the theme music was played over a short film of a flashing blue light attached to the rear of a police motorcycle in Waikīkī heading west (the film is shown at twice the normal speed, as can be seen from people crossing a street behind the police motorcycle). In later seasons, the same music was played over film of outrigger canoeists battling the surf.

In a 2010 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the show&#x27;s opening title sequence ranked No. 4 on a list of TV&#x27;s top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.

==Legacy==
The show was the longest-running crime show on American television until &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; surpassed it in 2002, and was the first to enjoy an uninterrupted run that exceeded a decade (it has since been joined in that distinction by several other series including &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;).

When the show premiered in 1968, Hawaiʻi had been a state for only nine years and was relatively obscure to Americans who had never served in the Pacific Theater, but as a geographic part of Polynesia it had an exotic image.

Known for the location, theme song, and ensemble cast, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; contains a heavy use of exterior location shooting throughout the entire 12 seasons. A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot on location, as opposed to a &quot;typical&quot; show of the time which would be shot largely on sound stages and backlots. It is also remembered for its unusual setting during a time when most crime dramas of the era were set in or around the Los Angeles or New York City areas.

The Hawaii-based television show &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; was created after &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; ended its run, in order to make further use of the expensive production facilities created there for &quot;Five-O&quot;. The first few &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; episodes made direct references to &quot;Five-O&quot;, suggesting that it takes place in the same fictional setting. In Episode 10 of Season 2, &quot;The Taking of Dick McWilliams,&quot; Rick Wright answers Thomas Magnum when asked about a license plate search that the car belonged to someone on Five-O named McGarrett. &quot;Magnum&quot;″s producers made a few attempts to coax Jack Lord out of retirement for a cameo appearance, but he refused.

Many local people were cast in the show, which was ethnically diverse by the standards of the late 1960s. The first run and syndication were seen by an estimated 400 million people around the world.

&quot;Bored, She Hung Herself&quot;, the 16th episode of the second season, depicted a Five-O investigation into the apparent suicide of a woman by hanging, which she was supposedly practicing as part of a health regimen. A viewer reportedly died trying the same technique, and as a result, the episode was not rebroadcast, was never included in any syndication packages, and has not been included on any DVD release of the show to date. The family of the person who died in the real-life hanging sued CBS over the episode.

===Remake projects===
In July 1996, it was announced producer George Litto had partnered with Leonard Freeman&#x27;s estate and his widow, Rose, in developing a theatrical adaptation of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; with a $50 million-$70 million budget and franchise potential. For the lead role of Steve McGarrett, Litto expressed a desire for Mel Gibson, Michael Douglas or Harrison Ford while former McGarrett actor Jack Lord would play a Governor or Senator from Hawaii. Directors whom Litto expressed interest in helming the project included Andrew Davis, Brian De Palma, and Paul Verhoeven. Development on a feature film was stonewalled when CBS filed suit against the Freeman estate claiming ownership and usage of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; rested with them and not the Freemans. The suit was eventually settled in favor of Freeman and Litto.

A one-hour pilot for a new series was made in 1996 but never aired. Produced and written by Stephen J. Cannell, it starred Gary Busey and Russell Wong as the new Five-O team. James MacArthur returned as Dan Williams, having become governor of Hawaii. Several cameos were made by other &quot;Five-O&quot; regulars, including Kam Fong as Chin Ho Kelly (even though the character had been killed off at the end of Season 10).

A remake pilot, called &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (the last character is a zero instead of the letter &quot;O&quot;; the original series used an &quot;O&quot; as zero was typed as a capital O), aired September 20, 2010, on CBS. It lasted for 10 seasons until the 240th and final episode was aired on April 3, 2020. The remake version &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; used the same principal character names as the original, and the new Steve McGarrett&#x27;s late father&#x27;s vintage 1974 Mercury Marquis was the actual car driven by Lord in the original series&#x27; final seasons. The new series opening credit sequence was an homage to the original; the theme song was cut in half, from 60 to 30 seconds, but was an otherwise identical instrumentation. Most of the iconic shots were replicated, beginning with the helicopter approach and close-up turn of McGarrett at the Ilikai Hotel penthouse, the jet engine nacelle, a hula dancer&#x27;s hips, the quickly stepped zoom-in to the face of the Lady Columbia statue at Punchbowl, the close-up of the Kamehameha Statue&#x27;s face, and the ending with a police motorcycle&#x27;s flashing blue light. The surname of recurring character Governor Sam Denning (played by Richard T. Jones) was a nod to actor Richard Denning, who played the Governor in the original series. Starting with Season 7, many of the clips that were part of the original opening were removed and more action shots of the cast were included. On the March 19, 2012 episode, Ed Asner reprised his role as &quot;August March&quot;, a character he first played in a 1975 episode. Clips from the 1975 episode were included in the new one, even though the 2010 series was intended to be in a different narrative universe than the Jack Lord series. The 2016 episode &quot;Makaukau ʻoe e Paʻani?&quot; features a sequence in which McGarrett (played by Alex O&#x27;Loughlin) briefly interacts with a CGI reconstruction of Jack Lord.

===Theme music===

Another legacy of the show is the popularity of the &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; theme music. The tune was composed by Morton Stevens, who also composed numerous episode scores performed by the CBS Orchestra. The theme was later recorded by the Ventures, whose version reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart, and is particularly popular with college and high school marching bands, especially at the University of Hawaiʻi where it has become the unofficial fight song. The tune has also been heard at Robertson Stadium after Houston Dynamo goals scored by Brian Ching, a native of Hawaii. Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of Northern soul and was popular on dance floors in the 1970s.

===Slang term for police===
The phrase &quot;five-O&quot; (or any variation, such as &quot;5–0&quot;, &quot;5-O&quot;, and &quot;five O&quot;) ) has often come to refer to the police in the United States.

===Syndication===
&quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; survived long enough to overlap with reruns of early episodes, which were broadcast by CBS in their late night schedule while new episodes were still being produced. Once the program entered syndication after the original run of the series, CBS broadcast reruns of season 12 in late night under the title &quot;McGarrett&quot; to avoid confusion with the episodes in syndication broadcast under the title &quot;Hawaii Five-O.&quot; 
In the United Kingdom, the series first aired on ITV on July 19, 1970, in a Saturday evening time slot.

In Hawaii, reruns of the series aired on 13 Alanui beginning on August 1, 2001 (the day 13 Alanui began broadcasting) and continued until December 30, 2011.

From September 2021 to mid October 2023, the series aired in Ontario, Canada intermittently weekdays either at 1pm or 2pm on CHCH TV 11. CHCH did air the HD remastered version of the series in its original unedited broadcast versions. CHCH did air all 12 seasons in broadcast order.

Since 2023, the series first 10 seasons streams three episodes per day on Pluto TV in Canada. Episodes are also remastered in HD and uncut.

==Other media==
A soundtrack album featuring Morton Stevens&#x27; theme and incidental music from the pilot and the first two seasons was issued by Capitol Records in 1970. Unlike many albums of television music of the time, the music was taken directly from the scoring sessions rather than being specially re-recorded for album release. One of the instrumental pieces on the album, &quot;Call to Danger&quot;, was originally recorded for the unsold 1967 pilot of the same name and also excerpted as background music accompanying a &quot;Special Presentation&quot; logo that CBS used to introduce its prime time television specials throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The album was re-issued on compact disc by Film Score Monthly in 2010.

<text>Bobsleigh or bobsled is a winter sport in which teams of 2 to 4 athletes make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sleigh. International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (formerly the FIBT).

The first bobsleds were built in the late 19th century in St. Moritz, Switzerland, by wealthy tourists from Victorian Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt. The early sleds were adapted from boys&#x27; delivery sleds and toboggans. These eventually evolved into bobsleighs, luges and skeletons. Initially the tourists would race their hand-built contraptions down the narrow streets of St. Moritz; however, as collisions increased, growing opposition from St. Moritz residents led to bobsledding being eventually banned from public highways. In the winter of 1884, Badrutt had a purpose-built run constructed near the hamlet of Cresta. The Cresta Run remains the oldest in the world and is the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club. It has hosted two Olympic Winter Games and as of 2022 was still in use.

Modern bobsleigh teams compete to complete a downhill route in the fastest times. An aggregate time from several runs is used to determine the winners. The four-man event has been featured since the first Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France. The only exception was the 1960 games in Squaw Valley (now known as Olympic Valley), California, United States, when the organizing committee decided not to build a track to reduce costs. The two-man event was introduced at the 1932 games and a two-woman event was first contested at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The women&#x27;s monobob event was introduced in the 2022 games.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the action some early competitors adopted of bobbing back and forth inside their sleds to increase speed.

==History==

===Origins===

Although sledding on snow or ice had long been popular in many northern countries, the origins of bobsleighing as a modern sport are relatively recent. It developed after hotelier Caspar Badrutt (1848–1904) convinced some wealthy English regular guests to remain through the entire winter at his hotel in the mineral spa town of St. Moritz, Switzerland. He had been frustrated that his hotel was only busy during the summer months. By keeping his guests entertained with food, alcohol and activities, he quickly established the concept of &quot;winter resorting&quot;. Within a few years, wintering at Badrutt&#x27;s St. Moritz hotel became very fashionable in Victorian Britain. However, with increased numbers this led some guests to search for new diversions. In the early 1870s some adventurous Englishmen began adapting boys&#x27; delivery sleds for recreational purposes.

However, when they began colliding with pedestrians in the icy lanes, alleyways and roads of St. Moritz, this led to the invention of &quot;steering means&quot; for the sleds. The basic bobsleigh (bobsled) consisted of two crestas (skeleton sleds) attached together with a board that had a steering mechanism at the front. The ability to steer meant the sleds could make longer runs through the town. Longer runs also meant higher speeds on curves. Local sentiment about these informal competitions varied, but eventually complaints grew so vociferous that Badrutt had to do something. His solution, in the late 1870s, was to build a basic natural-ice run for his guests outside the town near the small hamlet named Cresta. He took action because he did not want to make enemies in the town, and he had worked hard and invested a lot of time and money in popularizing wintering in St. Moritz, so he was not going to let boredom induce customers not to visit the area.

===Competitive discipline===
Formal competitions began down the natural-ice Cresta Run in 1884, which was built in an annual partnership between guests and local people. The run, which was still in operation , has served as a host track for skeleton at two Winter Olympic Games (1928 and 1948). As one of the few natural weather tracks in the world, it does not use artificial refrigeration. It is not known how much the original track evolved in the early years as the three sports matured and stabilized. The first club was formed in 1897, and the first purpose-built track solely for bobsleds opened in 1902 outside St. Moritz. Over the years, bobsleigh tracks evolved from straight runs to twisting and turning tracks. The original wooden sleds gave way to streamlined fiberglass and metal ones.

The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was founded in 1923. Men&#x27;s four-man bobsleigh appeared in the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924, and the men&#x27;s two-man bobsleigh event was added in 1932. Though not included in the 1960 Winter Olympics, bobsleigh has featured in every Winter Olympics since. Women&#x27;s bobsleigh competition began in the US in 1983 with two demonstration races in Lake Placid, New York, one held in February and the second held during the World Cup races in March 1983. Two-woman bobsleigh made its Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Bobsleigh is also contested at American, European, and World Cup championships.

Germany and Switzerland have proven the most successful bobsleighing nations, measured by overall success in European, World, World Cup, and Olympic championships. Since the 1990s Germans have dominated in international competition, having won more medals than any other nation. Italy, Austria, Canada and the United States also have strong bobsleigh traditions.

Bobsleighs can attain speeds of , with the reported world record being set on March 3, 2019 at the Whistler World Championships in 2019.

==Modern era==
===Tracks===
Modern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. They are required to have at least one straight section and one labyrinth (three turns in quick succession without a straight section). Ideally, a modern track should be long and have at least fifteen curves. Speeds may exceed , and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 &quot;g&quot;.

Some bobsleigh tracks are also used for luge and skeleton competition.

Some tracks offer tourists rides in bobsleighs, including those at Sigulda, Latvia; Innsbruck-Igls, Austria; Whistler, British Columbia, Canada; Lillehammer, Norway; Cesana Pariol, Italy; Lake Placid, US; Salt Lake City, Utah, US; and La Plagne, France.

===Sleighs and crews===

Modern-day sleighs combine light metals, steel runners, and an aerodynamic composite body. Competition sleighs must be a maximum of long (4-crew) or long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Nowadays the maximum weight, including crew, is (4-man), (2-man), or (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights. The bobsleighs themselves are designed to be as light as possible to allow dynamic positioning of mass through the turns of the bobsleigh course.

Although bobsleighs once were ridden by five or six, crews were reduced in the 1930s to either two or four people. The four-person crew consists of a pilot, a brakeman, and two pushers. Athletes are selected for their speed and strength, which are necessary to push the sleigh to a competitive speed at the start of the race. Pilots must have the skill, timing, and finesse to steer the sleigh along the path, or &quot;line&quot;, that will produce the greatest speed.

In modern bobsleighs, the steering system consists of two metal rings that actuate a pulley system located in the forward cowling that turns the front runners. For example, to turn left, the pilot would pull the left ring. Only subtle steering adjustments are necessary to guide the sled; at speeds up to , anything larger would result in a crash. The pilot does most of the steering, and the brakeman stops the sled after crossing the finish line by pulling the sled&#x27;s brake lever.

Women compete in women&#x27;s bobsleigh (which is always two-woman) and men in both two- and four-man competitions. Women were confirmed as being able to compete in any four-&quot;man&quot; bobsleigh event, as from 25 September 2014, either as part of a mixed-sex team or an all-female team. However, because women are on average lighter than men (and thus at a competitive disadvantage in a gravity sport), and because most sliding nations have fewer women able to compete than men, this option has not proved popular with teams.

===Monobob===
A single-person bobsleigh is called a &quot;monobob&quot;. Single-person sleds were introduced into international competition for both adaptive bobsleigh (for athletes who are able to drive a sled but not push) and as a youth sport (for younger athletes who have not yet developed the ability to push a heavy two- or four-person sled). After the 2018 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee and the IBSF agreed to add women&#x27;s monobob as an Olympic sport for the 2022 Winter Olympics, so that there would be an equal number of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s events in bobsleigh.

Prior to the 2020–21 competitive season, monobobs were traditionally constructed on one-piece chassis. Starting with the 2020–21 season, competitors in IBSF-sanctioned races must use articulated (two-section) monobobs manufactured by the IBSF&#x27;s sole source sled builder, iXent. The sled must weigh a minimum of without the athlete (but including timing equipment and any ballast weights) and a maximum of including the athlete; runners are the same as for two-person bobsleighs. This implies a maximum athlete weight limit of .

===Racing===
Individual runs down the course, or &quot;heats&quot;, begin from a standing start, with the crew pushing the sled for up to before boarding; though the pilot does not steer, grooves in the ice make steering unnecessary until the sled leaves the starting area. While poor form during the initial push can lose a team the heat, it is otherwise rarely, if ever, decisive. Over the rest of the course, a sleigh&#x27;s speed depends on its weight, aerodynamics, runners, the condition of the ice, and the skill of the pilot.

Race times are recorded in hundredths of seconds, so even seemingly minor errors – especially those at the beginning, which affect the remainder of the heat – can have a measurable impact on the final race standings.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s standings for normal races are calculated over the aggregate of two runs or heats. At the Olympic Winter Games and World Championships, all competitions (for both men and women) consist of four heats.

==Safety==
===Brain trauma===
Sledding at a competitive level involves sledders repeatedly subjecting themselves to high-G forces and multiple small collisions of their head into their helmet as sharp turns are taken. Additionally, when mistakes happen and the sled crashes, there are no &quot;seatbelts&quot; or other protections; the sledders can simply be falling down the course at high speed with their helmet grinding along the surface or bouncing off the interior of the sled. One sledder described his experience during crashes as being equivalent to his head being inside a jet engine. Even ignoring crashes, repetitive shaking from small imperfections in the course is hypothesized to cause small tears in the brain, especially if performed repeatedly. The culture of competitive bobsledders (especially before this danger was recognized) also made injured participants hesitant to speak up and request breaks, fearful of being dropped from the team. Bobsledders who train frequently have reported issues such as chronic headaches, a heightened sensitivity to bright lights and loud noises, forgetfulness, a &quot;mental fog&quot;, and psychological problems. Repeated mild brain trauma has caused issues for boxers, rugby players, and football players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and fears have arisen that bobsledding carries a similar danger, at least with the steeper and faster courses used in competitions. A brain scan of one bobsledder, Christina Smith, revealed damage to the rear and frontal lobes, consistent with micro-tears in the brain&#x27;s white matter.

A significant number of athletes have either died by suicide or died of drug overdoses. Examples include medal-winning bobsledders Eugenio Monti and Pavle Jovanovic, who died by suicide; Steven Holcomb died of an overdose. Since 2013, three North American former bobsledders have taken their lives, another attempted it, and two others died of overdoses; this is far over expectation of the group from chance, as only a few hundred athletes participate seriously in bobsled and other sliding sports such as luge and skeleton at any one time.

<text>An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; it includes some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus&#x27;s history difficult to resolve.

Ecologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls, roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple, and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.

In culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.

== Etymology ==

The generic name &quot;Quercus&quot; is Latin for &quot;oak&quot;, derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*kwerkwu-&quot;, &quot;oak&quot;, which is also the origin of the name &quot;fir&quot;, another important or sacred tree in Indo-European culture. The word &quot;cork&quot;, for the bark of the cork oak, similarly derives from &quot;Quercus&quot;. The common name &quot;oak&quot; is from Old English &quot;ac&quot; (seen in placenames such as Acton, from &quot;ac&quot; + &quot;tun&quot;, &quot;oak village&quot;), which in turn is from Proto-Germanic &quot;*aiks&quot;, &quot;oak&quot;.

== Description ==

Oaks are hardwood (dicotyledonous) trees, deciduous or evergreen, with spirally arranged leaves, often with lobate margins; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male and female flowers. The staminate (male) flowers are arranged in catkins, while the small pistillate (female) flowers produce an acorn (a kind of nut) contained in a cupule. Each acorn usually contains one seed and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on the species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, which helps to guard against fungi and insects. There are some 500 extant species of oaks.

Trees in the genus are often large and slow-growing; &quot;Q. alba&quot; can reach an age of 600 years, a diameter of and a height of . The Granit oak in Bulgaria, a &quot;Q. robur&quot; specimen, has an estimated age of 1,637 years, making it the oldest oak in Europe. The Wi&#x27;aaSal tree, a live oak in the reservation of the Pechanga Band of Indians, California, is at least 1,000 years old, and might be as much as 2,000 years old, which would make it the oldest oak in the US. Among the smallest oaks is &quot;Q. acuta&quot;, the Japanese evergreen oak. It forms a bush or small tree to a height of some .

== Distribution ==

The genus &quot;Quercus&quot; is native to the Northern Hemisphere and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico, of which 109 are endemic, and about 90 in the United States. The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.

In the Americas, &quot;Quercus&quot; is widespread from Vancouver and Nova Scotia in the south of Canada, south to Mexico and across the whole of the eastern United States. It is present in a small area of the west of Cuba; in Mesoamerica it occurs mainly above . The genus crossed the isthmus of Panama when the northern and southern continents came together and is present as one species, &quot;Q. humboldtii&quot;, above 1,000 metres in Colombia. The oaks of North America are of many sections (&quot;Protobalanus&quot;, &quot;Lobatae&quot;, &quot;Ponticae&quot;, &quot;Quercus&quot;, and &quot;Virentes&quot;) along with related genera such as &quot;Notholithocarpus&quot;.

In the Old World, oaks of section &quot;Quercus&quot; extend across the whole of Europe including European Russia apart from the far north, and north Africa (north of the Sahara) from Morocco to Libya. In Mediterranean Europe, they are joined by oaks of the sections &quot;Cerris&quot; and &quot;Ilex&quot;, which extend across Turkey, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan&quot;,&quot; while section &quot;Ponticae&quot; is endemic to the western Caucasus in Turkey and Georgia. Oaks of section &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; extend in a narrow belt along the Himalayas to cover mainland and island Southeast Asia as far as Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Palawan. Finally, oaks of multiple sections (&quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot;, &quot;Ilex&quot;, &quot;Cerris&quot;, &quot;Quercus&quot; and related genera like &quot;Lithocarpus&quot; and &quot;Castanopsis&quot;) extend across east Asia including China, Korea, and Japan.

== Evolution ==

=== Fossil history ===

Potential records of &quot;Quercus&quot; have been reported from Late Cretaceous deposits in North America and East Asia. These are not considered definitive, as macrofossils older than the Paleogene, and possibly from before the Eocene are mostly poorly preserved without critical features for certain identification. Amongst the oldest unequivocal records of &quot;Quercus&quot; are pollen from Austria, dating to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, around 55 million years ago. The oldest records of &quot;Quercus&quot; in North America are from Oregon, dating to the Middle Eocene, around 44 million years ago, with the oldest records in Asia from the Middle Eocene of Japan; both forms have affinities to the &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; group.

=== External phylogeny ===

&quot;Quercus&quot; forms part, or rather two parts, of the Quercoideae subfamily of the Fagaceae, the beech family. Modern molecular phylogenetics suggests the following relationships:

=== Internal phylogeny ===

Molecular techniques for phylogenetic analysis show that the genus &quot;Quercus&quot; consisted of Old World and New World clades. The entire genome of &quot;Quercus robur&quot; (the pedunculate oak) has been sequenced, revealing an array of mutations that may underlie the evolution of longevity and disease resistance in oaks. In addition, hundreds of oak species have been compared (at RAD-seq loci), allowing a detailed phylogeny to be constructed. However, the high signal of introgressive hybridization (the transfer of genetic material by repeated backcrossing with hybrid offspring) in the genus has made it difficult to resolve an unambiguous, unitary history of oaks. The phylogeny from Hipp et al. 2019 is:

=== Taxonomy ===

==== Taxonomic history ====

The genus &quot;Quercus&quot; was circumscribed by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of his 1753 &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. He described 15 species within the new genus, providing type specimens for 10 of these, and giving names but no types for &quot;Q. cerris&quot;, &quot;Q. coccifera&quot;, &quot;Q. ilex&quot;, &quot;Q. smilax&quot;, and &quot;Q. suber&quot;. He chose &quot;Q. robur&quot;, the pedunculate oak, as the type species for the genus.

A 2017 classification of &quot;Quercus&quot;, based on multiple molecular phylogenetic studies, divided the genus into two subgenera and eight sections:

*Subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot; – the New World clade (or high-latitude clade), mostly native to North America
**Section &quot;Lobatae&quot; – North American red oaks
**Section &quot;Protobalanus&quot; – North American intermediate oaks
**Section &quot;Ponticae&quot; – with a disjunct distribution between western Eurasia and western North America
**Section &quot;Virentes&quot; – American southern live oaks
**Section &quot;Quercus&quot; – white oaks from North America and Eurasia
*Subgenus &quot;Cerris&quot; – the Old World clade (or mid-latitude clade), exclusively native to Eurasia
**Section &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; – cycle-cup oaks of East Asia
**Section &quot;Cerris&quot; – cerris oaks of subtropical and temperate Eurasia and North Africa
**Section &quot;Ilex&quot; – ilex oaks of tropical and subtropical Eurasia and North Africa
The subgenus division supports the evolutionary diversification of oaks among two distinct clades: the Old World clade (subgenus &quot;Cerris&quot;), including oaks that diversified in Eurasia; and the New World clade (subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot;), oaks that diversified mainly in the Americas.

==== Subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot; ====

* Sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot; (synonym &quot;Erythrobalanus&quot;), the red oaks of North America, Central America and northern South America. Styles are long; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The actual nut is encased in a thin, clinging, papery skin. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe.
* Sect. &quot;Protobalanus&quot;, the canyon live oak and its relatives, in the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico. Styles are short; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
* Sect. &quot;Ponticae,&quot; a disjunct including just two species. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves have large stipules, high secondary veins, and are highly toothed.
* Sect. &quot;Virentes,&quot; the southern live oaks of the Americas. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves are evergreen or subevergreen.
* Sect. &quot;Quercus&quot; (synonyms &quot;Lepidobalanus&quot; and &quot;Leucobalanus&quot;), the white oaks of Europe, Asia and North America. Trees or shrubs that produce nuts, specifically acorns, as fruits. Acorns mature in one year for annual trees and two years for biannual trees. Acorn is encapsulated by a spiny cupule as characterized by the family Fagaceae. Flowers in the &quot;Quercus&quot; genera produce one flower per node, with three or six styles, as well as three or six ovaries, respectively. The leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips, which are usually rounded. The type species is &quot;Quercus robur&quot;.

==== Subgenus &quot;Cerris&quot; ====

The type species is &quot;Quercus cerris&quot;.
* Sect. &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot;, the ring-cupped oaks of eastern and southeastern Asia. These are evergreen trees growing tall. They are distinct from subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot; in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. Species of &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests, which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of the genus &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and the laurel family (Lauraceae).
* Sect. &quot;Cerris&quot;, the Turkey oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles are long; acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn&#x27;s shell is hairless. Its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
* Sect. &quot;Ilex&quot;, the Ilex oak and its relatives of Eurasia and northern Africa. Styles are medium-long; acorns mature in 12–24 months, appearing hairy on the inside. The leaves are evergreen, with bristle-like extensions on the teeth.

== Ecology ==

Oaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They are important components of hardwood forests; some species grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak–heath forests. Several kinds of truffles, including two well-known varieties – black Périgord truffle and the white Piedmont truffle – have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. Similarly, many other fungi, such as &quot;Ramaria flavosaponaria&quot;, associate with oaks.

Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillars, an important food source for many birds. Mature oak trees shed widely varying numbers of acorns (known collectively as mast) annually, with large quantities in mast years. This may be a predator satiation strategy, increasing the chance that some acorns will survive to germination.

Animals including squirrels and jays – Eurasian jays in the Old World, blue jays in North America – feed on acorns, and are important agents of seed dispersal as they carry the acorns away and bury many of them as food stores. However, some species of squirrel selectively excise the embryos from the acorns that they store, meaning that the food store lasts longer and that the acorns will never germinate.

=== Hybridisation ===

Interspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks, but usually between species within the same section only, and most common in the white oak group. White oaks cannot discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring. Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.

Frequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with much introgression and the evolution of new species. Introgression has caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information. As a result, genetic data often does not differentiate between clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations. The maintenance of particular loci for adaptation to ecological niches may explain the retention of species identity despite significant gene flow.

The Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a slowly-evolving clade compared to other angiosperms, and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in &quot;Quercus&quot; pose a significant challenge to the concept of a species as a group of &quot;actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.&quot; By this definition, many species of &quot;Quercus&quot; would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and genetic data.

=== Diseases and pests ===

Oaks are affected by a large number of pests and diseases. For instance, &quot;Q. robur&quot; and &quot;Q. petraea&quot; in Britain host 423 insect species. This diversity includes 106 macro-moths, 83 micro-moths, 67 beetles, 53 cynipoidean wasps, 38 heteropteran bugs, 21 auchenorrhynchan bugs, 17 sawflies, and 15 aphids. The insect numbers are seasonal: in spring, chewing insects such as caterpillars become numerous, followed by insects with sucking mouthparts such as aphids, then by leaf miners, and finally by gall wasps such as &quot;Neuroterus&quot;. Several powdery mildews affect oak species. In Europe, the species &quot;Erysiphe alphitoides&quot; is the most common. It reduces the ability of leaves to photosynthesize, and infected leaves are shed early.
Another significant threat, the oak processionary moth (&quot;Thaumetopoea processionea&quot;), has emerged in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems. A little-understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has affected the UK since 2009. 
In California, goldspotted oak borer (&quot;Agrilus auroguttatus&quot;) has destroyed many oak trees, while sudden oak death, caused by the oomycete pathogen &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, has devastated oaks in California and Oregon, and is present in Europe. Japanese oak wilt, caused by the fungus &quot;Raffaelea quercivora&quot;, has rapidly killed trees across Japan.

=== Gall communities ===

Many galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, and roots. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall. These galls are the handiwork of tiny wasps from the Cynipidae. In a complex ecological relationship, these gall wasps become hosts to parasitoid wasps—primarily from the order Chalcidoidea—which lay their larvae inside the gall wasps, ultimately leading to the hosts&#x27; demise. Additionally, inquilines live commensally within the galls without harming the gall wasps.

== Toxicity ==

The leaves and acorns of oaks are poisonous to livestock, including cattle and horses, if eaten in large amounts, due to the toxin tannic acid, which causes kidney damage and gastroenteritis. An exception is the domestic pig, which, under the right conditions, may be fed entirely on acorns, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish &quot;dehesa&quot; and the English system of pannage). Humans can eat acorns after leaching out the tannins in water.

== Uses ==

=== Timber ===

Oak timber is a strong and hard wood with many uses, such as for furniture, floors, building frames, and veneers.
The wood of a red oak &quot;Quercus cerris&quot; (the Turkey oak) has better mechanical properties than those of the white oaks &quot;Q. petraea&quot; and &quot;Q. robur&quot;; the heartwood and sapwood have similar mechanical properties. Of the North American red oaks, the northern red oak, &quot;Quercus rubra&quot;, is highly prized for lumber.
The wood is resistant to insect and fungal attack.

Wood from &quot;Q. robur&quot; and &quot;Q. petraea&quot; was used in Europe for shipbuilding, especially of naval men of war, until the 19th century. In hill states of India such as Uttarakhand, along with being used for fuelwood and timber, oak wood is used for agricultural implements, while the leaves serve as fodder for livestock during lean periods.

=== Other traditional products ===

Oak bark, with its high tannin content, was traditionally used in the Old World for tanning leather. Oak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink for manuscripts, harvested at a specific time of year. In Korea, sawtooth oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction. The dried bark of the white oak was used in traditional medical preparations; its tannic acid content made it astringent and antiseptic. Acorns have been ground to make a flour, and roasted for acorn coffee.

=== Culinary ===

Barrels for aging wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy and Scotch whisky are made from oak, with single barrel malt whiskies fetching a premium. The use of oak in wine adds a range of flavours. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to their contents&#x27; colour, taste, and aroma, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour. A dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;, &quot;Q. petraea&quot;) give greater refinement and are chosen for the best, most expensive wines. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces a more powerful bouquet.

Oak wood chips are used for smoking foods such as fish, meat, and cheese. 
In Japan, Children&#x27;s Day is celebrated with rice cakes, filled with a sweet red bean paste, and wrapped in a oak leaf.
The bark of the cork oak is used to produce cork stoppers for wine bottles. This species grows around the Mediterranean Sea; Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco produce most of the world&#x27;s supply.

Acorns of various oak species have been used as food for millennia, in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and among the native peoples of North America. In North Africa, acorns have been pressed to make acorn oil: the oil content can be as high as 30%. Oaks have also been used as fodder, both leaves and acorns being fed to livestock such as pigs. Given their high tannin content, acorns have often been leached to remove tannins before use as fodder.

== Conservation ==

An estimated 31% of the world&#x27;s oak species are threatened with extinction, while 41% of oak species are considered to be of conservation concern. The countries with the highest numbers of threatened oak species (as of 2020) are China with 36 species, Mexico with 32 species, Vietnam with 20 species, and the US with 16 species. Leading causes are climate change and invasive pests in the US, and deforestation and urbanization in Asia. 
In the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine trees due to global warming. The associated pine forest species may cross frontiers and integrate into the oak forests. 
Over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America, and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood, and charcoal. In the US, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests. However, disturbance-tolerant oaks may have benefited from grazers like bison, and suffered when the bison were removed following European colonization.

==Culture==

=== Symbols ===

The oak is a widely used symbol of strength and endurance. It is the national tree of many countries, including the US, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (golden oak), Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales. Ireland&#x27;s fifth-largest city, Derry, is named for the tree, from . Oak branches are displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the euro.
Oak leaves symbolize rank in armed forces including those of the United States. Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns, and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy staff corps officers. The oak tree is used as a symbol by several political parties and organisations. It is the symbol of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland.

=== Religion ===

The prehistoric Indo-European tribes worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder god, and this tradition descended to many classical cultures. In Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus&#x27;s oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak&#x27;s leaves. Mortals who destroyed such trees were said to be punished by the gods since the ancient Greeks believed beings called hamadryads inhabited them. In Norse and Baltic mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder gods Thor and Perkūnas respectively. In Celtic polytheism, the name druid, Celtic priest, is connected to Proto-Indo-European &quot;*deru&quot;, meaning oak or tree. Veneration of the oak survives in Serbian Orthodox Church tradition. Christmas celebrations include the &quot;badnjak&quot;, a branch taken from a young and straight oak ceremonially felled early on Christmas Eve morning, similar to a yule log.

=== History ===
: Category: &quot;Individual oak trees&quot;

Several oak trees hold cultural importance; such as the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica oak in the Basque Country. &quot;The Proscribed Royalist, 1651&quot;, a famous painting by John Everett Millais, depicts a Royalist hiding in an oak tree while fleeing from Cromwell&#x27;s forces.

In the Roman Republic, a crown of oak leaves was given to those who had saved the life of a citizen in battle; it was called the &quot;Civic Crown&quot;. In his 17th century poem &quot;The Garden&quot;, Andrew Marvell critiqued the desire to be awarded such a leafy crown: &quot;How vainly men themselves amaze / To win the palm, the oak, or bays; And their uncessant labors see / Crowned from some single herb or tree, ...&quot;

<text>Frederick Barbarossa (December 1122 – 10 June 1190), also known as Frederick I (; ), was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1155 until his death in 1190. He was elected King of Germany in Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March 1152. He was crowned King of Italy on 24 April 1155 in Pavia and emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155 in Rome. Two years later, the term &#x27; (&quot;holy&quot;) first appeared in a document in connection with his empire. He was later formally crowned [[King of Burgundy]], at [[Arles]] on 30 June 1178. He was named by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means &quot;red beard&quot; in Italian; in German, he was known as&#x27;, which in English means &quot;Emperor Redbeard&quot;. The prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns under his reign.

Frederick was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147–1152, as Frederick III) before his imperial election in 1152. He was the son of Duke Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Judith, daughter of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf. Frederick, therefore, descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire&#x27;s prince-electors. Frederick joined the Third Crusade and opted to travel overland to the Holy Land. In 1190, Frederick drowned attempting to cross the Saleph River, leading to most of his army abandoning the Crusade before reaching Acre.

Historians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen, and his political perspicacity. His contributions to Central European society and culture include the re-establishment of the &quot;&quot;, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the Investiture controversy. Due to his popularity and notoriety, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he was used as a political symbol by many movements and regimes: the Risorgimento, the Wilhelmine government in Germany (especially under Emperor Wilhelm I), and the Nazi movement (Operation Barbarossa, Barbarossa decree) resulting in mixed legacies. Modern researchers, while exploring the legacy of Frederick, attempt to untangle legend from historical reality—these efforts result in new perspectives on both the emperor as a person and the social developments associated with him.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frederick was born in mid-December 1122 in Haguenau, to Frederick II, Duke of Swabia and Judith of Bavaria. His father was from the Hohenstaufen family, and his mother was from the Welf family, the two most powerful families in Germany. The Hohenstaufens were often called Ghibellines, which derives from the Italianized name for Waiblingen castle, the family seat in Swabia; the Welfs, in a similar Italianization, were called Guelfs. Frederick was also a descendant of the Salian dynasty through his paternal grandmother Agnes as she was the daughter of Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy. He also had ties to the Salians through his mother Judith as she hailed from Emperor Otto II and his wife Theophanu. Therefore, Frederick carried on the bloodline of Emperor Otto the Great and his wives, Eadgyth and Adelaide. He learned to ride, hunt and use weapons at an early age, but could neither read nor write, and was also unable to speak the Latin language until later in life. He took part in several &quot;Hoftage&quot; during the reign of his uncle, King Conrad III, which were a form of informal and irregular assembly popular among the nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. One took place in 1141 in Strasbourg, another in 1142 in Konstanz, 1143 in Ulm, 1144 in Würzburg and 1145 in Worms.

===Second Crusade===
In early 1147, Frederick decided to join the Second Crusade after his uncle, King Conrad III, had taken the crusader vow in public on 28 December 1146. Frederick&#x27;s father, Duke Frederick II, strongly objected to this and according to Otto of Freising, the duke berated his brother for permitting his son to go. The elder Frederick, who was dying, expected his son to look after his widow and younger half-brother once he had passed on, not risk his life by going on a crusade. Perhaps in preparation for the crusade, Frederick married Adelaide of Vohburg sometime before March 1147. His father died on 4 or 6 April and Frederick succeeded him as the Duke of Swabia. The German crusader army departed from Regensburg seven weeks later.

In August 1147, while crossing the Byzantine Empire, an ill crusader stopped in a monastery outside Adrianople to recuperate. There he was robbed and killed. Conrad ordered Frederick to avenge him. The duke of Swabia razed the monastery, captured and executed the robbers and demanded they return the stolen money. The intervention of the Byzantine general Prosuch prevented further escalation. A few weeks later, on 8 September, Frederick and Welf VI were among the few German crusaders who survived when a flash flood destroyed the main camp. They had decided to encamp on a hill a ways away from the main army. The remains of the army reached Constantinople the following day.

Conrad III attempted to lead the army across Anatolia but finding this too difficult in the face of constant Turkish attacks near Dorylaeum, decided to turn back. The rearguard was subsequently annihilated. Conrad sent Frederick ahead to inform King Louis VII of France of the disaster and ask for help. The two armies, French and German, then advanced together. When Conrad fell ill around Christmas in Ephesus, he returned to Constantinople by ship with his personal retinue, which included Frederick. With Byzantine ships and money, the German army once again left Constantinople on 7 March 1148 and arrived in Acre on 11 April. After Easter, Conrad and Frederick visited Jerusalem, where Frederick was impressed by the charitable works of the Knights Hospitaller. He took part in the council of Acre on 24 June, where a decision was reached that the crusaders would attack Damascus.
The Siege of Damascus (24–28 July) lasted a mere five days and ended in failure. Gilbert of Mons, writing fifty years later, recorded that Frederick &quot;prevailed in arms before all others in front of Damascus&quot;. On 8 September, the German army sailed out of Acre. On the route home, Conrad III and Frederick stopped in Thessaloniki where they swore oaths to uphold the treaty that Conrad had agreed with Emperor Manuel I Komnenos the previous winter. This treaty obligated the Germans to attack King Roger II of Sicily in cooperation with the Byzantines. After confirming the treaty, Frederick was sent ahead to Germany. He passed through Bulgaria and Hungary and arrived in Germany in April 1149.

===Election===

When Conrad died in February 1152, only Frederick and the prince-bishop of Bamberg were at his deathbed. Both asserted afterwards that Conrad had, in full possession of his mental faculties, handed the royal insignia to Frederick and indicated that he, rather than Conrad&#x27;s own six-year-old son, the future Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia, succeed him as king. Frederick energetically pursued the crown and at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 the kingdom&#x27;s princely electors designated him as the next German king. He was crowned King of the Romans at Aachen several days later, on 9 March 1152.
The reigns of Henry IV and Henry V left the status of the German empire in disarray, its power waning under the weight of the investiture controversy. For a quarter of a century following the death of Henry V in 1125, the German monarchy was largely a nominal title with no real power behind it. The king, chosen by the prince-electors, was given no resources outside those of his own duchy, and he was at the same time prevented from exercising any real authority or leadership. The royal title was furthermore passed from one family to another to preclude the development of any dynastic interest in the German crown. When Frederick was chosen as king in 1152, royal power had been in effective abeyance for over twenty-five years, and to a considerable degree for more than eighty years. The only real claim to wealth lay in the rich cities of northern Italy, which were still within the nominal control of the German king. The Salian line had died out with the death of Henry V in 1125, and the German princes refused to give the crown to his nephew, the duke of Swabia, for fear he would try to regain the imperial power held by Henry V. Instead, they chose Lothair III (1125–1137), who found himself embroiled in a long-running dispute with the Hohenstaufens, and who married into the Welfs. One of the Hohenstaufens gained the throne as Conrad III of Germany (1137–1152). When Frederick Barbarossa succeeded his uncle in 1152, there seemed to be excellent prospects for ending the feud, since he was a Welf on his mother&#x27;s side. The Welf duke of Saxony, Henry the Lion, would not be appeased, however, remaining an implacable enemy of the Hohenstaufen monarchy. Barbarossa had the duchies of Swabia and Franconia, the force of his own personality, and very little else to construct an empire.

The Germany that Frederick tried to unite was a patchwork of more than 1,600 individual states, each with its own prince. A few of these, such as Bavaria and Saxony, were large. Many were too small to pinpoint on a map. The titles afforded to the German king were &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, and &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;. By the time Frederick would assume these, they were little more than propaganda slogans with little other meaning. Frederick was a pragmatist who dealt with the princes by finding a mutual self-interest. Unlike Henry II of England, Frederick did not attempt to end medieval feudalism, but rather tried to restore it, though this was beyond his ability. The great players in the German civil war had been the Pope, Emperor, Ghibellines and the Guelfs, but none of these had emerged as the winner.

===Rise to power===

Eager to restore the Empire to the position it had occupied under Charlemagne and Otto I the Great, the new king saw clearly that the restoration of order in Germany was a necessary preliminary to the enforcement of the imperial rights in Italy. Issuing a general order for peace, he made lavish concessions to the nobles. Abroad, Frederick intervened in the Danish civil war between Svend III and Valdemar I of Denmark and began negotiations with the Eastern Roman Emperor, Manuel I Comnenus. It was probably about this time that the king obtained papal assent for the annulment of his childless marriage with Adelheid of Vohburg, on the grounds of consanguinity (his great-great-grandfather was a brother of Adela&#x27;s great-great-great-grandmother, making them fourth cousins, once removed). He then made a vain attempt to obtain a bride from the court of Constantinople. On his accession, Frederick had communicated the news of his election to Pope Eugene III, but had neglected to ask for papal confirmation. In March 1153, Frederick concluded the Treaty of Constance with the Pope, wherein he promised, in return for his coronation, to defend the papacy, to make no peace with king Roger II of Sicily or other enemies of the Church without the consent of Eugene, and to help Eugene regain control of the city of Rome.

===First Italian Campaign: 1154–55===
Frederick undertook six expeditions into Italy. In the first, beginning in October 1154, his plan was to launch a campaign against the Normans under King William I of Sicily. He marched down and almost immediately encountered resistance to his authority. Obtaining the submission of Milan, he successfully besieged Tortona on 13 February 1155, razing it to the ground on 18 April. He moved on to Pavia, where he according to some historians received the Iron Crown and the title of King of Italy on 24 April in the Basilica of San Michele Maggiore. Other historians instead suggest his coronation took place in Monza on 15 April. Moving through Bologna and Tuscany, he was soon approaching the city of Rome. There, Pope Adrian IV was struggling with the forces of the republican city commune led by Arnold of Brescia, a student of Abelard. As a sign of good faith, Frederick dismissed the ambassadors from the revived Roman Senate, and Imperial forces suppressed the republicans. Arnold was captured and hanged for treason and rebellion. Despite his unorthodox teaching concerning theology, Arnold was not charged with heresy.

As Frederick approached the gates of Rome, the Pope advanced to meet him. At the royal tent the king received him, and after kissing the pope&#x27;s feet, Frederick expected to receive the traditional kiss of peace. Frederick had declined to hold the Pope&#x27;s stirrup while leading him to the tent, however, so Adrian refused to give the kiss until this protocol had been complied with. Frederick hesitated, and Adrian IV withdrew; after a day&#x27;s negotiation, Frederick agreed to perform the required ritual, reportedly muttering, &quot;&quot;Pro Petro, non Adriano&quot; – For Peter, not for Adrian.&quot; Rome was still in an uproar over the fate of Arnold of Brescia, so rather than marching through the streets of Rome, Frederick and Adrian retired to the Vatican.
The next day, 18 June 1155, Adrian IV crowned Frederick I Holy Roman Emperor at St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, amidst the acclamations of the German army. The Romans began to riot, and Frederick spent his coronation day putting down the revolt, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Romans and many more thousands injured. The next day, Frederick, Adrian, and the German army travelled to Tivoli. From there, a combination of the unhealthy Italian summer and the effects of his year-long absence from Germany meant he was forced to put off his planned campaign against the Normans of Sicily. On their way northwards, they attacked Spoleto and encountered the ambassadors of Manuel I Comnenus, who showered Frederick with costly gifts. At Verona, Frederick declared his fury with the rebellious Milanese before finally returning to Germany.

Disorder was again rampant in Germany, especially in Bavaria, but general peace was restored by Frederick&#x27;s vigorous, but conciliatory, measures. The duchy of Bavaria was transferred from Henry II Jasomirgott, margrave of Austria, to Frederick&#x27;s formidable younger cousin Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, of the House of Guelph, whose father had previously held both duchies. Henry II Jasomirgott was named Duke of Austria in compensation for his loss of Bavaria. As part of his general policy of concessions of formal power to the German princes and ending the civil wars within the kingdom, Frederick further appeased Henry by issuing him with the Privilegium Minus, granting him unprecedented entitlements as Duke of Austria. This was a large concession on the part of Frederick, who realized that Henry the Lion had to be accommodated, even to the point of sharing some power with him. Frederick could not afford to make an outright enemy of Henry.

On 9 June 1156 at Würzburg, Frederick married Beatrice of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Renaud III, thus adding to his possessions the sizeable realm of the County of Burgundy. In an attempt to create comity, Emperor Frederick proclaimed the Peace of the Land, written between 1152 and 1157, which enacted punishments for a variety of crimes, as well as systems for adjudicating many disputes. He also declared himself the sole Augustus of the Roman world, ceasing to recognise Manuel I at Constantinople.

===Second, Third and Fourth Italian Campaigns: 1158–1174===

The retreat of Frederick in 1155 forced Pope Adrian IV to come to terms with King William I of Sicily, granting to William I territories that Frederick viewed as his dominion. This aggrieved Frederick, and he was further displeased when Papal legates chose to interpret a letter from Adrian to Frederick in a manner that seemed to imply that the imperial crown was a gift from the Papacy and that in fact the Empire itself was a fief of the Papacy. Disgusted with the pope, and still wishing to crush the Normans in the south of Italy, in June 1158, Frederick set out upon his second Italian expedition, accompanied by Henry the Lion and his Saxon troops. This expedition resulted in the revolt and capture of Milan, the Diet of Roncaglia that saw the establishment of imperial officers and ecclesiastical reforms in the cities of northern Italy, and the beginning of the long struggle with Pope Alexander III. Milan soon rebelled again and humiliated Empress Beatrice (see Legend below).

The death of Pope Adrian IV in 1159 led to the election of two rival popes, Alexander III and the antipope Victor IV, and both sought Frederick&#x27;s support. Frederick, busy with the siege of Crema, appeared unsupportive of Alexander III, and after the sacking of Crema demanded that Alexander appear before the emperor at Pavia and to accept the imperial decree. Alexander refused, and Frederick recognised Victor IV as the legitimate pope in 1160. In response, Alexander III excommunicated both Frederick I and Victor IV. Frederick attempted to convoke a joint council with King Louis VII of France in 1162 to decide the issue of who should be pope. Louis neared the meeting site, but when he became aware that Frederick had stacked the votes for Victor, Louis decided not to attend the council. As a result, the issue was not resolved at that time.

The political result of the struggle with Pope Alexander was an alliance formed between the Norman state of Sicily and Pope Alexander III against Frederick. In the meantime, Frederick had to deal with another rebellion at Milan, in which the city surrendered on 6 March 1162; much of it was destroyed three weeks later on the emperor&#x27;s orders. The fate of Milan led to the submission of Brescia, Placentia, and many other northern Italian cities. In August 1162 he triumphantly entered Turin and was crowned with his consort in the cathedral on August 15. Returning to Germany towards the close of 1162, Frederick prevented the escalation of conflicts between Henry the Lion from Saxony and a number of neighbouring princes who were growing weary of Henry&#x27;s power, influence, and territorial gains. He also severely punished the citizens of Mainz for their rebellion against Archbishop Arnold. In Frederick&#x27;s third visit to Italy in 1163, his plans for the conquest of Sicily were ruined by the formation of a powerful league against him, brought together mainly by opposition to imperial taxes.

In 1164, Frederick took what are believed to be the relics of the &quot;Biblical Magi&quot; (the Wise Men or Three Kings) from the Basilica di Sant&#x27;Eustorgio in Milan and gave them as a gift (or as loot) to the Archbishop of Cologne, Rainald of Dassel. The relics had great religious significance and could be counted upon to draw pilgrims from all over Christendom. Today they are kept in the Shrine of the Three Kings in the Cologne cathedral. After the death of the antipope Victor IV, Frederick supported antipope Paschal III, but he was soon driven from Rome, leading to the return of Pope Alexander III in 1165.
In the meantime Frederick was focused on restoring peace in the Rhineland, where he organized a magnificent celebration of the canonization of Charlemagne at Aachen, under the authority of the antipope Paschal III. Concerned over rumours that Alexander III was about to enter into an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I, in October 1166 Frederick embarked on his fourth Italian campaign, hoping as well to secure the claim of Paschal III and the coronation of his wife Beatrice as Holy Roman Empress. This time, Henry the Lion refused to join Frederick on his Italian trip, tending instead to his own disputes with neighbors and his continuing expansion into Slavic territories in northeastern Germany. In 1167 Frederick began besieging Ancona, which had acknowledged the authority of Manuel I; at the same time, his forces achieved a great victory over the Romans at the Battle of Monte Porzio. Heartened by this victory, Frederick lifted the siege of Ancona and hurried to Rome, where he had his wife crowned empress and also received a second coronation from Paschal III. His campaign was halted by the sudden outbreak of an epidemic (malaria or the plague), which threatened to destroy the Imperial army and drove the emperor as a fugitive to Germany, where he remained for the ensuing six years. During this period, Frederick decided conflicting claims to various bishoprics, asserted imperial authority over Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary, initiated friendly relations with Manuel I, and tried to come to a better understanding with Henry II of England and Louis VII of France. Many Swabian counts, including his cousin the young Duke of Swabia, Frederick IV, died in 1167, so he was able to organize a new mighty territory in the Duchy of Swabia under his reign in this time. Consequently, his younger son Frederick V became the new Duke of Swabia in 1167, while his eldest son Henry was crowned King of the Romans in 1169, alongside his father who also retained the title.

===Later years===

Increasing anti-German sentiment swept through Lombardy, culminating in the restoration of Milan in 1169. In 1174 Frederick made his fifth expedition to Italy. (It was probably during this time that the famous &quot;Tafelgüterverzeichnis&quot;, a record of the royal estates, was made.) He was opposed by the pro-papal Lombard League (now joined by Venice, Sicily and Constantinople), which had previously formed to stand against him. The cities of northern Italy had become exceedingly wealthy through trade, representing a marked turning point in the transition from medieval feudalism. While continental feudalism had remained strong socially and economically, it was in deep political decline by the time of Frederick Barbarossa. When the northern Italian cities inflicted a defeat on Frederick at Alessandria in 1175, the European world was shocked. With the refusal of Henry the Lion to bring help to Italy, the campaign was a complete failure. Frederick suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Legnano near Milan, on 29 May 1176, where he was wounded and for some time was believed to be dead. This battle marked the turning point in Frederick&#x27;s claim to empire. He had no choice other than to begin negotiations for peace with Alexander III and the Lombard League. In the Peace of Anagni in 1176, Frederick recognized Alexander III as pope, and in the Peace of Venice in 1177, Frederick and Alexander III were formally reconciled. With decisions of Paschal III nullfied, Beatrice ceased to be referred as empress.

The scene was similar to that which had occurred between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor at Canossa a century earlier. The conflict was the same as that resolved in the Concordat of Worms: Did the Holy Roman Emperor have the power to name the pope and bishops? The Investiture controversy from previous centuries had been brought to a tendentious peace with the Concordat of Worms and affirmed in the First Council of the Lateran. Now it had recurred, in a slightly different form. Frederick had to humble himself before Alexander III at Venice. The emperor acknowledged the pope&#x27;s sovereignty over the Papal States, and in return Alexander acknowledged the emperor&#x27;s overlordship of the Imperial Church. Also in the Peace of Venice, a truce was made with the Lombard cities, which took effect in August 1178. The grounds for a permanent peace were not established until 1183, however, in the Peace of Constance, when Frederick conceded their right to freely elect town magistrates. By this move, Frederick recovered his nominal domination over Italy, which became his chief means of applying pressure on the papacy.

In a move to consolidate his reign after the disastrous expedition into Italy, Frederick was formally crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. Although traditionally the German kings had automatically inherited the royal crown of Arles since the time of Conrad II, Frederick felt the need to be crowned by the Archbishop of Arles, regardless of his laying claim to the title from 1152.
Frederick did not forgive Henry the Lion for refusing to come to his aid in 1176. By 1180, Henry had successfully established a powerful state comprising Saxony, Bavaria, and substantial territories in the north and east of Germany. Taking advantage of the hostility of other German princes to Henry, Frederick had Henry tried in absentia by a court of bishops and princes in 1180, declared that imperial law overruled traditional German law, and had Henry stripped of his lands and declared an outlaw. He then invaded Saxony with an imperial army to force his cousin to surrender. Henry&#x27;s allies deserted him, and he finally had to submit to Frederick at an Imperial Diet in Erfurt in November 1181. Henry spent three years in exile at the court of his father-in-law Henry II of England in Normandy before being allowed back into Germany. He finished his days in Germany, as the much-diminished Duke of Brunswick. Frederick&#x27;s desire for revenge was sated. Henry the Lion lived a relatively quiet life, sponsoring arts and architecture. Frederick&#x27;s victory over Henry did not gain him as much in the German feudalistic system as it would have in the English feudalistic system. While in England the pledge of fealty went in a direct line from overlords to those under them, the Germans pledged oaths only to the direct overlord, so that in Henry&#x27;s case, those below him in the feudal chain owed nothing to Frederick. Thus, despite the diminished stature of Henry the Lion, Frederick did not gain his allegiances.

Frederick was faced with the reality of disorder among the German states, where continuous civil wars were waged between pretenders and the ambitious who wanted the crown for themselves. Italian unity under German rule was more myth than truth. Despite proclamations of German hegemony, the pope was the most powerful force in Italy. When Frederick returned to Germany after his defeat in northern Italy, he was a bitter and exhausted man. The German princes, far from being subordinated to royal control, were intensifying their hold on wealth and power in Germany and entrenching their positions. There began to be a generalized social desire to &quot;create greater Germany&quot; by conquering the Slavs to the east.

Although the Italian city states had achieved a measure of independence from Frederick as a result of his failed fifth expedition into Italy, the emperor had not given up on his Italian dominions. In 1184, he held a massive celebration, the Diet of Pentecost, when his two eldest sons were knighted, and thousands of knights were invited from all over Germany. While payments upon the knighting of a son were part of the expectations of an overlord in England and France, only a &quot;gift&quot; was given in Germany for such an occasion. Frederick&#x27;s monetary gain from this celebration is said to have been modest. Later in 1184, Frederick again moved into Italy, this time joining forces with the local rural nobility to reduce the power of the Tuscan cities. In 1186, he engineered the marriage of his son Henry to Constance of Sicily, heiress to the Kingdom of Sicily, over the objections of Pope Urban III.

Pope Urban III died shortly after, and was succeeded by Pope Gregory VIII, who even as Papal Chancellor had pursued a more conciliatory line with the Emperor than previous popes and was more concerned with troubling reports from the Holy Land than with a power struggle with Barbarossa.

===Third Crusade===
Around 23 November 1187, Frederick received letters that had been sent to him from the rulers of the Crusader states in the Near East urging him to come to their aid. Around 1 December, Cardinal Henry of Marcy preached a crusade sermon before Frederick and a public assembly in Strasbourg. Frederick expressed support for the crusade but declined to take the cross on the grounds of his ongoing conflict with Archbishop Philip of Cologne. He did, however, urge King Philip II of France to take the cross through messengers and then in a personal meeting on 25 December on the border between Ivois and Mouzon.

On 27 March 1188, at the Diet of Mainz, the archbishop of Cologne submitted to Frederick. Bishop of Würzburg, Godfrey of Spitzenberg, preached a crusade sermon and Frederick asked the assembly whether he should take the cross. At the universal acclaim of the assembly, he took the crusader&#x27;s vow. His second son, the duke of Swabia, followed suit. The eldest, Henry VI, was to remain behind in Germany as regent. At Mainz Frederick proclaimed a &quot;general expedition against the pagans&quot;. He set the period of preparation as 17 April 1188 to 8 April 1189 and scheduled the army to assemble at Regensburg on 23 April 1189.

At Strasbourg, Frederick had imposed a small tax on the Jews of Germany to fund the crusade. He also put the Jews under his protection and forbade anyone to preach against the Jews. When mobs threatened the Jews of Mainz on the eve of the assembly in March, Frederick sent the imperial marshal Henry of Kalden to disperse them. Rabbi Moses then met with the emperor, which resulted in an imperial edict threatening maiming or death for anyone who maimed or killed a Jew. On 29 March, Frederick and the rabbi rode through the streets together. Frederick successfully prevented a repeat of the massacres that had accompanied the First Crusade and Second Crusade in Germany.

Because Frederick had signed a treaty of friendship with Saladin in 1175, he felt it necessary to give Saladin notice of the termination of their alliance. On 26 May 1188, he sent Count Henry II of Dietz to present an ultimatum to Saladin. A few days after Christmas 1188, Frederick received Hungarian, Byzantine, Serbian and Seljuk envoys in Nuremberg. The Hungarians and Seljuks promised provisions and safe-conduct to the crusaders. The envoys of Stefan Nemanja, grand prince of Serbia, announced that their prince would receive Frederick in Niš. Only with difficulty was an agreement reached with the Byzantine envoy, John Kamateros. Frederick sent a large embassy ahead to make preparations in Byzantium.
On 15 April 1189 in Haguenau, Frederick formally and symbolically accepted the staff and scrip of a pilgrim and set out. His crusade was &quot;the most meticulously planned and organized&quot; up to that time. According to one source written in the 1220s, Frederick organized a grand army of 100,000 men (including 20,000 knights) and set out on the overland route to the Holy Land; This number is believed to be inaccurate by modern scholars using incomplete contemporary sources that place the size of his army at 12,000–15,000 men, including 3,000–4,000 knights.

On 11 May 1189, after the majority of his army had already departed toward Hungary on land, Frederick sailed from Regensburg down the River Danube. When he came to the village of Mauthausen, Frederick ordered the village to be burned for levying a toll on the crusader army. The Crusaders then passed through Hungary, Serbia, and Bulgaria before entering Byzantine territory. While in Hungary, Barbarossa personally asked the Hungarian Prince Géza, brother of King Béla III of Hungary, to join the Crusade. The king agreed, and a Hungarian army of 2,000 men led by Géza escorted the German emperor&#x27;s forces. Later on, Frederick camped in Philippopolis, then in Adrianople in the autumn of 1189 to avoid the winter climate in Anatolia, in the meantime, he received imprisoned German emissaries who were held in Constantinople, and exchanged hostages with Isaac II, as a guarantee that the crusaders would not sack local settlements until they depart the Byzantine territory. In March 1190, Frederick left Adrianople for Gallipoli at the Dardanelles, to embark to Asia Minor.

The armies coming from western Europe pushed on through Anatolia, where they were victorious at the Battle of Philomelium and defeated the Turks in the Battle of Iconium, eventually reaching as far as Cilician Armenia. The approach of Barbarossa&#x27;s victorious German army greatly concerned Saladin, who was forced to weaken his force at the Siege of Acre and send troops to the north to block the arrival of the Germans.

===Death and burials===

Barbarossa opted on the local Armenians&#x27; advice to follow a shortcut along the Saleph River. Meanwhile, the army started to traverse the mountain path. On 10 June 1190, he drowned near Silifke Castle in the Saleph River. There are several conflicting accounts of the event:

* According to &quot;Ansbert&quot;, against everyone&#x27;s advice, the emperor chose to swim across the river and was swept away by the current.
* Another account recorded that Frederick was thrown from his horse while crossing the river, weighed down by his armour, and drowned.
* According to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, &quot;the king went down to the river to wash himself and was drowned at a place where the water was not even up to his waist. Thus God saved us from the evil of such a man&quot;.
* The writer of the &quot;Letter on the Death of the Emperor Frederick&quot;, a churchman who accompanied the crusader forces, reported that &quot;after the many and terrible exertions that he [Frederick I] had undergone in the previous month and more, he decided to bathe in that same river, for he wanted to cool down with a swim. But by the secret judgment of God there was an unexpected and lamentable death and he drowned.&quot; Frederick, who liked to swim, as he went to bathe with Otto of Wittelsbach in the Adriatic, might have been exhausted from weeks of marching, hence he was fatally affected by the very hot summer in Anatolia. If the writer was Godfrey of Spitzenberg, Bishop of Würzburg, who was a close confidant of Frederick, the report would be the most plausible account of what happened, since he might have witnessed the emperor&#x27;s death.

Jacques de Vitry, a historian of the Crusades, outlined Frederick&#x27;s endeavors and Saladin&#x27;s dilemma, in which he reported:

Frederick&#x27;s death caused several thousand German soldiers to leave the force and return home through the Cilician and Syrian ports. The German-Hungarian army was struck with an onset of disease near Antioch, weakening it further. Only 5,000 soldiers, a third of the original force, arrived in Acre. Barbarossa&#x27;s son, Frederick VI of Swabia, carried on with the remnants of the German army, along with the Hungarian army under the command of Prince Géza, with the aim of burying the emperor in Jerusalem, but efforts to preserve his body in vinegar failed. Hence, his flesh was interred in the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Antioch, his bones in the Cathedral of Tyre, and his heart and inner organs in Saint Paul&#x27;s Church, Tarsus.

The unexpected demise of Frederick left the Crusader army under the command of the rivals Philip II and Richard, who had traveled to Palestine separately by sea, and ultimately led to its dissolution. Richard continued to the East where he fought Saladin, winning territories along the shores of Palestine, but ultimately failed to win the war by conquering Jerusalem itself before he was forced to return to his own territories in north-western Europe, known to modern historians as the Angevin Empire. He returned home after he signed the Treaty of Ramla agreeing that Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control while allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders to visit the city. The treaty also reduced the Latin Kingdom to a geopolitical coastal strip extending from Tyre to Jaffa.

==Frederick and the Justinian code==
The increase in wealth of the trading cities of northern Italy led to a revival in the study of the Justinian Code, a Latin legal system that had become extinct centuries earlier. Legal scholars renewed its application. It is speculated that Pope Gregory VII personally encouraged the Justinian rule of law and had a copy of it. The historian Norman Cantor described Corpus Juris Civilis (Justinian Body of Civil Law) as &quot;the greatest legal code ever devised&quot;. It envisaged the law of the state as a reflection of natural moral law, the principle of rationality in the universe. By the time Frederick assumed the throne, this legal system was well established on both sides of the Alps. He was the first to use the availability of the new professional class of lawyers. The Civil Law allowed Frederick to use these lawyers to administer his kingdom in a logical and consistent manner. It also provided a framework to legitimize his claim to the right to rule both Germany and northern Italy. In the old days of Henry IV and Henry V, the claim of divine right of kings had been severely undermined by the Investiture controversy. The Church had won that argument in the common man&#x27;s mind. There was no divine right for the German king to also control the church by naming both bishops and popes. The institution of the Justinian code was used, perhaps unscrupulously, by Frederick to lay claim to divine powers.

In Germany, Frederick was a political realist, taking what he could and leaving the rest. In Italy, he tended to be a romantic reactionary, reveling in the antiquarian spirit of the age, exemplified by a revival of classical studies and Roman law. It was through the use of the restored Justinian code that Frederick came to view himself as a new Roman emperor. Roman law gave a rational purpose for the existence of Frederick and his imperial ambitions. It was a counterweight to the claims of the Church to have authority because of divine revelation. The Church was opposed to Frederick for ideological reasons, not the least of which was the humanist nature found in the revival of the old Roman legal system. When Pepin the Short sought to become king of the Franks in the 8th century, the church needed military protection, so Pepin found it convenient to make an ally of the pope. Frederick, however, desired to put the pope aside and claim the crown of old Rome simply because he was in the likeness of the great emperors of old, who tended to have a domineering role over the church, Caesaropapism. Pope Adrian IV was naturally opposed to this view and undertook a vigorous propaganda campaign designed to diminish Frederick and his ambition. To a large extent, this was successful.

==Economic policy==
Frederick did little to encourage economic development in Germany prior to the autumn of 1165. In that year he visited the lower Rhineland, the most economically advanced region in Germany. He had already travelled to northern Italy, the most economically advanced region in the Empire, three times. From 1165 on, Frederick pursued economic policies to encourage growth and trade. There is no question that his reign was a period of major economic growth in Germany, but it is impossible now to determine how much of that growth was owed to Frederick&#x27;s policies.

The number of mints in Germany increased ninefold in the reign of Frederick and his son Henry, from about two dozen mints at the start of his reign to 215 mints in 1197 and from a mere two royal mints to 28. Frederick himself established at least twelve royal mints, including those of Aachen, Donauwörth, Ulm, Haguenau, Duisburg, Kaiserswerth, Frankfurt, Gelnhausen and Dortmund. He also granted privileges exempting the merchants of Aachen, Gelnhausen, Haguenau, Monza, Rome, Pisa and Venice from all tolls within the Empire.

==Cultural depictions==
===Charismatic leader===
Otto of Freising, Frederick&#x27;s uncle, wrote an account of his reign entitled &quot;Gesta Friderici I imperatoris&quot; (Deeds of the Emperor Frederick), which is considered to be an accurate history of the king. Otto&#x27;s other major work, the &quot;Chronica sive Historia de duabus civitatibus&quot; (&quot;Chronicle or History of the Two Cities&quot;) had been an exposition of the &quot;Civitas Dei&quot; (&quot;The City of God&quot;) of Augustine of Hippo, full of Augustinian negativity concerning the nature of the world and history. His work on Frederick is of opposite tone, being an optimistic portrayal of the glorious potentials of imperial authority. Otto died after finishing the first two books, leaving the last two to Rahewin, his provost. Rahewin&#x27;s text is in places heavily dependent on classical precedent. For example, Rahewin&#x27;s physical description of Frederick reproduces word-for-word (except for details of hair and beard) a description of another monarch, Theodoric II written nearly eight hundred years earlier by Sidonius Apollinaris:

In the opinion of Norman Cantor, Frederick&#x27;s charisma led to a fantastic juggling act that, over a quarter of a century, restored the imperial authority in the German states. His formidable enemies defeated him on almost every side, yet in the end he emerged triumphant. When Frederick came to the throne, the prospects for the revival of German imperial power were extremely thin. The great German princes had increased their power and land holdings. The king had been left with only the traditional family domains and a vestige of power over the bishops and abbeys. The backwash of the Investiture controversy had left the German states in continuous turmoil. Rival states were in perpetual war. These conditions allowed Frederick to be both warrior and occasional peace-maker, both to his advantage.

===Legend===

Frederick is the subject of many legends, including that of a Kyffhäuser legend. Legend says he is not dead, but asleep with his knights in a cave in the Kyffhäuser mountains in Thuringia or Mount Untersberg at the border between Bavaria, Germany, and Salzburg, Austria, and that when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness. According to the story, his red beard has grown through the table at which he sits. His eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying. A similar story, set in Sicily, was earlier attested about his grandson, Frederick II. To garner political support the German Empire built atop the Kyffhäuser the Kyffhäuser Monument, which declared Kaiser Wilhelm I the reincarnation of Frederick; the 1896 dedication occurred on 18 June, the day of Frederick&#x27;s coronation.

In medieval Europe, the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; became refined by Jacopo da Voragine. This was a popularized interpretation of the Biblical end of the world. It consisted of three things: (1) terrible natural disasters; (2) the arrival of the Antichrist; (3) the establishment of a good king to combat the anti-Christ. These millennial fables were common and freely traded by the populations on Continental Europe. End-time accounts had been around for thousands of years, but entered the Christian tradition with the writings of the Apostle Peter. German propaganda played into the exaggerated fables believed by the common people by characterizing Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II as personification of the &quot;good king&quot;.

Another legend states that when Barbarossa was in the process of seizing Milan in 1158, his wife, the Empress Beatrice, was taken captive by the enraged Milanese and forced to ride through the city on a donkey in a humiliating manner. Some sources of this legend indicate that Barbarossa implemented his revenge for this insult by forcing the magistrates of the city to remove a fig from the anus of a donkey using only their teeth. Another source states that Barbarossa took his wrath upon every able-bodied man in the city, and that it was not a fig they were forced to hold in their mouth, but excrement from the donkey. To add to this debasement, they were made to announce, &quot;Ecco la fica&quot; (meaning &quot;behold the fig&quot;), with the feces still in their mouths. It used to be said that the insulting gesture (called fico), of holding one&#x27;s fist with the thumb in between the middle and forefinger came by its origin from this event.

Frederick&#x27;s legend was further reinforced in the early twentieth century, when Adolf Hitler named Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union after him.

===Historiography===
Scholarly evaluations of Frederick began in the nineteenth century, but have been hampered by the unfortunate deaths of key researchers who did not have the chance to complete their works (such as Henry Simonsfeld who died in 1913, Wilhelm von Giesebrecht who died in 1889 and Johannes Laudage who died in an accident in 2008). Nevertheless, the two volumes about Frederick (that focus on his relationship with the Welfs and the Papacy) in Wilhelm von Giesebrecht&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Deutschen Kaiserzeit&quot; (1855–88), completed by his student Bernhard von Simson in 1895, later became the scholarly standard work on the emperor&#x27;s life.

In 1975, Frederick&#x27;s charters were published. This and the postwar abandonment of the Kyffhäuser myth have led to the publications of several new biographies. The notable recent authorities among German-speaking historians include Ferdinand Opll, Johannes Laudage, and Knut Görich. Opll&#x27;s &quot;Friedrich Barbarossa&quot; (1990) presents the emperor as a pragmatic leader with a capacity of adaptation and recovery after defeat. Laudage investigates the important role of the concept of honour in Frederick&#x27;s decisions while explaining the far-reaching visions of the emperor and his advisers, while Görich (who also emphasizes the honour, or &quot;honor imperii&quot; factor) questions whether traditional researchers have overemphasized the intentional side of Frederick&#x27;s politics and instead highlights his flexibility and consensus-building capability as a leader.

In Italy, the scholarly attention towards Frederick&#x27;s person and his reign is also considerable, with notable contributions including Franco Cardini&#x27;s sympathetic 1985 biography or the 1982 work &quot;Federico Barbarossa nel dibattito storiografico in Italia e in Germania&quot;, edited by Manselli and Riedmann, considered by Schumann to be a definite synthesis of non-nationally oriented historiography approaches (combining German and Italian research results) of the last forty years.

==Ancestry==
==Children==
Frederick&#x27;s first marriage, to Adelheid of Vohburg, did not produce any children and was annulled.

From his second marriage to Beatrice of Burgundy, he had the following children:

#Beatrice (end 1162/early 1163 – at least early 1174/1179). King William II of Sicily first asked for her hand, but the marriage negotiations never came through. 
#Frederick V, Duke of Swabia (Pavia, 16 July 1164 – 28 November 1170).
#Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Nijmegen, November 1165 – Messina, 28 September 1197).
#Conrad (Modigliana, February 1167 – Acre, 20 January 1191), later renamed Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia after the death of his older brother.
# ?Judith (October/November 1168 – end 1184). She was betrothed to Richard, Count of Poitou (later King of England) but died before they could be married.
#Otto I, Count of Burgundy (June/July 1170 – killed, Besançon, 13 January 1200).
#Conrad II, Duke of Swabia and Rothenburg (February/March 1172 – killed, Durlach, 15 August 1196).
#Rainald (October/November 1173 – before April 1174/soon after October 1178), buried in Lorch Abbey.
#William (June/July 1175 – soon after October 1178), buried in Lorch Abbey.
#Philip (February/March 1177 – killed, Bamberg, 21 June 1208) King of Germany in 1198.
#Agnes (early 1179 – 8 October 1184). She was betrothed to King Emeric of Hungary, but died before they could be married.

Some modern authorities list a daughter named Sophia, who was betrothed William VI of Montferrat but died before the marriage in 1187. Her existence is first recorded the &quot;Thesaurus rerum Suevicarum&quot; of Johann Reinhard Wegelin in 1757. If she really existed, she was born between about 1168 and 1180 and was an illegitimate child.

<text>Dari (; endonym: ), Dari Persian (, , or , ), or Eastern Persian is the variety of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan. Dari is the Afghan government&#x27;s official term for the Persian language; it is known as Afghan Persian or Eastern Persian in many Western sources. The decision to rename the local variety of Persian in 1964 was more political than linguistic to support an Afghan state narrative. Dari Persian is most closely related to Tajiki Persian as spoken in Tajikistan and the two share many phonological and lexical similarities. Apart from a few basics of vocabulary, there is little difference between formal written Persian of Afghanistan and Iran; the languages are mutually intelligible. Dari is the official language for approximately 35 million people in Afghanistan and it serves as the common language for inter-ethnic communication in the country.

As defined in the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan, Dari is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan; the other is Pashto. Dari is the most widely spoken language in Afghanistan and the native language of approximately 25–55% of the population. Dari serves as the lingua franca of the country and is understood by up to 78% of the population.

Dari Persian served as the preferred literary and administrative language among non-native speakers, such as the Turco-Mongol peoples including the Mughals, for centuries before the rise of modern nationalism. Also, like Iranian Persian and Tajiki Persian, Dari Persian is a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of the Sassanian Empire (224–651 AD), itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids (550–330 BC). In historical usage, &quot;Dari&quot; refers to the Middle Persian court language of the Sassanids.

== Etymology ==
Dari is a name given to the New Persian language since the 10th century, widely used in Arabic (compare Al-Estakhri, Al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal) and Persian texts.

Since 1964, it has been the official name in Afghanistan for the Persian spoken there. In Afghanistan, Dari refers to a modern dialect form of Persian that is the standard language used in administration, government, radio, television, and print media. Because of a preponderance of Dari native speakers, who normally refer to the language as &quot;Farsi&quot; (, &quot;Persian&quot;), it is also known as &quot;Afghan Persian&quot; in some Western sources.

There are different opinions about the origin of the word &quot;Dari&quot;. The majority of scholars believe that &quot;Dari&quot; refers to the Persian word &quot;dar&quot; or &quot;darbār&quot; (), meaning &quot;court&quot;, as it was the formal language of the Sassanids. The original meaning of the word &quot;dari&quot; is given in a notice attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ (cited by Ibn al-Nadim in &quot;Al-Fehrest&quot;). According to him, &quot;&quot;Pārsī&quot; was the language spoken by priests, scholars, and the like; it is the language of Fars.&quot; This language refers to Middle Persian. As for &quot;Dari&quot;, he says, &quot;it is the language of the cities of Madā&#x27;en; it is spoken by those who are at the king&#x27;s court. [Its name] is connected with presence at court. Among the languages of the people of Khorasan and the east, the language of the people of Balkh is predominant.&quot;

Dari Persian spoken in Afghanistan is not to be confused with the language of Iran called Dari or Gabri, which is a language of the Central Iranian subgroup spoken in some Zoroastrian communities.

== History ==
Dari comes from Middle Persian which was spoken during the rule of the Sassanid dynasty. In general, Iranian languages are known from three periods, usually referred to as Old, Middle, and New (Modern) periods. These correspond to three eras in Iranian history, the old era being the period from some time before, during, and after the Achaemenid period (that is, to 300 BC), the Middle Era being the next period, namely, the Sassanid period and part of the post-Sassanid period, and the New era being the period afterward down to the present day.

The first person in Europe to use the term &quot;Deri&quot; for &quot;Dari&quot; may have been Thomas Hyde in his chief work, &quot;Historia religionis veterum Persarum&quot; (1700).

&quot;Dari&quot; or &quot;Deri&quot; has two meanings. It may mean the language of the court:
: &quot;the Zebani Deri (Zeban i Deri or Zaban i Dari = the language of Deri), or the language of the court, and the Zebani Farsi, the dialect of Persia at large (...)&quot;

It may also indicate a form of poetry used from Rudaki to Jami. In the fifteenth century it appeared in Herat under the Persian-speaking Timurid dynasty. The Persian-language poets of the Indian Subcontinent who used the Indian verse methods or rhyme methods, like Bedil and Muhammad Iqbal, became familiar with the &quot;araki&quot; form of poetry. Iqbal loved both styles of literature and poetry, when he wrote:
This can be translated as:

&quot;Even though in euphonious Hindi is sugar&quot; –
&quot;Rhyme method in Dari is sweeter&quot;

&quot;Uzūbat&quot; usually means &quot;bliss&quot;, &quot;delight&quot;, &quot;sweetness&quot;; in language, literature and poetry, &quot;uzubat&quot; also means &quot;euphonious&quot; or &quot;melodic&quot;.

Referring to the 14th-century Persian poet Hafez, Iqbal wrote:

English translation:
Here &quot;qand-e Pārsī&quot; (&quot;Rock candy of Persia&quot;) is a metaphor for the Persian language and poetry.

Persian replaced the Central Asian languages of the Eastern Iranic peoples. Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara were starting to be influenced by Dari, and were originally Khwarezmian and Sogdian-speaking areas during Samanid rule. Dari Persian spread around the Oxus River region, Afghanistan, and Khorasan after the Arab conquests and during Islamic-Arab rule. The replacement of the Pahlavi script with the Arabic script in order to write the Persian language was done by the Tahirids in 9th century Khorasan. Dari Persian spread and led to the extinction of Eastern Iranian languages like Bactrian and Khwarezmian with only a tiny amount of Sogdian descended Yaghnobi speakers remaining, as the ancestors of Tajiks started speaking Dari after relinquishing their original language (most likely Bactrian) around this time, due to the fact that the Arab-Islamic army which invaded Central Asia also included some Persians who governed the region like the Sassanids. Persian was a prestigious high-ranking language and was further rooted into Central Asia by the Samanids. Persian also phased out Sogdian. The role of lingua franca that Sogdian originally played was succeeded by Persian after the arrival of Islam.

== Geographical distribution ==

Dari is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan. In practice though, it serves as the de facto lingua franca among the various ethnolinguistic groups.

Dari Persian is spoken by approximately 25–80% of the population of Afghanistan. Tajiks, who comprise 27–39% of the population, are the primary native speakers, followed by Hazaras (9%) and Aymāqs (4%). Moreover, while Pashtuns (37–48%) natively speak Pashto, those living in Tajik and Hazara dominated areas also use Dari Persian as their main or secondary language. Thus, non-native Persian speaking groups have contributed to the increased number of Persian speakers within Afghanistan. The World Factbook states that about 80% of the Afghan population speaks Dari Persian. About 2.5 million Afghans in Iran and Afghans in Pakistan, part of the wider Afghan diaspora, also speak Dari Persian as one of their primary languages.

Dari Persian dominates the northern, western, and central areas of Afghanistan, and is the common language spoken in cities such as Balkh, Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Fayzabad, Panjshir, Bamiyan, and the Afghan capital of Kabul where all ethnic groups are settled. Dari Persian-speaking communities also exist in southwestern and eastern Pashtun-dominated areas such as in the cities of Ghazni, Farah, Zaranj, Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, and Gardez.

== Cultural influence ==
Dari Persian has contributed to the majority of Persian borrowings in several Indo-Aryan languages, such as Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali and others, as it was the administrative, official, cultural language of the Persianate Mughal Empire and served as the lingua franca throughout the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Often based in Afghanistan, Turkic Central Asian conquerors brought the language into South Asia. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties. The sizable Persian component of the Anglo-Indian loan words in English and in Urdu therefore reflects the Dari Persian pronunciation. For instance, the words dopiaza and pyjama come from the Afghan Persian pronunciation; in Iranian Persian they are pronounced &quot;do-piyāzeh&quot; and &quot;pey-jāmeh&quot;. Persian lexemes and certain morphological elements (e.g., the &quot;ezāfe&quot;) have often been employed to coin words for political and cultural concepts, items, or ideas that were historically unknown outside the South Asian region, as is the case with the aforementioned &quot;borrowings&quot;. Dari Persian has a rich and colorful tradition of proverbs that deeply reflect Afghan culture and relationships, as demonstrated through the works of Rumi and other literature.

== Differences between Iranian and Afghan Persian ==
There are phonological, lexical, and morphological differences between Afghan Persian and Iranian Persian. For example, Afghan Farsi has more vowels than Iranian Farsi. 

=== Phonological differences ===
The phonology of Dari Persian as spoken in Kabul, compared with Classical Persian, is overall more conservative than the accent of Iran&#x27;s standard register. In this regard Dari Persian is more similar to Tajiki Persian. The principal differences between standard Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian as based on the Kabul dialect are:

# The merging of &quot;majhul&quot; vowels and into and respectively in Iranian Persian, whereas in Afghan Persian, they are still kept separate. For instance, the identically written words &#x27;lion&#x27; and &#x27;milk&#x27; are pronounced the same in Iranian Persian as , but differently as for &#x27;lion&#x27; and for &#x27;milk&#x27; in Afghan Persian, similar to Tajiki Persian. The long vowel in &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;strength&quot; is realized as in Iranian Persian, in contrast, these words are pronounced and respectively by Persian speakers in Afghanistan.
# The Classical Persian high short vowels and tend to be lowered in Iranian Persian to and , unlike in Dari where they might have both high and lowered allophones.
# The treatment of the diphthongs of early Classical Persian &quot;ay&quot; (as &quot;i&quot; in English &quot;size&quot;) and &quot;aw&quot; (as &quot;ow&quot; in Engl. &quot;cow&quot;), which are pronounced (as in English &quot;day&quot;) and (as in Engl. &quot;low&quot;) in Iranian Persian. Dari, on the other hand, is more like ancient Persian, e.g. &#x27;no&#x27; is realized as in Iranian but in Afghan Persian, and &#x27;Persian New Year&#x27; is in Iranian but in Afghan Persian. Moreover, is simplified to in normal Iranian speech, thereby merging with the lowered Classical short vowel (see above). This does not occur in Afghan Persian.
# The pronunciation of the labial consonant , which is realized as a voiced labiodental fricative in standard Iranian, is still pronounced with the classical bilabial pronunciation in Afghanistan; is found in Afghan Persian as an allophone of before voiced consonants and as variation of in some cases, along with .
# The convergence of the voiced uvular stop () and the voiced velar fricative () in some dialects of Iranian Persian (presumably under the influence of Turkic languages like Azeri and Turkmen) is absent in Dari, where the two are still kept separate.
# and in word-final positions are distinguished in Dari, whereas is a word-final allophone of in Iranian Persian.

=== Dialect continuum ===
The dialects of Dari spoken in Northern, Central, and Eastern Afghanistan, for example in Kabul, Mazar, and Badakhshan, have distinct features compared to Iranian Persian. However, the dialect of Dari spoken in Western Afghanistan stands in between the Afghan and Iranian Persian. For instance, the Herati dialect shares vocabulary and phonology with both Afghan and Iranian Persian. Likewise, the dialect of Persian in Eastern Iran, for instance in Mashhad, is quite similar to the Herati dialect of Afghanistan.

== Varieties of Dari Persian ==
In a paper jointly published by Takhar University and the Ministry of Education in 2018, researchers studying varieties of Persian from Iran to Tajikistan, Identified 3 dialect groups (or macro dialects) present within Afghanistan. In an article about various languages spoken in Afghanistan, Encyclopaedia Iranica identified a nearly identical categorization but considered varieties spoken in the Sistan region to constitute a distinct group.

Takhar and the MOE only discussed vocabulary differences between the dialect groups and did not extensively discuss phonological differences between these groups. However, there was a noticeable difference in the romanizations of the Western dialects and the South-Eastern dialects. Chiefly that the vowel diacritic &quot;pesh&quot; (Kasrah) was romanized with an &quot;i&quot; for South-Eastern dialects but as an &quot;e&quot; for western dialects. This is presumably due to a difference in quality, however the paper itself did not explain why the vowels were transliterated differently.

=== South-Eastern ===
The South Eastern group (also referred to the Southern and Eastern group) constitutes varieties spoken in and around Kabul, Parwan, Balkh, Baghlan, Samangan, Kunduz, Takhar, Badakhshan and others. A distinctive character of this group is its conservative nature compared to, for example, the Tehrani dialect. This can be seen in its Phonology (e.g. it&#x27;s preservation of &quot;Majhul&quot; vowels), Morhphonology and Syntax, and it&#x27;s Lexicon. A further distinction may be made between varieties in and near Kabul and varieties in and near Afghan Turkistan. With dialects near Kabul exhibiting some influences from languages in southern Afghanistan and South Asia and dialects in Afghan Turkistan exhibiting more influence from Tajik. All South-Eastern varieties exhibited some influence from Uzbek. Despite the Afghanistan Ministry of Education referring to this group as &quot;South-Eastern&quot; some of the varieties included are in the north.

As seen in many Hazaragi varieties, certain Eastern Dialects have developed a system of retroflex consonants under pressure from Pashto. They are not widespread, however.

The Kabuli dialect has become the standard model of Dari Persian in Afghanistan, as has the Tehrani dialect in relation to the Persian in Iran. Since the 1940s, Radio Afghanistan has broadcast its Dari programs in Kabuli Dari, which ensured the homogenization between the Kabuli version of the language and other dialects of Dari Persian spoken throughout Afghanistan. Since 2003, the media, especially the private radio and television broadcasters, have carried out their Dari programs using the Kabuli variety.

=== Western ===
The Western group includes various varieties spoken in and around: Herat, Badghis, Farah and Ghor. Varieties in this group share many features with the dialects of Persian spoken in Eastern Iran, and one may make many comparisons between the speech of Herat and Mashhad.

=== Hazaragi ===

The third group recognized by Afghanistan Ministry of Education is Hazaragi. Spoken by the Hazara people, these varieties are spoken in the majority of central Afghanistan including: Bamyan, parts of Ghazni, Daikundi, Laal Sari Jangal in Ghor province, &#x27;uruzgan khas&#x27;, in a wide area in the west of Kabul which is mainly recognized as Dashti Barchi, and some regions near Herat. As a group, the Hazaragi varieties are distinguished by the presence of retroflex consonants and distinctive vocabulary. However it has been shown that Hazaragi is more accurately a sub-dialect of Dari rather than its own variety of Persian.

=== Sistani ===

Afghanistan&#x27;s Ministry of Education does not make a distinction between varieties of the Sistan region and the varieties in the Western group. However Encyclopaedia Iranica considers the Sistani dialect to constitute their own distinctive group, with notable influences from Balochi.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===

* Stops // are phonetically dental [].
* A glottal stop /ʔ/ only appears in words of Arabic origin.
* A flap sound // may be realized as a trill sound [], in some environments, mostly word-final position; otherwise, they contrast between vowels wherein a trill occurs as a result of gemination (doubling) of [], especially in loanwords of Arabic origin. Only [] occurs before and after consonants; in word-final position, it is usually a free variation between a flap or a trill when followed by a consonant or a pause, but flap is more common, only flap before vowel-initial words.
* As in many other languages, is realized as bilabial before bilabial stops and as velar before velar stops.
* is voiced to before voiced consonants.
* /w/ is almost always voiced as , as in Middle Persian.

=== Vowels ===
Dari does not distinguish [] and [] in any position, these are distinct phonemes in English but are in un-conditional free variation in nearly all dialects of Dari. There are no environmental factors related to the appearance of [] or [] and native Dari speakers do not perceive them as different phonemes (that is to say, the English words bet [bt] and bit [bt] would be nearly indistinguishable to a native Dari speaker). However, speakers in Urban regions of Kabul, Panjšir and other nearby provinces in southern and eastern Afghanistan tend to realize the vowel as []. Speakers of Dari in central Afghanistan (i.e. Hazaragi speakers) tend to realize the vowel in proximity to, or identically to, [], unless the following syllable contains a high-back vowel. Speakers in western Afghanistan (such as in the Herat or Farah province) and some rural regions in the Kabul province (not the city) most commonly realize the vowel as []. Additionally, in some varieties of Dari, the phoneme [] appears as an allophone of [a].

* When occurring as lax, the open vowels are raised to .

== Political views and disputes on the language ==
Successive governments of Afghanistan have promoted New Persian as an official language of government since the time of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526), even as those governments were dominated by Pashtun people. Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty (1826–1973) first introduced the Pashto language as an additional language of administration. The local name for the Persian variety spoken in Afghanistan was officially changed from Farsi to Dari, meaning &quot;court language&quot;, in 1964. Zaher said there would be, as there are now, two official languages, Pashto and Farsi, though the latter would henceforth be named Dari. Within their respective linguistic boundaries, Dari Persian and Pashto are the media of education.

The term continues to divide opinion in Afghanistan today. While Dari has been the official name for decades, &quot;Farsi&quot; is still the preferred name to many Persian speakers of Afghanistan. Omar Samad, an Afghan analyst and ambassador, says of the dispute:

<text>In moral and political philosophy, the social contract is an idea, theory, or model that usually, although not always, concerns the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. Conceptualized in the Age of Enlightenment, it is a core concept of constitutionalism, while not necessarily convened and written down in a constituent assembly and constitution.

Social contract arguments typically are that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority (of the ruler, or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining rights or maintenance of the social order. The relation between natural and legal rights is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (French: &quot;Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique&quot;), a 1762 book by Jean-Jacques Rousseau that discussed this concept. Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law, the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy.

The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent any political order (termed the &quot;state of nature&quot; by Thomas Hobbes). In this condition, individuals&#x27; actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience, assuming that &#x27;nature&#x27; precludes mutually beneficial social relationships. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate why rational individuals would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

Prominent 17th- and 18th-century theorists of the social contract and natural rights included Hugo de Groot (1625), Thomas Hobbes (1651), Samuel von Pufendorf (1673), John Locke (1689), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762) and Immanuel Kant (1797), each approaching the concept of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had natural rights. 
Thomas Hobbes famously said that in a &quot;state of nature&quot;, human life would be &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot;. In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the &quot;right to all things&quot; and thus the freedom to plunder, rape and murder; there would be an endless &quot;war of all against all&quot; (&quot;bellum omnium contra omnes&quot;). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political community (civil society) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign&#x27;s edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary).

Alternatively, Locke and Rousseau argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.

The central assertion that social contract theory approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest.

== Overview ==

=== The model of the social contract ===
There is a general form of social contract theories, which is: &quot;I&quot; chooses &quot;R&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and this gives &quot;I*&quot; reason to endorse and comply with &quot;R&quot; in the real world insofar as the reasons &quot;I&quot; has for choosing &quot;R&quot; in &quot;M&quot; are (or can be) shared by &quot;I*.&quot;With &quot;M&quot; being the deliberative setting; &quot;R&quot; rules, principles or institutions; &quot;I&quot; the (hypothetical) people in original position or state of nature making the social contract; and &quot;I*&quot; being the individuals in the real world following the social contract.

== History ==

===Classical thought===
Social contract formulations are preserved in many of the world&#x27;s oldest records. The Indian Buddhist text of the second century BC &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:
In his rock edicts, the Indian Buddhist king Asoka was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist &quot;vinaya&quot; also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.

Epicurus in the fourth century BC seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his &quot;Principal Doctrines&quot; (see also Epicurean ethics):

The concept of the social contract was originally posed by Glaucon, as described by Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot;, BookII.

The social contract theory also appears in &quot;Crito&quot;, another dialogue from Plato. Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after Epicurus (341–270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also Epicurean ethics), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society. As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.

===Renaissance developments===
Quentin Skinner has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the Low Countries who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England. Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), from the School of Salamanca, might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing natural law in an attempt to limit the divine right of absolute monarchy. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular sovereignty by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-&quot;state of nature&quot; arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.

These arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which &quot;a populus&quot; can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.

==Philosophers==

===Thomas Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651)===
The first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the state of nature were &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot;, a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the &quot;social&quot;, or society. Life was &quot;anarchic&quot; (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.

The social contract was seen as an &quot;occurrence&quot; during which individuals came together and ceded some of their individual rights so that others would cede theirs. This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer &quot;a war of all against all&quot;.

The state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes&#x27; work helped to serve as a basis for the realism theories of international relations, advanced by E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau. Hobbes wrote in &quot;Leviathan&quot; that humans (&quot;we&quot;) need the &quot;terrour of some Power&quot; otherwise humans will not heed the law of reciprocity, &quot;(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to&quot;.

===John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot; (1689)===
John Locke&#x27;s conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes&#x27; in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, in which man has the &quot;power... to preserve his property; that is, his life, liberty and estate against the injuries and attempts of other men&quot;. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a &quot;neutral judge&quot;, acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.

While Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot;. Locke argued that a government&#x27;s legitimacy comes from the citizens&#x27; delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or &quot;self-preservation&quot;), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Du Contrat social&quot; (1762)===
Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, outlined a different version of social-contract theory, as the foundations of society based on the sovereignty of the &quot;general will&quot;.

Rousseau&#x27;s political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau&#x27;s collectivist conception is most evident in his development of the &quot;luminous conception&quot; (which he credited to Denis Diderot) of the &quot;general will&quot;. Summarised, the &quot;general will&quot; is the power of all the citizens&#x27; collective interest—not to be confused with their individual interests.

Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their representative government, nor any form of representative government. Rousseau believed that society was only legitimate when the sovereign (i.e. the &quot;general will&quot;) were the sole legislators. He also stated that the individual must accept &quot;the total alienation to the whole community of each associate with all his rights&quot;. In short, Rousseau meant that in order for the social contract to work, individuals &quot;must&quot; forfeit their rights to the whole so that such conditions were &quot;equal for all&quot;.

Rousseau&#x27;s striking phrase that man must &quot;be forced to be free&quot; should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, if an individual rejects this &quot;civil liberty&quot; in place of &quot;natural liberty&quot; and self interest, disobeying the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collective (as citizens). Thus the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression. The individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will.

Because laws represent the restraint of &quot;natural liberty&quot;, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force. Therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people help to mould their character.

Rousseau also analyses the social contract in terms of risk management,
thus suggesting the origins of the state as a form of mutual insurance.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s individualist social contract (1851)===
While Rousseau&#x27;s social contract is based on popular sovereignty and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by individualists, libertarians, and anarchists that do not involve agreeing to anything more than negative rights and creates only a limited state, if any.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:

===John Rawls&#x27; &quot;Theory of Justice&quot; (1971)===
Building on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state, John Rawls (1921–2002), in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical &quot;original position&quot; would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a game-theoretical formalization of the notion of fairness.

===David Gauthier&#x27;s &quot;Morals by Agreement&quot; (1986)===

David Gauthier&#x27;s &quot;neo-Hobbesian&quot; theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics. Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result. In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.

===Philip Pettit&#x27;s &quot;Republicanism&quot; (1997)===
Philip Pettit (b. 1945) has argued, in &quot;Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government&quot; (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the consent of the governed, should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be manufactured, Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract&#x27;s only legitimacy.

==Application==

===Elections===
Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that societal laws are upheld up the collective will of the citizens whom they represent. Thus, in obeying laws, the citizen &quot;remains free.&quot; Within elections, the will of the establishment is the will of the collective. Barring corruption, the legitimacy of the democractic government is absolute.
According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society, citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence. Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (majority-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence.

===Courtroom===
In court, the social contract is used to diagnose mental health, with the ultimate aim of delivering a fair sentence. Judge John Geoffrey Jones called it &quot;an aspect of the instinct for self-preservation.&quot; He saw the committer of bad deeds as the impervious person: that &quot;rare person whose intuition is stunted and who misses out on instruction grows up uninhibited, so continues bad deeds.&quot; Jones argued that the legitimancy of the judiciary is not absolute. Rather than the court, it is the psychiatrist&#x27;s job to diagnose mental health.

==Criticism==

===Consent of the governed===
An early critic of social contract theory was Rousseau&#x27;s friend, the philosopher David Hume, who in 1742 published an essay &quot;Of Civil Liberty&quot;. The second part of this essay, entitled &quot;Of the Original Contract&quot;, stresses that the concept of a &quot;social contract&quot; is a convenient fiction: 

Hume argued that consent of the governed was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. 

===Natural law and constitutionalism===
Legal scholar Randy Barnett has argued that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to &quot;all&quot; rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.A. Brownson, who argued that, in a sense, three &quot;constitutions&quot; are involved: first, the &quot;constitution of nature&quot; that includes all of what the Founders called &quot;natural law&quot;; second, the &quot;constitution of society&quot;, an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a &quot;constitution of government&quot;. To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be &quot;constitutional&quot; in that sense.

===Tacit consent===
The theory of a tacit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.

Other writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.

=== Explicit consent ===
The theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent. The main difference between tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation. Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.

===Contracts must be consensual===
According to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century lawyer who argued before the United States
Supreme Court and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay &quot;No Treason&quot; that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all. An abolitionist, he made similar arguments about the unconstitutionality of slavery in the US.

Modern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote &quot;Leviathan&quot;; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes&#x27; contemporaries as they do to us.

<text>Edward V (2 November 1470 – ) was King of England from 9 April to 25 June 1483. He succeeded his father, Edward IV, upon the latter&#x27;s death. Edward V was never crowned, and his brief reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle and Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester, who deposed him to reign as King Richard III; this was confirmed by the &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, an Act of Parliament which denounced any further claims through Edward IV&#x27;s heirs by delegitimising Edward V and all of his siblings. This was later repealed by Henry VII, who wished to legitimise his reign by marrying Elizabeth of York, Edward V&#x27;s eldest sister.

Edward V and his younger brother, Richard of Shrewsbury, are known as the Princes in the Tower. They disappeared after being sent to heavily guarded royal lodgings in the Tower of London. Responsibility for their disappearance (and presumed deaths) is widely attributed to Richard III, who sent them to the Tower, but the lack of conclusive evidence and conflicting contemporary accounts allow for other possibilities. 

==Early life==
Edward was born on 2 November 1470 at Cheyneygates, the medieval house of the Abbot of Westminster, adjoining Westminster Abbey. His mother, Elizabeth Woodville, had sought sanctuary there from Lancastrian supporters who had deposed his father, the Yorkist king Edward IV, during the course of the Wars of the Roses. Edward was created Prince of Wales in June 1471, following his father&#x27;s restoration to the throne, and in 1473 was established at Ludlow Castle on the Welsh Marches as nominal president of a newly created Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1479, his father conferred the earldom of Pembroke on him; it became merged into the crown on his succession.

Prince Edward was placed under the supervision of the queen&#x27;s brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, a noted scholar. In a letter to Rivers, Edward IV set down precise conditions for the upbringing of his son and the management of the prince&#x27;s household. He was to &quot;arise every morning at a convenient hour, according to his age&quot;. His day would begin with matins and then Mass, which he was to receive uninterrupted. After breakfast, the business of educating the prince began with &quot;virtuous learning&quot;. Dinner was served from ten in the morning, and then he was to be read &quot;noble stories ... of virtue, honour, cunning, wisdom, and of deeds of worship&quot; but &quot;of nothing that should move or stir him to vice&quot;. Perhaps aware of his own vices, the king was keen to safeguard his son&#x27;s morals, and instructed Rivers to ensure that no one in the prince&#x27;s household was a habitual &quot;swearer, brawler, backbiter, common hazarder, adulterer, [or user of] words of &quot;. After further study, in the afternoon the prince was to engage in sporting activities suitable for his class, before evensong. Supper was served from four, and curtains were to be drawn at eight. Following this, the prince&#x27;s attendants were to &quot;enforce themselves to make him merry and joyous towards his bed&quot;. They would then watch over him as he slept.

Dominic Mancini reported of the young Edward V:

As with several of his other children, Edward IV planned a prestigious European marriage for his eldest son, and in 1480 concluded an alliance with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, whereby Prince Edward was betrothed to the duke&#x27;s four-year-old daughter and heiress to the duchy, Anne. The two were to be married upon their majority, with their eldest son inheriting England and their second son Brittany.

==Reign==

It was at Ludlow that the 12-year-old Edward received the news, on Monday 14 April 1483, of his father&#x27;s sudden death five days before. Edward IV&#x27;s will, which has not survived, nominated his trusted brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as Protector during the minority of his son. The new king left Ludlow on 24 April, with Richard leaving York a day earlier, planning to meet at Northampton and travel to London together. However, when Richard reached Northampton, Edward and his party had already travelled onward to Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire. The Earl Rivers travelled back to Northampton to meet Richard and Buckingham, who had now arrived. On the night of 29 April Richard dined with Rivers and Edward&#x27;s half-brother, Richard Grey, but the following morning Rivers, Grey and the king&#x27;s chamberlain, Thomas Vaughan, were arrested and sent north. Despite Richard&#x27;s assurances, all three were subsequently executed. Dominic Mancini, an Italian who visited England in the 1480s, reports that Edward protested, but the remainder of his entourage was dismissed and Richard escorted him to London. On 19 May 1483, the new king took up residence in the Tower of London; on 16 June, his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York joined him there.

The Privy Council had at first hoped for a speedy coronation, to avoid the need for a protectorate. This had previously happened with Richard II, who had become king at the age of ten. Another precedent was Henry VI, whose protectorate (which started when he inherited the crown aged 9 months) had ended with his coronation aged seven. Richard, however, repeatedly postponed the coronation.

On 22 June, Ralph Shaa preached a sermon declaring that Edward IV had already been contracted to marry Lady Eleanor Butler when he married Elizabeth Woodville, thereby rendering his marriage to Elizabeth invalid and their children together illegitimate. The children of Richard&#x27;s older brother George, Duke of Clarence, were barred from the throne by their father&#x27;s attainder, and therefore, on 25 June, an assembly of Lords and Commons declared Richard to be the lawful king. This was later confirmed by the act of parliament, &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;. The following day he acceded to the throne as King Richard III.

==Disappearance==

Dominic Mancini recorded that after Richard III seized the throne, Edward and his brother Richard were taken into the &quot;inner apartments of the Tower&quot; and then were seen less and less until the end of the summer to the autumn of 1483, when they disappeared from public view altogether. During this period Mancini records that Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, &quot;like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him.&quot; The Latin reference to had previously been translated as &quot;a doctor from Strasbourg&quot;, because the Latin name for the city of Strasbourg, , was still current at the time; however, D. E. Rhodes suggests it may actually refer to &quot;Doctor Argentine&quot;, whom Rhodes identifies as John Argentine, an English physician who would later serve as provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and as doctor to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor).

The princes&#x27; fate after their disappearance remains unknown, but the most widely accepted theory is that they were murdered on the orders of their uncle, King Richard. Thomas More (1478-1535) wrote that they were smothered to death with their pillows, and his account forms the basis of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, in which Tyrrell murders the princes on Richard&#x27;s orders. In the absence of hard evidence a number of other theories have been put forward, of which the most widely discussed are that they were murdered on the orders of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, or by Henry Tudor. However, A. J. Pollard points out that these theories are less plausible than the straightforward one that they were murdered by their uncle who in any case controlled access to them and was therefore regarded as responsible for their welfare. In the period before the boys&#x27; disappearance, Edward was regularly being visited by a doctor; historian David Baldwin extrapolates that contemporaries may have believed Edward had died of an illness (or as the result of attempts to cure him). An alternative theory is that Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the throne, was indeed Richard, Duke of York, as he claimed, having escaped to Flanders after his uncle&#x27;s defeat at Bosworth to be raised by his aunt, Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy.

In 1486 Edward IV&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, sister of Edward V, married Henry VII, thereby uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster. In 1516, Dame Margaret Capel bequeathed a chain that had belonged to Edward V to her son Giles Capel. This is one of the few known references to the personal possessions of the Princes in the Tower.

In 2021, researchers from &quot;The Missing Princes Project&quot; claimed to have found evidence that Edward may have lived out his days in the rural Devon village of Coldridge. They linked the 13-year-old prince with a man named John Evans, who arrived in the village around 1484, and was immediately given an official position and the title of Lord of the Manor. Researcher John Dike noted Yorkist symbols and stained glass windows depicting Edward V in a Coldridge chapel commissioned by Evans and built around 1511, unusual for the location.

Bones belonging to two children were discovered in 1674 by workmen rebuilding a stairway in the Tower. On the orders of King Charles II, these were subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey, in an urn bearing the names of Edward and Richard. The bones were re-examined in 1933, at which time it was discovered the skeletons were incomplete and had been interred with animal bones. It has never been proven that the bones belonged to the princes, and it is possible that they were buried before the reconstruction of that part of the Tower of London. Permission for a subsequent examination has been refused.

In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Adjoining this was another vault, which was found to contain the coffins of two children. This tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV&#x27;s children who had predeceased him: George, Duke of Bedford, and Mary. However, the remains of these two children were later found elsewhere in the chapel, leaving the occupants of the children&#x27;s coffins within the tomb unknown.

===Missing Princes Project===
In 2022, Langley led &quot;The Missing Princes Project&quot; to discover the fate of the Princes in the Tower. The project began in 2015, following the reburial of Richard III in Leicester and was formally launched in July the following year. In 2023 she claimed to have discovered new evidence that disproved the theory that Richard III was responsible for the deaths of the princes. Along with Rob Rinder, she hosted a Channel 4 programme called &quot;Princes in the Tower: The New Evidence&quot;, in which she revealed her own theories and new archival discoveries. Although praising Langley&#x27;s discoveries, &quot;The Spectator&quot;&#x27;s reviewer called the programme &quot;a calculated insult to the viewer&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;compelling&quot; and awarded the documentary its &quot;Critics Choice.&quot; The programme achieved a large audience with Richard III and the Princes in the Tower trending on Twitter / X. The Richard III Society issued a press release stating: 
Three leading members of the Dutch Research Group who had assisted in the project subsequently distanced themselves from Langley&#x27;s documentary and book, arguing that the documents they had discovered &quot;are in our own opinion open to various interpretations and do not constitute irrefutable proof&quot; for the survival of the princes. Langley responded that her conclusions were based on &quot;the totality of evidence thus assembled and the outcomes of a modern police missing person investigation methodology ... (and not through a traditional historical research method)&quot;. Historian Michael Hicks said that the new documents &quot;do add to knowledge of the Tudor impostors, but they fall short of proof that either Edward V or Richard Duke of York survived beyond their disappearance in the autumn of 1483&quot;.

==Epitaph==

As outlined above, on the orders of Charles II, the presumed bones of Edward V and his brother Richard were interred in Westminster Abbey; Edward was thus buried in the place of his birth. The white marble sarcophagus was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and made by Joshua Marshall. The sarcophagus can be found in the north aisle of the Henry VII Chapel, near Elizabeth I&#x27;s tomb.

The Latin inscription on the urn can be translated as follows:

The original Latin text is as follows (original all in capitals):

==Portrayals in fiction==
Edward appears as a character in the play &quot;Richard III&quot; by William Shakespeare. Edward appears alive in only one scene of the play (Act 3 Scene 1), during which he and his brother are portrayed as bright, precocious children who see through their uncle&#x27;s ambitions. Edward in particular is portrayed as wiser than his years (something his uncle notes) and ambitious about his kingship. Edward and his brother&#x27;s deaths are described in the play, but occur offstage. Their ghosts return in one more scene (Act 5 Scene 3) to haunt their uncle&#x27;s dreams and promise success to his rival, Richmond (i.e. King Henry VII). In film and television adaptations of this play, Edward V has been portrayed by the following actors:

* Kathleen Yorke in the 1911 silent short dramatising a part of the play.
* Howard Stuart in the 1912 silent adaptation.
* Paul Huson in the 1955 film version, alongside Laurence Olivier as Richard.
* Hugh Janes in the 1960 BBC series &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, which contained all the history plays from &quot;Richard II&quot; to &quot;Richard III&quot;.
* Nicolaus Haenel in the 1964 West German TV version 
* Dorian Ford in the 1983 BBC Shakespeare version.
* Spike Hood provided his voice in the 1994 BBC series &quot;&quot;.
* Marco Williamson in the 1995 film version, alongside Ian McKellen as Richard.
* Jon Plummer in the 2005 modernised TV version set on a Brighton housing estate.
* Germaine De Leon in the 2007 modern-day adaptation.
* Edward Bracey in the 2014 drama documentary &quot;Richard III: The Princes in the Tower&quot;.
* Caspar Morley played Edward in the BBC&#x27;s 2016 adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; alongside Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard. It is the final episode in the second season of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;.

Edward V is also featured as a mute role in another of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, where he appears as a newborn baby in the final scene. His father Edward IV addresses his own brothers thus: &quot;Clarence, and Gloster, love my lovely queen, And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.&quot; Gloster, the future Richard III, is at the close of this play already encompassing his nephew&#x27;s demise, as he mutters in an aside, &quot;To say the truth, so Judas kiss&#x27;d his master, And cried – All hail! when as he meant – all harm.&quot;

Edward appears in &quot;The White Queen&quot;, a 2009 historical novel by Philippa Gregory and in the subsequent 2013 TV miniseries &quot;The White Queen&quot;; in the latter, he is played by Sonny Ashbourne Serkis.

==Heraldry==
As heir apparent, Edward bore the royal arms (quarterly France and England) differenced by a label of three points argent. During his brief reign, he used the royal arms undifferenced, supported by a lion and a hart as had his father. His livery badges were the traditional Yorkist symbols of the fetterlocked falcon and the rose argent.

<text>The Fertile Crescent () is a crescent-shaped region in the Middle East, spanning modern-day Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, together with northern Kuwait, south-eastern Turkey, and western Iran. Some authors also include Cyprus and northern Egypt.

The Fertile Crescent is believed to be the first region where settled farming emerged as people started the process of clearance and modification of natural vegetation to grow newly domesticated plants as crops. Early human civilizations such as Sumer in Mesopotamia flourished as a result. Technological advances in the region include the development of agriculture and the use of irrigation, of writing, the wheel, and glass, most emerging first in Mesopotamia.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; was popularized by archaeologist James Henry Breasted in &quot;Outlines of European History&quot; (1914) and &quot;Ancient Times, A History of the Early World&quot; (1916).&lt;ref name=&quot;Breasted 1914/1916&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

There is no single term for this region in antiquity. At the time that Breasted was writing, it roughly corresponded with the territories of the Ottoman Empire ceded to Britain and France in the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Historian Thomas Scheffler has noted that Breasted was following a trend in Western geography to &quot;overwrite the classical geographical distinctions between continents, countries and landscapes with large, abstract spaces&quot;, drawing parallels with the work of Halford Mackinder, who conceptualised Eurasia as a &#x27;pivot area&#x27; surrounded by an &#x27;inner crescent&#x27;, Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s Middle East, and Friedrich Naumann&#x27;s &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot;.

In current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as the surrounding portions of Turkey and Iran. In addition to the Tigris and Euphrates, riverwater sources include the Jordan River. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the Syrian Desert to the south. Around the outer boundary are the Anatolian and Armenian highlands to the north, the Sahara Desert to the west, Sudan to the south, and the Iranian plateau to the east.

==Biodiversity and climate==
As crucial as rivers and marshlands were to the rise of civilization in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the &quot;bridge&quot; between North Africa and Eurasia, which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, where climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The Saharan pump theory posits that this Middle Eastern land bridge was extremely important to the modern distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity.

The area has borne the brunt of the tectonic divergence between the African and Arabian plates and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.

The Fertile Crescent had many diverse climates, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many &quot;r&quot; type annual plants, which produce more edible seeds than &quot;K&quot; type perennial plants. The region&#x27;s dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops important in early agriculture (i.e., wild progenitors to emmer wheat, einkorn, barley, flax, chick pea, pea, lentil, bitter vetch), and four of the five most important species of domesticated animals—cows, goats, sheep, and pigs; the fifth species, the horse, lived nearby. The Fertile Crescent flora comprises a high percentage of plants that can self-pollinate, but may also be cross-pollinated. These plants, called &quot;selfers&quot;, were one of the geographical advantages of the area because they did not depend on other plants for reproduction.

==History==
As well as possessing many sites with the skeletal and cultural remains of both pre-modern and early modern humans (e.g., at Tabun and Es Skhul caves), later Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and Epipalaeolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers (the Natufians); the Fertile Crescent is most famous for its sites related to the origins of agriculture. The western zone around the Jordan and upper Euphrates rivers gave rise to the first known Neolithic farming settlements (referred to as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)), which date to around 9,000 BCE and includes very ancient sites such as Göbekli Tepe, Chogha Golan, and Jericho (Tell es-Sultan).

This region, alongside Mesopotamia (Greek for &quot;between rivers&quot;, between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, lies in the east of the Fertile Crescent), also saw the emergence of early complex societies during the succeeding Bronze Age. There is also early evidence from the region for writing and the formation of hierarchical state level societies. This has earned the region the nickname &quot;The cradle of civilization&quot;.

From ancient times empires arose and fell in the Tigris–Euphrates river basin, including Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Abbasid Caliphate. 

It is in this region where the first libraries appeared about 4,500 years ago. The oldest known libraries are found in Nippur (in Sumer) and Ebla (in Syria), both from .

Both the Tigris and Euphrates start in the Taurus Mountains of what is modern-day Turkey. Farmers in southern Mesopotamia had to protect their fields from flooding each year. Northern Mesopotamia had sufficient rain to make some farming possible. To protect against flooding they made levees.

Since the Bronze Age, the region&#x27;s natural fertility has been greatly extended by irrigation works, upon which much of its agricultural production continues to depend. The last two millennia have seen repeated cycles of decline and recovery as past works have fallen into disrepair through the replacement of states, to be replaced under their successors. Another ongoing problem has been salination—gradual concentration of salt and other minerals in soils with a long history of irrigation.

===Early domestications===
Prehistoric seedless figs were discovered at Gilgal I in the Jordan Valley, suggesting that fig trees were being planted some 11,400 years ago. Cereals were already grown in Syria as long as 9,000 years ago. Small cats (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;) also were domesticated in this region. Also, legumes including peas, lentils and chickpea were domesticated in this region.

Domesticated animals include the cattle, sheep, goat, domestic pig, cat, and domestic goose.

==Cosmopolitan diffusion==

Modern analyses comparing 24 craniofacial measurements reveal a relatively diverse population within the pre-Neolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age Fertile Crescent, supporting the view that several populations occupied this region during these time periods. Similar arguments do not hold true for the Basques and Canary Islanders of the same time period, as the studies demonstrate those ancient peoples to be &quot;clearly associated with modern Europeans&quot;. Additionally, no evidence from the studies demonstrates Cro-Magnon influence, contrary to former suggestions.

The studies further suggest a diffusion of this diverse population away from the Fertile Crescent, with the early migrants moving away from the Near East—westward into Europe and North Africa, northward to Crimea, and northeastward to Mongolia. They took their agricultural practices with them and interbred with the hunter-gatherers whom they subsequently came in contact with while perpetuating their farming practices. This supports prior genetic and archaeological studies which have all arrived at the same conclusion.

Consequently, contemporary &quot;in situ&quot; peoples absorbed the agricultural way of life of those early migrants who ventured out of the Fertile Crescent. This is contrary to the suggestion that the spread of agriculture disseminated out of the Fertile Crescent by way of sharing of knowledge. Instead, the view now supported by a preponderance of evidence is that it occurred by actual migration out of the region, coupled with subsequent interbreeding with indigenous local populations whom the migrants came in contact with.

The studies show also that not all present day Europeans share strong genetic affinities to the Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent; the closest ties to the Fertile Crescent rest with Southern Europeans. The same study further demonstrates all present-day Europeans to be closely related.

==Languages==

Linguistically, the Fertile Crescent was a region of great diversity. Historically, Semitic languages generally prevailed in the modern regions of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Sinai and the fringes of southeast Turkey and northwest Iran, as well as the Sumerian (a language isolate) in Iraq, whilst in the mountainous areas to the east and north a number of generally unrelated language isolates were found, including; Elamite, Gutian and Kassite in Iran, and Hattic, Kaskian and Hurro-Urartian in Turkey. The precise affiliation of these, and their date of arrival, remain topics of scholarly discussion. However, given lack of textual evidence for the earliest era of prehistory, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.

The evidence that does exist suggests that, by the third millennium BCE and into the second, several language groups already existed in the region. These included:
* Proto-Euphratean language: a hypothetical non-Semitic language previously hypothesized to be the substratum language of the people that introduced farming into Southern Iraq in the Early Ubaid period. (5300–4700 BCE) The linguistic consensus today is that multiple unknown substrata contributed to the formation of the artifacts in Sumerian names that motivated the Proto-Euphratean substrate hypothesis, including fossilized archaic elements from earlier stages of Sumerian itself. 
* Sumerian: a non-Semitic language isolate that displays a Sprachbund-type relationship with neighbouring Semitic Akkadian
* Elamite language: a non-Semitic language isolate
* Semitic languages: Akkadian (aka Assyrian and Babylonian), Eblaite, Amorite, Aramaic, Ugaritic, Canaanite languages (including Hebrew, Moabite, Edomite, Phoenician/Carthaginian)
* Hattic: a language isolate, spoken originally in central Anatolia
* Indo-European languages: generally believed to be later intrusive languages arriving after 2000 BCE, such as Hittite, Luwian and the Indo-Aryan material attested in the Mitanni civilization, but recent evidence suggests that the language family emerged from the Fertile Crescent as early as 6000 BCE
* Egyptian: a stand-alone branch of the Afroasiatic languages confined to Egypt
* Hurro-Urartian languages, a small family. The Kassite language spoken in the northern part of the region may have belonged to this family.

Links between Hurro-Urartian and Hattic and the indigenous languages of the Caucasus have frequently been suggested, but are not generally accepted.

<text>The 1936 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the XI Olympiad () and officially branded as Berlin 1936, was an international multi-sport event held from 1 to 16 August 1936 in Berlin, then part of Nazi Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona on the 29th IOC Session on 26 April 1931. The 1936 Games marked the second and most recent time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city bidding to host those Games. Later rule modifications forbade cities hosting the bid vote from being awarded the games.

To outdo the 1932 Los Angeles Games, Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built, as well as six gymnasiums and other smaller arenas. The Games were the first to be televised, with radio broadcasts reaching 41 countries. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million. Her film, titled &quot;Olympia&quot;, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.

Hitler saw the 1936 Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism, and the official Nazi Party paper, the , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games. German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part in the Games by a variety of methods, although some female swimmers from the Jewish sports club Hakoah Vienna did participate. Jewish athletes from other countries were said to have been sidelined to avoid offending the Nazi regime. Lithuania was expelled from the Olympic Games due to Berlin&#x27;s position regarding Lithuanian anti-Nazi policy, particularly because of the 1934–35 Trial of Neumann and Sass in Klaipėda.

Total ticket revenues were 7.5million Reichsmark (equivalent to € in ), for a profit of over one million ℛ︁ℳ︁. The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin (which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5million R.M.) or the outlays of the German national government (which did not make its costs public, but is estimated to have spent US$30million).

Jesse Owens of the United States won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events, and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin, while Germany was the most successful country overall with 101 medals (38 of them gold); the United States placed a distant second with 57 medals. These were the final Olympic Games under the presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour. For the next 12 years, no Olympic Games were held due to the immense world disruption caused by the Second World War. The next Olympic Games were held in 1948 (the Winter Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and then the Summer Games in London, England).

==Host city selection==
At the 28th IOC Session, held in May 1930 in Berlin, 14 cities announced their intention to bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. By the time of the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona in April 1931, only Barcelona and Berlin were left in contention. The other cities that announced an intention to hold the games, but withdrew from the race, were Alexandria, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Cologne, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, Lausanne, Montevideo, Nuremberg, Rio de Janeiro, and Rome. Helsinki, Rome, Barcelona, and Rio de Janeiro would go on to host the Olympic Games in 1952, 1960, 1992, and 2016, respectively. Rome withdrew on the eve of the 1931 Session. 

The city of Barcelona held a multi-sport festival at the same time as the 1931 IOC Session. This included a football match between Spain and the Irish Free State, which was watched by 50,000 spectators. The political uncertainty around the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, which had happened days before the IOC Session, was likely a great factor in the decision taken by delegates regarding the host city for 1936. 

The games were the first for which the host was decided by a vote of each individual IOC member. The deadline for votes was 13 May 1931, two weeks after the Barcelona Session. Of the 67 voting IOC members, 19 submitted ballots during the Session, and 40 by post to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne; the other 8 abstained. The vote was 43 for Berlin, and 16 for Barcelona.

After the Nazis took control of Germany and began instituting anti-Semitic policies, the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin. However, Hitler&#x27;s regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team. One year before the games, the American Olympic Association suggested to change the venue to Rome; they saw Rome as a good replacement because Rome was originally selected to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics.

==Organization==
Hans von Tschammer und Osten, as &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; (i.e., head of the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise (Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen, DRL), the Reich Sports Office, played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics. He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth. At the same time, he also believed that sports was a &quot;way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables&quot;.

Von Tschammer entrusted the details of the organisation of the games to Theodor Lewald and Carl Diem, the former president and secretary of the &quot;Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen&quot;, the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office. Among Diem&#x27;s ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the Olympic torch relay between Greece and the host nation.

===Torch relay===
The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind, following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the 1938 film &quot;Olympia&quot;.

===Broadcasting===
The games were the first to have live television coverage in black-and-white. The German Post Office, using equipment from Telefunken, broadcast over 70 hours of coverage to special viewing rooms throughout Berlin and Potsdam and a few private TV sets, transmitting from the Paul Nipkow TV Station. They used three different types of TV cameras, so blackouts would occur when changing from one type to another. The games were also first time photographed and filmed in color using newly invented Agfacolor.

===Olympic village===
The 1936 Olympic village was located at Elstal in Wustermark (at ), on the western edge of Berlin. The site, which is from the centre of the city, consisted of one and two-floor dormitories, a large dining hall, &quot;Dining Hall of the Nations&quot;, a swimming facility, a gymnasium, track, and other training facilities. Its layout was designed and construction was overseen by the appointed village commander &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Wolfgang Fürstner beginning in 1934. Less than two months before the start of the Olympic Games, Fürstner was abruptly demoted to vice-commander, and replaced by &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Werner von Gilsa, commander of the Berlin Guard-Regiment. The official reason for the replacement was that Fürstner had not acted &quot;with the necessary energy&quot; to prevent damage to the site as 370,000 visitors passed through it between 1 May and 15 June. However, this was just a cover story to explain the sudden demotion of the half-Jewish officer. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws, passed during the period Fürstner was overseeing the Olympic Village, had classified him as a Jew, and as such, the career officer was to be expelled from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Two days after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics, vice-commander Fürstner had been removed from active &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; duty, and committed suicide a day later because he realised he had no future under the Nazis.

After the completion of the Olympic Games, the village was repurposed for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; into the Olympic Döberitz Hospital (), and Army Infantry School (), and was used as such through the Second World War. In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet Union and became a military camp of the Soviet occupation forces. Late 20th-century efforts were made to restore parts of the former village, but little progress was made. More recently, the vast majority of the land of the Olympic Village has been managed by the DKB Foundation, with more success; efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum. The dormitory building used by Jesse Owens, Meissen House, has been fully restored, with the gymnasium and swimming hall partially restored. Seasonally, tours are given daily to small groups and students.

The site remains relatively unknown even in Germany, but some tournaments are held at the site to boost knowledge of the venues.

==Venues==

Twenty-two venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Many were located in the Reich Sportsfeld complex.

Sailing was held in the Bay of Kiel, which would serve as the same sporting venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich. The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two FIFA World Cups and then host an IAAF World Championships in Athletics along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium. Avus Motor Road (AVUS) was started in 1907, but was not completed until 1921 due to World War I. The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games. AVUS continued being used after World War II though mainly in Formula 2 racing. The German Grand Prix was last held at the track in 1959. Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998.

BSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football, handball, athletics, and tennis. The Reich Sports Field, which consisted of the Olympic Stadium, the Dietrich Eckert Open-Air Theatre, the Olympic Swimming Stadium, Mayfield, the Hockey Stadiums, the Tennis Courts, and the Haus des Deutschen Sports, was planned for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics, but was not completed until 1934. Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936. Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935. Mommenstadion opened in 1930. Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). The tennis courts were used, which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final. The K-1 1000 m canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Grünau that included thunder and lightning. During World War II, Deutschlandhalle in Berlin, suffered heavy aerial bombing damage. After the war, the hall was reconstructed and expanded. The Deutschlandhalle was used as a venue, but was increasingly closed for repairs, last in 2009. It was demolished in December 2011. The Mommsenstadion was renovated in 1987 and was still in use .

The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germany&#x27;s favor. The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s. As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands. British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994. Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000. This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004. The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004, with a capacity of 74,228 people. The seating has been changed greatly, especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders. The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC (1963–present), and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come. For the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France. Three years later, the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships.

===Opening ceremony===

The opening ceremony was held at the Berlin Olympic Stadium on 1 August 1936. A flyover by the German airship &quot;Hindenburg&quot; flying the Olympic flag behind it was featured early in the opening ceremonies. After the arrival of Hitler and his entourage, the parade of nations proceeded, each nation with its own unique costume. As the birthplace of the Olympics, Greece entered the stadium first. The host nation, Germany, entered last. Some nations&#x27; athletes purposefully gave the Nazi salute as they passed Hitler. Others gave the Olympic salute (a similar one, given with the same arm), or a different gesture entirely, such as hats-over-hearts, as the United States, India, and China did. All nations lowered their flags as they passed the Führer, save the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the Commonwealth of the Philippines. (The United States doing this was explained later as an army regulation.) Writer Thomas Wolfe, who was there, described the opening as an &quot;almost religious event, the crowd screaming, swaying in unison and begging for Hitler. There was something scary about it; his cult of personality.&quot;

After a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee, the games were officially declared open by Adolf Hitler who quoted (in German): &quot;I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin, celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era.&quot; This sentence was written by IOC President Baillet-Latour as part of a compromise the IOC struck to prevent Hitler from turning the speech into a propaganda event, and he was to follow it strictly, to which Hitler reportedly joked &quot;Count, I&#x27;ll take the trouble to learn it by heart&quot;. Hitler opened the games from his own box, on top of others. Writer David Wallechinsky has commented on the event, saying, &quot;This was his event, he wanted to be glorified.&quot;

Although the Olympic flame was first introduced in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, this was the first instance of the torch relay. The Nazis invented the concept of the torch run from ancient Olympia to the host city. Thus as swimmer Iris Cummings later related, &quot;once the athletes were all in place, the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium&quot;. A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the games.

But despite all the pomp and ceremony, and the glorification of Hitler, all did not go according to plan, and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony. U.S. distance runner Louis Zamperini, one of the athletes present, related it on camera:
===Events===

Basketball, canoeing, and handball made their debut at the Olympics. Handball did not appear again on the program until the next German summer Olympic games in Munich in 1972. There were two demonstration sports: baseball and gliding. Art competitions for medals were also held, and medals were awarded at the closing ceremony for feats of alpinism and aeronautics. Unofficial exhibition events included Indian sports, wushu and motor racing.

===Notable achievements===

Germany had a successful year in the equestrian events, winning individual and team gold in all three disciplines, as well as individual silver in dressage. In the cycling match sprint finals, German Toni Merkens fouled Arie van Vliet of the Netherlands. Instead of being disqualified, he was fined 100 ℛℳ and kept his gold. German gymnasts Konrad Frey and Alfred Schwarzmann both won three gold medals.

American Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events. His German competitor Luz Long offered Owens advice after he almost failed to qualify in the long jump. Mack Robinson, brother of Jackie Robinson, won the 200-meter sprint silver medal behind Owens by 0.4 seconds. Although he did not win a medal, future American war hero Louis Zamperini, lagging behind in the 5,000-meter final, made up ground by clocking a 56-second final lap. In one of the most dramatic 800-meter races in history, American John Woodruff won gold after slowing to jogging speed in the middle of the final to free himself from being boxed in. Glenn Edgar Morris, a farm boy from Colorado, won gold in the decathlon. British rower Jack Beresford won his fifth Olympic medal in the sport, and his third gold medal. The U.S. eight-man rowing team from the University of Washington won the gold medal, coming from behind to defeat the Germans and Italians with Hitler in attendance. 13-year-old American sensation Marjorie Gestring won the women&#x27;s 3 meter diving event.

Jack Lovelock of New Zealand won the 1500 m gold medal, coming through a strong field to win in the world record time of 3:47.8.

In the marathon, the ethnic Koreans Sohn Kee-chung and Nam Sung-yong won one gold and one bronze medal; as Korea was annexed by Japan at the time, they were running for Japan.

India won the gold medal in the field hockey event once again (they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956), defeating Germany 8–1 in the final. Indians were considered Indo-Aryans by the German authorities and there was no controversy regarding the victory. 

Rie Mastenbroek of the Netherlands won three gold medals and a silver in swimming. Estonian heavyweight wrestler Kristjan Palusalu won two gold medals, and he became the first and only wrestler in Olympic history ever to win both the Greco-Roman and freestyle heavyweight events. Berlin 1936 marked the last time Estonia competed as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992.

After winning the middleweight class, the Egyptian weightlifter Khadr El Touni continued to compete for another 45 minutes, finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35 kg. The 20-year-old El Touni lifted a total of 387.5 kg, crushing two German world champions and breaking the then-Olympic and world records, while the German lifted 352.5 kg. Furthermore, El Touni had lifted 15 kg more than the light-heavyweight gold medalist, a feat only El Touni has accomplished. El Touni&#x27;s new world records stood for 13 years. Fascinated by El Touni&#x27;s performance, Adolf Hitler rushed down to greet this human miracle. Prior to the competition, Hitler was said to have been sure that Rudolf Ismayr and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents. Hitler was so impressed by El Touni&#x27;s domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlin&#x27;s Olympic village. The Egyptian held the No. 1 position on the IWF list of history&#x27;s 50 greatest weightlifters for 60 years, until the 1996 Games in Atlanta where Turkey&#x27;s Naim Süleymanoğlu surpassed him to top the list.

Italy&#x27;s football team continued their dominance under head coach Vittorio Pozzo, winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive World Cup victories (1934 and 1938). Much like the successes of German athletes, this triumph was claimed by supporters of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system. Austria won the silver; a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Peru&#x27;s 4–2 win over Austria. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games. In the quarter-finals of the football tournament, Peru beat Austria 4–2 in extra-time. Peru rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time. During extra-time, Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player. In the chaos, Peru scored twice and won, 4–2. However, Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators. The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did Colombia.

A remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay team. The German team were the heavy favourites, but dropped the baton at one hand-off. Of notable interest on the US team was Betty Robinson. She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field, winning the women&#x27;s 100 m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash, and was severely injured. Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead. She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker, where it was discovered that she was not dead, but in a coma. She awoke from the coma seven months later, although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again. Due to the length of her recovery, she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, in her home country.

==Participating nations==
A total of 49 nations attended the Berlin Olympics, up from 37 in 1932. Five nations made their first official Olympic appearance at these Games: Afghanistan, Bermuda, Bolivia, Costa Rica and Liechtenstein.
The nations that returned to the games were Bulgaria, Chile, Egypt, Iceland, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Peru, Romania and Turkey.

The nations that participated in the previous games in Los Angeles in 1932 but were absent in Berlin in 1936 were Ireland and Spain.

At the time, Australia and New Zealand were dominions of the British Empire. Both nations had not yet ratified the Statute of Westminster 1931. India and Bermuda were also part of the British Empire, but were not dominions. And Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States.

==Controversies==
Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy. The official Nazi party paper, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, wrote in the strongest terms that Jewish and black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games. However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed black and Jewish people to participate, and added one token participant to the German team—Helene Mayer, a woman of Jewish descent. In an attempt to &quot;clean up&quot; the host city, the German Ministry of the Interior authorized the chief of police to arrest all Romani and keep them in a &quot;special camp&quot;, the Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp.

===Political aspects===

United States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany, arguing that &quot;politics has no place in sport&quot;, despite having initial doubts.

French Olympians gave a Roman salute at the opening ceremony: known as the &quot;salut de Joinville&quot; per the battalion, Bataillon de Joinville, the Olympic salute was part of the Olympic traditions since the 1924 games. However, due to the different context this action was mistaken by the crowd for a support to fascism, and the Olympic salute was discarded after 1946.

Although Haiti attended only the opening ceremony, an interesting vexillological fact was noticed: its flag and the flag of Liechtenstein were coincidentally identical, and this was not discovered until then. The following year, a crown was added to Liechtenstein&#x27;s to distinguish one flag from the other.

Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were originally slated to compete in the American 4x100 relay team but were replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe prior to the start of the race. There were speculations that their Jewish heritage contributed to the decision &quot;not to embarrass the German hosts&quot;; however, given that African-Americans were also heavily disliked by the Nazis, Glickman and Stoller&#x27;s replacement with black American athletes does not support this theory. Others said that they were in a better physical condition, and that was the main reason behind the replacement.

In 1937, 20th Century Fox released the film &quot;Charlie Chan at the Olympics&quot;. The plot concerned members of the Berlin police force helping the Chinese detective apprehends a group of spies (of unnamed nationality) trying to steal a new aerial guidance system. Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics, actual Games&#x27; footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbols.

After the Olympics, Jewish participation in German sports was further limited, and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal. The Olympic Games provided a nine-month period of relative calmness.

===Antisemitism===

The German Olympic committee, in accordance with Nazi directives, virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or Roma or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games (Helene Mayer, who had one Jewish parent, was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games). This decision meant exclusion for many of the country&#x27;s top athletes such as shotputter and discus thrower Lilli Henoch, who was a four-time world record holder and 10-time German national champion, and Gretel Bergmann who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 1.60 meters in the high jump.

Individual Jewish athletes from several countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics, including South African Sid Kiel, and Americans Milton Green and Norman Cahners. In the United States, the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott.

===Boycott debate===
Prior to and during the Games, there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued. Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931 during the Weimar Republic, but after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime. A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, and the United States. Exiled German political opponents of Hitler&#x27;s regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through pro-Communist newspapers such as the &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot;.

The protests were ultimately unsuccessful; forty-nine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games, the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point.

====France====
Fencer Albert Wolff qualified for the French Olympic Team but boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics, withdrawing from France&#x27;s national team on principle because he was Jewish. He said: &quot;I cannot participate in anything sponsored by Adolf Hitler, even for France.&quot;

====Spain====

The Spanish government led by the newly elected left-wing Popular Front boycotted the Games and organized the People&#x27;s Olympiad as a parallel event in Barcelona. Some 6,000 athletes from 49 countries registered. However, the People&#x27;s Olympiad was aborted because of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just one day before the event was due to start.

====Soviet Union====
The Soviet Union had not participated in international sporting events since the 1920 Summer Olympics. The Soviet government was not invited to the 1920 Games, with the Russian Civil War still raging, and they did not participate in the 1924 Summer Olympics and forward on ideological grounds. Instead, through the auspices of the Red Sport International, it had participated in a left-wing workers&#x27; alternative, the Spartakiad, since 1928. The USSR had intended to attend the People&#x27;s Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled; the Soviets did attend the Spartakiad-sponsored 1937 Workers&#x27; Summer Olympiad in Antwerp, Belgium. The Soviet Union started competing in the Olympics in 1952, when Joseph Stalin realized that they could use the event to fulfil their political and ideological agenda.

====Turkey====
Halet Çambel and Suat Fetgeri Așani, the first Turkish and Muslim women athletes to participate in the Olympics (fencing), refused an offer by their guide to be formally introduced to Adolf Hitler, saying they would not shake hands with him due to his approach to Jews, as stated by Ms. Çambel in a &quot;Milliyet&quot; newspaper interview in 2000.

====United States====
Traditionally, the United States sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics, and there was a considerable debate over whether the nation should participate in the 1936 Games.

Those involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included Ernest Lee Jahncke, Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney, and future IOC President Avery Brundage. Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games, as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its antisemitic policies. However, others such as Brundage (see below) argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views, but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes.

Brundage, then of the United States Olympic Committee, opposed the boycott, stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue. Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports, and that they should never be entwined. Brundage also believed that there was a &quot;Jewish-Communist conspiracy&quot; that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games. Somewhat ironically, Brundage would be later accused of being a Soviet dupe for his controversial stance on the Soviet sports system that allowed them to circumvent the amateur rules. On the subject of Jewish discrimination, he stated, &quot;The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class, creed, or race.&quot;

During a fact-finding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly, Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him, and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry, either.

Unlike Brundage, Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games. Mahoney, the president of the Amateur Athletic Union, led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics. He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich.

Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation. The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival, held on 15 and 16 August at New York&#x27;s Randall&#x27;s Island, to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.

Eventually, Brundage won the debate, convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics. Mahoney&#x27;s efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed.

US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration did not become involved in the debate, due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence. However, several American diplomats including William E. Dodd, the American ambassador to Berlin, and George Messersmith, head of the US legation in Vienna, deplored the US Olympic Committee&#x27;s decision to participate in the games.

<doc id="39731" wikidata="Q391591" url="?curid=39731" title="Roger Williams">
<text>Roger Williams (March 1683) was an English-born New England Puritan minister, theologian, and author who founded Providence Plantations, which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and later the State of Rhode Island. He was a staunch advocate for religious freedom, separation of church and state, and fair dealings with the Native Americans.

Williams was expelled by the Puritan leaders from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he established Providence Plantations in 1636 as a refuge offering what he termed &quot;liberty of conscience&quot;. In 1638, he founded the First Baptist Church in America in Providence. Williams studied the language of the New England Native Americans and published the first book-length study of it in English.

==Early life==
Roger Williams was born in London, and many historians cite 1603 as the probable year of his birth. His birth records were destroyed when St. Sepulchre church burned during the Great Fire of London, and his entry in &quot;American National Biography&quot; notes that Williams gave contradictory information about his age throughout his life. His father was James Williams (1562–1620), a merchant tailor in Smithfield, and his mother was Alice Pemberton (1564–1635).

At an early age, Williams had a spiritual conversion of which his father disapproved. As an adolescent, he apprenticed under Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634), the famous jurist, and was educated at Charterhouse School under Coke&#x27;s patronage. Williams later attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1627. He demonstrated a facility with languages, acquiring familiarity with Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Dutch, and French at an early age. Years later, he tutored John Milton in Dutch and Native American languages in exchange for refresher lessons in Hebrew and Greek.

Williams took holy orders in the Church of England in connection with his studies, but he became a Puritan at Cambridge and thus ruined his chance for preferment in the Anglican church. After graduating from Cambridge, he became the chaplain to Sir William Masham. In April 1629, Williams proposed marriage to Jane Whalley, the niece of Lady Joan (Cromwell) Barrington, but she declined. Later that year, he married Mary Bernard (1609–76), the daughter of Rev. Richard Bernard, a notable Puritan preacher and author; they were married at the Church of High Laver in Epping Forest District, Essex, around 20 miles north-east of London. They had six children, all born in America: Mary, Freeborn, Providence, Mercy, Daniel, and Joseph.

Williams knew that Puritan leaders planned to immigrate to the New World. He did not join the first wave of settlers, but later decided that he could not remain in England under the administration of Archbishop William Laud. Williams regarded the Church of England as corrupt and false, and he had arrived at the Separatist position by 1630; on December 1, he and his wife boarded the Boston-bound &quot;Lyon&quot; in Bristol.

==First years in America==

=== Arrival in Boston ===
On February 5, 1631, the &quot;Lyon&quot; anchored in Nantasket outside of Boston. The church of Boston offered him the opportunity to serve during the vacancy of Rev. John Wilson, who had returned to England to bring his wife back to America. Williams declined the position on grounds that it was &quot;an unseparated church.&quot; In addition, he asserted that civil magistrates must not punish any sort of &quot;breach of the first table&quot; of the Ten Commandments such as idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, false worship, and blasphemy, and that individuals should be free to follow their own convictions in religious matters. These three principles later became central tenets of Williams&#x27;s teachings and writings.

===Salem and Plymouth===
As a Separatist, Williams considered the Church of England irredeemably corrupt and believed that one must completely separate from it to establish a new church for the true and pure worship of God. The Salem church was also inclined to Separatism, and they invited him to become their teacher. In response, leaders in Boston vigorously protested, leading Salem to withdraw its offer. As the summer of 1631 ended, Williams moved to Plymouth Colony where he was welcomed, and informally assisted the minister. At Plymouth, he regularly preached. Plymouth Governor William Bradford wrote that &quot;his teachings were well approved.&quot;

After a time, Williams decided that the Plymouth church was not sufficiently separated from the Church of England. Furthermore, his contact with the Narragansett Native Americans had caused him to question the validity of colonial charters that did not include legitimate purchase of Native American land. Governor Bradford later wrote that Williams fell &quot;into some strange opinions which caused some controversy between the church and him.&quot;

In December 1632, Williams wrote a lengthy tract that openly condemned the King&#x27;s charters and questioned the right of Plymouth to the land without first buying it from the Native Americans. He even charged that King James had uttered a &quot;solemn lie&quot; in claiming that he was the first Christian monarch to have discovered the land. Williams moved back to Salem by the fall of 1633 and was welcomed by Rev. Samuel Skelton as an unofficial assistant.

===Litigation and exile===

The Massachusetts Bay authorities were not pleased at Williams&#x27;s return. In December 1633, they summoned him to appear before the General Court in Boston to defend his tract attacking the King and the charter. The issue was smoothed out, and the tract disappeared forever, probably burned. In August 1634, Williams became acting pastor of the Salem church, the Rev. Skelton having died. In March 1635, he was again ordered to appear before the General Court, and he was summoned yet again for the Court&#x27;s July term to answer for &quot;erroneous&quot; and &quot;dangerous opinions.&quot; The Court finally ordered that he be removed from his church position.

This latest controversy welled up as the town of Salem petitioned the General Court to annex some land on Marblehead Neck. The Court refused to consider the request unless the church in Salem removed Williams. The church felt that this order violated their independence, and sent a letter of protest to the other churches. However, the letter was not read publicly in those churches, and the General Court refused to seat the delegates from Salem at the next session. Support for Williams began to wane under this pressure, and he withdrew from the church and began meeting with a few of his most ardent followers in his home.

Finally, the General Court tried Williams in October 1635 and convicted him of sedition and heresy. They declared that he was spreading &quot;diverse, new, and dangerous opinions&quot; and ordered that he be banished. The execution of the order was delayed because Williams was ill and winter was approaching, so he was allowed to stay temporarily, provided that he ceased publicly teaching his opinions. He did not comply with this demand, and the sheriff came in January 1636, only to discover that he had slipped away three days earlier during a blizzard. He traveled 55 miles on foot through the deep snow, from Salem to Raynham, Massachusetts, where the local Wampanoags offered him shelter at their winter camp. Sachem Massasoit hosted Williams there for the three months until spring.

==Settlement at Providence==

In the spring of 1636, Williams and a number of others from Salem began a new settlement on land which he had bought from Massasoit in Rumford. After settling, however, Plymouth Governor William Bradford sent him a friendly letter which nonetheless warned him that he was still within jurisdiction of Plymouth Colony and concerned that this might antagonize the leaders in Boston.

Accordingly, Williams and Thomas Angell crossed the Seekonk River in search of a new location suitable for settlement. Upon reaching the shore, Williams and Angell were met by Narragansett people who greeted them with the words &quot;What cheer, Netop&quot; (). The settlers then continued eastward along the Providence River, where they encountered a cove and freshwater spring. Finding the area suitable for settlement, Williams acquired the tract from sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi. Here, Williams and his followers established a new, permanent settlement, convinced that divine providence had brought them there. They named it Providence Plantations.

Williams wanted his settlement to be a haven for those &quot;distressed of conscience,&quot; and it soon attracted a growing number of families who did not see eye-to-eye with the leaders in Massachusetts Bay. From the beginning, a majority vote of the heads of households governed the new settlement, but only in civil things. Newcomers could also be admitted to full citizenship by a majority vote. In August 1637, a new town agreement again restricted the government to civil things. In 1640, 39 freemen (men who had full citizenship and voting rights) signed another agreement that declared their determination &quot;still to hold forth liberty of conscience.&quot; Thus, Williams founded the first place in modern history where citizenship and religion were separate, providing religious liberty and separation of church and state. This was combined with the principle of majoritarian democracy.
In November 1637, the General Court of Massachusetts exiled a number of families during the Antinomian Controversy, including Anne Hutchinson and her followers. John Clarke was among them, and he learned from Williams that Aquidneck Island might be purchased from the Narragansetts; Williams helped him to make the purchase, along with William Coddington and others, and they established the settlement of Portsmouth. In spring 1638, some of those settlers split away and founded the nearby settlement of Newport, also situated on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck).

In 1638, Williams and about 12 others were baptized and formed a congregation. Today, Williams&#x27;s congregation is recognized as the First Baptist Church in America.

===Pequot War and relations with Native Americans===

In the meantime, the Pequot War had broken out. Massachusetts Bay asked for Williams&#x27;s help, which he gave despite his exile, and he became the Bay colony&#x27;s eyes and ears, and also dissuaded the Narragansetts from joining with the Pequots. Instead, the Narragansetts allied themselves with the colonists and helped to defeat the Pequots in 1637–38.

Williams formed firm friendships and developed deep trust among the Native American tribes, especially the Narragansetts. He was able to keep the peace between the Native Americans and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations for nearly 40 years by his constant mediation and negotiation. He twice surrendered himself as a hostage to the Native Americans to guarantee the safe return of a great sachem from a summons to a court: Pessicus in 1645 and Metacom (&quot;King Philip&quot;) in 1671. The Native Americans trusted Williams more than any other Colonist, and he proved trustworthy.

== Securing Charters ==
Williams arrived in London in the midst of the English Civil War. Puritans held power in London, and he was able to obtain a charter through the offices of Sir Henry Vane the Younger despite strenuous opposition from Massachusetts&#x27;s agents. His book &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot; proved crucial to the success of his charter, albeit indirectly. It was published in 1643 in London and combined a phrase-book with observations about life and culture as an aid to communicate with the Native Americans of New England. It covered everything from salutations to death and burial. Williams also sought to correct the attitudes of superiority displayed by the colonists towards Native Americans:
Gregory Dexter printed the book, which was the first book-length study of a Native American language. In England, it was well received by readers who were curious about the Native American tribes of the New World.

Williams secured his charter from Parliament for Providence Plantations in July 1644, after which he published his most famous book &quot;The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience&quot;. The publication produced a great uproar; between 1644 and 1649, at least 60 pamphlets were published addressing the work&#x27;s arguments. Parliament responded to Williams on August 9, 1644, by ordering the public hangman to burn all copies. By this time, however, Williams was already on his way back to New England where he arrived with his charter in September.

It took Williams several years to unify the settlements of Narragansett Bay under a single government, given the opposition of William Coddington. The settlements of Providence, Portsmouth, Newport, and Warwick finally united in 1647 into the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Freedom of conscience was again proclaimed, and the colony became a safe haven for people who were persecuted for their beliefs, including Baptists, Quakers, and Jews. However, Coddington disliked Williams and did not enjoy his position of subordination under the new charter government. He sailed to England and returned to Rhode Island in 1651 with his own patent making him &quot;Governor for Life&quot; over Rhode Island and Conanicut Island.

As a result, Providence, Warwick, and Coddington&#x27;s opponents on the island dispatched Williams and John Clarke to England, seeking to cancel Coddington&#x27;s commission. Williams sold his trading post at Cocumscussec (near Wickford, Rhode Island) to pay for his journey even though it had provided his primary source of income. He and Clarke succeeded in rescinding Coddington&#x27;s patent, with Clarke remaining in England for the following decade to protect the colonists&#x27; interests and secure a new charter. Williams returned to America in 1654 and was immediately elected the colony&#x27;s president. He subsequently served in many offices in town and colonial governments.

=== Slavery ===
Williams did not write extensively about slavery. He consistently expressed disapproval of it, though generally he did not object to the enslavement of captured enemy combatants for a fixed duration, a practice that was the normal course of warfare in that time. Williams struggled with the morality of slavery and raised his concerns in letters to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop concerning the treatment of the Pequots during the Pequot War (1636–1638). In these letters, he requested Winthrop to prevent the enslavement of Pequot women and children, as well as to direct the colonial militia to spare them during the fighting. In another letter to Winthrop written on July 31, 1637, Williams conceded that the capture and indenture of remaining Pequot women and children would &quot;lawfully&quot; ensure that remaining enemy combatants were &quot;weakned and despoild&quot;, but pleaded that their indenture not be permanent.

Despite his reservations, Williams formed part of the colonial delegation sent to conduct negotiations at the end of the Pequot War, where the fates of the captured Pequots were decided upon between the colonists of New England and their Native American allies the Narragansetts, Mohegans, and Niantics. Williams reported to Winthrop that he and Narragansett sachem Miantonomoh discussed what to do with a group of captured Pequots; initially they discussed the possibility of distributing them as slaves among the four victorious parties, which Miantonomoh &quot;liked well&quot;, though at Williams&#x27;s suggestion, the non-combatants were relocated to an island in Niantic territory &quot;because most of them were families&quot;. Miantonomoh later requested an enslaved female Pequot from Winthrop, to which Williams objected, stating that &quot;he had his share sent to him&quot;. Instead, Williams suggested that he &quot;buy one or two of some English man&quot;.

In July 1637, Winthrop gave Williams a Pequot boy as an indentured servant. The child had been captured by Israel Stoughton in Connecticut. Williams renamed the child &quot;Will.&quot;

Some of the Native American allies aided in the export of enslaved Pequots to the West Indies, while others disagreed with the practice, believing that they should have been given land and provisions to contribute to the wellbeing of colonial settlements. Many enslaved Pequots frequently ran away, where they were taken in by surrounding Native American settlements. Williams aided colonists in distributing and selling Pequot captives and fielded requests from colonists to track down and return runaways, using his connections with Miantonomoh, Ayanemo, and other Native leaders to find escapees. Williams recorded experiences of abuse and rape recounted by the Natives he apprehended, and Margaret Ellen Newell speculates that Williams&#x27;s letters encouraging Winthrop to limit terms of servitude were informed by his acquaintance with escapees.

In 1641, the Massachusetts Bay Colony passed laws sanctioning slavery. In response, under Williams&#x27;s leadership, Providence Plantations passed a law in 1652 restricting the amount of time for which an individual could be held in servitude and tried to prevent the importation of slaves from Africa. The law established terms for slavery that mirrored that of indentured servitude; enslavement was to be limited in duration and not passed down to children. Upon the unification of the mainland and island settlements, residents of the island refused to accept this law, ensuring that it became dead legislation.

Tensions escalated with the Narragansetts during King Philip&#x27;s War, despite Williams&#x27;s efforts to maintain peace, during which his home was burned to the ground. During the war, Williams led the committee responsible for processing and selling Rhode Island&#x27;s Native American captives into slavery. Williams&#x27;s committee recommended that Providence allow residents to keep Native American slaves in spite of earlier municipal statutes. The committee appraised the prices of various Native American captives and brokered their sale to residents. Williams&#x27;s son transported additional captives to be sold in Newport. Williams also organized the trial and execution of a captured Native American man who had been a ring leader in the war.

== Relations with the Baptists ==
Ezekiel Holliman baptized Williams in late 1638. A few years later, Dr. John Clarke established the First Baptist Church in Newport, Rhode Island, and both Roger Williams and John Clarke became the founders of the Baptist faith in America. Williams did not affiliate himself with any church, but he remained interested in the Baptists, agreeing with their rejection of infant baptism and most other matters. Both enemies and admirers sometimes called him a &quot;Seeker,&quot; associating him with a heretical movement that accepted Socinianism and Universal Reconciliation, but Williams rejected both of these ideas.

==King Philip&#x27;s War and death==

King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676) pitted the colonists against the Wampanoags, along with some of the Narragansetts with whom Williams had previously maintained good relations. Williams was elected captain of Providence&#x27;s militia, even though he was in his 70s. On March 29, 1676, Narragansetts led by Canonchet burned Providence; nearly the entire town was destroyed, including Williams&#x27;s home.

Williams died sometime between January 16 and March 16, 1683 and was buried on his own property. Fifty years later, his house collapsed into the cellar and the location of his grave was forgotten.

Providence residents were determined to raise a monument in his honor in 1860; they &quot;dug up the spot where they believed the remains to be, they found only nails, teeth, and bone fragments. They also found an apple tree root,&quot; which they thought followed the shape of a human body; the root followed the shape of a spine, split at the hips, bent at the knees, and turned up at the feet.

The Rhode Island Historical Society has cared for this tree root since 1860 as representative of Rhode Island&#x27;s founder. Since 2007, the root has been displayed at the John Brown House.

The few remains discovered alongside the root were reinterred in Prospect Terrace Park in 1939 at the base of a large stone monument.

==Separation of church and state==

Williams was a staunch advocate of the separation of church and state. He was convinced that civil government had no basis for meddling in matters of religious belief. He declared that the state should concern itself only with matters of civil order, not with religious belief, and he rejected any attempt by civil authorities to enforce the &quot;first Table&quot; of the Ten Commandments, those commandments that deal with an individual&#x27;s relationship with and belief in God. Williams believed that the state must confine itself to the commandments dealing with the relations between people: murder, theft, adultery, lying, honoring parents, etc. He wrote of a &quot;hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world.&quot; Thomas Jefferson later used the metaphor in his 1801 &quot;Letter to Danbury Baptists&quot;.

Williams considered the state&#x27;s sponsorship of religious beliefs or practice to be &quot;forced worship&quot;, declaring &quot;Forced worship stinks in God&#x27;s nostrils.&quot; He also believed Constantine the Great to be a worse enemy to Christianity than Nero because the subsequent state involvement in religious matters corrupted Christianity and led to the death of the first Christian church and the first Christian communities. He described laws concerning an individual&#x27;s religious beliefs as &quot;rape of the soul&quot; and spoke of the &quot;oceans of blood&quot; shed as a result of trying to command conformity. The moral principles in the Scriptures ought to guide civil magistrates, he believed, but he observed that well-ordered, just, and civil governments existed even where Christianity was not present. Thus, all governments had to maintain civil order and justice, but Williams decided that none had a warrant to promote or repress any religious views. Most of his contemporaries criticized his ideas as a prescription for chaos and anarchy, and the vast majority believed that each nation must have its national church and could require that dissenters conform.

==Writings==

Williams&#x27;s career as an author began with &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot; (London, 1643), written during his first voyage to England. His next publication was &quot;Mr. Cotton&#x27;s Letter lately Printed, Examined and Answered&quot; (London, 1644; reprinted in &quot;Publications of the Narragansett Club&quot;, vol. ii, along with John Cotton&#x27;s letter which it answered). His most famous work is &quot;The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience&quot; (published in 1644), considered by some to be one of the best defenses of liberty of conscience.

An anonymous pamphlet was published in London in 1644 entitled &quot;Queries of Highest Consideration Proposed to Mr. Tho. Goodwin, Mr. Phillip Nye, Mr. Wil. Bridges, Mr. Jer. Burroughs, Mr. Sidr. Simpson, all Independents, etc.&quot; which is now ascribed to Williams. These &quot;Independents&quot; were members of the Westminster Assembly; their &quot;Apologetical Narration&quot; sought a way between extreme Separatism and Presbyterianism, and their prescription was to accept the state church model of Massachusetts Bay.

Williams published &quot;The Bloody Tenent yet more Bloudy: by Mr. Cotton&#x27;s Endeavor to wash it white in the Blood of the Lamb; of whose precious Blood, spilt in the Bloud of his Servants; and of the Blood of Millions spilt in former and later Wars for Conscience sake, that most Bloody Tenent of Persecution for cause of Conscience, upon, a second Tryal is found more apparently and more notoriously guilty, etc.&quot; (London, 1652) during his second visit to England. This work reiterated and amplified the arguments in &quot;Bloudy Tenent&quot;, but it has the advantage of being written in answer to Cotton&#x27;s &quot;A Reply to Mr. Williams his Examination&quot;.

Other works by Williams include:
* &quot;The Hireling Ministry None of Christ&#x27;s&quot; (London, 1652)
* &quot;Experiments of Spiritual Life and Health, and their Preservatives&quot; (London, 1652; reprinted Providence, 1863)
* &quot;George Fox Digged out of his Burrowes&quot; (Boston, 1676) (discusses Quakerism with its different belief in the &quot;inner light,&quot; which Williams considered heretical)

A volume of his letters is included in the Narragansett Club edition of Williams&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (7 vols., Providence, 1866–74), and a volume was edited by John Russell Bartlett (1882).
* &quot;The Correspondence of Roger Williams,&quot; 2 vols., Rhode Island Historical Society, 1988, edited by Glenn W. LaFantasie

Brown University&#x27;s John Carter Brown Library has long housed a 234-page volume referred to as the &quot;Roger Williams Mystery Book&quot;. The margins of this book are filled with notations in handwritten code, believed to be the work of Roger Williams. In 2012, Brown University undergraduate Lucas Mason-Brown cracked the code and uncovered conclusive historical evidence attributing its authorship to Williams. Translations are revealing transcriptions of a geographical text, a medical text, and 20 pages of original notes addressing the issue of infant baptism. Mason-Brown has since discovered more writings by Williams employing a separate code in the margins of a rare edition of the &quot;Eliot Indian Bible&quot;.

==Legacy==

Williams&#x27;s defense of the Native Americans, his accusations that Puritans had reproduced the &quot;evils&quot; of the Anglican Church, and his insistence that England pay the Native Americans for their land all put him at the center of many political debates during his life. He was considered an important historical figure of religious liberty at the time of American independence, and he was a key influence on the thinking of the Founding Fathers.

Slate Rock is a prominent boulder on the west shore of the Seekonk River (near the current Gano Park) that was once one of Providence&#x27;s most important historic landmarks. It was believed to be the spot where the Narragansetts greeted Williams with the famous phrase &quot;What cheer, netop?&quot; The historic rock was accidentally blown up by city workers in 1877. They were attempting to expose a buried portion of the stone, but used too much dynamite and it was &quot;blasted to pieces.&quot; A memorial in Roger Williams Square commemorates the location.

<text>The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that aired five seasons from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large blended family of six children, with three boys and three girls. After its cancellation in 1974, the series debuted in syndication in September 1975. Though it was never a ratings hit or a critical success during its original run, the program has since become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers.

&quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;″s success in syndication led to several television reunion films and spin-off series: &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot; (1976–77), &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot; (1981), &quot;The Brady Brides&quot; (1981), &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Bradys&quot; (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, followed by &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot; in 1996. A second sequel, &quot;The Brady Bunch in the White House&quot;, aired on Fox in November 2002 as a made-for-television film.

In 1997, &quot;Getting Davy Jones&quot; (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. The show&#x27;s enduring popularity has resulted in its widespread recognition as an American cultural icon.

==Premise==
Mike Brady (Robert Reed), a widowed architect with three sons—Greg (Barry Williams), Peter (Christopher Knight), and Bobby (Mike Lookinland)—marries Carol Martin (Florence Henderson), who herself has three daughters: Marcia (Maureen McCormick), Jan (Eve Plumb), and Cindy (Susan Olsen). Mike and Carol adopt each other&#x27;s children and Carol and her daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike&#x27;s live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis), and the boys&#x27; dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet: a cat named Fluffy who never appears in any other episodes). The setting is a large two-story house designed by Mike, located in a Los Angeles suburb. The show never addressed what happened to Carol&#x27;s first husband.

In the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the storylines. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only &quot;steps&quot; in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the Bradys are not a &quot;stepfamily&quot;, only &quot;a family&quot;). Thereafter, episodes focus on typical teen and preteen concerns such as sibling rivalry, puppy love, self-image, character building, responsibility, dating, school grades and getting along in social company. Noticeably absent is any political commentary, especially regarding the Vietnam War, which was being waged at its largest extent during the height of the series.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
The regular cast appears in an opening title sequence in which video &quot;headshots&quot; are arranged in a three-by-three grid, with cast members appearing to look around at one another. The sequence used the then-new &quot;multi-dynamic image technique&quot; created by Canadian filmmaker Christopher Chapman; as a result of the popular attention it garnered in this sequence, it was referred to in the press as &quot;the Brady Bunch effect&quot;. In a 2010 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the show&#x27;s opening title sequence ranked number eight on a list of TV&#x27;s top-10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.
* Robert Reed as Mike Brady
* Florence Henderson as Carol Brady
* Ann B. Davis as Alice Nelson
* Maureen McCormick as Marcia Brady
* Eve Plumb as Jan Brady
* Susan Olsen as Cindy Brady
* Barry Williams as Greg Brady
* Christopher Knight as Peter Brady
* Mike Lookinland as Bobby Brady

===Recurring characters===
* Sam Franklin (Allan Melvin) is Alice&#x27;s boyfriend. He is the owner of a local butcher shop. Sam appears in only eight episodes, but they span all five seasons. He is also frequently mentioned in dialogue, and Alice occasionally goes on dates with him off-screen. By the time of the 1981 made-for-TV film &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot;, Alice and Sam are married.
* Tiger the dog — the original dog that played Tiger died early in the first season. A replacement dog proved problematic, so the producers decided the dog would appear only when essential to the plot. Tiger appeared in about half the episodes in the first season and about half a dozen episodes in the second season. Tiger seemingly vanished without an explanation and was not shown again after &quot;The Impractical Joker&quot; (last episode shown with Tiger) and &quot;What Goes Up&quot; (last episode made with Tiger); however, his doghouse remained in the back yard for the entire run of the series.
* Mr. Phillips (Jack Collins) is Mike&#x27;s boss at the architectural firm. He appears only in season two, in three episodes, but is often mentioned in other episodes when work-related issues occur.
* Cousin Oliver (Robbie Rist) — in the middle of season five, producers added a new character named Oliver, Carol Brady&#x27;s young nephew, who is sent to live with the Bradys while his parents are living in South America. The character was added in an attempt to fill the age gap left by the maturing Brady children — the youngest (Susan Olsen) was 12 years old during the show&#x27;s final season. Lloyd Schwartz, son of creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, later admitted that the character threw off the balance of the show. Fans disliked the character of Oliver, regarding him as an interloper. Oliver appears in the final six episodes of season five, which proved to be the final season, as ABC cancelled the series in 1974. The addition of the character has been cited as the moment the series &quot;jumped the shark&quot;. The term &quot;Cousin Oliver&quot; has been used to describe the addition of a young character as an attempt to save a series from cancellation.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1966, following the success of his TV series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; after reading in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage&quot;. He set to work on a pilot script for a series tentatively titled &quot;Mine and Yours&quot;. Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorcée, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol&#x27;s marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.

Schwartz shopped the series to the &quot;big three&quot; television networks of the era. ABC, CBS, and NBC all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project. Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists&#x27; &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (starring Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball) and CBS&#x27;s &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; (starring Brian Keith and Doris Day), the original script for &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968) was a factor in ABC&#x27;s decision to order episodes for the series.

After receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director John Rich to direct the pilot, then called &quot;The Brady Brood&quot;, cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother, father, and housekeeper roles. The hair colors of the parents were intended to be contrasting from the beginning, so Schwartz intended to keep in reserve three blonde boys, three brunette boys, three blonde girls and three brunette girls until the parents&#x27; actors would be confirmed. For the part of the father, Schwartz originally cast Bob Holiday, who was well known for portraying Superman in a Broadway musical, but since Holiday had little on-camera experience, network executives overrode Schwartz&#x27;s decision; also considered was Gene Hackman, who, however, was largely unknown at the time, so in the end, the role was given to TV veteran Robert Reed, because he was already under contract to Paramount and he had name recognition from The Defenders. For the mother&#x27;s role, comedic actress Joyce Bulifant was close to be cast, to play a somewhat wacky mom. She already did some of the screen tests with the various child actors, in fact, Eve Plumb was cast because of her resemblance to Bulifant. However, after comedic actress Ann B. Davis was cast as the housekeeper, she was deemed to be &quot;more than wacky enough&quot;, and a more grounded, down-to-earth mother was needed to maintain a balance, Florence Henderson was cast instead. As the sets were built on Paramount Television stage 5, adjacent to the stage where &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; was filmed by Sid and Marty Krofft, who later produced &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot;, the production crew prepared the backyard of a home in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, as the exterior location for the chaotic backyard wedding scene. Filming of the pilot began on Friday, October 4, 1968, and lasted eight days.

===Theme song and credits sequence===
The theme song, written by Schwartz and Frank De Vol, and originally arranged, sung, and performed by Paul Parrish, Lois Fletcher, and John Beland under the name the Peppermint Trolley Company, quickly communicated to audiences that the Bradys were a blended family. As described above, the Brady family is shown in a three-by-three grid, tic-tac-toe board-style graphic with Carol in the top center, Alice in the middle block, and Mike in the bottom center. To the right are three blocks with the boys from the oldest on top to the youngest. To the left are three blocks with the girls from the oldest to the youngest. In season two, the Brady kids took over singing the theme song. In season three, the boys sing the first verse, girls sing the second verse, and all sing together for the third and last verse. In season four, a new version is recorded with the same structure as the season three version, but in season five, the season three version returns. Utilizing Christopher Chapman&#x27;s &quot;multi-dynamic image technique&quot;, a version of which had famously appeared in the 1968 film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, the sequence was created and filmed by Howard A. Anderson Jr., a visual effects pioneer who worked on the title sequences for many popular television series. The use of this innovation here became so familiar through the sitcom&#x27;s popularity that it was referred to in the press as the &quot;Brady Bunch effect&quot;. 

The end credits feature an instrumental version of the theme song&#x27;s third verse. In season one, it was recorded by the Peppermint Trolley Company. From season two on, the theme was recorded in-house by Paramount musicians.

===The Brady house===
The house built in 1959, by Harry M. Londelius Jr., and used in exterior shots, is located in Studio City, within the city limits of Los Angeles. It originally bore little relation to the interior of the Bradys&#x27; on-screen home, but was gutted and renovated in 2018 to match the layout of the soundstage sets. According to a 1994 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the San Fernando Valley house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt it looked like a home where an architect would live. A false window was attached to the front&#x27;s A-frame section to give the illusion that it had two full stories (the 2018/19 renovation installed a real window where the false one was in the TV show footage). Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner&#x27;s permission for the 1990 TV series &quot;The Bradys&quot;. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; in 1995, so a facade resembling the original home was built around an existing house.

The house was put up for sale, for the first time since 1973, in the summer of 2018 with an asking price of $1.885 million. Cable network HGTV outbid seven others for it, including NSYNC&#x27;s Lance Bass. HGTV has expanded the home for its original series &quot;A Very Brady Renovation&quot;, with the goal of recreating each of the interior rooms used in the TV series (which had only existed as a Paramount Studios set) while maintaining the original exterior look from the street, and to make it fully habitable (unlike the sets made on Paramount soundstage #5). The six actors who played the TV children, and who also actively participated in the 2018/19 renovation, posed for a photo in front on November 1 the same year. In May 2023, it was announced that HGTV was selling the house for $5.5 million. The house was bought on September 11, 2023 by media executive Tina Trahan, the wife of former HBO chief executive Chris Albrecht and a longtime fan of the show, for $3.2 million. She said she will leave the house as is and not renovate nor update it, and no one will be living in the house, and plans to use it for charity events and fundraisers.

In the series, the address of the house was given as 4222 Clinton Way (as read aloud by Carol from an arriving package in the first-season episode entitled &quot;Lost Locket, Found Locket&quot;, and &quot;Clinton Way&quot; is clearly legible on Marcia&#x27;s driver permit in the fifth-season episode &quot;The Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot;). Although no city was ever specified, it was presumed from references to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Rams, and a Hollywood film studio, among many others, that the Bradys lived in Southern California, most likely Los Angeles or one of its suburbs.

The interior sets of the Brady house were used at least three times for other Paramount TV shows while &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; was still in production: twice for &quot;Mannix&quot; and once for &quot;&quot;. In the case of &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, the Brady furniture was also used. A re-creation of the Brady house was constructed for the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Sunshine Days&quot;, which also revolved around &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.

==Broadcast and syndication==
Since its first syndicated airing in September 1975, an episode of the show has been broadcast somewhere in the United States and abroad every day of the year. Episodes were also shown on ABC Daytime from July 9, 1973, to April 18, 1975, and from June 30 to August 29, 1975, at 11:30 a.m. EST/10:30 CST.

The show aired on TBS starting in the 1980s until 1997, Nickelodeon (as part of the Nick at Nite block in 1995 for a special event, and again from 1998 to 2003 and briefly during the spring of 2012), Noggin (as part of The N block from March to April 2004), TV Land from 2002 to 2015, Nick Jr. Channel (as part of the NickMom block from 2012 to 2013), and Hallmark Channel from January to June 2013 and again starting September 5–30, 2016.

===Current airings===
U.S.

Since its national launch in 2010, the Weigel Broadcasting–owned classic-TV network MeTV has aired a weekly block of the show every Sunday morning promoted as the &quot;Brady Bunch Brunch&quot;. MeTV&#x27;s sister network Catchy Comedy airs the show weekday mornings.

International

In West Germany, the show premiered on ZDF under the name &quot;Drei Mädchen und drei Jungen&quot; (&quot;Three Girls and Three Boys&quot;) on August 8, 1971, with episode six &quot;A Clubhouse Is Not a Home&quot;, and was shown on Sunday afternoons until halfway through Season 4, culminating with episode 77 &quot;Cyrano De Brady&quot; on October 5, 1974. Some episodes were omitted. From 1984 to 1998, reruns would sporadically occur on Sat.1. The later reunion show, &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married/The Brady Brides&quot; would be broadcast on ZDF as &quot;Eine Reizende Familie&quot; (&quot;A Lovely Family&quot;) from October 18, 1984, to January 10, 1985. The second half of Season 4, Season 5 and the omitted episodes would not premiere before 1997 on Comedy &amp; Co.

In Italy, under a RAI-Paramount deal, eight episodes were broadcast on Programma Nazionale (today RAI 1) from April 27 to June 15, 1973 under the name &quot;Album di famiglia&quot;. In the late-70s, it would be shown again in Italian dub on Swiss and Istrian networks. Years later, RAI bought the distribution rights again, and the show began airing on Rai 1 and later Rai 3 under the name &quot;La famiglia Brady&quot; (&quot;The Brady Family&quot;) starting on March 11, 1987. It was later bought by Fininvest, that aired it on Italia 1 from July 9, 1990 and on Canale 5 from January 5, 1991.

ITV broadcast the show in a number of United Kingdom regions, including Thames, Granada, Tyne Tees, Grampian and Ulster from 1975 to 1982.

Streaming

&quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; is also available through video-on-demand services Hulu and Paramount+, although neither streamer offers the complete collection of episodes in its entirety. It was shown dubbed in Argentina under the name “La tribu Brady”.

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment released all five seasons on DVD in Region 1 from 2005 to 2006, before CBS Home Entertainment took over DVD rights to the Paramount Television library (though CBS DVD releases are still distributed by Paramount). Paramount/CBS has released the series on DVD in other countries as well.

In April 2007, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment released the complete series box set, which includes the TV films &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Brady 500&quot; (an episode of &quot;The Bradys&quot;), as well as two episodes of &quot;The Brady Kids&quot; animated series. The box art for this set features green shag carpeting and 1970s-style wood paneling.

8 years later on April 7, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment re-released the complete series box set, a repackaged version at a lower price, but it does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series release.

The TV film &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot; was released as a stand-alone DVD in Region 1 on October 10, 2017.

In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the original series, CBS/Paramount released &quot;The Brady-est Brady Bunch TV &amp; Movie Collection&quot; in Region 1 on June 4, 2019. The collection contains every episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Brady Kids&quot;, &quot;The Brady Brides&quot;, and &quot;The Bradys&quot;, as well as the films &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch in the White House&quot;, and &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot;.

The first two seasons are also available on Region 2 DVD for the UK, with audio in English and subtitle choices in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, or Finnish.

The series has also been released on VHS.

==Reception==
===U.S. television ratings===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Ratings data prior to 1972 is scarce for shows that did not place in the Top 30. Beginning in 2017, The TV Ratings Guide began publishing vintage television ratings as they became readily available from old newspaper publishings. Season 4 ratings came from &quot;Variety&quot; year-end rankings dated May 30, 1973. &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; earned steady ratings during its primetime run (but never placed in the top 30 during the five years it aired) and was cancelled in 1974 after five seasons and 117 episodes; it was cancelled shortly after the series crossed the minimum threshold for syndication. At that point in the storyline, Greg graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college.

===Awards and honors===

&quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; was not an award-winning show at the time of its original broadcast in the 1970s. The series and its cast and crew were not nominated for an award until 1989, when Barry Williams was honored with the Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award at the 10th Youth in Film Awards.

All other awards and nominations for the series have come from the TV Land Awards:

==Discography==
During the series&#x27; original run, the six Brady kids recorded several albums on Paramount&#x27;s record label, all credited to &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. Note that Florence Henderson and Robert Reed did not participate in these recordings, and are not pictured on the album sleeves. 

While session musicians provided backing, the actors from the series provided their own singing voices (which was not always the case for early 1970s television crossover acts). In addition, Chris Knight &amp; Maureen McCormick issued a duet LP in 1973, and five of the six Brady kids also released solo singles between 1970 and 1974; only Susan Olsen did not. None of the singles from The Brady Bunch, or any single or album from the assorted spin-off acts, ever became hits on any national music charts. The group&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Meet The Brady Bunch&quot; was their only charting release, hitting #108 on Billboard&#x27;s album charts.

===Studio albums===
===Compilation albums===
===Singles===
Also includes solo singles as indicated.

==Spin-offs, sequels, and reunions==
Several spin-offs, and sequels, and reality series to the original series have been made, featuring all or most of the original cast. These include another sitcom, an animated series, a variety show, television films, a dramatic series, a stage play, theatrical films, and a reality series.

===&quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot; / &quot;Together We Stand&quot; / &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot;===
A final-season &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; episode, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot;, was intended as a pilot for a prospective spin-off series of the same name. Ken Berry starred as Ken Kelly, a friend and neighbor of the Bradys, who with his wife Kathy (Brooke Bundy) adopted three orphaned boys of different racial backgrounds. One of the adopted sons was played by Todd Lookinland, the younger brother of Mike Lookinland. While &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot; was not subsequently picked up as a full series, producer Sherwood Schwartz reworked the basic premise for the short-lived 1980s sitcom &quot;Together We Stand&quot; starring Elliott Gould and Dee Wallace.

===&quot;The Brady Kids&quot;===

A 22-episode animated Saturday morning cartoon series, produced by Filmation and airing on ABC from September 1972 to August 1974, is about the Brady kids having various adventures. The family&#x27;s adults were never seen or mentioned, and the &quot;home&quot; scenes were in a very large, well-appointed tree house. Several animals were regular characters, including two non-English-speaking pandas (Ping and Pong), a talking bird (Merlin) which could do magic, and an ordinary pet dog (Mop Top). The first 17 episodes featured the voices of all six of the original child actors from the show, but Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick were replaced for the last five episodes due to a contract dispute.

===&quot;The Brady Bunch Variety Hour&quot;===

On November 28, 1976, a one-hour television special entitled &quot;The Brady Bunch Variety Hour&quot; aired on ABC. Eve Plumb was the only regular cast member from the original show who declined to be in the series and the role of Jan was recast with Geri Reischl. Produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, the sibling team behind &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;, &quot;Donny and Marie&quot;, and other variety shows and children&#x27;s series of the era, the show was intended to air every fifth week in the same slot as &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, but ended up being scheduled sporadically throughout the season, leading to inconsistent ratings and its inevitable cancellation.

In 2009, &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; cast member Susan Olsen, with Lisa Sutton, published a book, &quot;Love to Love You Bradys&quot;, which dissects and celebrates the &quot;Variety Hour&quot; as a cult classic.

===&quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot; / &quot;The Brady Brides&quot;===
A TV reunion film called &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot; was produced in 1981. Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length film format, NBC decided at the last minute to divide it into half-hour segments and show one part a week for three weeks. The fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled &quot;The Brady Brides&quot;, which carried on from where the reunion film left off. The film featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series (the complete surviving cast also appeared in these official projects together: &quot;Brady Bunch Home Movies&quot; from 1995, &quot;The Brady Bunch 35th Anniversary Reunion Special: Still Brady After All These Years&quot; from 2004, as well as various reunion programs in 2019 for the 50th anniversary). The film&#x27;s opening credits featured the season-one &quot;Grid&quot; and theme song, with the addition of &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot; title. The film shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan&#x27;s double wedding.

&quot;The Brady Brides&quot; features Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb reprising their respective roles as Marcia and Jan Brady. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan&#x27;s uptight and conservative husband, Phillip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia&#x27;s tousled and more bohemian husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by Jerry Houser), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Florence Henderson and Ann B. Davis also appeared regularly. Ten episodes were aired before the sitcom was cancelled. This was the only Brady show in sitcom form to be filmed in front of a live studio audience. Bob Eubanks guest-starred as himself in an episode where the two couples appear on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;.

Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, &quot;The Brady Girls Get Married&quot; was rerun on various networks in its original full-length film format.

In 2019, the series was released on DVD for the first time as a part of &quot;The Brady-est Brady Bunch TV &amp; Movie Collection&quot;.

====Episodes (1981)====
===&quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;===

A second TV reunion film, &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;, aired in December 1988 on CBS and features most of the regular cast (except Susan Olsen, who was on her honeymoon at the time of filming; the role of Cindy was played by Jennifer Runyon), as well as three grandchildren, Peter&#x27;s girlfriend, Valerie, and the spouses of Greg, Marcia, and Jan (Nora, Wally, and Phillip, respectively). The Nielsen ratings for &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot; were the highest of any television film that season for CBS.

===&quot;The Bradys&quot;===

Due to the success of &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;, CBS asked &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; creator Sherwood Schwartz and son Lloyd to create a new series for the network. According to Lloyd Schwartz, he and his father initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was &quot;desperate for programming&quot;. A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled &quot;The Bradys&quot;. All original &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; cast members returned for the series, except for Maureen McCormick (Marcia), who was replaced with Leah Ayres.

As with &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Bradys&quot; also balanced elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines of a more serious nature than the original series and subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared &quot;The Bradys&quot; to another dramedy of the time, &quot;thirtysomething&quot;. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.

===&quot;Day by Day&quot;: &quot;A Very Brady Episode&quot;===
The &quot;Day by Day&quot; episode titled &quot;A Very Brady Episode&quot; (February 5, 1989), on NBC, reunited six of the original &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; cast members: Robert Reed, Florence Henderson, Ann B. Davis, Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland and Maureen McCormick.

===&quot;Bradymania: A Very Brady Special&quot;===
A one-hour TV special retrospective of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; hosted by Florence Henderson who introduces a montage of various episodes of the original series, and also examines the show&#x27;s phenomenal after-life, illustrated by clips from spin-offs and other incarnations of the series. Also, cast members Christopher Knight, Susan Olsen, Mike Lookinland, Barry Williams, Ann B. Davis, and creator Sherwood Schwartz reflect on the impact of the show on their lives. Directed by Malcolm Leo, the special was originally broadcast on ABC on May 19, 1993.

===&quot;A Very Brady Renovation&quot;===

Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland, Maureen McCormick, Susan Olsen, Eve Plumb, and Barry Williams reunited for the 2019 HGTV series &quot;A Very Brady Renovation&quot;, which follows a full renovation (interior mostly) of the real house, used for the sitcom&#x27;s exterior shots, into the fictional Brady house.

===&quot;Chopped&quot;===
In conjunction with the Renovation series, in the autumn of 2019, The Food Network aired two episodes of their program &quot;Chopped&quot; with the siblings as guest judges. Season 43, episode 3 - &quot;Brady Bunch Bash&quot; features Williams, Plumb, and Lookinland judging meals made from Hawaiian ingredients. Season 43, episode 4 - &quot;A Very Brady Chopped&quot; features McCormick, Knight, and Olsen judging meals from &quot;groovy&quot; ingredients of the &#x27;70s.

===&quot;A Very Brady Musical&quot;===
In October 2020, during the global Covid-19 virus pandemic, Ogunquit Playhouse did a live stream broadcast of &quot;A Very Brady Musical&quot;, a brand new musical adventure for the stage created by Lloyd J. Schwartz (son of Brady Bunch creator Sherwood Schwartz), Hope Juber (book/lyrics), and Laurence Juber (music/lyrics) and directed by Richard Israel. It was co-produced by Ogunquit Playhouse, Purple Mountain Productions, and Broadway and Beyond Theatricals. More in the vein of the Brady films, this PG-13 story follows the Brady kids’ misadventures when they come to the mistaken conclusion that Mike and Carol are headed for divorce. After consulting Alice, the kids raise money to pay for marriage counseling, learning valuable lessons along the way, as their respective well-intentioned ideas land them in outrageous trouble. Barry Williams and Christopher Knight were on hand for a post-show question and answer session on all things Brady.

===&quot;Dragging the Classics: The Brady Bunch&quot;===
On June 30, 2021, streaming service Paramount+ celebrated Pride Month with the premiere of a crossover special combining &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and the reality television series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. In the crossover event, original &quot;Brady&quot; cast members and former &quot;Drag Race&quot; competitors come together to recreate a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; episode. Christopher Knight and Mike Lookinland reprise their roles of Peter and Bobby Brady, respectively, while the original Greg Brady, Barry Williams, switches parts to play family patriarch Mike; Greg Brady is portrayed by &quot;Drag Race&quot; Season 6 and &quot;All Stars 3&quot; competitor BenDeLaCreme. Season 6 winner Bianca Del Rio fills the role of mother Carol Brady, and daughters Marcia, Jan, and Cindy are portrayed by &quot;All Stars 5&quot; winner Shea Couleé, season 2 and &quot;All Stars 6&quot; competitor Kylie Sonique Love, and season 13 runner-up Kandy Muse, respectively. Season 11 Miss Congeniality Nina West appears as housekeeper Alice Nelson.

The special, which recreates the season two episode &quot;Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?&quot;, also contains cameos by &quot;Drag Race&quot; judges RuPaul and Michelle Visage, who appear as employees of a wig shop that Jan patronizes. The original Jan and Cindy Brady, Eve Plumb and Susan Olsen, also appear as children who are guests at the birthday party.

===&quot;The Real Brady Bros: Podcast&quot;===
In January 2022, Christopher Knight and Barry Williams published their new podcast The Real Brady Bros. The weekly podcast recaps episodes of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. Eve Plumb, Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland have guested to discuss episodes in which they have featured.

=== Unmade revival ===
In October 2024, during a heated Presidential election cycle, Susan Olsen claimed on a political podcast that due to her right-wing political views, in 2022, a planned Brady Bunch revival, which would have picked up with the Brady Bunch children as adults, was cancelled. Olsen alleged that Lloyd J. Schwartz questioned her about her political views, and due to her behavior, the project died in early stages and it was unclear whether even a script had been written. Reportedly, in the series, Cindy was going to be a libertarian podcaster. According to Olsen, the project was &quot;dead in the water&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
Twenty years following the conclusion of the original series, a film adaptation, &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie,&quot; went into production and was released in 1995 from Paramount Pictures. The film is set in the present day (1990s) and the Bradys, still living their lives as if it were the 1970s, are unfamiliar with their surroundings. It stars Gary Cole and Shelley Long as Mike and Carol Brady, with Christopher Daniel Barnes (Greg), Christine Taylor (Marcia), Paul Sutera (Peter), Jennifer Elise Cox (Jan), Jesse Lee (Bobby), Olivia Hack (Cindy), Henriette Mantel (Alice), and cameo appearances from Ann B. Davis as a long-haul truck driver, Barry Williams as a record label executive, Christopher Knight as a Westdale High gym teacher, RuPaul as a guidance counselor, and Florence Henderson as Carol&#x27;s mother. Mike Lookinland, Susan Olsen and Maureen McCormick appear in deleted scenes.

A sequel, &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot;, was released in 1996. The cast of the first film returned for the sequel. Another sequel, &quot;The Brady Bunch in the White House&quot;, was made-for-television and aired on Fox in 2002. Gary Cole and Shelley Long returned for the third film, while the Brady kids and Alice were recast.

The third episode of the Disney+ miniseries &quot;WandaVision&quot;, &quot;Now in Color&quot;, pays homage to 1970s sitcoms, including &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, and uses a similar intro for the virtual &quot;WandaVision&quot; in-show program.

==Unauthorized adaptations==
An unauthorized stage show, &quot;The Real Live Brady Bunch&quot;, was created by siblings Joey Soloway and Faith Soloway at Chicago’s Annoyance Theatre in 1991. The cast, including Andy Richter as Mike, Jane Lynch as Carol, and Melanie Hutsell as Jan, performed original &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; scripts verbatim on stage. The show became a phenomenon in Chicago, with “new” episodes transcribed and performed every two weeks. Guest performers included Eve Plumb and Davy Jones, while Robert Reed and Susan Olsen attended multiple performances. Paramount was preparing legal action over the stage show when Sherwood Schwartz visited Chicago. Charmed by the tribute, Schwartz agreed to grant rights to the Soloways. The show went on to run in New York and Los Angeles. Joey Soloway became a successful television producer, with credits including &quot;Transparent&quot;.

David Gilbert’s 2014 short story, “Here’s the Story,” imagines a backstory for the series, in which the original spouses of Carol and Mike are on the verge of beginning an extramarital affair when they both die in the same plane crash. The story ran in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2014.

<text>Élie Ducommun (19 February 1833, Geneva – 7 December 1906, Bern) was a Swiss peace activist. He was a Nobel laureate, awarded the 1902 Nobel Peace Prize, which he shared with Charles Albert Gobat.

Born in Geneva, he worked as a tutor, language teacher, journalist and a translator for the Swiss federal Chancellery (1869–1873).

In 1867 he helped to found the Ligue de la paix et de la liberté (League of Peace and Freedom), though he continued working at other positions, including secretary for the Jura-Simplon Steel Company from 1873 to 1891. That year, he was appointed director of the newly formed International Peace Bureau, the first non-governmental international peace organization, based in Bern. He refused to accept a salary for the position, stating that he wished to serve in this capacity solely for reasons of idealism. From 1895 he was made the director of &quot;Correspondance bi-mensuelle&quot;, journal of the International Peace Office. 

His keen organizational skills ensured the group&#x27;s success. He was awarded in the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902, and served as director of the organization until his death in 1906.

<doc id="39735" wikidata="Q1235967" url="?curid=39735" title="Edmund of Abingdon">
<text>Edmund of Abingdon (also known as Edmund Rich, St Edmund of Canterbury, Edmund of Pontigny, French: St Edme; c. 11741240) was an English Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Canterbury. He became a respected lecturer in mathematics, dialectics and theology at the Universities of Paris and Oxford, promoting the study of Aristotle. 

Having already an unsought reputation as an ascetic, he was ordained a priest, took a doctorate in divinity and soon became known not only for his lectures on theology but as a popular preacher, spending long years travelling within England, and engaging in 1227 preaching the Sixth Crusade. 

Obliged to accept an appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Gregory IX, he combined a gentle personal temperament with a strong public stature and severity towards King Henry III in defence of Magna Carta and in general of good civil and Church government and justice. He also worked for strict observance in monastic life and negotiated peace with Llywelyn the Great. 

His policies earned him hostility and jealousy from the king, and opposition from several monasteries and from the clergy of Canterbury Cathedral. He died in France at the beginning of a journey to Rome in 1240. He was canonised in 1246.

==Life==

===Early life and career===
Edmund was born circa 1174, possibly on 20 November (the feast of St Edmund the Martyr), in Abingdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), 7 miles south of Oxford, England. Edmund had two sisters and at least one brother.

&quot;Rich&quot; was an epithet sometimes given to his wealthy merchant father, Reynold. It was never applied to Edmund or his siblings in their lifetimes. His father retired, with his wife&#x27;s consent, to the monastery at Eynsham Abbey, leaving in her hands the education of their family. Her name was Mabel; she was a devout woman who lived an ascetic life and encouraged her children to do the same. Both her daughters took the veil.

Edmund may have been educated at the monastic school in Abingdon. He developed a taste for religious learning, saw visions while still at school, and at the age of twelve took a vow of perpetual chastity in the Virgin&#x27;s church at Oxford. His early studies were in England, but he completed his higher learning in France at the University of Paris. About 1195, in company with his brother Richard, he was sent to the schools of Paris. He studied at the universities of Oxford and Paris and became a teacher about 1200, or a little earlier. For six years he lectured on mathematics and dialectics, apparently dividing his time between Oxford and Paris, and helped introduce the study of Aristotle.

Edmund became one of Oxford&#x27;s first lecturers with a Master of Arts, but was not Oxford&#x27;s first Doctor of Divinity. Long hours at night spent in prayer had the result that he often &quot;nodded off&quot; during his lectures. There is a long-established tradition that he utilised his lecture-fees to build the Lady Chapel of St Peter&#x27;s in the East at Oxford. The site where he lived and taught was formed into a mediaeval academic hall in his name and later incorporated as the college of St Edmund Hall.

His mother&#x27;s influence then led to his taking up the study of theology.
Though for some time Edmund resisted the change, he finally entered upon his new career between 1205 and 1210. He spent a year in retirement with the Augustinian canons of Merton Priory, received ordination, took a doctorate in divinity and soon became known as a lecturer on theology and as an extemporaneous preacher. In this capacity he gained some reputation for eloquence. He spent the fees which he received in charity, and refused to spend upon himself the revenues which he derived from several benefices. He often retired for solitude to Reading Abbey, and it is possible that he would have become a monk if that profession had afforded more scope for his gifts as a preacher and expositor.

Sometime between 1219 and 1222 he was appointed vicar of the parish of Calne in Wiltshire, and treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral. He held this position for eleven years, during which time he also engaged in preaching. In 1227 he preached the Sixth Crusade through a large part of England. He formed a friendship with Ela, countess of Salisbury, and her husband, William Longespée, and was noted for his works of charity and the austerity of his life.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
In 1233 came the news of Edmund&#x27;s appointment, by Pope Gregory IX, to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. The chapter had already made three selections which the pope had declined to confirm. Edmund&#x27;s name had been proposed as a compromise by Gregory, perhaps on account of his work for the crusade. He was consecrated on 2 April 1234.

Before his consecration Edmund became known for supporting ecclesiastical independence from Rome, maintenance of the Magna Carta and the exclusion of foreigners from civil and ecclesiastical office. Reluctant to accept appointment as archbishop, Edmund was persuaded when it was pointed out that if he refused, the Pope might very well appoint a foreign ecclesiastic. He chose as his chancellor Richard of Wich, known to later ages as St Richard of Chichester.
In the name of his fellow bishops Edmund admonished Henry III of England at Westminster, on 2 February 1234, to heed the example of his father, John of England. A week after his consecration he again appeared before the king with the barons and bishops, this time threatening Henry with excommunication if he refused to dismiss his councillors, many of them foreign, and particularly Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. Henry yielded, and the favourites were dismissed, Hubert de Burgh (whom they had imprisoned) was released and reconciled to the king and soon the archbishop was sent to Wales to negotiate peace with Llywelyn the Great. Edmund&#x27;s success, however, turned the king against him.

Edmund was valued by the local people for his teaching, preaching, study, and his prayer; but his uncompromising stand in favour of good discipline in both civil and ecclesial government, of strict observance in monastic life, and of justice in high quarters brought him into conflict with Henry III, with several monasteries, and with the priests of Canterbury cathedral. He claimed and exercised metropolitan rights of visitation, this was often challenged and he had to resort to litigation to maintain his authority, not the least with his own monastic chapter at Canterbury.
In 1236, with the object of emancipating himself from Edmund&#x27;s control, the king asked the pope to send him a legate. On the arrival of Cardinal Odo in 1237 the archbishop found himself thwarted and insulted at every point. The politically significant marriage between Simon de Montfort and Henry&#x27;s sister Eleanor, which Edmund had pronounced invalid, was ratified at Rome upon appeal. The king and legate upheld the monks of Canterbury in their opposition to Edmund&#x27;s authority. Edmund protested to the king, and excommunicated in general terms all who had infringed the liberties of Canterbury. These measures had no impact, and the pope could not be moved to reverse the legate&#x27;s decisions. Edmund complained that the discipline of the national church was ruined by this conflict of powers, and began to consider retirement.

===Journey to Rome===
Notwithstanding the gentleness of his disposition, Edmund firmly defended the rights of Church and State against the exactions and usurpations of Henry III. In December 1237 Edmund set out for Rome to plead his cause in person. From this futile mission he returned to England in August 1238 where his efforts to foster reform were frustrated. Edmund submitted to the papal demands and, early in 1240 paid to the pope&#x27;s agents one fifth of his revenue, which had been levied for the pope&#x27;s war against Emperor Frederick II. Other English prelates followed his example.

The papacy then ordered that 300 English benefices should be assigned to Romans. In 1240 Edmund set out for Rome. At the Cistercian Pontigny Abbey in France he became sick, began travelling back to England, but died only 50 miles further north, on 16 November 1240, at the house of Augustinian Canons at Soisy-Bouy and was taken back to Pontigny.

===Veneration===

Less than a year after Edmund&#x27;s death, miracles were alleged to be wrought at his grave. Despite Henry&#x27;s opposition, he was canonised only six years after his death, in December 1246. His feast day is 16 November. A few years later, the first chapel dedicated to him, St Edmund&#x27;s Chapel, was consecrated in Dover by his friend Richard of Chichester, making it the only chapel dedicated to one English saint by another; this small building still stands.

At Salisbury, a collegiate church founded in 1269 by Bishop de la Wyle was dedicated to Edmund; rebuilt in 1407, the church is now Salisbury Arts Centre. An altar in the cathedral is also dedicated to him.

Today he is remembered in the name of St Edmund Hall, Oxford and St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His name is given also to St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware; St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury; St Edmund&#x27;s School, Hindhead; St Edmund&#x27;s Catholic School, Portsmouth; St Edmund of Abingdon pastoral area of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton; St Edmund&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, Abingdon, Oxfordshire and St Edmund Preparatory High School, Brooklyn, NY.

Edmund Rich of Abingdon is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 16 November.

===Relics===
Edmund&#x27;s body was never translated to Canterbury, because the Benedictine community there resented what they regarded as Edmund&#x27;s attacks on their independence. After his death he was taken back to Pontigny Abbey, where his main relics are now found in a baroque reliquary tomb dating to the 17th century.

An arm is enshrined in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption at St. Edmund&#x27;s Retreat on Enders Island off the coast of Mystic, Connecticut. The retreat is operated by the Society of the Fathers and Brothers of St. Edmund.

In 1853, the fibula of Edmund&#x27;s left leg was presented to St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, by Cardinal Wiseman. Many local cures of serious illnesses were attributed to the intercession of St Edmund; one of the earliest of these was of a student who nearly died after a fall in 1871. His complete healing led to the accomplishment of a vow to extend the Pugin chapel with a side chapel to honour the saint.

The Islamic silk chasuble, with the main fabric probably made in Al-Andalus, that Edmund had with him at his death remains in the museum in Provins, with a stole and maniple.

===Character===
Edmund&#x27;s life was one of self-sacrifice and devotion to others. From boyhood he practised asceticism, such as fasting on Saturdays on bread and water, and wearing a hair shirt. After a few hours&#x27; sleep, he spent most of the night in prayer and meditation.

==Works==
Besides his &quot;Constitutions&quot;, issued in 1236 (printed in W. Lynwood&#x27;s &quot;Constitutiones Angliae&quot;, Oxford, 1679), Edmund wrote a work in the genre of the Speculum literature entitled &quot;Speculum ecclesiae&quot; (London, 1521; Eng. transl., 1527; reprinted in M. de la Bigne&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca veterum patrum&quot;, v., Paris, 1609), which was translated into Anglo-Norman around the second half of the thirteenth century as &quot;Mirour de Seinte Eglyse&quot; (&#x27;a mirror of the holy Church&#x27;), a treatise about the Christian faith aimed at religious practitioners. (The French text was then revised in a version labelled by its editor as a &#x27;lay version&#x27;, which is attested principally in the manuscript London, British Library, MS Arundel 288).

==Religious Congregation of the Society of St Edmund==
Edmund&#x27;s life inspired the formation of the Society of Saint Edmund at Pontigny, France, in 1843 by Jean Baptiste Muard and Pierre Boyer. The Society intended to keep Edmund&#x27;s memory and life alive by conducting parish missions in the archdiocese of Sens, so as to revitalize the faith of the people who had become alienated from the Church. Members of the Society, based in Pontigny, fled to the United States in 1889 after widespread anticlericalism in France. The Society of Saint Edmund settled in Winooski Park, Vermont and in 1904 established Saint Michael&#x27;s College where the deeds and values of Edmund&#x27;s life continue through the college mission. Today members of the Society of Saint Edmund devote themselves to parochial work in the Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, ministry to the African American community through the Edmundite Missions in Selma, Alabama, to higher education at Saint Michael&#x27;s College, and retreat ministry at Saint Edmund&#x27;s Retreat (Enders Island) in Connecticut as well as Saint Anne&#x27;s Shrine in Vermont.

<text>In taxonomy, binomial nomenclature (&quot;two-term naming system&quot;), also called binary nomenclature, is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (often shortened to just &quot;binomial&quot;), a binomen, name, or a scientific name; more informally, it is also called a Latin name. In the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the system is also called nomenclature, with an &quot;n&quot; before the &quot;al&quot; in &quot;binominal&quot;, which is a typographic error, meaning &quot;two-name naming system&quot;.

The first part of the name – the &quot;generic name&quot; – identifies the genus to which the species belongs, whereas the second part – the specific name or specific epithet – distinguishes the species within the genus. For example, modern humans belong to the genus &quot;Homo&quot; and within this genus to the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; is likely the most widely known binomial. The &quot;formal&quot; introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. But as early as 1622, Gaspard Bauhin introduced in his book &quot;Pinax theatri botanici&quot; (English, &quot;Illustrated exposition of plants&quot;) containing many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Binomial nomenclature was introduced in order to provide succinct, relatively stable and verifiable names that could be used and understood internationally, unlike common names which are usually different in every language.

The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot; (&quot;ICZN&quot;) for animals and the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (&quot;ICNafp&quot; or &quot;ICN&quot;). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences in the terminology they use and their particular rules.

In modern usage, the first letter of the generic name is always capitalized in writing, while that of the specific epithet is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond) is now written as &quot;Phlox drummondii&quot;. Often, after a species name is introduced in a text, the generic name is abbreviated to the first letter in subsequent mentions (e.g., &quot;P. drummondii&quot;).

In scientific works, the authority for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the year of publication may be specified.
* In zoology
** &quot;&quot;Patella vulgata&quot; Linnaeus, 1758&quot;. The name &quot;Linnaeus&quot; tells the reader who published the name and description for this species; 1758 is the year the name and original description were published (in this case, in the 10th edition of the book &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;).
** &quot;&quot;Passer domesticus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758)&quot;. The original name given by Linnaeus was &quot;Fringilla domestica&quot;; the parentheses indicate that the species is now placed in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.
* In botany
** &quot;&quot;Amaranthus retroflexus&quot; L.&quot; – &quot;L.&quot; is the standard abbreviation used for &quot;Linnaeus&quot;.
** &quot;&quot;Hyacinthoides italica&quot; (L.) Rothm.&quot; – Linnaeus first named this bluebell species &quot;Scilla italica&quot;; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;; the &quot;ICNafp&quot; does not require that the dates of either publication be specified.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;binomial&quot; is composed of two elements: (Latin prefix meaning &#x27;two&#x27;) and (the adjective form of , Latin for &#x27;name&#x27;). In Medieval Latin, the related word was used to signify one term in a binomial expression in mathematics. In fact, the Latin word may validly refer to either of the epithets in the binomial name, which can equally be referred to as a (pl. ).

==History==
Prior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long. Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature. These names had two separate functions. First, to designate or label the species, and second, to be a diagnosis or description; however, these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible. In a simple genus, containing only two species, it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name; but as more species were discovered, the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy, for instance, &quot;Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti&quot; (&quot;plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindric spike and a terete scape&quot;), which we know today as &quot;Plantago media&quot;.

Such &quot;polynomial names&quot; may sometimes look like binomials, but are significantly different. For example, Gerard&#x27;s herbal (as amended by Johnson) describes various kinds of spiderwort: &quot;The first is called &quot;Phalangium ramosum&quot;, Branched Spiderwort; the second, &quot;Phalangium non ramosum&quot;, Unbranched Spiderwort. The other ... is aptly termed &quot;Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum&quot;, Soon-Fading Spiderwort of Virginia&quot;. The Latin phrases are short descriptions, rather than identifying labels.

The Bauhins, in particular Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624), took some important steps towards the binomial system by pruning the Latin descriptions, in many cases to two words. The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778). It was in Linnaeus&#x27;s 1753 &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; that he began consistently using a one-word trivial name () after a generic name (genus name) in a system of binomial nomenclature. Trivial names had already appeared in his &quot;Critica Botanica&quot; (1737) and &quot;Philosophia Botanica&quot; (1751). This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet (&quot;ICNafp&quot;) or specific name (&quot;ICZN&quot;). The Bauhins&#x27; genus names were retained in many of these, but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word.

Linnaeus&#x27;s trivial names introduced the important new idea that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label, meaning that the name no longer needed to be descriptive. Both parts could, for example, be derived from the names of people. Thus Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Phalangium ephemerum virginianum&quot; became &quot;Tradescantia virginiana&quot;, where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the Younger, an English botanist and gardener. A bird in the parrot family was named &quot;Psittacus alexandri&quot;, meaning &quot;Alexander&#x27;s parrot&quot;, after Alexander the Great, whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to Greece. Linnaeus&#x27;s trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names, and eventually replaced them.

==Value==

The value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names that the Codes of Zoological and Botanical, Bacterial and Viral Nomenclature provide:
* Economy. Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced, a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember. It corresponds to the noun-adjective form many vernacular names take to indicate a species within a group (for example, &#x27;brown bear&#x27; to refer to a particular type of bear), as well as the widespread system of family name plus given name(s) used to name people in many cultures.
* Widespread use. The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide. A few binomials have also entered common speech, such as &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Boa constrictor&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, and &quot;Aloe vera&quot;.
* Uniqueness. Provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species, it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code, generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species. This means the species a binomial name refers to can be clearly identified, as compared to the common names of species which are usually different in every language. However, establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can sometimes be difficult, particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries. Therefore, a species may have more than one regularly used name; all but one of these names are &quot;synonyms&quot;. Furthermore, within zoology or botany, each species name applies to only one species. If a name is used more than once, it is called a homonym.

* Stability. Although stability is far from absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names, such as the principle of priority, tend to favor stability. For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge), the second part of the binomial is kept the same (unless it becomes a homonym). Thus, there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera &quot;Chionodoxa&quot; and &quot;Scilla&quot; are sufficiently different for them to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name &quot;Chionodoxa siehei&quot;; those who do not give it the name &quot;Scilla siehei&quot;. The &quot;siehei&quot; element is constant. Similarly, if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, the second part of the binomial name is retained as a trinomen (the third part of the new name). Thus, the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is &quot;Erithacus superbus&quot;, or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is &quot;Erithacus rubecula superbus&quot;. The &quot;superbus&quot; element of the name is constant, as are its authorship and year of publication.

==Problems==
Binomial nomenclature for species has the effect that when a species is moved from one genus to another, sometimes the specific name or epithet must be changed as well. This may happen because the specific name is already used in the new genus, or to agree in gender with the new genus if the specific epithet is an adjective modifying the genus name. Some biologists have argued for the combination of the genus name and specific epithet into a single unambiguous name, or for the use of uninomials (as used in nomenclature of ranks above species).

Because genus names are unique only within a nomenclature code, it is possible for homonyms (two or more species sharing the same genus name) to happen, and even the same binomial if they occur in different kingdoms. At least 1,258 instances of genus name duplication occur (mainly between zoology and botany).

==Relationship to classification and taxonomy==
Nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification, although the two are related. Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities or differences; in biological classification, species are one of the kinds of item to be classified. In principle, the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification. This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera.

Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification. Its first stages (sometimes called &quot;alpha taxonomy&quot;) are concerned with finding, describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms. Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named. Taxonomists are also concerned with classification, including its principles, procedures and rules.

==Derivation of binomial names==
A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language (hence the common use of the term &quot;Latin name&quot; for a binomial name). However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include:
* Latin, from any period, whether classical, medieval or modern. Thus, both parts of the binomial name are Latin words, meaning &quot;wise&quot; () &quot;human/man&quot; ().
* Classical Greek. The genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word , itself derived from &quot;rhodon&quot;, &quot;rose&quot;, and &quot;dendron&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;. Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form. Thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name &quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot;. &quot;Erythroxylum&quot; is derived from the Greek words , red, and , wood. The Greek ending - (-on), when it is neuter, is often converted to the Latin neuter ending .
* Other languages. The second part of the name &quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; is derived from , the name of the plant in Aymara and Quechua. Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use Mongolian words, e.g. &quot;Tarchia&quot; from , meaning &quot;brain&quot;, or &quot;Saichania&quot; meaning &quot;beautiful one&quot;.
* Names of people (often naturalists or biologists). The name &quot;Magnolia campbellii&quot; commemorates two people: Pierre Magnol, a French botanist, and Archibald Campbell, a doctor in British India.
* Names of places. The lone star tick, &quot;Amblyomma americanum&quot;, is widespread in the United States.
* Other sources. Some binomial names have been constructed from taxonomic anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names. Thus the name of the genus &quot;Muilla&quot; is derived by reversing the name &quot;Allium&quot;. Names may also be derived from jokes or puns. For example, Neal Evenhuis described a number of species of flies in a genus he named &quot;Pieza&quot;, including &quot;Pieza pi&quot;, &quot;Pieza rhea&quot;, &quot;Pieza kake&quot;, and &quot;Pieza deresistans&quot;.

The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word that can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case. It must be unique within the purview of each nomenclatural code, but can be repeated between them. Thus &quot;Huia recurvata&quot; is an extinct species of plant, found as fossils in Yunnan, China, whereas &quot;Huia masonii&quot; is a species of frog found in Java, Indonesia.
The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms:
* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. If so, the form of the adjective must agree with the genus name in gender. Latin nouns can have three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, and many Latin adjectives will have two or three different endings, depending upon the gender of the noun they refer to. The house sparrow has the binomial name . Here (&quot;domestic&quot;) simply means &quot;associated with the house&quot;. The sacred bamboo is rather than , since is feminine whereas is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant , since is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are , , (as in the previous example of ); , , (e.g., , meaning &quot;sad&quot;); and (e.g., , meaning &quot;smaller&quot;).

* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is . Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, is feminine and is masculine.

* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are or in the singular and in the plural, and for feminine nouns in the singular and in the plural. The noun may be part of a person&#x27;s name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope (), the shrub , or the olive-backed pipit (). The meaning is &quot;of the person named&quot;, so means &quot;Hodgson&#x27;s magnolia&quot;. The or endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example, was named by Charles Wallace Richmond, in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with , meaning &quot;of the Chalumna River&quot;. Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium , where means &quot;of the colon&quot;. This formation is common in parasites, as in , where means &quot;of the wasps&quot;, since is a parasite of wasps.

Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within the purview of each nomenclatural code, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of &quot;hodgsonii&quot; above), but cannot be used more than once within a single genus. The full binomial name must be unique within each code.

==Codes==
From the early 19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. In the course of time these became nomenclature codes. The &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot; (&quot;ICZN&quot;) governs the naming of animals, the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (&quot;ICNafp&quot;) that of plants (including cyanobacteria), and the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria&quot; (&quot;ICNB&quot;) that of bacteria (including Archaea). Virus names are governed by the &quot;International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses&quot; (&quot;ICTV&quot;), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:
* &quot;Binomial nomenclature&quot; is the correct term for botany, although it is also used by zoologists. Since 1961, &quot;binominal nomenclature&quot; is the technically correct term in zoology. A binomial name is also called a binomen (plural binomina) or name.
* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the &quot;generic name&quot;. In the zoological code (&quot;ICZN&quot;), the second part of the name is a &quot;specific name&quot;. In the botanical code (&quot;ICNafp&quot;), it is a &quot;specific epithet&quot;. Together, these two parts are referred to as a &quot;species name&quot; or &quot;binomen&quot; in the zoological code: or &quot;species name&quot;, &quot;binomial&quot;, or &quot;binary combination&quot; in the botanical code. &quot;Species name&quot; is the only term common to the two codes.
* The &quot;ICNafp&quot;, the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym), whereas the &quot;ICZN&quot;, the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomen &quot;Bison bison&quot;; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.
* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;). In zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, 10th Edition, and also Clerck&#x27;s &quot;Aranei Svecici&quot;). Bacteriology started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.

Unifying the different codes into a single code, the &quot;BioCode&quot;, has been suggested, although implementation is not in sight. (There is also a published code for a different system of biotic nomenclature, which does not use ranks above species, but instead names clades. This is called &quot;PhyloCode&quot;.)

===Differences in handling personal names===
As noted above, there are some differences between the codes in how binomials can be formed; for example the &quot;ICZN&quot; allows both parts to be the same, while the &quot;ICNafp&quot; does not. Another difference is in how personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The &quot;ICNafp&quot; sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not &quot;er&quot;) are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding &quot;-ius&quot; (for a man) or &quot;-ia&quot; (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning &quot;of that person or persons&quot;). This produces specific epithets like &quot;lecardii&quot; for Lecard (male), &quot;wilsoniae&quot; for Wilson (female), and &quot;brauniarum&quot; for the Braun sisters. By contrast, the &quot;ICZN&quot; does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to be added directly to the personal name. This explains the difference between the names of the plant &quot;Magnolia hodgsonii&quot; and the bird &quot;Anthus hodgsoni&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;ICNafp&quot; requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it, whereas the &quot;ICZN&quot; is more protective of the form used by the original author.

== Writing binomial names ==
By tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Generally, the binomial should be printed in a font style different from that used in the normal text; for example, &quot;&quot;Several more &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossils were discovered&quot;.&quot; When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, Homo sapiens.

The first part of the binomial, the genus name, is always written with an initial capital letter. Older sources, particularly botanical works published before the 1950s, used a different convention: if the second part of the name was derived from a proper noun, e.g., the name of a person or place, a capital letter was used. Thus, the modern form &quot;Berberis darwinii&quot; was written as &quot;Berberis Darwinii&quot;. A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g., &quot;Panthera Leo&quot; or &quot;Centaurea Cyanus&quot;. In current usage, the second part is never written with an initial capital.

When used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication. For example, &quot;The house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) is decreasing in Europe.&quot;

The binomial name should generally be written in full. The exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report, or the same species is mentioned repeatedly; in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used, but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop). For example, a list of members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; might be written as &quot;&quot;Canis lupus&quot;, &quot;C. aureus&quot;, &quot;C. simensis&quot;&quot;. In rare cases, this abbreviated form has spread to more general use; for example, the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is often referred to as just &quot;E. coli&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; is perhaps even better known simply as &quot;T. rex&quot;, these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given.

The abbreviation &quot;sp.&quot; is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified. The abbreviation &quot;spp.&quot; (plural) indicates &quot;several species&quot;. These abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined). For example: &quot;&quot;Canis&quot; sp.&quot; means &quot;an unspecified species of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, while &quot;Canis&quot; spp.&quot; means &quot;two or more species of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;&quot;. (These abbreviations should not be confused with the abbreviations &quot;ssp.&quot; (zoology) or &quot;subsp.&quot; (botany), plurals &quot;sspp.&quot; or &quot;subspp.&quot;, referring to one or more subspecies. See trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name.)

The abbreviation &quot;cf.&quot; (i.e., &quot;confer&quot; in Latin) is used to compare individuals/taxa with known/described species. Conventions for use of the &quot;cf.&quot; qualifier vary. In paleontology, it is typically used when the identification is not confirmed. For example, &quot;&quot;Corvus&quot; cf. &quot;nasicus&quot;&quot; was used to indicate &quot;a fossil bird similar to the Cuban crow but not certainly identified as this species&quot;. In molecular systematics papers, &quot;cf.&quot; may be used to indicate one or more undescribed species assumed to be related to a described species. For example, in a paper describing the phylogeny of small benthic freshwater fish called darters, five undescribed putative species (Ozark, Sheltowee, Wildcat, Ihiyo, and Mamequit darters), notable for brightly colored nuptial males with distinctive color patterns, were referred to as &quot;&quot;Etheostoma&quot; cf. &quot;spectabile&quot;&quot; because they had been viewed as related to, but distinct from, &quot;Etheostoma spectabile&quot; (orangethroat darter). This view was supported to varying degrees by DNA analysis. The somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as open nomenclature and it is not subject to strict usage codes.

In some contexts, the dagger symbol (&quot;†&quot;) may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct.

=== Authority ===
In scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the &quot;authority&quot; – a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the &quot;ICZN&quot; the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. One example of author citation of scientific name is: &quot;&quot;Amabela&quot; Möschler, 1880.&quot; The &quot;ICZN&quot; recommends that the &quot;original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.&quot; For names governed by the &quot;ICNafp&quot; the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The International Plant Names Index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.

When the original name is changed, e.g., the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the &quot;ICNafp&quot; also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the &quot;ICNafp&quot;, the original name is then called the basionym. Some examples:
* (Plant) &quot;Amaranthus retroflexus&quot; L. – &quot;L.&quot; is the standard abbreviation for &quot;Linnaeus&quot;; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.
* (Plant) &quot;Hyacinthoides italica&quot; (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell &quot;Scilla italica&quot;; that is the basionym. Rothmaler later transferred it to the genus &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;.
* (Animal) &quot;Passer domesticus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – the original name given by Linnaeus was &quot;Fringilla domestica&quot;; unlike the &quot;ICNafp&quot;, the &quot;ICZN&quot; does not require the name of the person who changed the genus (Mathurin Jacques Brisson) to be given.

==Other ranks==
Binomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly, it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks, there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus, the house sparrow, &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;, belongs to the family Passeridae. Family names are normally based on genus names, such as in zoology, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.

Ranks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the &quot;ICZN&quot; and the &quot;ICNafp&quot;. In zoology, the only formal rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus, one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is &quot;Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii&quot;. Informally, in some circumstances, a form may be appended. For example &quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot; f. &quot;spectabilis&quot; is the harlequin ladybird in its black or melanic forms having four large orange or red spots. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a &quot;connecting term&quot; (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus, the American black elder is &quot;Sambucus nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;canadensis&quot;; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; f. &quot;albiflorum&quot;.

<doc id="39737" wikidata="Q778508" url="?curid=39737" title="Myles Coverdale">
<text>Myles Coverdale, first name also spelt Miles (c. 1488 – 20 January 1569), was an English ecclesiastical reformer chiefly known as a Bible translator, preacher, hymnist and, briefly, Bishop of Exeter (1551–1553). In 1535, Coverdale produced the first printed translation of the full Bible into Early Modern English, completing the translations of William Tyndale. 

His theological development is a paradigm of the progress of the English Reformation from 1530 to 1552. By the time of his death, he had transitioned into an early Puritan, affiliated to Calvin, and a friend of John Knox.

==Life to end of 1528==
Regarding his probable birth county, Daniell cites John Bale, author of a sixteenth-century scriptorium, giving it as Yorkshire. His birth date is generally regarded as 1488.

Coverdale studied philosophy and theology at Cambridge, becoming bachelor of canon law in 1513. In 1514 John Underwood, a suffragan bishop and archdeacon of Norfolk, ordained him priest in Norwich. He entered the house of the Augustinian friars in Cambridge, where Robert Barnes had returned from Louvain to become its prior. This is thought to have been about 1520–1525.
According to Trueman, Barnes returned to Cambridge in the early to mid-1520s. At Louvain Barnes had studied under Erasmus and had developed humanist sympathies. In Cambridge, he read aloud to his students from St. Paul&#x27;s epistles in translation and taught from classical authors. This undoubtedly influenced them towards Reform. In February 1526, Coverdale was part of a group of friars that travelled from Cambridge to London to present the defence of their superior, after Barnes was summoned before Cardinal Wolsey. Barnes had been arrested as a heretic after being accused of preaching Lutheran views in the church of St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge on Christmas Eve. Coverdale is said to have acted as Barnes&#x27; secretary during the trial. By the standards of the time, Barnes received relatively lenient treatment, being made to do public penance by carrying a faggot to St Paul&#x27;s Cross. However on 10 June 1539, Parliament passed the Act of Six Articles, marking a turning point in the progress of radical protestantism.
Barnes was burned at the stake on 30 July 1540, at Smithfield, along with two other reformers. Also executed that day were three Roman Catholics, who were hanged, drawn and quartered.

Coverdale probably met Thomas Cromwell some time before 1527. A letter survives showing that later, in 1531, he wrote to Cromwell, requesting his guidance on his behaviour and preaching; also stating his need for books. By Lent 1528, he had left the Augustinians and, wearing simple garments, was preaching in Essex against transubstantiation, the veneration of sacred images, and Confession to a Priest. At that date, such views were very dangerous, for the future course of the religious revolution that began during the reign of Henry VIII was as yet very uncertain. Reforms, both of the forms proposed by Lollardy, and those preached by Luther, were being pursued by a vigorous campaign against heresy. Consequently, towards the end of 1528, Coverdale fled from England to the Continent.

==First exile, 1528==
From 1528 to 1535 Coverdale spent most of his time in continental Europe, mainly in Antwerp. Celia Hughes believes that upon arriving there, he rendered considerable assistance to William Tyndale in his revisions and partial completion of his English versions of the Bible. 

In 1531, Tyndale spoke to Stephen Vaughan of his poverty and the hardships of exile, although he was relatively safe in the English House in Antwerp, where the inhabitants supposedly enjoyed diplomatic immunity. However, in the spring of 1535 a &quot;debauched and villainous young Englishman wanting money&quot; named Henry Phillips insinuated himself into Tyndale&#x27;s trust. Phillips had gambled away money from his father and had fled abroad. He promised the authorities of the Holy Roman Emperor that he would betray Tyndale for cash. On the morning of 21 May 1535, having arranged for the imperial officers to be ready, Phillips tricked Tyndale into leaving the English House, whereupon he was immediately seized. Tyndale languished in prison throughout the remainder of 1535 and despite attempts to have him released, organised by Cromwell through Thomas Poyntz at the English House, Tyndale was strangled and burned at the stake in October 1536. 

Meanwhile Coverdale continued his work alone to produce what became the first complete English Bible in print, namely the Coverdale Bible. Not proficient in Hebrew or Greek, he used Latin, English and German sources plus the translations of Tyndale himself.

==Coverdale&#x27;s translation of the Bible, 1535==
In 1534 Canterbury Convocation petitioned Henry VIII that the whole Bible might be translated into English. Consequently, in 1535, Coverdale dedicated this complete Bible to the King. After much scholarly debate, it is now considered very probable that the place of printing of the Coverdale Bible was Antwerp. The printing was financed by Jacobus van Meteren. The printing of the first edition was finished on 4 October 1535. 

Coverdale based the text in part on Tyndale&#x27;s translation of the New Testament (following Tyndale&#x27;s November 1534 Antwerp edition) and of those books which were translated by Tyndale: the Pentateuch, and the Book of Jonah. Other Old Testament books he translated from the German of Luther and others.

Based on Coverdale&#x27;s translation of the Book of Psalms in his 1535 Bible, his later Psalter has remained in use in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; to the present day, and is retained with various minor corrections in the 1926 Irish &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the 1928 US Episcopal &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, and the 1962 Canadian &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, etc.

==Further translations, 1537–1539==
In 1537 the Matthew Bible was printed, also in Antwerp, at the expense of Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch who issued it in London. It comprised Tyndale&#x27;s Pentateuch; a version of Joshua 2 and Chronicles translated from the Hebrew, probably by Tyndale and not previously published; the remainder of the Old Testament from Coverdale; Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament from 1535. It was dedicated to Henry VIII who licensed it for general reading. &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot;, the supposed editor, was an alias for John Rogers.

The Matthew Bible was theologically controversial. Furthermore it bore evidence of its origin from Tyndale. If Henry VIII had become aware of this, the position of Cromwell and Cranmer would have been precarious. Consequently in 1538 Coverdale was sent to Paris by Cromwell to superintend the printing of the planned &quot;Great Bible&quot;. François Regnault, who had supplied all English service books from 1519 to 1534, was selected as the printer because his typography was more sumptuous than that available in England. According to Kenyon, the assent of the French king was obtained. In May 1538 printing began. Nevertheless, a coalition of English bishops together with French theologians at the Sorbonne interfered with the operations and the Pope issued an edict that the English Bibles should be burned and the presses stopped. Some completed sheets were seized, but Coverdale rescued others, together with the type, transferring them to London. Ultimately, the work was completed in London by Grafton and Whitchurch.

Also in 1538, editions were published, both in Paris and in London, of a diglot (dual-language) New Testament. In this, Coverdale compared the Latin Vulgate text with his own English translation, in parallel columns on each page.

An injunction was issued by Cromwell in September 1538, strengthening an earlier one that had been issued but widely ignored in 1536. This second injunction firmly declared opposition to &quot;pilgrimages, feigned relics, or images, or any such superstitions&quot; whilst correspondingly placing heavy emphasis on scripture as &quot;the very lively word of God&quot;. Coverdale’s Great Bible was now almost ready for circulation and the injunction called for the use of &quot;one book of the whole Bible of the largest volume&quot; in every English church. However at the time insufficient Great Bibles were actually printed in London so an edition of the Matthew Bible that had been re-edited by Coverdale started to be used. The laity were also intended to learn other core items of worship in English, including the Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and the Ten Commandments.

In February 1539, Coverdale was in Newbury communicating with Thomas Cromwell. The printing of the London edition of the Great Bible was in progress. It was finally published in April of the same year. John Winchcombe, son of &quot;Jack O&#x27;Newbury&quot;, a famous clothier, served as a confidential messenger to Coverdale who was performing an ecclesiastical visitation. Coverdale commended Winchcombe for &quot;his true heart towards the King&#x27;s Highness&quot; and in 1540, Henry VIII granted to Winchcombe the manor of Bucklebury, a former demesne of Reading Abbey.
Also from Newbury, Coverdale reported to Cromwell via Winchcombe about breaches in the king&#x27;s laws against papism, sought out churches in the district where the sanctity of Becket was still maintained, and arranged to burn primers and other church books which had not been altered to match the king&#x27;s proceedings.

Sometime between 1535 and 1540 (the exact dates being uncertain), separate printings were made of Coverdale&#x27;s translations into English of the psalms. These first versions of his psalm renditions were based mainly or completely upon his translation of the Book of Psalms in the 1535 Coverdale Bible.

In the final years of the decade, the conservative clerics, led by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, were rapidly recovering their power and influence, opposing Cromwell&#x27;s policies. On 28 June 1539 the Act of Six Articles became law, ending official tolerance of religious reform. Cromwell was executed on 28 July 1540. This was close to the date of the burning of Coverdale&#x27;s Augustinian mentor Robert Barnes. Cromwell had protected Coverdale since at least 1527 and the latter was obliged to seek refuge again.

==Second exile, 1540–1547==
In April 1540 there was a second edition of the Great Bible, this time with a prologue by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. For this reason, the Great Bible is sometimes known as Cranmer’s Bible although he had no part in its translation. According to Kenyon, there were seven editions in total, up until the end of 1541, with the later versions including some revisions.

Before leaving England, Coverdale married Elizabeth Macheson (d. 1565), a Scotswoman of noble family who had come to England with her sister and brother-in-law as religious exiles from Scotland. They went first to Strasbourg, where they remained for about three years. He translated books from Latin and German and wrote an important defence of Barnes. This is regarded as his most significant reforming statement apart from his Bible prefaces. He received the degree of DTh from Tübingen and visited Denmark, where he wrote reforming tracts. In Strasbourg he befriended Conrad Hubert, Martin Bucer&#x27;s secretary and a preacher at the church of St Thomas. Hubert was a native of Bergzabern (now Bad Bergzabern) in the duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken. In September 1543, on the recommendation of Hubert, Coverdale became assistant minister in Bergzabern as well as schoolmaster in the town&#x27;s grammar school. During this period, he opposed Martin Luther&#x27;s attack on the Reformed view of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. He also began to learn Hebrew, becoming competent in the language, as had been Tyndale.

==Return to England, 1548==

Edward VI (1547–53) was only 9 years old when he succeeded his father on 28 January 1547. For most of his reign he was being educated, whilst his uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, acted as Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King&#x27;s Person. Immediately upon receiving these appointments he became Duke of Somerset.

Coverdale did not immediately return to England, although the prospects looked better for him. Religious policy followed that of the chief ministers and during Edward&#x27;s reign this moved towards Protestantism. However in March 1548 he wrote to John Calvin that he was now returning, after eight years of exile for his faith. He was well received at the court of the new monarch. He became a royal chaplain in Windsor, and was appointed almoner to the queen dowager, Catherine Parr. At Parr&#x27;s funeral in September 1548, Coverdale delivered what would later be said to have been his &quot;1st Protestant sermon&quot;.

On 10 June 1549, the Prayer Book Rebellion broke out in Devon and Cornwall. There, Coverdale was directly involved in preaching and pacification attempts. Recognising the continuing unpopularity of the Book of Common Prayer in such areas, the Act of Uniformity had been introduced, making the Latin liturgical rites unlawful from Whitsunday 1549 onward. The west-country rebels, many of whom spoke Cornish but not English, complained that the new English liturgy was &quot;but lyke a Christmas game&quot; – men and women should form separate files to receive communion, reminding them of country dancing. 

The direct spark of rebellion occurred at Sampford Courtenay where, in attempting to enforce the orders, an altercation led to a death, with a proponent of the changes being run through with a pitchfork.
Unrest was said also to have been fuelled by several years of increasing social dissatisfaction. Lord John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford was sent by the Lord Protector to put down the rapidly spreading rebellion and Coverdale accompanied him as chaplain. The Battle of Sampford Courtenay effectively ended the rebellion by the end of August, at a loss of over 1,200 Catholic rebel lives, and several thousands more in previous battles and massacres. 

However Coverdale remained in Devon for several more months, helping to pacify the people and doing the work that properly belonged to the Bishop of Exeter. The incumbent, John Vesey, was eighty-six, and had not stirred from Sutton Coldfield in Warwickshire, his birthplace and long-term residence.

== Bishop of Exeter, 1551==
Coverdale spent Easter 1551 in Oxford with the Florentine-born Augustinian reformer Peter Martyr Vermigli. At that time, Martyr was Regius Professor of divinity, belonging to Magdalen College. He had been assisting Cranmer with a revision of the Anglican prayer book. Coverdale attended Martyr&#x27;s lectures on the Epistle to the Romans and Martyr called him a &quot;a good man who in former years acted as parish minister in Germany&quot; who now &quot;labours greatly in Devon in preaching and explaining the Scriptures&quot;. He predicted that Coverdale would become Bishop of Exeter and this took place on 14 August 1551 when John Vesey was ejected from his see.

==Third exile, 1553–1559==
Edward VI died of tuberculosis on 6 July 1553. Shortly before, he had attempted to deter a Roman Catholic revival by switching the succession from Mary daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon to Lady Jane Grey. However his settlement of the succession lasted barely a fortnight. After a brief struggle between the opposing factions, Mary was proclaimed Queen of England on 19 July. Historian Eamon Duffy reports that the news broke during a sermon by Bishop Coverdale, during which almost all the congregation walked out one by one (i.e., such was the anti-Protestant affinity of the locals of Devon and Cornwall.)

The renewed danger to reformers such as Coverdale was obvious. He was summoned almost immediately to appear before the Privy Council and on 1 September he was placed under house arrest in Exeter. On 18 September, he was ejected from his see and Vesey, now ninety and still in Warwickshire, was reinstated. Following an intervention by his brother-in-law, chaplain to King Christian III of Denmark-Norway, Coverdale and his wife were permitted to leave for that country. They then went on to Wesel, and finally back to Bergzabern.

On 24 October 1558, Coverdale received leave to settle in Geneva. Commenting on his contribution to the Geneva Bible (the exact details of which are scarce), Daniell says: &quot;Although his Hebrew, and ... now his Greek, could not match the local scholars&#x27; skills, Coverdale would no doubt have special things to offer as one who nearly two dozen years before had first translated the whole Bible ... the only Englishman to have done so, and then revised it under royal authority for the successive editions of the Great Bible.&quot; On 29 November 1558 Coverdale was godfather to John Knox&#x27;s son. On 16 December he became an elder of the English church in Geneva, and participated in a reconciling letter from its leaders to other English churches on the continent.

==London, 1559–1569==
In August 1559, Coverdale and his family returned to London, where they lodged with the Duchess of Suffolk, whom they had known at Wesel. He was appointed as preacher and tutor to her children. He wrote to William Cole in Geneva, saying that the duchess had &quot;like us, the greatest abhorrence of the ceremonies&quot; (meaning the increasing reversion to the use of vestments).

His stance on vestments was one of the reasons why he was not reinstated to his bishopric. However Hughes believes that it is likely that in his own opinion, he felt too elderly to undertake the responsibility properly. From 1564 to 1566, he was rector of St Magnus the Martyr in the City of London near London Bridge. Coverdale’s first wife, Elizabeth, died early in September 1565, and was buried in St Michael Paternoster Royal, City of London, on the 8th. On 7 April 1566 he married his second wife, Katherine, at the same church. After the summer of 1566, when he had resigned his last living at St Magnus, Coverdale became popular in early Puritan circles, because of his quiet but firm stance against ceremonies and elaborate clerical dress. Due to his opposition to official church practices, he died in poverty aged 80 or 81 on 20 January 1569, in London and was buried at St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange with a multitude of mourners present. When that church was demolished in 1840 to make way for the new Royal Exchange, his remains were moved to St Magnus, where there is a tablet in his memory on the east wall, close to the altar. Coverdale left no will and on 23 January 1569 letters of administration were granted to his second wife, Katherine. Daniell says that it appears that he has no living descendants.

==Legacy==
Coverdale&#x27;s legacy has been far-reaching, especially that of his first complete English Bible of 1535. For the 400th anniversary of the Authorised King James Bible, in 2011, the Church of England issued a resolution, which was endorsed by the General Synod. Starting with the Coverdale Bible, the text included a brief description of the continuing significance of the Authorised King James Bible (1611) and its immediate antecedents:
* The Coverdale Bible (1535)
* The Matthew Bible (1537)
* The Great Bible (1539)

As indicated above, Coverdale was involved with the first four of the above. He was partially responsible for Matthew&#x27;s Bible. In addition to those mentioned above, he produced a diglot New Testament in 1538. He was extensively involved with editing and producing the Great Bible. He was also part of the group of &quot;Geneva Exiles&quot; who produced the Geneva Bible – the edition preferred, some ninety-five years later, by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army and Parliamentarians.

Coverdale&#x27;s translation of the Psalms (based on Luther&#x27;s version and the Latin Vulgate) have a particular importance in the history of the English Bible. His translation is still used in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It is the most familiar translation for many in the Anglican Communion worldwide, particularly those in collegiate and cathedral churches. Many musical settings of the psalms also make use of the Coverdale translation. For example Coverdale&#x27;s renderings are used in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, based on the Prayer Book Psalter rather than the King James Bible version. His translation of the Roman Canon is still used in some Anglican and Anglican Use Roman Catholic churches. Less well known is Coverdale’s early involvement in hymn books. Celia Hughes believes that in the days of renewed biblical suppression after 1543, the most important work of Coverdale, apart from his principal Bible translation, was his &quot;Ghostly Psalms and Spiritual Songs&quot; . This she calls &quot;the first English hymn book&quot; and &quot;the only one until the publication of the collection by Sternhold and Hopkins.&quot; (This was more than twenty years later). The undated print probably was done parallel to his Bible translation in 1535. Coverdale’s first three hymns are based on the Latin Veni Creator Spiritus, preceding its other English translations such as that of 1625 by Bishop J. Cosin by more than ninety years. However, the majority of the hymns are based on the Protestant hymnbooks from Germany, particularly Johann Walter&#x27;s settings of Martin Luther&#x27;s hymns such as &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot;. Coverdale intended his &quot;&quot;godly songs&quot; for &quot;our young men ... and our women spinning at the wheels.&quot;&quot; Thus Hughes argues that he realised that for the less-privileged, his scriptural teaching could be learnt and retained more readily by song rather than by direct access to the Bible, which could often be prohibited. However, his hymnbook also ended up on the list of forbidden books in 1539, and only one complete copy of it survives which is today held in Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. Two fragments survived as binding material and are now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and in the Beinecke Library at Yale.

Coverdale is honoured, together with William Tyndale, with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 6 October. His extensive contacts with English and Continental Reformers was integral to the development of successive versions of the Bible in the English language.

<text>In geometry, confocal means having the same foci: confocal conic sections.

* For an optical cavity consisting of two mirrors, confocal means that they share their foci. If they are identical mirrors, their radius of curvature, &quot;R&quot;mirror, equals &quot;L&quot;, where &quot;L&quot; is the distance between the mirrors.
* In conic sections, it is said of two ellipses, two hyperbolas, or an ellipse and a hyperbola which share both foci with each other. If an ellipse and a hyperbola are confocal, they are perpendicular to each other.
* In optics, it means that one focus or image point of one lens is the same as one focus of the next lens.
