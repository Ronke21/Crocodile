<text>Glasnevin Cemetery () is a large cemetery in Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland which opened in 1832. It holds the graves and memorials of several notable figures, and has a museum.

==Location==
The cemetery is located in Glasnevin, Dublin, in two parts. The main part, with its trademark high walls and watchtowers, is located on one side of the road from Finglas to the city centre, while the other part, &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s,&quot; is located across the road and beyond a green space, between two railway lines.

A gateway into the National Botanic Gardens, adjacent to the cemetery, was reopened in recent years.

==History and description==
Prior to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery, Irish Catholics had no cemeteries of their own in which to bury their dead and, as the repressive Penal Laws of the eighteenth century placed heavy restrictions on the public performance of Catholic services, it had become normal practice for Catholics to conduct a limited version of their own funeral services in Protestant churchyards or graveyards. This situation continued until an incident at a funeral held at St. Kevin&#x27;s Churchyard in 1823 provoked public outcry when a Protestant sexton reprimanded a Catholic priest for proceeding to perform a limited version of a funeral mass. The outcry prompted Daniel O&#x27;Connell, champion of Catholic rights, to launch a campaign and prepare a legal opinion proving that there was actually no law passed forbidding praying for a dead Catholic in a graveyard. O&#x27;Connell pushed for the opening of a burial ground in which both Irish Catholics and Protestants could give their dead dignified burial.

Glasnevin Cemetery was consecrated and opened to the public for the first time on 21 February 1832. The first burial, that of eleven-year-old Michael Carey from Francis Street in Dublin, took place on the following day in a section of the cemetery known as Curran&#x27;s Square. The cemetery was initially known as Prospect Cemetery, a name chosen from the townland of Prospect, which surrounded the cemetery lands. Besides the famous interred at Glasnevin, nearly 800,000 people have been buried in Glasnevin in unmarked mass graves due to the death toll from the Great Famine of the 1840s and a later cholera epidemic.

Originally covering nine acres of ground, the area of the cemetery has now grown to approximately 124 acres. This includes its expansion on the southern side of the Finglas Road with the section called St. Paul&#x27;s. The option of cremation has been provided since March 1982.

==Ownership and management==
Glasnevin Cemetery is under the care of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee. The development of the cemetery is an ongoing task, and includes a number of expansion and refurbishment tasks.

==Religious services==
The Catholic Mass is celebrated by members of the parish clergy every Sunday at 9.45 am. The annual blessing of the graves takes place each summer as it has done since the foundation of the cemetery in 1832.

==Features==

===Memorials and graves===

The cemetery contains historically notable monuments and the graves of many of Ireland&#x27;s most prominent national figures. These include the graves of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Collins, Éamon de Valera, Arthur Griffith, Maude Gonne, Kevin Barry, Roger Casement, Constance Markievicz, Seán MacBride, Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa, James Larkin, Brendan Behan, Christy Brown and Luke Kelly of the Dubliners.
The grave of Michael Collins, the nationalist leader who was killed in the Irish Civil War in 1922, is among the most visited sites in Glasnevin. Around him were buried at least 183 soldiers of the Irish Free State. In 1967 their names were recorded on a memorial around Collin&#x27;s grave.
In 1993 a mass grave at the site of a Magdalene laundry, institutions used to house &quot;fallen women&quot;, was discovered after the convent which ran the laundry sold the land to a property developer. The Sisters from the Convent arranged to have the remains cremated and reburied in a mass grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, splitting the cost of the reburial with the developer who had bought the land.

The cemetery also offers a view of the changing style of death monuments in Ireland over the last 200 years: from the austere, simple, high stone erections of the period up until the 1860s, to the elaborate Celtic crosses of the nationalistic revival from the 1860s to the 1960s, to the plain Italian marble of the late 20th century.
The high wall with watchtowers surrounding the main part of the cemetery was built to deter bodysnatchers, who were active in Dublin in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The watchmen also had a pack of bloodhounds who roamed the cemetery at night.

In 2009, Glasnevin Trust in co-operation with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) began identifying the graves of Irish service personnel who died while serving in the Commonwealth forces during the two world wars. These names are inscribed on two memorials, rededicated and relocated in 2011 to near the main entrance. A Cross of Sacrifice was erected in the cemetery, in a joint Irish-British commemoration ceremony, to mark the First World War centenary. As of July 2019, there are 215 service personnel of the Commonwealth of both wars identified as buried here.

===Angels plot===
Glasnevin is one of the few cemeteries that allowed stillborn babies to be buried in consecrated ground and contains an area called the Angels Plot.

===Crematorium===
In 1982, a crematorium was constructed within the cemetery grounds by Glasnevin Trust. Since then, the service has been used for people of various religious denominations who wished to be cremated.

===Museum and tours===
A feature of the cemetery is the Glasnevin Trust Museum, designed by A&amp;D Wejchert &amp; Partners Architects and opened in 2010. It includes a café.

The cemetery also runs tours, hosts educational groups and has support for genealogists and those studying family history.

==In popular culture==
Glasnevin Cemetery is the setting for the &quot;Hades&quot; episode in James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and is mentioned by Idris Davies in his poem &quot;Eire&quot;.

The gate of the cemetery, as well as the nearby pub John Kavanagh&#x27;s &#x27;The Gravediggers&#x27;, were featured in the 1970 comedy film &quot;Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx&quot;.

Shane MacThomais, the cemetery&#x27;s historian, was the author and contributor to a number of published works on the cemetery, prior to his death in March 2014.

The documentary &quot;One Million Dubliners&quot; was released in 2014, featuring stories about the history and operation of the cemetery.

<doc id="42182" wikidata="Q92611" url="?curid=42182" title="Haskell Curry">
<text>Haskell Brooks Curry ( ; September 12, 1900 – September 1, 1982) was an American mathematician, logician and computer scientist. Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic, whose initial concept is based on a paper by Moses Schönfinkel, for which Curry did much of the development. Curry is also known for Curry&#x27;s paradox and the Curry–Howard correspondence. Named for him are three programming languages: Haskell, Brook, and Curry, and the concept of &quot;currying&quot;, a method to transform functions, used in mathematics and computer science.

== Life ==
Curry was born on in Millis, Massachusetts, to Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright Curry, who ran a school for elocution. He entered Harvard University in 1916 to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in 1920. After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he returned to Harvard to study physics, earning a Master of Arts (M.A.) in 1924. Curry&#x27;s interest in mathematical logic began during this period when he was introduced to the Principia Mathematica, the attempt by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell to ground mathematics in symbolic logic. Remaining at Harvard, Curry pursued a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in mathematics. While he was directed by George David Birkhoff to work on differential equations, his interests continued to shift to logic. In 1927, while an instructor at Princeton University, he discovered the work of Moses Schönfinkel in combinatory logic. Schönfinkel&#x27;s work had anticipated much of Curry&#x27;s own research, and as a consequence, he moved to University of Göttingen where he could work with Heinrich Behmann and Paul Bernays, who were familiar with Schönfinkel&#x27;s work. Curry was supervised by David Hilbert and worked closely with Bernays, receiving a Ph.D. in 1930 with a dissertation on combinatory logic.

In 1928, before leaving for Göttingen, Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley. The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation, then, in 1929, moved to State College, Pennsylvania where Curry accepted a position at Pennsylvania State College. They had two children, Anne Wright Curry (July 27, 1930) and Robert Wheatley Curry (July 6, 1934). Curry remained at Penn State for the next 37 years. He spent one year at University of Chicago in 1931–1932 under a National Research Fellowship and one year in 1938–1939 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1942 he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the United States government during World War II, notably at the Frankford Arsenal. Immediately after the war he worked on the ENIAC project, in 1945 and 1946. Under a Fulbright fellowship, he collaborated with Robert Feys in Louvain, Belgium. After retiring from Penn State in 1966, Curry accepted a position at the University of Amsterdam. In 1970, after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic, Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College, Pennsylvania.

Haskell Curry died on , in State College, Pennsylvania.

== Work ==
The focus of Curry&#x27;s work were attempts to show that combinatory logic could provide a foundation for mathematics. Towards the end of 1933, he learned of the Kleene–Rosser paradox from correspondence with John Rosser. The paradox, developed by Rosser and Stephen Kleene, had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems, including one proposed by Alonzo Church (a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem) and Curry&#x27;s own system. However, unlike Church, Kleene, and Rosser, Curry did not give up on the foundational approach, saying that he did not want to &quot;run away from paradoxes.&quot;

By working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career, Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field. Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of functional programming language. The power and scope of combinatory logic are quite similar to that of the lambda calculus of Church, and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades.

During World War II, Curry worked at the Frankford Arsenal,
where he developed a &quot;steepest descent&quot; algorithm, based on work by Cauchy.

This became a foundational example of modern gradient descent methods.

In 1947 Curry also described one of the first high-level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one-address computer.

He taught at Harvard, Princeton, and from 1929 to 1966, at the Pennsylvania State University. In 1942, he published Curry&#x27;s paradox. In 1966 he became professor of logic and its history and philosophy of exact sciences at the University of Amsterdam, the successor of Evert Willem Beth.

Curry also wrote and taught mathematical logic more generally; his teaching in this area culminated in his 1963 &quot;Foundations of Mathematical Logic&quot;. His preferred philosophy of mathematics was formalism (cf. his 1951 book), following his mentor Hilbert, but his writings betray substantial philosophical curiosity and a very open mind about intuitionistic logic.

<text>In Greek mythology, Chiron ( ; also Cheiron or Kheiron; ) was held to be the superlative centaur amongst his brethren since he was called the &quot;wisest and justest of all the centaurs&quot;.

==Biography==
Chiron was notable throughout Greek mythology for his youth-nurturing nature. His personal skills tend to match those of his foster father Apollo, who taught the young centaur the art of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics, and prophecy, and made him rise above his beastly nature. Chiron was known for his knowledge and skill with medicine, and thus was credited with the discovery of botany and pharmacy, the science of herbs and medicine.

Like satyrs, centaurs were notorious for being wild, lusty, overly indulgent drinkers and carousers, violent when intoxicated, and generally uncultured delinquents. Chiron, by contrast, was intelligent, civilized, and kind, because he was not related directly to the other centaurs due to his parentage. He was the son of the Titan Cronus and the Oceanid Philyra, and thus possible brother to Dolops and Aphrus, the ancestor and eponym of the Aphroi, i.e. the native Africans. Chiron lived predominantly on Mount Pelion; there he married the nymph Chariclo who bore him three daughters, Hippe (also known as Melanippe meaning the &quot;black mare&quot; or Euippe, &quot;good mare&quot;), Endeïs, and Ocyrhoe, and one son Carystus. A different source also stated that his wife was called Nais while a certain Aristaeus was called his son.

Like the other centaurs, Chiron was later expelled by the Lapithae from his home; but sacrifices were offered to him there by the Magnesians until a very late period, and the family of the Cheironidae in that neighbourhood, who were distinguished for their knowledge of medicine, were regarded as his descendants.

==Physical appearance==

Although a centaur, Chiron&#x27;s physical appearance often differs somewhat from other centaurs, demonstrating his status and heritage. In traditional Greek representations of Chiron his front legs are human, rather than equine. This is in contrast to the traditional representation of centaurs, which have the entire lower body of a horse. This clearly sets Chiron apart from the other centaurs, making him easily identifiable. This difference may also have highlighted Chiron&#x27;s unique lineage, being the son of Cronus. Chiron is often depicted carrying a branch with dead hares he has caught hanging from it. Chiron is also often depicted wearing clothes, demonstrating he is more civilised and unlike a normal centaur (the only other occasional exceptions to this rule are the centaurs Nessus and Pholus).

The &quot;Education of Achilles&quot; wall painting, from the basilica in Herculaneum (top right), is one of the most common Roman depictions of Chiron, as he teaches Achilles the lyre. In this version we see Chiron with a fully equine lower body, in contrast to the ancient Greek representations. In addition to this reconfiguration, Chiron&#x27;s appearance is further altered with his ears. Whereas previously human, Chiron&#x27;s ears now match those of a satyr; folded over at the top. This rendering creates a more bestial version of Chiron, much more akin to a standard centaur. It may be possible that due to the rise of written sources, Roman artists were inspired by written descriptions of Chiron; simply using the word centaur, rather than having available traditional visual representations. This may, then, not be a deliberate reworking of the Chiron myth on the part of the Romans, but simply a lost nuance of the character in its migration from Greece to Rome. As F. Kelsey writes; &quot;The Chiron of our painting, ... has a body like that of the other centaurs, but the prominence of the human element in his nature is no less marked; he is the wise and gentle teacher, the instructor of an art&quot;. Chiron has retained an element of clothing and gained a laurel wreath, suggesting the artist wished to portray nobility, or even divinity, more consistent with the traditional view. It has also been suggested that this fresco is a reproduction of an actual statue in the Roman forum.

==Mythology==
===Early years===
According to an archaic myth, Chiron was sired by the Titan Cronus when he had taken the form of a horse and impregnated the nymph Philyra. In another version his mother was the nymph Naïs.

Chiron&#x27;s lineage was different from other centaurs, who were born from Ixion, consigned to a fiery wheel, and Nephele (&quot;cloud&quot;), which in the Olympian telling Zeus invented to look like Hera.

Soon after giving birth to Chiron, Philyra abandoned her child out of shame and disgust. Chiron, effectively orphaned, was later found by the god Apollo, who took him under his wing and taught him the art of music, lyre, archery, medicine and prophecy. Apollo&#x27;s twin sister, Artemis, trained him in archery and hunting. Chiron&#x27;s uniquely peaceful character, kindness, and intelligence are attributed to Apollo and Artemis.

Some sources speculate that Chiron was originally a Thessalian god, later subsumed into the Greek pantheon as a centaur.

A great healer, astrologer, and respected oracle, Chiron was said to be the first among centaurs and highly revered as a teacher and tutor. Among his pupils were many culture heroes: Asclepius, Aristaeus, Actaeon, Achilles, Jason, Medus.

There is also a persistent link with Peleus throughout Chiron&#x27;s myth. This can be explained that the latter was the grandfather of Peleus through his daughter Endeis who married the king of Aegina, Aeacus. Chiron saved the life of Peleus when Acastus tried to kill him by taking his sword and leaving him out in the woods to be slaughtered by the centaurs. Chiron retrieved the sword for Peleus. Chiron then explained to Peleus how to capture the nymph Thetis, leading to their marriage.

Chiron is also connected with the story of the Argonauts, whom he received kindly when they came to his residence on their voyage, for many of the heroes were his friends and pupils.

===Students===

Chiron was a renowned mentor, and brought up some future heroes such as:

* Achilles – The son of the Argonaut Peleus and the Nereid Thetis. Peleus had a friendly relationship with Chiron who had already saved him from Acastus and a band of murderous centaurs, and later restored the sight of Phoenix, a blind friend of Peleus. When Achilles was old enough, Peleus brought him to Chiron, who received him as a disciple, and fed him the innards of lions and boars, and bear marrow. In some accounts, Achilles was previously called &quot;Ligyron&quot;, and Chiron gave him his new name. Later in his life, Achilles taught Patroclus what Chiron had taught him, including the medical arts.
* Aristaeus – Although his mother Cyrene lived in Libya, Aristaeus&#x27; father Apollo brought him on Mount Pelion to be reared by Chiron. Aristaeus would later become in his life a god of certain rustic arts such as beekeeping and cheesemaking. Moreover, he is the protagonist of a creation myth regarding the Etesian winds.
* Actaeon – The son of Autonoë and Aristeus (an aforementioned student of Chiron). He became an excellent hunter thanks to the centaur&#x27;s lessons. In his adulthood as he was hunting in the woods, he saw the virgin goddess Artemis bathing. She punished Actaeon for seeing her naked body by turning him into a stag. His hunting dogs did not recognize him and devoured him. Ignorant of what they had done, the hunting dogs came to the cave of Chiron seeking their master and the Centaur fashioned an image of Actaeon in order to soothe their grief.
* Asclepius – The Greek God of Doctors. Artemis killed Asclepius&#x27; mother Coronis after her lover Apollo discovered she was cheating on him. But Coronis had conceived a son to him and before her body had been consumed by the funerary pyre he saved the child (Asclepius) and brought him to Chiron, who reared him and taught him the art of healing. When Chiron&#x27;s daughter Ocyrhoe saw him, she prophesied his destiny and death. Because of this, Zeus turned her into a mare. In fact, Asclepius would later die because of his hubris: he had become such a skilled medic he could resurrect the dead and Zeus would end up killing him for this after getting a complaint from Hades. Though Zeus would later revive him as a God to avoid any feuds with Apollo.
* Jason – The leader of the Argonauts was, in some versions, raised by Chiron. Jason&#x27;s father Aeson had been locked up by his brother Pelias, yet he managed to conceive a son with a woman named Alcimede. When Alcimede delivered Jason, she pretended he was a stillborn to escape Pelias&#x27; notice and then gave him to Chiron. Jason&#x27;s son Medus will also become one of the centaur&#x27;s students.
* Medus – Alternatively called Medeus or Polyxenus, his mother was Medea, but accounts differ about his father, who may be either Jason, an Asian king, or Aegeus of Athens. Just like his father, he was reared by Chiron. Later in his life, he would become the first king of the Medes.
* Patroclus is also numbered amongst the students by Statius (a Roman poet of the 1st century AD) in his unfinished work, the Achilleid, although Homer clearly contradicts him.

According to Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably the same as Ptolemaeus Chennus), a writer and playwright whose works are now lost, Chiron was also the mentor of the god Dionysus (who became the centaur&#x27;s eromenos, and learned from him chants and dances) and of a youth named Cocytus; the latter supposedly cured Adonis when he was wounded by a wild boar using the medical techniques learned from his teacher. It is worthy of note that Ptolemy&#x27;s account only survived thanks to Photios I&#x27;s summary of his works. Photios I, an ecumenical patriarch of the 9th century AD, harshly criticized Ptolemy, denouncing him for seemingly distorting, inventing and misinterpreting myths. Considering little is known about Ptolemy and his works are not preserved, it is unknown whether he was simply reporting alternative versions of myths or making them up.

===Death===

His nobility is further reflected in the story of his death, as Prometheus sacrificed his life, allowing mankind to obtain the use of fire. As the son of Cronus he was immortal, so it was left to Heracles to arrange a bargain with Zeus to exchange Chiron&#x27;s immortality for the life of Prometheus who had been chained to a rock where an eagle pecked out his regenerating liver for his transgressions. Chiron was pierced with an arrow belonging to Heracles that had been treated with the blood of the Hydra, or, in other versions, poison that Chiron had given to the hero when he had been under the honorable centaur&#x27;s tutelage. According to a &quot;Scholium&quot; on Theocritus, this had taken place during the visit of Heracles to the cave of Pholus on Mount Pelion in Thessaly during his fourth labour, defeating the Erymanthian Boar. While they were at supper, Heracles asked for some wine to accompany his meal. Pholus, who ate his food raw, was taken aback. He had been given a vessel of sacred wine by Dionysus sometime earlier, to be kept in trust by the centaurs until the right time for its opening. At Heracles&#x27; prompting, Pholus was forced to produce the vessel of sacred wine. The hero, gasping for wine, grabbed it from him and forced it open. Thereupon the vapors of the sacred wine wafted out of the cave and intoxicated the wild centaurs led by Nessus who had gathered outside. They attacked with stones and fir trees the cave which was located in the neighbourhood of Malea. Heracles was forced to shoot many arrows (poisoned with the blood of the Hydra) to drive them back. During the assault, Chiron was hit in the thigh by one of the poisoned arrows. After the centaurs had fled, Pholus emerged from the cave to observe the destruction. Being of a philosophical frame of mind, he pulled one of the arrows from the body of a dead centaur and wondered how such a little thing as an arrow could have caused so much death and destruction. In that instant, he let slip the arrow from his hand and it dropped and hit him in the hoof, killing him instantly. This, however, is open to controversy, because Pholus shared the &quot;civilized centaur&quot; form with Chiron in some art images, and thus would have been immortal.

Ironically, Chiron, the master of the healing arts, could not heal himself and willingly gave up his immortality. For this reason, his half-brother Zeus took pity on him and thus placed him among the stars in the sky to be honored. The Greeks identified him as the constellation Centaurus.

In Ovid&#x27;s poem &quot;Fasti&quot;, Ovid has the hero Hercules visiting Chiron&#x27;s home on Pelion while the child Achilles is there. While Chiron is examining Hercules&#x27; weapons, one of the arrows dipped in Lernaean hydra venom falls on Chiron&#x27;s left foot and poisons him:
:And while the old man fingered the shafts clotted with poison, one of the arrows fell out of the quiver and stuck in his left foot. Chiron groaned and drew the steel from his body.
Chiron then tries to use herbs to heal himself, but fails. After nine days with a weeping Achilles looking on, Chiron passes into the stars becoming a constellation.

==The &quot;Precepts of Chiron&quot;==
A didactic poem, &quot;Precepts of Chiron&quot;, has been lost. However, fragments in heroic hexameters that survive in quotations are considered to belong to it. The common thread in the fragments, which may reflect in some degree the Acharnian image of Chiron and his teaching, is that it is expository rather than narrative, and suggests that, rather than recounting the inspiring events of archaic times as men like Nestor or Glaucus might do, Chiron taught the primeval ways of mankind, the gods and nature, beginning with the caution &quot;First, whenever you come to your house, offer good sacrifices to the eternal gods&quot;.

==Statius&#x27; &quot;Achilleid&quot;==

&quot;The Achilleid&quot; was to be an epic poem on the life of Achilles. However, its author, Statius, died during the writing of the second book late in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Domitian. &quot;The Achilleid&quot; shows the relationship between Chiron and his charge, Achilles. During Book One, the close relationship between Chiron and Achilles is made clear when Thetis spends the evening with them in Chiron&#x27;s cave on Mount Pelion, before leaving with Achilles. Chiron is shown in a paternal capacity, rather than that of merely a teacher, and is depicted as far from animal. Night draws to slumber. The huge Centaur collapses on stone and Achilles fondly twines himself about his shoulders, though his mother is there, preferring the familiar bosom. &quot;(&quot;1.195–97). Here, Statius is showing a loving relationship between the two characters, which the traditional view of Chiron never explored. Later, when describing what he ate when growing up, Achilles refers to Chiron as a parent; &quot;&quot;thus that father of mine used to feed me&quot; (&quot;2.102), the Latin used here is &#x27;pater&#x27; so we may judge this an accurate translation. This further demonstrates the nature of the loving relationship between Chiron and Achilles. Statius here may be continuing a theme started by Ovid in &quot;Fasti&quot; several years earlier.

In &quot;Fasti&quot;, on Chiron&#x27;s death, Achilles says &quot;&quot;&#x27;Live, I beg you; don&#x27;t leave me, dear father [pater]!&#x27;&quot;(&quot;5.412), this would suggest that in Rome the reconfiguration of Chiron&#x27;s myth was as a loving and loved foster parent, rather than simply teacher. Chiron&#x27;s relationship with his pupil is used to demonstrate a Roman longing for the father-son relationship.

In addition to Chiron&#x27;s loving characteristics developed in Book One, Book Two of &quot;The Achilleid&quot; has Achilles describe many tasks Chiron would make him perform during his heroic education, including standing in fast flowing rivers;I stood, but the angry river and the mist of his broad rush took me back. He bore down on me with savage threats and scolded to shame me. I did not leave till ordered (2.146–150). There is a clear contrast here in the hardship and insults Chiron is directing at his pupil compared to his previous kindness. However, this duality can be seen as a demonstration of a traditional Roman education, especially a noble one; learning both military and refined arts. Centaurs in antiquity were often remembered for their battle with the Lapiths. Statius deliberately disassociates Chiron from this story with his description of Chiron&#x27;s cave on Pelion,Here are no darts that have tasted human blood, no ash trees fractured in festive combats, nor mixing bowls shattered upon kindred foes (1.111–15).Instead of combat, the emphasis is that Chiron&#x27;s weapons are only used for hunting and there are no signs of savage behaviour. In addition to Achilles&#x27; descriptions of the physical lessons Chiron gives him he also refers to a more cultured education, He fixed in my mind the precepts of sacred justice (2.163–4). Statius creates an image of Chiron that is not only a loving father, but a strict and wise teacher, disassociated with the bestial aspects of centaurs.

<text>Katowice () is the capital city of the Silesian Voivodeship in southern Poland and the central city of the Katowice urban area. As of 2021, Katowice has an official population of 286,960, and a resident population estimate of around 315,000. Katowice is a central part of the Metropolis GZM, with a population of 2.3 million, and a part of a larger Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area that extends into the Czech Republic and has a population of around 5 million people, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the European Union.

Katowice was founded as a village in the 16th century, whereas several modern districts of Katowice were founded as villages in the Middle Ages. Throughout the mid-18th century, Katowice grew following the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area. In the first half of the 19th century, intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks, mines, foundries and artisan workshops. The city has since reshaped its economy from a heavy industry-based one to professional services, education and healthcare. The entire metropolitan area is the 16th most economically powerful city by GDP in the European Union with an output amounting to $114.5 billion. Katowice Special Economic Zone is ranked fourth on the list of the TOP10 Global Free Zones.

Katowice has been classified as a Gamma – global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and is a centre of commerce, business, transportation, and culture in southern Poland, with numerous public companies headquartered in the city or in its suburbs including energy group Tauron and metal industry corporation Fasing, important cultural institutions such as Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, award-winning music festivals such as Off Festival and Tauron New Music, and transportation infrastructure such as Katowice Korfanty Airport. It also hosts the finals of Intel Extreme Masters, an Esports video game tournament. Katowice is also home to several institutions of higher learning, notably the University of Silesia, the Silesian University of Technology and the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network having been recognized as a City of Music.

==History==
===Before the industrial revolution===

The area around Katowice, in Upper Silesia, has been inhabited by Lechitic Silesian tribes from its earliest documented history. While the name Katowice (&quot;Katowicze&quot;) is mentioned for the first time in 1598, other villages and settlements that would eventually become parts of modern Katowice have been established earlier, with &quot;Dąb&quot; being the oldest, mentioned in 1299 for the first time in a document issued by Duke Casimir of Bytom. Bogucice, Ligota, Szopenice and Podlesie were all established in early 14th century. Aside from farming, people living in the area would also work in hammer mills: the first one, &quot;Kuźnica Bogucka&quot;, is mentioned in 1397.

The area which would become Katowice was initially ruled by the Polish Silesian Piast dynasty until its extinction. From 1327, the region was under administration of the Kingdom of Bohemia under the Holy Roman Empire. As part of the Bohemian Crown, it was passed to the Habsburg monarchy of Austria in 1526. In 1742, along with most of Silesia, it was seized by Prussia following the First Silesian War. The two subsequent Silesian Wars left the area severely depopulated and with an economy in ruins. In 1838, Franz von Winckler bought Katowice from Karl Friedrich Lehmann and in 1841, he made it the headquarters of his estate.

===Emergence as an industrial centre===

On 3 October 1846, the works of the final stage of the Breslau-Myslowitz (&quot;Wrocław-Mysłowice&quot;) rail line ended, built and operated by the Upper Silesian Railway. It was opened by king Frederick William IV of Prussia. A year later, on 6 August 1847, the first train arrived at the new Katowice station.

The railway connection with major European cities (Katowice gained connections to Berlin, Kraków, Vienna and Warsaw, among others, between 1847 and 1848) fostered economic and population growth. The population grew enough to erect the first Lutheran church on 29 September 1858 (Church of the Resurrection), and the first Catholic church two years later, on 11 November 1860. Katowice (then: &quot;Kattowitz&quot;) gained city status on 11 September 1865 in the Prussian Province of Silesia, by the act of the king Wilhelm I Hohenzollern.

The city flourished due to large mineral (especially coal) deposits in the area. Extensive city growth and prosperity depended on the coal mining and steel industries, which took off during the Industrial Revolution. The city was inhabited mainly by Germans, Poles incl. Silesians, and Jews. In 1884, 36 Jewish Zionist delegates met here, forming the Hovevei Zion movement. Previously part of the Beuthen district, in 1873 it became the capital of the new Kattowitz district. On 1 April 1899, the city was separated from the district, becoming an independent city.

In 1882, the Upper Silesian Coal and Steelworks Company (&quot;Oberschlesischer Berg- und Hüttenmännischer Verein&quot;) moved its headquarters to Katowice, followed by creation of the Upper Silesian Coal Convention (&quot;Oberschlesische Kohlen-Konvention&quot;) in 1898. Civic development followed industrial development: in 1851, the first post office opens in Katowice, and in 1893 the current regional post office headquarters have been opened; in 1871 the first middle school was opened (later expanded to high school); in 1889, Katowice got a district court; in 1895, the city bath opened and regional headquarters of the Prussian state railways has been established in the city; in 1907, the city theater (currently the Silesian Theatre) opened.
Under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, the Upper Silesia plebiscite was organised by the League of Nations. Though Kattowitz proper voted 22,774 to remain in Germany and 3,900 for Poland, it was attached to Poland as the larger district voted 66,119 for Poland and 52,992 for Germany. Following the Silesian Uprisings of 1918–21 Katowice became part of the Second Polish Republic with some autonomy for the Silesian Parliament as a constituency and the Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. In 1924, the surrounding villages and towns were incorporated into Katowice, and the number of inhabitants increased to over 112,000, since then the number of Poles exceeded the number of Germans – throughout the interwar period, the number of Germans decreased (in 1925 they constituted 12% of the inhabitants of Katowice, and in 1939 only 6%, while Poles constituted 93%). At the end of the interwar period, the number of inhabitants exceeded 134,000.

From 1926 to 1933, Katowice and the Polish part of Upper Silesia were connected with Gdynia and the Polish part of Pomerania through the Polish Coal Trunk-Line ().

===World War II===
During the early stages of World War II and the Poland Campaign, Katowice was essentially abandoned by the Polish Land Forces, which had to position itself around Kraków. Nevertheless, the city was defended by local Poles, and the invading Germans immediately carried out massacres of captured Polish defenders. In the following weeks the German &quot;Einsatzkommando 1&quot; was stationed in the city, and its units were responsible for many crimes against Poles committed in the region.
Under German occupation many of the city&#x27;s historical and iconic monuments were destroyed, most notably the Great Katowice Synagogue, which was burned to the ground on 4 September 1939. This was followed by the alteration of street names and the introduction of strict rules. Additionally, the use of Polish in public conversations was banned. The German administration was also infamous for organising public executions of civilians and by the middle of 1941, most of the Polish and Jewish population was expelled. The Germans established and operated a Nazi prison in the city, and multiple forced labour camps within present-day city limits, including two camps solely for Poles (&quot;Polenlager&quot;), four camps solely for Jews, two subcamps (E734, E750) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp, and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Eventually, Katowice was captured by the Red Army in January 1945. Significant parts of the downtown and inner suburbs were demolished during the occupation. As a result, the authorities were able to preserve the central district in its prewar character.

===Postwar period===
The postwar period of Katowice was characterised by the time of heavy industry development in the Upper Silesian region, which helped the city in regaining its status as the most industrialised Polish city and a major administrative centre. As the city developed so briskly, the 1950s marked a significant increase in its population and an influx of migrants from the Eastern Borderlands, the so-called &quot;Kresy&quot;. The city area began to quickly expand by incorporating the neighbouring communes and counties. However, the thriving industrial city also had a dark period in its short but meaningful history. Most notably, between 7 March 1953 and 10 December 1956, Katowice was called &quot;Stalinogród&quot; in honour of Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union. The change was brought upon by an issued decree of the State Council. The date of the alteration of the city name was neither a coincidence or accidental as it happened on the day of Stalin&#x27;s death. In this way, the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and the socialist authority wanted to pay tribute to the dictator. The new name never got accepted by the citizens and in 1956 the former Polish name was restored.

The following decades were more memorable in the history of Katowice. Regardless of its industrial significance, it started to become an important cultural and educational centre in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1968, the University of Silesia in Katowice, the largest and most valued college in the area, was founded. Simultaneously the construction of large housing estates began to evolve. Furthermore, many representative structures were erected at that time, including the Silesian Insurgents&#x27; Monument (1967) and Spodek (1971), which have become familiar landmarks and tourist sights. The 1960s and 1970s saw the evolution of modernist architecture and functionalism. Katowice eventually developed into one of the most modernist post-war cities of Poland.

One of the most dramatic events in the history of the city occurred on 16 December 1981. It was then that 9 protesters died (7 were shot dead; 2 died from injury complications) and another 21 were wounded in the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine. The Special Platoon of the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens&#x27; Militia (&quot;ZOMO&quot;) was responsible for the brutal handling of strikers protesting against Wojciech Jaruzelski&#x27;s declaration of martial law and the arrest of Solidarity trade union officials. On the 10th anniversary of the event, a memorial was unveiled by the President of Poland Lech Wałęsa.

In 1990, the first democratic local elections that took place marked a new period in the city&#x27;s history. The economy of Katowice has been transforming from the heavy industry of steel and coal mines into &quot;one of the most attractive investment areas for modern economy branches in Central Europe&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2008, Katowice was awarded the Europe Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for having made exceptional efforts to spread the ideal of European unity.

The city&#x27;s efficient infrastructure, rapid progress in the overall development and an increase in office space has made Katowice a popular venue for conducting business. The Katowice Expo Centre (&quot;Katowickie Centrum Wystawiennicze&quot;) organises trade fairs or exhibitions and attracts investors from all over the world. In 2018, the city was the host of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24). In 2022, the city hosted the 11th edition of the World Urban Forum, the world&#x27;s most important conference on sustainable urbanization and development of cities.

==Geography==
Katowice encompasses an area of . The city is situated in the Silesian Highlands, about north of the Silesian Beskids (part of the Carpathian Mountains). Kłodnica and Rawa (tributaries of the Oder and the Vistula respectively) are the largest rivers in Katowice, and the border between catchment areas of Oder and Vistula goes through the city. With a minimal elevation of and median elevation of above sea level, Katowice has the highest elevation among large cities in Poland.

===Climate===
Katowice has a temperate, ocean-moderated humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb/Cfb&quot;). The average temperature is 8.2 °Celsius ( in January and up to in July). Yearly rainfall averages at . Characteristic weak winds blow at about from the southwest, through the Moravian Gate.

===Neighborhoods===
Katowice has 22 officially recognized neighborhoods. Śródmieście, Osiedle Paderewskiego-Muchowiec, Zawodzie and Koszutka form the dense central urban core where most cultural and educational institutions, businesses and administrative buildings are located.

Most Northern and Eastern neighborhoods around the downtown core are more working-class and developed from worker&#x27;s estates build around large industry such as coal mines, manufactures and steelworks. Each of these neighborhoods has its own dense commercial strip surrounded by mid-rise apartment buildings and some single-family homes. Szopienice, located between downtown Katowice and Mysłowice, used to be a separate town until mid-1960s. Nikiszowiec, a former mine&#x27;s town, has undergone strong gentrification in recent years, and emerged as a major tourist attraction in the region thanks to its unique architecture and art galleries.

Western and Southern neighborhoods (with the exception of Brynów-Załęska Hałda, which is a working-class neighborhood built around a coal mine) are more suburban in nature, concentrating the city&#x27;s middle and upper middle classes. 
===Metropolitan area===
Katowice lies in the centre of the largest conurbation in Poland, one of the largest in the European Union, numbering about 2.7 million. The Katowice metropolitan area consists of about 40 adjacent cities and towns, the whole Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (mostly within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin) over 50 cities or towns and a population of 5,008,000. In 2006, Katowice and 14 adjacent cities united as the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia (predecessor to the current Metropolis GZM). Its population was 2 million and its area was 1,104 km2. In 2006–2007 the union planned to unite these cities in one city under the name &quot;Silesia&quot;, but this proved unsuccessful.

The Katowice conurbation comprises settlements which have evolved because of the mining of metal ores, coal and raw rock materials. The establishment of mining and heavy industry which have developed for the past centuries has resulted in the unique character of the cityscape; its typical aspects are the red brick housing estates constructed for the poorer working class, factory chimneys, manufacturing plants, power stations and quarries. The inhabitants of a large mining community like Katowice, and local administrations within the conurbation, which have only evolved due to mining, are a subject to overall decline after the liquidation of coal mines and factories. This is one of the reasons which led to the development of the service sector, including office spaces, shopping centres and tourism.

==Demographics==
The Polish Statistical Office estimates Katowice&#x27;s population to be 292,774 with a population density of . There were 139,274 males and 153,500 females. Age breakdown of people in Katowice is: 12.9% 0–14 years old, 13.7% 15–29 years old, 23.8% 30–44 years old, 19.5% 45–59 years old, 20.1% 60–74 years old, and 9.9% 75 years and older.

Katowice is a centre of the Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area, with a population of approx. 5.3 million. This metropolitan area extends into the neighboring Czechia, where the other centre is the city of Ostrava. 41 municipalities that constitute the core of the metropolitan area created the Metropolis GZM association, which has 2.3 million people 

===Historical population===
Katowice&#x27;s population grew very fast between 1845 and 1960, fueled by the expansion of heavy industry and administrative functions. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, the city grew by another 100,000 people, reaching a height of 368,621 in 1988. Since then, the decline of heavy industry, emigration, and suburbanization reversed the population development; Katowice lost approx. 75,000 people (20%) since the fall of communism in Poland.

Before World War II, Katowice was mainly inhabited by Poles and Germans. The 1905 Silesian demographic census has shown that Germans made up nearly 70–75% of the total population (including German Jews) and Poles constituted 25–30% of inhabitants of Katowice. After the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, Silesian uprisings and the incorporation of Katowice into Poland in 1922, and then the incorporation of several nearby villages and towns into the city, the number of inhabitants of Katowice increased significantly, but the number of Germans in Katowice fell to 12% in 1925 and to 6% in 1939 (most Germans left Poland, many ethnic Silesians who used to identify as Germans switched their identification to Poles, and areas with a Polish majority were incorporated). Thus, in 1939 the ethnic breakdown of the city was: 93% Poles, 6% Germans, and 1% Jews.

After the German aggression against Poland in 1939, some Poles were displaced from Katowice and Germans were settled in their place. During the war, the Nazi occupiers committed severe crimes against the local Roma and Jewish communities, either killing them on the spot or transporting them to concentration camps such as Auschwitz for complete extermination. This led to a wartime population drop. In 1945, practically the entire German minority has either left fleeing the Red Army or was forced to leave after Poland regained control of the city, and Poles from Kresy (Eastern Borderlands of interwar Poland that were annexed by USSR after the war) and other parts of the country started to come to settle in the city. Katowice enjoyed a population boom after World War II, driven primarily by internal economic migration from less developed parts of the country. 

Since the late 1960s, Katowice and the surrounding area experiences low birth rates, which, paired with the decline of heavy industry and reduced job opportunities, caused the population of Katowice to start decreasing in the late 1980s. As of recent years, increased economic activity in the area has stopped outward migration but the negative natural change (more deaths than births) continues to fuel population decline. 

===Ethnic diversity===
Katowice is one of the more diverse cities in Poland. In the 2021 census, 93.87% of inhabitants declared a Polish nationality while 19.38% declared a nationality other than Polish (in the Polish census, respondents are allowed to declare up to two nationalities or ethnicities). Indigenous Silesians were the largest minority, at 17.8%, followed by Germans (0.43%), Ukrainians (0.18%), the English (0.12%), Jews (0.07%) and Italians (0.07%).

In addition, Katowice is home to a large immigrant population that is largely unaccounted for in the official population data in Poland. According to the Polish Ministry of Development, Labor and Technology, there have been 20,527 foreigners (7% of official population figure) on a special worker permit for citizens of Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine in Katowice in 2020, 19,003 of them from Ukraine. By the end of 2021, this number has increased to 26,990, with 23,207 of them from Ukraine. Additionally, 11,568 refugees settled in Katowice since the start of the Russian invasion on Ukraine. By the December 2024, the number has increased to 11,894.

===Socioeconomics===
According to the 2021 census, 32.3% of the population aged 13 and older had a college degree, 34.3% had a high school diploma or some college, 17.9% completed a vocational secondary school, 2.4% only completed a gimnazjum, 8.4% only completed a primary school while 2.1% did not complete primary school. In 2011, in the 25–34 age group, college graduates share is 44.9%, and an additional 31.8% has a high school degree. According to Eurostat data, Katowice and its surrounding Silesian region had one of the highest share of people who have attained at least an upper secondary level of education (more than 90%), and one of the lowest share of school dropouts in Europe (less than 5%).

There were 120,869 households in Katowice as of the 2021 census, a drop from 134,199 in the 2011 census. Average household size was 2.33, virtually unchanged from the 2.3 reported in the previous census. 32.4% households were single-person households, 31.2% had two people, 18.5% had three people, 11.5% had four people and 6.4% had five people or more. Compared to the 2011 census, the largest difference was an increase in households with 5 and more people (from 4.9%).

As of 2022, Katowice placed third in the country among cities with the highest average salaries, at PLN 8,017.49, behind Warsaw and Kraków. Poverty rate places Katowice on average with other big cities in Poland, at 4.09% of inhabitants eligible for welfare benefits 

===Religion===
Roman Catholicism is the main religion in Katowice; Polish census, 60.52% (172,915 people) of Katowice residents declared to be Roman Catholic, representing a significant drop from the 2011 census when Roman Catholics were 82.43% of the population.

No other denomination had at least 1,000 followers as of the 2021 census. In the 2011 census, denominations with at least 1,000 worshippers included the Lutheran Church in Poland – 0.43% (1,336 people) and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses – 0.42% (1,311 people). Other religions with presence and places of worship in the city include Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism, as well as other Protestant denominations.

====Christianity====

Katowice is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, with the suffragan bishoprics of Gliwice and Opole, and around 1,477,900 Catholics. The Cathedral of Christ the King, constructed between 1927 and 1955 in a classicist style, is the largest cathedral in Poland. There are 36 Catholic churches in Katowice (including two basilicas), as well as 18 monasteries. Katowice is also a seat of a diocesan Catholic seminary, as well as one of the Order of Friars Minor. Katowice Archdiocese owns several media companies headquartered in Katowice: &quot;Księgarnia św. Jacka&quot;, a Catholic publishing company, and &quot;Instytut Gość Media&quot;, a multi-channeled media company that owns &quot;Radio eM&quot;, a regional Catholic radio, and a few magazines. Gość Niedzielny, owned by &quot;Instytut Gość Media&quot; and published in Katowice, is currently the most-popular Catholic magazine in the country with approx. 120,000 copies sold weekly.

Katowice is also the seat of a Lutheran Diocese which covers Upper Silesia, Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian region and has 12,934 adherents Lutherans have two churches in Katowice, including a cathedral, which is the oldest church built originally in Katowice, completed on 29 September 1858. Historically, Lutheran population in Katowice was mostly German, and with the expulsion of Germans from Poland after the Second World War, number of Lutherans dropped in Katowice.

Other denominations with churches or praying houses in Katowice include Seventh Day Adventists, Baptists, Christ Church in Poland, Pentecostals and other evangelical groups.

====Judaism====

Judaism has historically been present in Katowice since at least 1702. First synagogue, designed by a local architect Ignatz Grünfeld, was consecrated on 4 September 1862, while the Jewish cemetery was established in 1868. Dr. Jacob Cohn was the first rabbi of Katowice, appointed to this function on 6 January 1872 and holding it until 1920s. Zionism was strong in Katowice, and in 1884 the city was the place of the Katowice Conference, the first public Zionist meeting in history. On 12 September 1900, the Great Synagogue was opened.

Following World War I and subsequent creation of the Polish state, most Katowice Jews, who identified with Germany, left the city and settled primarily in Bytom, a nearby city that was still part of Germany. They were partially replaced by Jews moving from the East, particularly the neighboring Dąbrowa Basin region that had a large Jewish population. In 1931, 60% of 5,716 Jews in Katowice were recent immigrants from other parts of Poland. On 1 September 1939, Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany, and Katowice, a border city, surrendered on 3 September. The Great Synagogue was burned by the German army the same day, and in the following months, Katowice Jews were deported to ghettos in Dąbrowa Basin (primarily Sosnowiec and Będzin) or directly to various concentration and death camps where most of them were murdered in the Holocaust. After the war, around 1,500 Jews were living in Katowice, but most of them left Poland and emigrated to the United States and other Western countries.

Currently, Katowice has one Qahal with approximately 200 members. It owns houses of prayer in Katowice (along with a kosher cafeteria) and nearby Gliwice, and the current rabbi is Yehoshua Ellis.

====Other religions====
There are two buddhist groups in Katowice: Kwan Um School of Zen, first registered in 1982, and the Diamond Road of Karma Kagyu line association. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses maintain 13 houses of prayer and one Kingdom Hall in Katowice. Aside from Polish-language congregations, there is one for English speakers and one for Ukrainian speakers.

==Architecture and urban design==
=== Late 19th/early 20th century ===
Unlike most other large Polish cities, Katowice did not originate as a medieval town, therefore it does not have an old town with a street layout and architectural styles characteristic to cities founded on Magdeburg rights. Katowice&#x27;s urban layout is a result of expansion and annexation of various towns, industrial worker estates, and villages. 

Katowice city centre has an axis design, along the main railway line, developed by an industrialist Friedrich Grundman in mid-19th century. Most of the city centre in Katowice developed in late 19th and early 20th century, when it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and had a German-speaking majority. As a result, architectural styles of that era are similar to those in other Prussian cities such as Berlin or Wrocław (then Breslau); primarily renaissance revival and baroque revival, with some buildings in gothic revival, romanesque revival, and art nouveau styles.

=== Interwar architecture ===
In 1922, Katowice and the eastern portion of Upper Silesia were reintegrated with reborn Poland, and an autonomous Silesian Voivodeship was established, with Katowice as its capital. This event has marked the beginning of a period of unprecedented architectural development in the city. Since most traditional styles, especially gothic and gothic revival, were perceived as connected to imperial Germany by the new Polish authorities, all new development was to be built in, at first in the neoclassical, and later in functionalist/Bauhaus style. The city, which needed to build administrative buildings for the new authorities and housing for people working in regional administration, began expansion southward creating one of the largest complexes of modern architecture in Poland, comparable to Warsaw and Gdynia (newly built port on the Baltic Sea) only.

The modernist district is centered around the monumental Silesian Parliament building (1923–1929), which architecture is mostly neoclassical, albeit with early modernist influences. During World War II, the building became headquarters of the Reichsgau Oberschlesien and part of the interior was redesigned by Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s favorite architect, to resemble the interior of the Reich Chancellery. The nearby Cathedral of Christ the King (1927–1955, with dome lowered by 34 meters compared to original design) is also neoclassical but with an ascetic, modernist-inspired interior (including a tabernacle and a golden mosaic funded by future pope, Joseph Ratzinger). Other buildings, designed in mid-to-late 1920s and 1930s, are mostly modernist or functionalist. A symbol of the city in the interwar period, Drapacz Chmur (literally: &quot;The Skyscraper&quot;), was the first skyscraper built in Poland after World War I, and the first building in the country to be based on a steel frame.

=== Post-war architecture ===
After World War II, Katowice again expected a period of rapid growth, particularly under the regional leadership of Marshall Jerzy Ziętek. Pałac Młodzieży (&quot;Youth Palace&quot;) became the first major new building completed in Katowice after the war, erected in the socrealist style with elements of late modernism in 1949–1951. The largest development of the 1950s in Katowice was the expansion of the Koszutka neighborhood, also in the socialist realist style, in early 1950s.

Following the death of Stalin in 1956, and the end of socrealism, Jerzy Ziętek and city authorities commissioned a group of young architects and urbanists to create a project of the new urban design of Katowice. The collective, named &quot;Miastoprojekt Katowice&quot;, came up with a design heavily influenced by Le Corbusier&#x27;s ideas. The project was centered around a grand avenue (current &quot;Aleja Korfantego&quot;) surrounded by simple, modern blocks and monuments, scattered in distance to each other according to modernist ideals of preserving space and light for the masses. The most important buildings from that time include:

* Spodek Arena (1964–1971), widely considered the symbol of Katowice and ranked among the finest achievements of modern architecture in Poland; one of the first buildings in the world with a tensegrity rooftop. Arena&#x27;s unique design, resembling a typical depiction of a UFO at the time, gave it its Polish name (literally meaning &quot;a saucer&quot;, a shorthand for UFO in Polish). 
* Katowice Railway Station (1959–1972), considered to be the most outstanding example of brutalism in Poland, controversially demolished in 2010 and partially rebuilt as an addition to the Galeria Katowicka shopping centre. 
* Superjednostka (1967–1972), a massive (187.5 meters length, 51 meters high) residential block heavily inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s Unite d&#x27;habitation in Marseille
* Osiedle Gwiazdy (1978–1985), a housing estate of eight 27-floor residential buildings on a plan resembling a star
* Osiedle Tysiąclecia (1961–1982, later expanded), a large housing estate connecting to the Silesian Park, built with modernist principles (separation of foot and automobile traffic, vast green spaces, self-sufficiency in terms of schools, basic shops and healthcare). Later expansion of the estate includes Kukurydze high-rises, a group of 26-floor high residential towers inspired by Marina City in Chicago
* Stalexport Towers (1979–1982), twin office towers with 22 and 20 floors, a prime example of early postmodernism in Poland

=== Contemporary architecture ===

Following the collapse of communism in Poland and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the centrally-planned economy with it, Poland&#x27;s economy suffered a downturn, and construction slowed down. One of the most significant buildings of the 1990s was the new branch of the Silesian Library, in postmodernism style.

The situation changed in the early aughts, when several new notable developments were completed:

* Chorzowska 50 (1999–2001) – first modern, A-grade office building in Katowice; currently owned and occupied by ING Bank Śląski 
* Altus, previously known as Uni Centrum (2001–2003) – for many years the highest skyscraper in Poland outside of Warsaw, at 125 meters (410 ft) high. 
* Silesia City Center (2003–2005), the flagship brownfield development of the era, built in place a defunct coal mine Gottwald. It remains one of the largest shopping centres in Poland, at , and also includes a housing estate and a chapel.
* Dom z Ziemi Śląskiej (2001–2002), a modern suburban villa, nominated to Mies van der Rohe Award in 2002
* Department of Law at the University of Silesia (2001–2003), a postmodernist building aiming to resemble industrial installations of the region 
* Department of Theology at the University of Silesia (2002–2004), built in the style resembling early Christian hermitages 

Another wave of architectural revival came after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. European cohesion funds, along with private capital investment, flew into the city resulting in a number of architecturally acclaimed buildings and complexes, including:

* Strefa Kultury (&quot;Zone of Culture&quot;, a brownfield urban redevelopment in downtown Katowice): 
** National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra (NOSPR) building (2012–2014) contains two concert halls (for an audience of 1,800 or 300). Nominated to Mies van der Rohe Award in 2014, first prize in European Commercial Property Awards.
** Katowice International Conference Centre (2012–2015), the largest conference centre in Poland (capacity up to 12,000 people), connected to the Spodek Arena. The design of the centre, with a distinct canyon going through it in order to remove any obstruction from view of Spodek, has been hailed and the building was nominated to Mies van der Rohe award in 2017
** New Silesian Museum (2011–2013) located in place of a former coal mine, most of the museum is located underground, with only glass cubes that provide daylight, visible above ground. Shortlisted for Mies van der Rohe award in 2015.
* CINiBA (2009–2011) – academic library of the University of Silesia and Katowice University of Economics, shortlisted to Mies van der Rohe award in 2013.
* Krzysztof Kieślowski Film School at the University of Silesia (2014–2017) – awarded with Wienerberger Brick Award in 2020, shortlisted to Mies van der Rohe award in 2019. Located in a decayed neighborhood, the building aims at kick-starting an urban renewal process there.
* KTW (2018–2022) – the taller tower, KTW II, is the tallest building in Katowice and one of the tallest in Poland at .
* Global Office Park (2022–2023) – mixed-use complex featuring four buildings, with two office towers reaching .

==Economy==
Katowice has been classified as a Gamma – global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and is considered as an emerging metropolis. Katowice&#x27;s metropolitan area is the 16th most economically powerful urban area in the European Union by GDP, with an output amounting to $114.5 billion. The city is one of the major industrial, commerce and financial hubs of Poland and has successfully transformed its economy from heavy industry-based to knowledge-based one.

=== Employment and incomes ===

As of August 2024, 252,841 people are employed in Katowice, which makes the city the 7th largest job market in Poland, slightly ahead of Gdańsk. Main sectors include professional services (including the IT sector and finance) at 15.8%, retail (13.7%), and government (12.6%). Unemployment rate is extremely low at 1%, as of June 2024. 

Median monthly income for residents of Katowice stood at PLN 7,220.00 while median monthly income for those employed in Katowice was higher at PLN 8,053.30 as of August 2024, both above the country&#x27;s median of PLN 6,697.52.

=== Business and commerce ===
Katowice is a large business, convention and trade fair centre. As of 2012, 44,050 businesses were registered in Katowice. 13 of them are traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with ING Bank Śląski being the largest one by far, while 11 are traded on the NewConnect floor. 

Largest private corporations headquartered in Katowice include Polska Grupa Górnicza (coal mining and energy), Farmacol (pharmaceuticals), Famur (mining equipment manufacturing), Mistal (steel products manufacturing), Emiternet (renewable energy systems). Major international corporations with regional headquarters in Katowice include IBM, Unilever, PwC, Deloitte, Groupon, Eurofins, Capgemini, Sopra Steria, Accenture, Fujitsu, Citibank, HSBC, KPMG, RSM, Baker Tilly, and others. 

Katowice is also the seat of Katowice Special Economic Zone (Katowicka Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna).

=== Heavy industry and manufacturing ===
Since its creation, Katowice&#x27;s development was tightly connected to heavy industry, especially coal mining, steelworks and machine production. In 1931, 49.5% of inhabitants worked in industry, and 12.5% in coal mining alone. In 1989 industry accounted for 36% of all jobs in the city (112,000 employees). As of 2018, 34,294 people worked in industry in Katowice, 20.4% of total, below the national average.

The first reported coal mine in Katowice (&quot;Murcki&quot; coal mine) was established in 1740, and in 1769 construction on &quot;Emanuelssegen&quot; mine started. As the demand for coal kept rising in the Kingdom of Prussia, further mines were opened: &quot;Beata&quot; (1801), &quot;Ferdinand&quot; (1823), &quot;Kleofas&quot; (1845). Later in 19th and early 20th century additional mines were opened: &quot;Katowice&quot;, &quot;Wujek&quot;, &quot;Eminenz&quot; (later renamed &quot;Gottwald&quot; and merged with &quot;Kleofas&quot;), &quot;Wieczorek&quot;, &quot;Boże Dary&quot;, &quot;Staszic&quot; and renewed &quot;Murcki&quot;. Currently only one (&quot;Murcki-Staszic&quot;) remains in operation. Katowice is also the seat of Polska Grupa Górnicza, the largest coal mining corporation in Europe. Metallurgy was another important part of Katowice&#x27;s economy. In 1863 a dozen zinc metallurgy facilities were reported in Katowice, with &quot;Wilhelmina&quot; (founded in 1834) being the largest. In early 1900s, &quot;Wilhelmina&quot; (later renamed &quot;Huta Metali Niezależnych Szopienice&quot;) was enlarged and became the largest Silesian producer of non-ferrous metals and world&#x27;s largest producer of cadmium. Two major steelworks existed in the city: &quot;Huta Baildon&quot;, established in 1823 by the Scottish engineer and industrialist John Baildon (declared bankruptcy in 2001), and &quot;Huta Ferrum&quot;, established in 1874 and operating to this date in limited capacity.

==Culture==
Vibrant and progressive artistic communities, particularly around musical arts, make Katowice one of the leading cultural spots in Poland. Since mid-2000s, Katowice has established a strategy to redevelop the post-industrial areas using culture – the pinnacle of which was a massive development on the site of a former coal mine known as Strefa Kultury (the &quot;Zone of Culture&quot;), where numerous cultural and convention institutions are located.

=== Performing arts ===

Katowice&#x27;s status as the UNESCO City of Music, designated when Katowice joined UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2015, comes from a long and rich history of musical arts. Katowice is the seat of an internationally renowned Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music, whose faculty and graduates created the nationally important informal group called the Silesian school of composers. Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra has been located in Katowice since 1945 and has gotten a new internationally acclaimed concert hall in 2014, built on a site of a former coal mine near Katowice&#x27;s city center. The Silesian Philharmonic also has its seat in Katowice. The city is a venue for numerous classical concerts and festivals, such as: the International Festival of Young Music Competition Laureates, Grzegorz Fitelberg International Competition for Conductors, Chamber Music Festival, Ars Cameralis Festival and Katowice&#x27;s opera, operettas and most of all ballet.

There are currently 6 theater buildings in Katowice, and some theater groups without a permanent location. Teatr Śląski is the oldest still-functioning theater in Katowice, first opened for audience in 1907 and located on the main square. It was the first theater to give plays in Silesian dialect of Polish. Every first Monday of the month, the Silesian Opera singers from nearby Bytom give a performance there, as Katowice does not have an opera house of its own. Teatr Ateneum is an important puppetry theater, while Teatr Korez was one of the first non-public theaters in post-war Poland.

Katowice is home to many nationally and internationally renowned popular music festivals. Rawa Blues, named after a stream that passes through Katowice&#x27;s city center, is one of the largest blues festivals in Europe. Electronic music&#x27;s Mayday Festival takes place every year in early November and is a sister event to its namesake in Dortmund. OFF Festival, dedicated to alternative music, moved to Katowice in 2010 and has been held every August. Tauron Nowa Muzyka festival, oriented more towards dance and techno has been named one of the major European festivals to attend. Other music festivals, such as the Silesian Jazz Festival, KatoHej (dedicated to chants and touristic music), and Gardens of Sound, are also organized. In 2019, 475,806 people attended various big cultural events such as concerts and festivals, which gave the city the third place in Poland, behind Warsaw and Kraków. Nearby Chorzów, with the Silesian Stadium right across the street from Katowice, gathered another 319,783 attendees.

=== Museums and art galleries ===
The Silesian Museum is the largest and most-important museum in Katowice. It originally opened in 1929, and its radically modern, Bauhaus-style new building was demolished immediately after the Nazis seized Katowice in 1939, considering it too degenerate and too Polish. The museum has been placed in temporary buildings with its collections dispersed until 2015, when a new, mostly underground building has been constructed in the Zone of Culture. The museum exhibits works by famous and renowned Polish artists like Józef Chełmoński, Artur Grottger, Tadeusz Makowski, Jacek Malczewski, Jan Matejko, Józef Mehoffer and Stanisław Wyspiański. It is also well known for its collection of naïve art paintings, including local coal miners from Katowice area. The museum has a number of sketches of globally recognizable artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt.

The City History Museum of Katowice exhibitions include: immersive typical urban apartments from early 20th century, naïve art paintings from local artists and the history of Katowice from a village to an industrial center. Other museums in Katowice include Museum of the History of Computers and Informatics and the Museum of Smallest Books in the World.

The BWA Contemporary Art Gallery in Katowice, established in 1949, is a notable institution concerning the Contemporary arts. Every three years, it is responsible for organizing the Polish Graphic Art Triennial. Several other galleries feature exhibitions of the works by artists from abroad along with film screenings, workshops for children and public fairs.

The well-developed network supports over 200,000 cars registered in Katowice, and 49 percent of commuters that drive alone, a high share compared to other major cities in Poland. Several freeways in Katowice are among the busiest in Poland: expressway S86 between Sosnowiec and Katowice&#x27;s city center and highway A4 between Murckowska and Mikołowska interchanges both see over 100,000 cars passing each day.

Katowice has a ring around its city center, consisting of highway A4, Murckowska freeway, Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa (a freeway-style road connecting downtowns of cities in the Katowice urban area) that partly goes in a tunnel underground and Bocheńskiego road. Many of the roads and freeways in Katowice expand radially from the city center and replaced old local roads.

==== Main roads ====
European route E40 passes through Katowice as highway A4. It enters the city from Chorzów and continues eastward, with three lanes in each direction on the main road and two to three lanes in parallel access roads. It meets Bocheńskiego road and continues towards Mikołowska interchange, which is one of the only combination interchanges in Poland and the main exit towards the city center. After that interchange, the highway loses its access roads due to lack of space in the dense urban area and continues east with four lanes in each direction. Access roads appear again (only on the south side, though) after around 500 meters and there is an exit towards Francuska Street. After another 1.5 kilometer, access roads appear again on the north side, too, and there is a tight exit towards Pułaskiego Street. The highway then runs into Murckowska interchange, before exiting the city.

National road 79 (DK79) enters Katowice from Chorzów and separates the Silesian Park and Osiedle Tysiąclecia in Katowice. It then merges with Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa (DTŚ) at the junction with Bocheńskiego road and Złota Street. It continues with DTŚ through the Katowice city center and descents into a tunnel under the Rondo roundabout. It then emerges overground again, right before an interchange with DK86. The road continues eastward as a freeway with exits towards Zawodzie and Szopienice neighborhoods for several more kilometers, before entering Mysłowice and becoming a standard-access road.

National road 81 (DK81) enters Katowice from Mikołów and runs through the southern residential neighborhoods as an arterial road with two lanes in each direction, named Kościuszki Street. In the Brynów neighborhood, Kościuszki Street continues towards Katowice&#x27;s city center while NR 81 turns east, to run through the forest towards the interchange with DK86.

National road 86 (DK86) enters Katowice from Sosnowiec as expressway S86 up until Roździeńskiego interchange where it meets DK79 and loses its expressway status. It then continues south as Murckowska freeway east of the city center. It meets highway A4 and then passes by Giszowiec neighborhood and continues through the woods southward, with exits towards Murcki neighborhood (from which it gets its name) and Kostuchna. It bypasses Murcki from the east and continues south towards Tychy.

==== Tempo 30 Zone ====
In 2015, Katowice designated most of its city center as a zone, in an effort to curb traffic fatalities and crashes. Within 3 years of operation, the number of accidents dropped by 41 percent, including 37 percent drop in accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists. The accidents are also less severe: there was a 55 percent drop in injured pedestrians and cyclists.

<text>Vantaa (; , ) is a city in Finland. It is located to the north of the capital, Helsinki, in southern Uusimaa. The population of Vantaa is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland. Vantaa is part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, which has approximately  million inhabitants.

The administrative centre of Vantaa is located in the Tikkurila district. Vantaa lies in Southern Finland and shares borders with Helsinki, the Finnish capital, to the south, Espoo to the southwest, Nurmijärvi to the northwest, Kerava and Tuusula to the north, and Sipoo to the east. The city covers a total area of , of which is water.

Vantaa&#x27;s significant attractions include Vantaa River (&quot;Vantaanjoki&quot;), which runs through the city before flowing into the Gulf of Finland. The Helsinki Airport, situated in Vantaa, serves as the largest airport in Finland and the primary airline hub for the Helsinki metropolitan area. Companies headquartered in Vantaa comprise Finnair, Finavia, R-kioski, Tikkurila Oyj, Veikkaus, and Metsähallitus. Additionally, Vantaa is home to Heureka, a science center.

Vantaa is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers (the lowest percentage out of any bilingual municipality in Finland), and speakers of other languages, which is well above the national average. According to the 2025 disturbance index used by the Finnish Police, Vantaa is currently the most dangerous city of Finland, and Myyrmäki its most dangerous district.

==History==
Vantaa has a rich history that dates back to the Stone Age. The area was inhabited by Tavastians and Finns proper until the so-called second crusade to Finland and Swedish colonisation of the area.

===Ancient history===
Remains of an ancient rectangular dwelling dating to 6700 to 6500 BCE have been discovered in Brunaberg in Vantaa. At the time, the dwelling was located at the seashore near the mouth of the Keravanjoki river. The dwelling had been used for decades, apparently mostly in wintertime. A graveyard-like dwelling dating to the Mesolithic has been discovered in Jönsas, which was located at the mouth of a seaside bay at the time. In the Stone Age, people in Vantaa sought their food mostly from the sea. Seals were an important quarry, but remains of harbour porpoises have also been found at the numerous Neolithic dwelling sites at Jokiniemi. Remains of permanent dwellings found from Stenkulla in Hakkila date from the same period.

There are considerably many findings from the Comb Ceramic culture in Vantaa. Many ancient clay figures representing humans have been found in Jokiniemi in Vantaa. They have been estimated to be of various ages from 5300 to 5500 years old. During the typical Comb Ceramic time, large amounts of flint were brought to Finland from the south and southeast, which was made into blades and points, as well as amber. The Comb Ceramic era humans also knew how to use bows and arrows as weapons.

Iron Age history in Vantaa is not very well known, but the entire Uusimaa area was still a sparsely-populated backland of Tavastia at the end of the Iron Age. The most researched Iron Age dwelling in Vantaa is located at the same site as the earlier Stone Age dwellings of Jönsas and Palmu. Remains of Morby ceramics have been discovered at these sites, and iron slag has also been discovered in Jönsas. Remains of fireplaces dating to the Iron Age have also been researched in Jönsas. Remains of dwellings dating to the 10th century have been discovered in Gubbacka in Länsisalmi as well as remains of smithies from the 12th and 13th centuries.

Information about ancient villages located in the Vantaa area can be found from concentration of soil visible in palynological analysis as well as retroactive reasoning based on nomenclature and historical documents. According to historian Saulo Kepsu, Finnish population has spread from Tavastia to the Helsinki and Vantaa area in the 11th to 14th centuries, possibly even earlier. The Tavastians had fishing places and other pleasure grounds in the area.

===Swedish rule===
Prior to the name &quot;Vantaa&quot; being taken into use in 1974, the area was known as &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; (; &quot;Socken of Helsinki&quot;). The rapids of river Vantaa were known as &quot;Helsingfors&quot;, from which the current Swedish name of Helsinki derives. Early settlement in Vantaa was centered around the river, in Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä (&quot;Helsinki Parish Village&quot;), and from it the city&#x27;s current coat of arms derived its imagery.

The Swedish colonisation in Vantaa started in connection with the colonisation in the rest of Uusimaa in the late 13th century after the Second Swedish Crusade. The Swedes called the area &quot;Ny land&quot; (&quot;new land&quot;). There was permanent settlement in the area of the branching point of the rivers in the 14th century.

The history of &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; stretches at least to the 14th century. For a long time it was thought that the earliest record of the area was as &quot;Helsinge&quot; in 1351 when king Magnus IV of Sweden granted salmon fishing rights on the river &quot;Helsingaa&quot; (now known as the river Vantaa) to the Estonian Padise Abbey. However, according to current knowledge, the first mention of Vantaa was in a document given by king Magnus IV in Västerås on 14 September 1331, describing episcopal tithes, requiring a pound of butter for the bishop from every citizen of age 7 years or older.

Since the 14th century, the road between Turku and Vyborg, King&#x27;s Road, has run through Vantaa. The road brought significant attention to the city, and its location on the salmon rich river led to a permanent population.

The river &quot;Helsingaa&quot; soon gave its name to the entire area, and also inspired the coat of arms of Vantaa. The Helsinki socken was born from the 1370s to the 1390s, and the Church of St. Lawrence was built there in 1460. The church was located in a transport hub near the rivers of Vantaa and Kerava. Many roads also ran through the clerical centre: the King&#x27;s Road from Turku to Vyborg and the Häme road to the Häme Castle and to the coast in the south. The first vicar in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; was mentioned in 1395. &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; is seen as have established itself as a clerical and administrative parish in the 15th century, and the first mention of a church dedicated to Saint Lawrence in the area is from 1401. A local &quot;frälse&quot; family donated a land worth one &quot;skattmark&quot; from Rekola to the church of St. Lawrence. The name &quot;Helsinge&quot; was first mentioned in 1428. In the same year, fishing rights in the area were moved over to the Archdiocese of Turku, which helped the construction of a stone church to replace the old wooden one.

Justice in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; was the responsibility of its own district court. It is known that the parish had its own district court in the 16th century. The court could be held by deputies hired by high-ranking judges, so-called lawreaders. The use of lawreaders was common from the late 16th century to the 1680s.

Because of its poor location, Porvoo could not compete with the Hanseatic merchants in Tallinn, so in 1550 king Gustav Vasa decided to found the city of Helsinki at the site of &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; at the mouth of the Helsingaa river. &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; had already developed into a significant centre of marine trade in Uusimaa in the 1530s. However, the Vanhakaupunki area in Helsinki never became the city centre Gustav Vasa wanted during his lifetime.

In 1570, the 25-year Russian war also affected life in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot;. Increased stress, additional military tax and enemy attacks had their toll on the population and often led to farmsteads being deserted. In 1577 there were 51 farmsteads burned and raided by the enemy. Serving food to and accommodating the military departments was the responsibility of police chief Olof Mårtensson, who lived at the Malmi horsestead. The largest department served by the police chief consisted of 40 horsemen from the Uppland unit in January 1576. As well as the Malmi horsestead, &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; was also home to the horsesteads of Pukinmäki, Herttoniemi, Haltiala, Kirkonkylä, Meilby, Kulosaari and Heickby.

After the Treaty of Stolbovo, the Diet of Helsinki granted the rights of a staple town to Helsinki for foreign trade in 1617. The wars against Poland and Germany in the 1620s led to many large manors for the nobility being built in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; to support the cavalry, including Westerkulla and Hakunila. In autumn 1640, it was decided to move Helsinki from the Vanhakaupunki area to its current location at Vironniemi. The village of Töölö was annexed from &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; to Helsinki proper in 1644, and in 1652 the parish congregation lost its independent status, and in order to support the economy of the Helsinki congregation, the entire church parish of Helsinki was annexed to the city congregation of Helsinki.

The Great Famine of 1695–1697 also had its toll on &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot;. Successive years of crop loss caused famine and mortality was high. As well as the peasants, the famine also affected servants of the crown, both the noble and the common estates, and the bourgeoisie.

During the Great Wrath Russian troops invaded &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; in 1713. Some of the inhabitants fled to the mother country of Sweden or into nearby forests, some fought back against the invaders. As the invasion grew long, circumstances slowly settled and the Treaty of Nystad was made in autumn 1721. A second, shorter invasion, known as the Lesser Wrath, happened from 1742 to 1743.

Circumstances in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; started improving in the 1720s, as it became one of the most important centres of early industry in Finland. Water-powered sawmills were built in the area, forming a significant concentration of export industry at the time. This export was directed both to central Europe and also far way to the Mediterranean Sea in the late 18th century. A significant export target for &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; was located just near its coast: the construction of the Sveaborg fortress, started in 1748, required large amounts of workforce and agricultural and industrial products such as foodstuffs, wood, brick and lime.

&quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; was a Swedish-speaking area. From the middle 18th century to the early 19th century, only about a tenth of the population of the parish spoke Finnish.

===Grand Duchy of Finland under Russian rule===
Ore deposits in &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; had been discovered in the 1700s, but weren&#x27;t utilized until Finland transferred to Russian control in the early 1800s. Ore extraction and processing lead to rapid industrialization in the area, with communities forming around locations like Tikkurila and Kerava. The industrial community in Tikkurila included an expeller pressing plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer Tikkurila Oyj.

The capital of autonomous Finland was moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 1800s and &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; fell behind the growing population development of Helsinki proper. &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; gained municipality rights in 1865 because of the first municipal law enacted in Finland, after which it was named &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta/Helsinge kommun&quot; (&quot;Rural Municipality of Helsinki&quot;). In 1805 &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; had 4840 inhabitants, Sveaborg had 4606 and Helsinki had 4337. After six decades &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; had about 7000 inhabitants while Helsinki already had 23,000.

The parish assembly meeting in 1823 established the general order, which specified crimes and punishments they resulted in. One of the reasons the general order was made was the increase of rootless vagabonds in the society. The parish assembly meeting and participation of citizens in keeping up the order was needed, because the state officials failed to keep the poor-mannered part of the people under control. Crimes not resulting in a court session were handled in the parish assembly meeting by announcement from the fief holder.

Interest towards a people&#x27;s education increased in the early 19th century, when basic education still mostly depended on home tuition. By a suggestion from vicar Erik Crohns, a school was founded in Kirkonkylä in 1825 and a school master was hired.

The year 1865 is considered a significant year in the history of Vantaa, as municipal rule in Finland was established in that year and &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; became &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot;, the rural municipality of Helsinki. This also led to the congregation regaining its position as an independent vicar area. The railway centre of Malmi became the administrative centre of the rural municipality.

In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King&#x27;s Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a Renaissance Revival styled station building, which is the oldest extant station building in Finland and (as of 1978) has been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The old station building in Tikkurila is the only brick station building in Finland preserved in its original state. The building was designed by the provincial architect of the Häme Province, Carl Albert Edelfelt (1818-1869). The railway brought industry and induced population growth.

The Finnish famine of 1866–1868 decreased the population of Vantaa by 1300 people, and population growth was very slow for a whole decade. Only in the late 1870s Vantaa regained its population from 1865. The elementary school in Kirkonkylä was founded on 15 September 1869, four years later than originally planned. There were two teachers, one for boys and one for girls.

Four important roads passed through &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; in the late 19th century: Hämeentie, the King&#x27;s Road, Nurmijärventie and Porvoontie. To the north of Kirkonkylä, Hämeentie leading north crossed the King&#x27;s Road. The King&#x27;s Road connected Turku with Vyborg and Saint Petersburg. The King&#x27;s Road, leading northwest, started from Helsinki as an extension of Läntinen Viertotie (now known as Mannerheimintie). Porvoontie connected Hämeentie and the King&#x27;s Road separating from Hämeentie between Viikki and Malminkylä and connecting to the King&#x27;s Road in eastern Hakkila.

The largest industrial facility in &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; in the late 19th century was the Arabia porcelain factory. Its production value was greater than that of all the other factories in the municipality put together. The factory was active in the village of Koskela, to the north of Helsinki, and was named after the villa Arabia previously located at the site of the factory.

The growing city of Helsinki needed large amounts of building materials, brought from Uusimaa and Tavastia. Brick factories in &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; were located in Tikkurila, Lauttasaari and Kulosaari.

A brewery founded by J. K. Kröckell was active in Pitäjänmäki, producing several styles of beer, sparkling wine, lemon-flavoured mead and a type of alcohol-free juice called Sorbus. The brewery horses carried malt products both to Helsinki and to the nearby railway station, continuing all the way to Tampere. The Pitäjänmäki brewery remained in action until 1914.

In 1899, an edict about tightly populated communities came into force in Finland. During the next couple of decades, almost twenty tightly populated communities were founded in the area of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot;. Of these, Huopalahti separated into its own municipality in 1920, Oulunkylä in 1921 and Kulosaari in 1922. With the exception of Tikkurila, all these communities were discontinued in early 1946 as they were annexed to the city of Helsinki. The tightly populated community of Tikkurila was discontinued together with the rest of the tightly populated communities in Finland in early 1956.

===20th century to today===
Electricity started replacing steam as an industrial power source in &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; before World War I. The power station &quot;Oy Malmin Sähkölaitos Ab&quot; was founded in 1910, and another power station was founded in Oulunkylä in the following year. Malmin sähkölaitos, which had reached a central position, bought a lot from Tapanila for its new power plant. Construction of the power plant and distribution grid, led by Gottfried Strömberg, was finished by the end of the year 1910.

The Helsinki-Malmi Airport was built at Tattarinsuo in the Malmi area of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; in 1936. The soil in the area was very watery and converting it to an airfield was difficult. The airport was taken into use in December 1936. Before this, air traffic in Helsinki had been served by the Santahamina Airport in Santahamina, which was also part of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; at the time.

During the great annexation of 1946 the municipalities of Huopalahti, Oulunkylä and Kulosaari as well as about a third of the area of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; were annexed to the city of Helsinki. The rural municipality lost two thirds of its population, including Malmi and Pitäjänmäki. In 1954 some of the areas of Korso in Tuusula and Kerava were annexed to the rural municipality of Helsinki, as well as a small part of Tuusula in 1959. Vuosaari was annexed to Helsinki in 1966.

The population development of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; grew rapidly after World War II. Tikkurila became the new municipal centre in the 1950s. New residential areas consisting mainly of detached houses developed among the main roads and new suburban centres developed along the railways running through the area, such as Rekola, Korso and Koivukylä.

In 1952, the new international airport of Helsinki opened in &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; for the 1952 Summer Olympics, leading to the rural municipality becoming an important transport hub. The new airport split the municipality in half and brought large amounts of traffic and industry to its surroundings. The airport has become a significant part of the cityscape of Vantaa, and even today Vantaa is known abroad as an aviation city.

Because of World War II, many new urban areas had been born in Vantaa already in the 1940s, populated mainly by evacuees from Finnish Karelia and frontline soldiers, as well as Helsinkians seeking a less densely populated area to live in. The first apartment building groups were built in Tikkurila, Satomäki and Vaarala in the 1950s, after which rural flight sped up construction of apartment buildings. In the record year 1970, the population of Vantaa grew by ten thousand people.

The Keimola Motor Stadium was built in 1966 along Finnish National Road 3, opposite the residential area of Kivistö, and remained in operation until 1978. Construction of the new Keimolanmäki residential area in place of the former race track started in the 2010s.

In the early 20th century, the majority of the population of &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; was Swedish-speaking. Afterwards, the rapid increase in the population has brought much more primarily Finnish-speaking population to the city, and today only 3.1 percent of the population in Vantaa are Swedish-speaking.

The roads in Finland were widened in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Ring III beltway was built to connect five national roads with each other. Myyrmäki became a second centre in the area after the construction of the Martinlaakso railway, which also sped up development in southwestern Vantaa. New residential suburbs were born along the main railway in the 1960s to 1980s, sped up by rural flight. Areas left outside the main traffic connections, such as Seutula in the west and Sotunki in the east, were left mainly unbuilt and rural-oriented.

In 1972, the municipality was renamed &quot;Vantaa&quot; () and promoted to a kauppala (market town) (i.e. &quot;Vantaan kauppala/Vanda köping&quot;). In 1974, the town got full city rights as &quot;Vantaan kaupunki/Vanda stad&quot; or &quot;City of Vantaa&quot;. The name &quot;Vantaa&quot; comes from the river Vantaa running through the city, along which settlement in the Vantaa area was originally centred. The 650th anniversary of Vantaa was celebrated in 2001.

The city grew rapidly starting from 1960s and a railway line was built to the western side of the city in 1970s.

Since the days of the rural municipality, Vantaa has rapidly developed to its current form because of rural flight and good traffic connections. Like the neighbouring city of Espoo, Vantaa has many suburban commuter towns and lacks a specific city centre. The Helsinki Airport, the busiest airport in Finland by far, is located in central Vantaa.

In 2015, an extension to the existing railway line, the Ring Rail Line opened, providing service to the airport and new residential and working districts. Along the ring road, new residential were constructed. The largest of these developments is the Kivistö suburb followed by the residential districts of Leinelä and Aviapolis. The Ring Rail Line connects the Vantaankoski railway to the Finnish Main Line via the Helsinki Airport at Hiekkaharju.

The annual Beer floating summer event started in Vantaa in 1997. On 11 October 2002, an explosion took place in the Myyrmanni shopping centre in Myyrmäki. Negotiations to resolve the Aceh conflict, led by former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari, were held in the Köningstedt Manor in Vantaa in early 2005.

To connect the municipality on the west–east, a new tramway is planned to open in 2030. This tramway will run from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport through districts of Pakkala, Aviapolis and Koivuhaka to the administrative centre of Tikkurila and further onward to Hakkila and Länsimäki in the east. The tram will also provide a link to the Helsinki metro at Mellunmäki station. This tramline will be the first tram in Vantaa.

===History and etymology of nomenclature===
Colonists arriving from Sweden in the 14th century settled in the area what is now Vantaa and named the river in the area as &quot;Helsingå&quot; or &quot;Helsingaa&quot;. The etymology of this name is not known for sure, but according to an old tradition it probably comes from colonists who originally arrived at the Hälsingland area in Sweden.

The same river has also been known as the river Vantaa (&quot;Vanda å&quot; in Swedish). Unlike the name &quot;Helsingaa&quot;, the name Vantaa comes from the Finnish-speaking Tavastian inhabitants upstream of the river. There is a village named Vantaa near the source of the river, at the area which now belongs to the city of Riihimäki. According to a theory, the name comes from the Finnish words &quot;vanan taka&quot;, where &quot;vana&quot; means a riverbed and so Vantaa (possibly originally spelled &quot;Vanantaa&quot;) means a place behind a riverbed. Only later did the name also came to use also downstream and replace the old name &quot;Helsingaa&quot;.

The Vanhankaupunginkoski rapids at the mouth of the river Vantaa were originally known as &quot;Helsinge fors&quot; (&quot;Helsinki rapids&quot;), which also gave the name &quot;Helsingfors&quot; to the city founded along the rapids.

The Vantaa blast furnace founded at the shore of the Vantaankoski rapids in 1837 gave the name &quot;Vantaa&quot; to its entire environment.

By the new municipal law in 1865 the Finnish name of the municipality became &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; (&quot;the rural municipality of Helsinki&quot;), when the concept of sockens in Finland was discontinued. The Swedish name remained as &quot;Helsinge&quot;, in contrast to &quot;Helsingfors&quot;, the Swedish name for Helsinki proper. When &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot; became a market town in 1972, proposed new names included &quot;Helsingin kauppala&quot;, &quot;Helsinginjoen kauppala&quot; and &quot;Vantaanjoen kauppala&quot;. The accepted name was &quot;Vantaan kauppala&quot; after the river Vantaa. Two years later Vantaa received city rights.

==Geography==
===Location===
Vantaa is located in southern Finland, in the region of Uusimaa and the Helsinki sub-region. It is separated from the Gulf of Finland by Helsinki. Prior to the abolition of Finnish provinces in 2009, Vantaa was a part of the Southern Finland Province.

The city borders Helsinki, the Finnish capital, which is to the south and southwest. Other neighbouring municipalities are Espoo to the west; Nurmijärvi, Kerava, and Tuusula to the north; and Sipoo to the east. Vantaa is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the Helsinki capital region.

===Subdivision===

Vantaa is divided into seven major regions (, ): Tikkurila &quot;(Dickursby)&quot;, Hakunila &quot;(Håkansböle)&quot;, Koivukylä &quot;(Björkby)&quot;, Korso, Aviapolis, Myyrmäki &quot;(Myrbacka)&quot;, and Kivistö. These major regions are then divided into a total of 60 city districts, the most populated of which are Myyrmäki, Martinlaakso, Hakunila, and Pakkala.

===Features===
Vantaa consists mostly of lowlands cut up by rivers. According to a survey done by the National Land Survey of Finland on 1 January 2022, Vantaa encompasses , of which is water. The city is mostly suburban and urban area with some rural landscape, notably in the districts of Sotunki and Seutula. Average population density is , which rises above in concentrated urban districts like Myyrmäki and Tikkurila.

The river Vantaa runs through western Vantaa, and its tributary Keravanjoki runs through eastern Vantaa. In 1966, the rural municipality of Helsinki (now known as Vantaa) lost the district of Vuosaari to Helsinki proper, cutting it almost completely off from the sea. Up to 2008, Vantaa still reached the seashore at its southeastern corner at the Porvarinlahti bay, until the &quot;Västerkulla wedge&quot; with its seashore was annexed into Helsinki together with part of Sipoo in 2009. Thus Vantaa formally became the second largest inland city in the Nordic countries after Tampere.

For its area, Vantaa has relatively few lakes. The city encompasses two natural lakes: &quot;Kuusijärvi&quot; in Kuninkaanmäki and &quot;Lammaslampi&quot; Pähkinärinne, Hämeenkylä. In addition to these, there is an artificial lake, &quot;Silvolan tekojärvi&quot;. Vantaa shares two lakes with Espoo: &quot;Odilampi&quot; and &quot;Pitkäjärvi&quot;. Of the lakes in the Sipoonkorpi National Park, Bisajärvi and most of Gumböle träsk are located in Vantaa. Ponds formed in sand pits include Vetokannas, renovated into a swimming beach and the Vaaralanlammet ponds in Vaarala.

The easternmost districts of Vantaa, Rajakylä and Länsimäki, are located right next to the border to Helsinki and are connected to the Helsinki districts of Vesala and Mellunmäki. Part of the turnstile of the Mellunmäki metro station is located in Vantaa.

Vantaa exhibits frequent exposed granite bedrock ground, which is common in Finland. Resulting from erosion in the last glacial period (about 10,000 years ago), elevated surfaces often lack soil (superficial deposits), revealing bare stone unsuitable for most plant life. Other geological impacts of the last Ice Age include a series of eskers running through central Vantaa, which is one of the best sources of groundwater in the city. After the glacial period, most of the area of the current city of Vantaa was underwater except for the highest hills. As the land rose, bays stretching far inland were left behind, along with the river Vantaa, which changed its discharge from Mätäoja to Keravanjoki about two millennia ago. The bays flushed against the hills leaving shore formations still visibile today. They also formed flat deposits of clay at the bottom, which now form valleys especially along the rivers.

===Flora===

Vantaa belongs to the taiga zone and its flora represents the southern parts of the zone. Vantaa is located at the border between the southern boreal zone characteristic of inland southern Finland and the hemiboreal subzone characteristic of southwestern Finland.

The hemiboreal subzone is a transition subzone between coniferous and deciduous forests, and deciduous trees growing naturally in the subzone include oaks and elms. The river valleys running through Vantaa have previously been full of lush groves, but today most of them are farmed land. However, at some places they are connected to lush mixed forests, transitioning into shadowy spruce forests at some places.

There are prominent alder meadows along the river Mätäoja, which are home to various rare insect and plant species. The most common type of forest in Vantaa is a blueberry conifer forest with spruce and birch trees, whereas dry forests are only located at bare cliff areas.

The second most common forest type in Vantaa is the more lush grove-like forest. Its undergrowth includes blueberry, wood sorrel, herb Paris and lady fern, as well as wood anemone at some places.

There are lush groves growing mosaically among the forests, containing common southern grove plants such as the liverwort. The groves in Vantaa vary greatly, ranging from moist and shady spruce groves growing ostrich fern to dry groves growing liverwort and common hazel and hardwood groves. In springtime during the first weeks of May the wood anemone flowers very noticeably in almost all groves and grove-like forests, which is characteristic to the forest growth in southwestern and southern Finland.

There is a centuries-old oak forest in the district of Tammisto, which is considered to be the only natural oak forest in the Finnish capital area. The forest has been protected under the nature preservation law in 1946.

Although Vantaa is a very urbanised area, a great deal of its surface area still remains as rural fields or forest. The city of Vantaa contains 12.41 square kilometres of nature preserved area (about 5% of the surface area of the city). The first nature preserve area in Vantaa was founded in 1946 in Tammisto. There are two especially protected species in the nature preserve areas in Vantaa, the beetle species &quot;Hylochares cruentatus&quot; and the orchid species &quot;Malaxis monophyllos&quot;.

===Climate===

Vantaa has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb). The city has four distinct seasons, the amount of precipitation is relatively uniform throughout the year. The driest season is spring. Summers are generally relatively warm and winters are cold. Although the city does not have a coastline along the Baltic Sea, it is close enough to experience the mitigating influence of the sea and the Gulf Stream. The record low temperature in Vantaa is and the record high temperature is .


The coldest month of the year is in February, when the average temperature based on measurements from 1981 to 2010 was -5.8 degrees Celsius. After this, the temperatures rise rapidly. The average temperature in April for the same period is +4.0 degrees and the one in May is +10.5 degrees. The warmest month of the year is in July, when the average temperature is +17.7 degrees. The second warmest month is in August with an average temperature of +15.7 degrees and the third warmest is June with an average temperature of +14.7 degrees. The average number of hot weather days in Vantaa is 17, of which over half occur in July on average. In sporadic years hot weather can extend to September. The summer thunderstorm period in Vantaa is very short and varying: it typically starts around Midsummer and ends in middle August, peaking at the end of July.

The temperatures lower in autumn slower than they rise in spring. The average day temperature in November is +0.3 degrees and the one in December is -3.3 degrees. In autumn and early winter low pressure storm fronts move eastwards from the Atlantic Ocean passing over Vantaa. Vantaa&#x27;s location in Fennoscandia warmed by the Gulf Stream near the coast of the Gulf of Finland makes Vantaa a clearly more temperate area than the average based on its latitude. For example, the southern tip of Greenland is located south of Vantaa, as are the tundra areas of the Labrador Peninsula. The period when Vantaa is normally covered in snow is typically from late December to early April, after which the snow rapidly melts away.

Spring in Vantaa experiences significantly less rain than autumn. The average monthly rainfall in February through May is only about 30 to 40 millimetres. In summer the weather becomes rainier, and the average monthly rainfall in July through November is 60 to 80 millimetres. The rainfall varies greatly throughout the year: in the late months of the year there are monthly rainfalls of less than 20 millimetres, as well as over 200 millimetres. Respectively, the weather becomes drier in the early months of the year. The total average rainfall in Vantaa in a year is 682.9 millimetres.

There are Swedish speakers in Vantaa, or of the population. This compares with in Helsinki and in Espoo. The number of Swedish speakers in Vantaa has remained more or less constant over the decades, but the proportion of Swedish speakers in the city has declined steadily as a result of immigration. In 1960, about ten per cent of the population of Vantaa spoke Swedish. In 1980, the proportion was about five per cent. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Vantaa has been a predominantly Finnish-speaking municipality.

Vantaa remains officially bilingual, as the Finnish Language Act states that a municipality must be declared bilingual if the number of speakers of the official minority language (Finnish or Swedish) is at least 8% of the population or 3,000 people. In relation to the total population, the proportion of Swedish speakers in Vantaa is the lowest of all bilingual municipalities in Finland. Among Vantaa&#x27;s districts, the proportion of Swedish speakers was highest in Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä (19.0%), Sotunki (16.6%) and Luhtaanmäki (11.5%) in 2019.

The number of people who speak Sámi, Finland&#x27;s third official language, is only inhabitants. In Vantaa, of the population speak a mother tongue other than Finnish or Swedish.

==Economy==
===Economy of the city of Vantaa===
In the latest years, Vantaa has stabilised its economy via an economy and debt program accepted in 2012. The growth of the loan stock was stopped by the end of the council term from 2013 to 2017. In 2016 the city managed to decrease its loan stock a little, which had grown to over one billion euro.

Vantaa has been in increasing debt since the early 2000s, due to a decrease in state funding and an increase in investments. A contributing factor to its situation is the high concentration of families with children, leading to comparatively larger social expenditure. According to the former mayor Juhani Paajanen, the worst expenditures have ended, and the city&#x27;s gains are increasing.

On a nation-wide perspective, Vantaa has a high level of tax income, but in perspective of the capital region, the tax income of Vantaa is lower than those of Espoo and Helsinki. The state subsidy system and its stabilisation of tax income based on a nation-wide comparison have been seen as problematic because of special challenges of the cities in the capital region and because of constant rapid growth.

The municipal tax in Vantaa is 19.00%, which is clearly below the average in Finland and one of the lowest in the large cities. The last time Vantaa raised its municipal tax was in 2010. The state of Finland has raised the lower limit of the property tax because of new legislation.

In a comparison of characteristic figures of large cities Vantaa has developed positively in the latest years. In regard to municipal concerns and financing various investments, the differences in loan amounts in the cities have balanced out. In the early 2000s over half of the city&#x27;s debt consisted of rental apartments owned by the city (managed by the company VAV Asunnot Oy). On the other hand, the city ended up in a crisis mainly because it had made large investments in its own balance with borrowed money. The city has hardly sold any of its property in the early 2000s.

===Jobs and industry===

Because of good traffic connections, Vantaa has a large amount of food, HVAC and machinery industry as well as businesses. There are industrial areas along the Ring III beltway, particularly near the airport and in the neighbouring districts of Viinikkala, Veromies, Pakkala and Koivuhaka as well as in Hakkila, connected to the main railway line by a branch terminal line. The Aviapolis area has developed around the airport, containing many businesses in logistics and high technology. In 2000 74.6% of the jobs in the city were in services, 23.8% in refinery and only 0.5% in agriculture. In 2001 the rate of self-sufficiency in jobs in Vantaa had risen to 97.1%. In the 2000s the number of jobs in Vantaa had grown by about 15%.

Of those employed, two thirds are in the private sector. The most common industries in Vantaa include the food, architectural engineering, and machine industries. In 2007, the unemployment rate was 6.3%.

Companies that have their headquarters in Vantaa (at the Helsinki Airport, in Aviapolis) include Finnair, Finavia and Nordic Regional Airlines. Companies with headquarters in Vantaa outside of Aviapolis include R-kioski, Tikkurila Oyj, Veikkaus Oy, and Metsähallitus. Fujifilm Finland has its headquarters in Vantaa.

An interesting future possibility for Vantaa and for the entire capital region comes from the Ring Rail Line, which allows for significant increase in the number of apartments and jobs and provides a direct rail connection from the main railway line to the Helsinki Airport. The Ring Rail Line required an investment of over one hundred million euro from Vantaa. The city of Helsinki had been proposing the idea of joining the municipalities in the capital region, in order to better develop the area, for decades. The cities of Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen have rejected this idea each time, although Vantaa has done so a bit more slowly than the others. The municipal and city managers of Vantaa have repeatedly rejected Helsinki&#x27;s proposal fearing Vantaa would become a &quot;backyard&quot; of Helsinki. Helsinki has been expanding towards Vantaa throughout the 20th century, including the great annexation in 1946 and the annexation of Vuosaari in 1966. Through the annexation of Östersundom in Sipoo and the Västerkulla wedge to Helsinki in 2009, Vantaa lost its only connection to the sea, becoming the second-largest inland city in the Nordic countries, after Tampere.

<text>The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (; ; ; ) and commonly known as St. Moritz 1948 (; ), were a winter multi-sport event held from 30 January to 8 February 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been twelve years since the last Winter Games in 1936.

From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the 1948 Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström.

28 nations marched in the opening ceremonies on 30 January 1948. Bibi Torriani played for the Switzerland men&#x27;s national ice hockey team and became the first ice hockey player to recite the Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes. Nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports. The 1948 Games also featured two demonstration sports: military patrol, which later became the biathlon, and winter pentathlon, which was discontinued after these Games. Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters Dick Button and Barbara Ann Scott and skier Henri Oreiller. Most athletic venues have existed since St. Moritz first hosted the Winter Games in 1928. All the venues were outdoors, meaning the Games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions.

== Host city selection ==
The IOC selected St. Moritz to host the 1948 Games by acclamation at the 40 general session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 6 September 1946. The selection process consisted of two bids, and saw St. Moritz be selected ahead of Lake Placid, New York, United States. St. Moritz was chosen because all of the venues of the 1928 Winter Olympics were available, and the Swiss resort could organize the Games much quicker than any other city except for 1936 host Garmisch-Partenkirchen which was not considered. Despite the existence of many of the 1928 sites, it was still a difficult task to organize a Winter Olympic Games in less than 18 months.

==Organizing==

The Comité Olympique (CO) was composed of local dignitaries and members of the Swiss National Olympic Committee (COS). They decided to separate into several sub-committees responsible for various aspects of the Games. These committees included housing and maintenance, venue construction, finances, and media and advertising. The local committees worked very closely with the Swiss federal government and the IOC to ensure that the organization of the Games proceeded without hindrance. Since no athletes&#x27; village existed from the previous Games, the athletes and officials were housed in hotels around the city. It was essential for the committees to draw upon their experiences from the 1928 Olympics. Their selection of locations for the various events was contingent on the weather conditions, as all the events were held outdoors.

Over 800 people were involved in reporting the news of the Games to the world. Nearly 500 press credentials were issued by the Press Commission for the Games. Television would not make its Olympic debut until 1956. The coverage of the 1948 Games was split between newspapers and radio broadcasts. The organizing committee had to provide technology, such as long-distance telephone lines and telegraph services, to assist the press in communicating with their constituents.

Over 2,200 people were needed to provide all the services for the press, officials, and athletes at the Games. These services included sanitation, security, and care of the venues. Accommodating the influx of people into St. Moritz was difficult for the organizing committee. It was complicated by the mountainous region in which the community was situated. A massive project to improve the village&#x27;s transportation infrastructure had to be completed before the Games. This included building and widening roads for vehicular traffic. Several train stations were built to accommodate the increased demands for public transit. They also had to increase the capacity of the city&#x27;s sewers. All of the projects had to be approved by the Swiss government and justified by its impact on the success of the Games. To aid the organizing committee, the IOC demanded that all participating nations provide lists of their athletes several months before the Games. Consequently, the Swiss knew exactly how many athletes and officials to plan for.

==Politics==
Since these Games were the first since World War II, they were named &quot;The Games of Renewal.&quot; Japan and Germany were not invited to these Games because the international community still ostracized them for their role in World War II. Their absence was short-lived, though, as they returned to Olympic competition in 1952. The Soviet Union did not send athletes to the St. Moritz Games of 1948, but they did send ten delegates as observers of the Games to determine how successful the Soviet athletes would have been had they competed.

===Impact of World War II===
Sapporo, Japan had been the choice for the 1940 Winter Games. In 1938, the Japanese decided to decline the invitation to host the Games claiming that preparations for the Olympic Games were draining the country&#x27;s resources. The IOC turned to the host of the 1936 Games, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which would make it the only city to host consecutive Games. This became impractical when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939; subsequently Germany withdrew its bid to host the Games. Finland believed it could host the Games and extended an invitation to the IOC, but the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Finland ended all hope of an Olympic Games in 1940. The 1944 Winter Olympics had been awarded to Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy in 1939. As the war continued, this proved impractical, and the second consecutive olympiad passed without celebrating the Games. The IOC was presented with two possible host cities for the first post-war Games: Lake Placid, United States and St. Moritz, Switzerland. The IOC decided to award the Games to Switzerland, a neutral country immediately following World War II, to avoid political posturing by former combatants.

The impact of World War II was still being felt in 1948. The lack of financial resources and human energy made the organization of the Games challenging. Athletes were also affected by a lack of resources. Many competitors arrived with little or no equipment. In one notable case, Norwegian skiers had to borrow skis from the American team to compete.

==Events==
Medals were awarded in 22 events contested in 4 sports (9 disciplines).

*Skating

There were also two demonstration sports, military patrol and the winter pentathlon.

===Bobsled===

Two sliding sports were contested at the 1948 Winter Games; the first was bobsled. A controversy erupted when it was alleged that the sleds of the United States team had been sabotaged. It was discovered that the steering wheels had been damaged. After news broke of the apparent improprieties a truck driver stepped forward and admitted to having accidentally backed into the shed housing the bobsleds. The accident, however, did not hinder the United States teams, who won a bronze in the two-man event and a gold and a bronze in the four-man event. The Swiss two-man teams placed first and second, which is the best possible result for the event since only two teams were allowed to enter. The driver of the first place team, Felix Endrich, beat his coach, the driver of the second place team, Fritz Feierabend.

===Ice hockey===

The ice hockey tournament was won by Canada, with Czechoslovakia second and Switzerland third. This was the fifth Olympic gold medal for Canada in hockey. The only team to beat Canada since hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics was Great Britain at the 1936 Winter Olympics. The tournament was almost canceled when rival teams representing the United States arrived. An Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team was supported by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and an Amateur Hockey Association (AHA) team was supported by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The International Olympic Committee ruled that neither team could compete. Still, the Swiss organizing committee allowed the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony and the AHA team to play unofficially without being eligible for medals.

===Figure skating===
Barbara Ann Scott became the first and only Canadian woman to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating when she won the competition at St. Moritz. Despite the distraction caused by a low-flying airplane during her compulsory routine, she could muster the focus to place first entering the free skate. The ice had been shredded the night before the free skate by two ice hockey games (the ice resurfacer had not yet been invented); nonetheless, she was able to adjust her routine to avoid the potholes and emerge victorious.

Eighteen-year-old American Dick Button completed the unprecedented North American sweep of the figure skating gold medals. He led the field after the compulsory skate and won the gold medal by becoming the first person to complete a double Axel in competition. Later in the 1952 Olympics, Dick Button would win gold a second time. Swiss world champion Hans Gerschwiler fell during the free skate, but rebounded to win the silver medal.

===Speed skating===

The speed skating competition was held on the same rink that had hosted the events in 1928. At above sea level, the speed skating competition was held at the second-highest altitude in Olympic history; only Squaw Valley in 1960 was higher. The competition was dominated by the Scandinavian countries of Norway and Sweden who won nine out of the twelve possible medals. Scandinavians had done poorly in speed skating events up until the 1948 Games. Their success was because speed skating in Europe had reached a standstill during World War II. Only countries that were ancillary to the conflict had the resources to keep their speed skating programs intact. The 500 meter race was won by Finn Helgesen of Norway. There was a three-way tie for second place between Norwegian Thomas Byberg and Americans Robert Fitzgerald and Kenneth Bartholomew. All three had finished in exactly 43.2 seconds. Swede Åke Seyffarth won a gold medal in the 10,000 meter race and a silver medal in the 1,500 meter race. The 5,000 meter event was affected by weather. The twenty racers encountered wind, sun, and snow during the day&#x27;s competition. Finally, long-distance specialist Reidar Liaklev from Norway prevailed.

===Alpine skiing===

Alpine skiing made its Olympic debut at these Games. A few events had been held at the 1936 Games, but the St. Moritz Games featured a full slate of three men&#x27;s and three women&#x27;s alpine events. Frenchman Henri Oreiller won a medal in all three Alpine events: gold in the downhill and combined, and bronze in the slalom. He was one of only two athletes to win two gold medals at the 1948 Games, and he was also the only athlete to win three or more medals.

Austria dominated the women&#x27;s alpine events, winning five out of nine possible medals. Trude Beiser was a double-medal winner, earning gold in the combined event and silver in the downhill. She was not the only female skier to win two medals, though United States skier Gretchen Fraser won gold in the slalom and took silver behind Beiser in the combined. Austrian Erika Mahringer earned two medals by winning bronze medals in both the slalom and the combined.

===Cross-country skiing===

In cross-country skiing, 106 skiers from 15 nations competed in three events. The events were the 50 kilometer race, the 18 kilometer race, and the 4 x 10 kilometer relay. There were no women&#x27;s events at the 1948 Games. Martin Lundström of Sweden was the other athlete to win two gold medals when he won the 18 kilometer race and participated on the winning cross-country relay team. Sweden won seven out of fifteen possible medals in the Nordic events, including all three gold medals and a sweep of the 18 kilometer race. All fifteen medals were won by either Sweden, Norway, or Finland.

===Skeleton===

Skeleton made its second appearance at the Olympics during these Games. It debuted in St. Moritz at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Skeleton was a form of luge that had originally appeared in the St. Moritz region at the end of the 19th century. American John Heaton won his second Olympic medal in the skeleton; he won his first 20 years earlier when he was 19 years old. Italian slider Nino Bibbia won the gold medal. It was the first of his 231 career wins on the Cresta Boblsed track. One of the curves at Cesana Pariol, where the bobsled, luge, and skeleton events took place at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, was named after Bibbia.

===Nordic combined===

The Nordic combined event had been contested at each Winter Olympics since 1924. Nordic combined required athletes to first compete in the open 18 kilometer cross-country ski race alongside the other cross-country competitors. Their times would be assigned a point value. The athletes would take two jumps off the ski jump hill two days later. The jumps would be given a point value, and the longest jump would be combined with their cross-country time to create a score. Traditional Nordic combined power Norway was stunned at the 1948 Games when Finland&#x27;s Heikki Hasu became the first non-Norwegian to win the event. Norway did not even make the podium. Hasu&#x27;s teammate Martti Huhtala took the silver, and Sven Israelsson from Sweden won the bronze.

===Ski jumping===

The Norwegians swept the ski jumping event. Birger Ruud had won the gold medal in the ski jumping event at both the 1932 and 1936 Winter Games. The twelve-year hiatus due to World War II meant that Ruud was 36 years old in 1948. He had retired from competition and was coaching the Norwegian team. However, when he arrived at the Games, he decided to come out of retirement and compete one last time. Despite not having competed for several years, he earned a silver medal. Norwegian Petter Hugsted won the gold and teammate Thorleif Schjelderup won the bronze.

===Demonstration sports===

Two demonstration sports were held at the 1948 Games. Military patrol had been a demonstration sport at the 1924, 1928, and 1936 Winter Olympic Games. It entailed a combination of cross-country skiing and shooting at targets. Eventually the competition would be renamed Biathlon and was made an official Olympic medal sport at the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley, United States. Winter pentathlon involved five competitions: 10 kilometer cross-country ski race, shooting, downhill skiing, fencing and horseback riding. This was the first and last time the event was held. Fourteen competitors took part in the event.

==Calendar==
:&quot;All dates are in Central European Time (UTC+1)&quot;
The opening ceremonies were held at 10:00 am on 30 January, along with the initial hockey games and the first two runs of the two-man bobsled. The closing ceremonies were held at 4:00 pm on 8 February. All of the medals were awarded at the closing ceremonies rather than immediately after the event, as current tradition dictates.

==Venues==
The Stad Olympique (Olympic Stadium) hosted the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium was also used for speed skating, the figure skating competition, and the medal games for ice hockey. Most of the ice hockey games were held at the &quot;Suvretta&quot; and &quot;Kulm&quot; stadiums in St. Moritz. Bobsled was held at the St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun. Skeleton was contested on the Cresta Run track. Olympia Bob Run was built in 1897 and modernized for the 1948 Games, while the Cresta Run was first constructed in 1885. The ski jump competitions were held at Olympiaschanze ski jump hill in St. Moritz. It was built in 1927 for the 1928 Games and remained in use until 2006. The alpine events were held on ski-runs in and around Piz Nair.

==Participating nations==
Twenty-eight nations competed in St. Moritz, the same number as the previous Winter Games in 1936. Chile, Denmark, Iceland, Korea, and Lebanon all made their Winter Olympic debut at these Games. Germany and Japan were not invited because of their involvement in World War II. Despite being an Axis power, Italy was allowed to send athletes after it defected to the Allies in 1943. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and would not compete again as independent nations until 1992. Argentina returned to the Winter Games after missing the 1932 and 1936 Games, and Australia and Luxembourg did not compete in 1948, even though they had participated in 1936.

<text>The 1948 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XIV Olympiad and officially branded as London 1948, were an international multi-sport event held from 29 July to 14 August 1948 in London, United Kingdom. Following a twelve-year hiatus caused by the outbreak of World War II, these were the first Summer Olympics held since the 1936 Games in Berlin. The 1940 Olympic Games had been scheduled for Tokyo and then for Helsinki, while the 1944 Olympic Games had been provisionally planned for London. This was the second time London hosted the Olympic Games, having previously hosted them in 1908, making it the second city to host summer olympics twice (after Paris). The Olympics would return again to London 64 years later in 2012, making London the first city to host the games thrice, and the only such city until Paris, who hosted their third games in 2024, and Los Angeles, who will host theirs in 2028. The 1948 Olympic Games were also the first of two summer Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström.

The 1948 Olympics came to be known as the &quot;Austerity Games&quot; due to the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II. No new venues were built for the games (with events taking place mainly at Wembley Stadium, also known as Empire Stadium, and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park), and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village, as were the 1936 Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men, and 390 women in 19 sport disciplines. Germany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics. Israel requested to participate (symbolically represented by Raya Bronstein and ) but was denied as the International Olympic Committee did not yet recognize the country, while the Olympic mandate of Palestine expired. This in turn shifted the view of the Arab countries who had intended to boycott the event and now decided to take part.

One of the star performers at the 1948 Games was Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen. Dubbed the &quot;Flying Housewife&quot;, the thirty-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics. In the decathlon, Bob Mathias of the United States became the youngest male ever to win an Olympic track and field gold medal at the age of seventeen. The most individual medals were won by Veikko Huhtanen of Finland, who took three golds, a silver and a bronze in men&#x27;s gymnastics. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, having 300 athletes compared to the United Kingdom&#x27;s 404. France fielded the second largest team, with 316 athletes and finished third in the medal standings. The host nation ended up twelfth.

==Election as host city==

In June 1939, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 1944 Olympic Summer Games to London, ahead of Rome, Detroit, Budapest, Lausanne, Helsinki, Montreal and Athens. World War II stopped the plans and the Games were cancelled so London again stood as a candidate for 1948. Great Britain almost handed the 1948 games to the United States due to post-war financial and rationing problems, but King George VI said that this could be the chance to restore Britain from World War II. The official report of the London Olympics shows that there was no case of London being pressed to run the Games against its will. It says:

:The Games of 1944 had been allocated to London and so it was that in November 1945, the Chairman of the British Olympic Council, Lord Burghley, went to Stockholm and saw the president of the International Olympic Committee to discuss the question of London being chosen for this great event. As a result, an investigating committee was set up by the British Olympic Council to work out in some detail the possibility of holding the Games. After several meetings they recommended to the council that the Lord Mayor of London should be invited to apply for the allocation of the Games in 1948.

In June 1946 the IOC, through a postal vote, gave the summer Games to London and the winter competition to St Moritz. London was selected ahead of Baltimore, Minneapolis, Lausanne, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.

London, which had previously hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics, became the second city to host the Olympics twice; Paris hosted the event in 1900 and 1924. London later became the first city to host the Olympics for a third time when the city hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==Organization==

Lord Burghley, a gold medal winner at the 1928 Olympics, member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and president of the Amateur Athletics Association was named Chairman of the Organising and Executive Committees. The other members of the committees were: Colonel Evan Hunter, General Secretary of the British Olympic Association, and Chief de mission for Great Britain; Lord Aberdare, the other British member of the IOC; Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett; Alderman H.E. Fern; E.J. Holt; J. Emrys Lloyd, who became the committee&#x27;s legal advisor; C.B. Cowley of the London Press and Advertising; R.B. Studdert, managing director of the Army &amp; Navy Stores; A.E. Porritt, a member of the IOC for New Zealand who resided in London; S.F. Rous, Secretary of The Football Association; and Jack Beresford.

Olympic pictograms were introduced for the first time. There were twenty of them—one for each Olympic sport and three separate pictograms for the arts competition, the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. They were called &quot;Olympic symbols&quot; and intended for use on tickets. The background of each pictogram resembled an escutcheon. Olympic pictograms appeared again 16 years later, and were used at all subsequent Summer Olympics.

At the time of the Games, food, petrol and building were still subject to the rationing imposed during the war in Britain; because of this the 1948 Olympics came to be known as the &quot;Austerity Games&quot;. Athletes were given the same increased rations as dockers and miners, 5,467 calories a day instead of the normal 2,600. Building an Olympic Village was deemed too expensive, and athletes were housed in existing accommodation. Male competitors stayed at RAF camps in Uxbridge and West Drayton, and an Army camp in Richmond Park; female competitors in London colleges. Lord Burghley unfurled the Olympic Flag at the Richmond Park camp at an opening ceremony in July as Minister of Works, Charles Key, declared the camp open.

These were the first games to be held following the death of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, in 1937. They were also the last to include an arts competition, which took place at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==Torch relay==

Nicknamed &quot;relay of peace&quot; due to crossing through several countries in Europe to represent their union after the Second World War, the torch relay for these games took place from 17 to 29 July 1948, with a distance of and 1,416 torchbearers.

The torch was designed by Ralph Lavers. There were three types of torches: the standard one made of aluminum and powered by solid fuel, a special one powered by butane gas (used aboard ) and a third one used in the Wembley stadium, made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle.

The journey began with the lighting of the flame in Olympia. Due to the civil war in Greek soil, the Greek part of the relay went directly to Corfu, where HMS &quot;Whitesand Bay&quot; picked the flame to transport it to Bari. From there, the flame crossed Italy, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Belgium. After a boat trip from Calais to Dover (aboard of ), the flame traveled to several towns in Southeast England until the arrival at Wembley for the Opening ceremony.

The cities and towns visited by the Olympic flame were as follows:

==Opening ceremony==

The Games opened on 29 July. Army bands began playing at 2 pm for the 85,000 spectators in Empire Stadium at Wembley Park. The international and national organisers arrived at 2.35 pm and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, with Queen Mary and other members of the Royal Family, at 2.45 pm. Fifteen minutes later the competitors entered the stadium in a procession that took 50 minutes. The last team was that of the United Kingdom. When it had passed the saluting base, Lord Burghley began his welcome:

:Your Majesty: The hour has struck. A visionary dream has today become a glorious reality. At the end of the worldwide struggle in 1945, many institutions and associations were found to have withered and only the strongest had survived. How, many wondered, had the great Olympic Movement prospered?

After welcoming the athletes to two weeks of &quot;keen but friendly rivalry&quot;, he said London represented a &quot;warm flame of hope for a better understanding in the world which has burned so low.&quot;

At 4 pm, the time shown on the clock tower on the London Games symbol, the King declared the Games open, 2,500 pigeons were set free and the Olympic Flag raised to its flagpole at the end of the stadium. The Royal Horse Artillery sounded a 21-gun salute to welcome the last runner in the Torch Relay: John Mark, a British track and field sprinter and student at the University of Cambridge with impressive Olympian good looks. Mark ran a lap of the track – created with cinders from the domestic coal fires of Leicester – and climbed the steps to the Olympic cauldron. After saluting the crowd, he turned and lit the flame. After more speeches, Donald Finlay of the British team (given his RAF rank of Wing Commander) took the Olympic Oath on behalf of all competitors. The National Anthem was sung and the massed athletes turned and marched out of the stadium, led by Greece, tailed by Britain.

The 580-page official report concluded:

:Thus were launched the Olympic Games of London, under the most happy auspices. The smooth-running Ceremony, which profoundly moved not only all who saw it but also the millions who were listening-in on the radio throughout the world, and the glorious weather in which it took place, combined to give birth to a spirit which was to permeate the whole of the following two weeks of thrilling and intensive sport.

==Television coverage==
The opening ceremony and over 60 hours of Games coverage was broadcast live on BBC television, which was then officially available only in the London area. However, the BBC&#x27;s transmissions could be received much further away in the right conditions, and some of the Games was watched by at least one viewer in the Channel Islands. The BBC&#x27;s official report on the coverage estimated that an average of half a million viewers watched each of their Olympic broadcasts. The BBC paid £1,000 for the broadcasting rights.

Of the live television coverage, only a small section of the opening ceremony broadcast still exists in the archives. However, various filmed reports shot for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Television Newsreel&quot; programme do also still exist.

==Sports==
The 1948 Summer Olympics featured 136 medal events, covering 23 disciplines in 17 different sports and in arts.

===Athletics===

Empire Stadium was the venue for 33 athletics events at the Games; 24 for men and nine for women. Of these, four were making their Olympic debut – the men&#x27;s 10 km walk, and the women&#x27;s 200 metres, long jump and shot put. A total of 754 athletes from 53 countries participated in athletics. Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands, a 30-year-old mother of two children nicknamed &quot;The Flying Housewife&quot;, won four gold medals, in the 100 metres, 200 metres, 80 metre high hurdles, and 4 x 100 metre relay. As world record holder in the long jump and high jump Blankers-Koen may have been able to win further medals but, at this time, female athletes were limited to three individual events. Duncan White won the first medal of any kind for Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) when he finished second in the 400 metre hurdles. Arthur Wint became the first Jamaican to win an Olympic gold medal, in the men&#x27;s 400 metres; he also won silver in the men&#x27;s 800 metres. Audrey Patterson became the first African-American woman to win a medal, winning bronze in a track and field event. A few days later Alice Coachman became the first woman of colour in the world and the first African-American woman to win a gold medal in track and field in the history of the modern Olympics with a jump of 1.68 m (5&#x27; 6&quot;). She also was the only American woman to win an athletics gold medal during the 1948 Olympics.

The marathon saw a dramatic finish with the first man to enter the stadium, Etienne Gailly of Belgium, exhausted and nearly unable to run. While he was struggling, Argentinian athlete Delfo Cabrera and Tom Richards of Great Britain passed him, with Cabrera winning the gold medal and Richards obtaining the silver. Gailly managed to recover enough to cross the line for the bronze.

The decathlon was won by 17-year-old Bob Mathias of the United States. He became the youngest ever Olympic gold medallist in athletics and when asked how he would celebrate he replied: &quot;I&#x27;ll start shaving, I guess.&quot;

===Arts===

Categories: sports-related architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. These Olympics were the last time art competitions were considered Olympic events.

===Basketball===

Basketball made its second appearance as a medal sport, appearing as an indoor competition for the first time after poor weather disrupted the matches at the 1936 Berlin Games. The event, for men only, was contested by 23 nations split into four pools for the preliminary round; the top two in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals with the other teams entering playoffs for the minor placings. The United States and France reached the final which was won by the Americans 65–21 to claim the gold medal. This was the second of the United States&#x27; seven consecutive gold medals in Olympic men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. Brazil defeated Mexico 52–47 to claim bronze.

===Boxing===

Eight different classifications were contested ranging from flyweight, for boxers weighing less than 51 kg, to heavyweight, for boxers over 80 kg. South Africa, Argentina and Hungary each won two gold medals.

===Canoeing===

Nine events were contested, eight for men and one for women. This marked the first time that a women&#x27;s canoeing event had been contested in the Olympics. Sweden won four gold medals (two by Gert Fredriksson) and Czechoslovakia three.

===Cycling===

Six events were contested – two road bicycle racing events and four track cycling events. No women&#x27;s cycling events were contested. France won three gold medals and Italy two, while Great Britain captured five medals overall, but none were gold.

===Diving===

Four diving events were contested, two for men, and two for women. The events are labelled as 3  metre springboard and 10  metre platform by the International Olympic Committee but appeared on the 1948 Official Report as &quot;springboard diving&quot; and &quot;highboard diving&quot;, respectively. All four gold medals, and 10 out of 12 awarded in total, were won by the United States. Victoria Manalo Draves, who won both gold medals in the women&#x27;s events, and Sammy Lee, who took a gold and a bronze in the men&#x27;s events, became the first Asian Americans to win gold medals at an Olympic Games.

===Equestrian===

Six gold medals were awarded in equestrian, individual and team dressage, individual and team eventing and individual and team show jumping. Harry Llewellyn and Foxhunter, who would claim a gold medal in Helsinki, won bronze in the team jumping event.

===Fencing===

Seven events were contested, six for men and one for women. Ilona Elek, who had won the women&#x27;s foil competition in Berlin, was one of only two competitors to successfully defend an Olympic title in London. Elek&#x27;s sister, Margit, placed sixth in the same event. Edoardo Mangiarotti won three medals, two silver and a bronze, having previously won a gold medal in the 1936 Games. Throughout his career the Italian won 13 Olympic fencing medals and 27 world championship medals, both of which remain records.

===Field hockey===

Thirteen nations participated in the field hockey competition. The tournament was ultimately won by India, who defeated Great Britain to claim the country&#x27;s first gold medal as an independent nation under captain Kishan Lal and Vice-Captain Kunwar Digvijay Singh.

===Football===

Eighteen teams entered the football competition at these Olympics. Due to the rise of the professional game during the 12 years since the Berlin Olympics the number of talented amateurs for teams to select from was reduced. The gold medal was won by Sweden, who defeated Yugoslavia 3–1 in the final. Denmark defeated hosts Great Britain, managed by Matt Busby of Manchester United, 5–3 to win the bronze medal. In the tournament&#x27;s 18 matches a total of 102 goals were scored; an average 5.66 goals per match. The joint top scorers with seven goals each were Gunnar Nordahl of Sweden and Denmark&#x27;s John Hansen. Nordahl and Swedish teammates Gunnar Gren and Nils Liedholm went on to play for A.C. Milan and together were nicknamed Gre-No-Li.

This was the first international football tournament ever to be broadcast on television, with the two semi-finals, the bronze medal match and the final all being shown live in full by the BBC.

===Gymnastics===

Nine events were contested, eight for men, and one for women. In the men&#x27;s pommel horse, a tie was declared between three competitors, all Finns, and no medals other than gold were awarded in this event. Finland won six gold medals overall, and Switzerland three.

===Lacrosse===

Lacrosse was an exhibition sport at these Olympics. An English team composed of players from various universities played a U.S. team represented by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the Empire Stadium.

===Modern pentathlon===
Only one modern pentathlon event was contested, the five component sports– riding, fencing, shooting, swimming, and running- being held over six days. Scoring was by point-for-place system across the five phases with the winner being the athlete with the lowest combined ranking. The sport&#x27;s international federation, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne was founded during the Games, on 3 August 1948. Sweden won two medals in the event; William Grut won the gold, with a final points total of 16, and Gösta Gärdin took bronze. American George Moore won the silver medal.

===Rowing===

Seven rowing events were contested, all open to men only. Great Britain and the United States each claimed two gold medals. The events were held on the River Thames at Henley, over the same course as the Henley Royal Regatta.

===Sailing===

The sailing events at the Games took place in Torquay, in the southwest of Great Britain. Five events were contested, with the United States winning four total medals. One of host nation Great Britain&#x27;s three gold medals at the Games came in the Swallow class from Stewart Morris and David Bond. In the Firefly class Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm won gold the despite the Danish Olympic Committee having misgivings about sending him to compete as the 18-year-old could speak no English. This was the first of four consecutive Olympics with a gold medal for Elvstrøm.

===Shooting===

Four events were contested, all open to both men and women, although all medals were won by men. In the 50 metre rifle, prone position, only two points separated the top three competitors. Károly Takács had been a member of the Hungary&#x27;s world champion pistol shooting team in 1938 when a grenade shattered his right hand – his pistol hand. Takács taught himself to shoot with his left hand and, 10 years after his injury, he won an Olympic gold medal in the rapid-fire pistol event.

===Swimming===

Eleven events were contested, six for men and five for women. The United States won eight gold medals, including all six men&#x27;s events, and 15 medals in total.

===Water polo===

Eighteen nations fielded a team in these games, which were ultimately won by Italy, who were undefeated throughout. The tournament was conducted in a mult-tier bracket, with the best four teams from the group stages participating in a final round-robin bracket. Silver was claimed by Hungary, and bronze by the Netherlands.

===Weightlifting===

Six events were contested, all for men only. These games marked the addition of the bantamweight class to the Olympic programme, the first change to the programme since 1920. The United States won four gold medals, and eight overall; the remaining two gold medals were claimed by Egypt. Rodney Wilkes won the first medal for Trinidad and Tobago in an Olympic games, winning silver and Mohammad Jafar Salmasi won the first medal for Iran in an Olympic games, winning bronze in the featherweight division; gold medal was won by Egyptian Mahmoud Fayad, with a new Olympic and World record of 332.5 kg.

===Wrestling===

Sixteen wrestling events were held, eight Greco-Roman and eight freestyle. All were open to men only. Both categories were dominated by two nations. Turkey was the most successful nation with six gold medals followed by Sweden receiving 5 gold medals. These two teams claimed 24 total medals, in other words half of the total medals given.

==Political defection==
London was the first Olympics to have a political defection. Marie Provazníková, the 57-year-old Czechoslovak President of the International Gymnastics Federation, refused to return home, citing &quot;lack of freedom&quot; after the Czechoslovak coup in February led to the country&#x27;s inclusion in the Soviet Bloc.

==Media==
For the 1948 Olympics, the Technicolor Corporation devised a bipack colour filming process – dubbed &quot;Technichrome&quot; – whereby hundreds of hours of film documented the events in colour, without having to use expensive and heavy Technicolor cameras.

Slightly over 2,000 journalists attended the 1948 Games.

== Venues ==

No new venues were built for the Games. A cinder track was laid inside Empire Stadium and all other venues were adapted. For the first time at the Olympics swimming events were held undercover, at the 8000 capacity Empire Pool. As the pool was longer than the standard Olympic length of 50 metres a platform was constructed across the pool which both shortened it and housed officials. In 2010 one of the last remaining venues from the Games, the Herne Hill Velodrome where cycling events were staged, was saved when a new 15-year lease was agreed meaning that repairs could take place. Campaigners and users of the track had feared that it would be forced to close as it was in desperate need of refurbishment.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
A total of 59 nations sent athletes. Thirteen made their first official appearance: British Guiana (now Guyana), Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Iraq, Jamaica, Korea, Lebanon, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It was the first time that Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, India and Pakistan competed as fully independent nations at the Olympic Games. Germany, and Japan, under Allied military occupations, were not allowed to send athletes to the games. Due to continuing labour shortages, German prisoners of war were used for the construction of the facilities for the games, in particular Olympic Way. Italy, although originally an Axis power, defected to the Allies in 1943 following Benito Mussolini being deposed, and was allowed to send athletes. The Soviet Union was invited but they chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics.
The nations that returned to the games were Cuba, Iran (The last participation of a Persian athlete was in Paris 1900), Ireland, Panama and Spain.

Other nations, besides Germany and Japan, that participated in the previous games in Berlin 1936 but were absent in London 1948 were Bolivia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the case of the Baltic nations, they had been annexed by the Soviet Union, only returning to the games many decades later.

Athletes from Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States, competed for the United States team. Bermuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and British Guyana were part of the British Empire.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees (by highest to lowest)===
==Medal count==


These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1948 Summer Games, ranked by number of gold medals won. The host nation was 12th, with 23 medals, including three golds.

<text>Charles Monroe &quot;Sparky&quot; Schulz ( ; November 26, 1922 – February 12, 2000) was an American cartoonist, the creator of the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; which features his two best-known characters, Charlie Brown and Snoopy. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential cartoonists in history, and cited by many cartoonists as a major influence, including Jim Davis, Murray Ball, Bill Watterson, Matt Groening, and Dav Pilkey.

&quot;&quot;Peanuts&quot; pretty much defines the modern comic strip&quot;, said Bill Watterson, &quot;so even now it&#x27;s hard to see it with fresh eyes. The clean, minimalist drawings, the sarcastic humor, the unflinching emotional honesty, the inner thoughts of a household pet, the serious treatment of children, the wild fantasies, the merchandising on an enormous scalein countless ways, Schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Charles Monroe Schulz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 26, 1922, and grew up in Saint Paul. He was the only child of Carl Fred Schulz and Dena Halverson, and was of German and Norwegian descent. His uncle called him &quot;Sparky&quot; after the horse Spark Plug in Billy DeBeck&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Barney Google&quot;, which Schulz enjoyed reading.

Schulz attended Richards Gordon Elementary School in Saint Paul, where he skipped two half-grades. He became a shy, timid teenager, perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at Central High School.

Schulz loved drawing and sometimes drew his family dog, Spike, who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Schulz drew a picture of Spike and sent it to &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;; his drawing appeared in Robert Ripley&#x27;s syndicated panel, captioned, &quot;A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn.&quot; and &quot;Drawn by &#x27;Sparky&#x27;&quot;.

Another noteworthy episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook, which he referred to in &quot;Peanuts&quot; years later, when he had Lucy ask Charlie Brown to sign a picture he drew of a horse, only to then say it was a prank. A five-foot-tall statue of Snoopy was placed in the school&#x27;s main office 60 years later.

==Military service and post-war positions==

In February 1943, Schulz&#x27;s mother Dena died after a long illness. At the time of her death, he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer. Schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death had a significant effect on him.

Around the same time, Schulz was drafted into the United States Army. He served as a staff sergeant with the 20th Armored Division in Europe during World War II, as a squad leader on a .50 caliber machine gun team. His unit saw combat only at the very end of the war. Schulz said he had only one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it, and that the German soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered. Years later, Schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service. For being under fire he did receive the Combat Infantry Badge, of which he was very proud.

In late 1945, Schulz returned to Minnesota, where he did lettering for a Roman Catholic comic magazine, &quot;Timeless Topix.&quot; Before he was drafted, Schulz had taken a correspondence course from the school Art Instruction, Inc., and in July 1946 took a job at the school, where he reviewed and graded students&#x27; work. He worked at the school for several years as he developed his career as a comic creator.

==Career==
The anti-Communist propaganda comic book &quot;Is This Tomorrow&quot; featured some of Schulz&#x27;s early work.
Schulz&#x27;s first group of regular cartoons, a weekly series of one-panel jokes called &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;, was published from June 1947 to January 1950 in the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press,&quot; with Schulz usually doing four one-panel drawings per issue. It was in &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; that Schulz first used the name Charlie Brown for a character, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In May 1948, Schulz sold his first one-panel drawing to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;; within the next two years, a total of 17 untitled drawings by Schulz were published in the &quot;Post&quot;, simultaneously with his work for the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot;. Around the same time, he tried to have &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association; Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; was dropped from the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; in January 1950.

Later that year, Schulz approached United Feature Syndicate with the one-panel series &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;, and the syndicate became interested. By that time Schulz had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one, and to Schulz&#x27;s delight, the syndicate preferred that version. But to his consternation, the syndicate had to change the title for Schulz&#x27;s strip for legal reasons and selected a new name, &quot;Peanuts&quot;.

&quot;Peanuts&quot; made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, &quot;Peanuts&quot; eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Schulz also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Game&quot; (1957–59), but he abandoned it after the success of &quot;Peanuts&quot;. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a gag cartoon, &quot;Young Pillars&quot;, featuring teenagers, to &quot;Youth&quot;, a publication associated with the Church of God.

In 1957 and 1961 he illustrated two volumes of Art Linkletter&#x27;s &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;, and in 1964 a collection of letters, &quot;Dear President Johnson&quot;, by Bill Adler.

===&quot;Peanuts&quot;===

At its height, &quot;Peanuts&quot; was published daily in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, in 21 languages. Over nearly 50 years, Schulz drew 17,897 published &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips. The strips, plus merchandise and product endorsements, produced revenues of more than $1 billion per year, with Schulz earning an estimated $30 million to $40 million annually. During the strip&#x27;s run, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break in late 1997 to celebrate his 75th birthday; reruns of the strip ran during his vacation, the only time that occurred during Schulz&#x27;s life.

The first collection of &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips was published in July 1952 by Rinehart &amp; Company. Many more books followed, greatly contributing to the strip&#x27;s increasing popularity. In 2004, Fantagraphics began their &quot;Complete Peanuts&quot; series. &quot;Peanuts&quot; also proved popular in other media; the first animated TV special, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, aired in December 1965 and won an Emmy award. Numerous TV specials followed, the latest being &quot;Snoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin&quot; in 2024. Until his death, Schulz wrote or co-wrote the TV specials and carefully oversaw their production.
Charlie Brown, the principal character of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, was named after a co-worker at Art Instruction Inc. Schulz drew much from his own life, some examples being:
* Like Charlie Brown&#x27;s parents, Schulz&#x27;s father was a barber and his mother a housewife.
* Like Charlie Brown, Schulz had often felt shy and withdrawn. In an interview with Charlie Rose in May 1997, Schulz observed, &quot;I suppose there&#x27;s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists, because cartooning, like all other humor, comes from bad things happening.&quot;
* Schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy. Although this dog was a pointer, not a beagle like Snoopy, family photos confirm a certain physical resemblance.
* References to Snoopy&#x27;s brother Spike living outside of Needles, California, were influenced by the few years (1928–30) the Schulz family lived there; they moved to Needles to join other family members who had relocated from Minnesota to tend to an ill cousin.
* Schulz&#x27;s inspiration for Charlie Brown&#x27;s unrequited love for the Little Red-Haired Girl was Donna Mae Johnson, an Art Instruction Inc. accountant with whom he fell in love. When Schulz finally proposed to her in June 1950, shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate, she turned him down and married another man.
* Linus and Shermy were named for his good friends Linus Maurer and Sherman Plepler, respectively.
* Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of his cousins on his mother&#x27;s side. Schulz devised the character&#x27;s name when he saw peppermint candies in his house.
* Sally calls Linus her &quot;Sweet Babboo.&quot; The term of endearment was inspired by a phrase Jean Schulz used for her husband, &quot;I called him, &#x27;Sweet Babboo&#x27; and instead of saying, &#x27;O, that&#x27;s clever, I think I&#x27;ll use that,&#x27; it just showed up six weeks later in the comic strip!&quot;

===Influences===
The Charles M. Schulz Museum counts Milton Caniff (&quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;) and Bill Mauldin as key influences on Schulz&#x27;s work. In his own strip, Schulz regularly described Snoopy&#x27;s annual Veterans Day visits with Mauldin, including mention of Mauldin&#x27;s World War II cartoons. Schulz also credited George Herriman (&quot;Krazy Kat&quot;), Roy Crane (&quot;Wash Tubbs&quot;), Elzie C. Segar (&quot;Thimble Theatre&quot;) and Percy Crosby (&quot;Skippy&quot;) as influences. In a 1994 address to fellow cartoonists, Schulz discussed several of them. But according to his biographer Rheta Grimsley Johnson:

According to the museum, Schulz watched the movie &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; 40 times. The character Lucy van Pelt also expresses a fondness for the film, and in one strip, she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother.

According to the biography &quot;Schulz and Peanuts&quot; by David Michaelis, Schulz considered Jim Davis his greatest rival in the field. Schulz disliked Davis&#x27;s low, broad-appeal approach to his work and was somewhat jealous when Davis&#x27;s &quot;Garfield&quot; eclipsed &quot;Peanuts&quot; in popularity; in spite of this, Schulz frequently provided advice to the younger Davis, particularly in the realms of merchandising and franchising, by using the strategy he had developed for Snoopy and allowing Davis to develop it further for Garfield. Davis considered Schulz a valuable mentor. Davis credits Schulz with redesigning Garfield in his modern form; while Schulz and Davis were each working on their respective &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Garfield&quot; television specials in adjacent rooms, Davis was struggling to work Garfield&#x27;s obese, quadrupedal physique into physical gags and asked Schulz for ideas, to which Schulz sketched out a redesign—bipedal and pot-bellied but slimmer—that Davis has used in its basic form ever since.

==Personal life==

In April 1951, Schulz married Joyce Halverson, who was not related to his mother Dena Halverson Schulz. He also adopted Halverson&#x27;s daughter, Meredith Hodges. Later the same year, they moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. Their son, Monte, was born in February 1952, and three more children, Craig, Amy and Jill, were born later in Minnesota.

Schulz and his family moved to Minneapolis and stayed until 1958. They then moved to Sebastopol, California, where Schulz built his first studio. Until then, he had worked at home or in a small rented office room. It was there that Schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary, &quot;Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz&quot;. Schulz&#x27;s father died while visiting him in 1966, the same year Schulz&#x27;s Sebastopol studio burned down. By 1969, Schulz had moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he lived and worked until his death. While briefly living in Colorado Springs, Schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his daughter Meredith, featuring Patty with a balloon, Charlie Brown jumping over a candlestick, and Snoopy playing on all fours. The wall was removed in 2001, and donated and relocated to the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa.

By Thanksgiving of 1970, it was clear that Schulz&#x27;s marriage was in trouble, and they divorced in 1972. He married Jean Forsyth Clyde in September 1973, whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink. They were married for 27 years, until Schulz&#x27;s death in 2000.

Schulz&#x27;s son Craig has served as President of the Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates licensing company, and has had a prominent role in modern Peanuts adaptations, including &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;. Schulz&#x27;s daughter Jill starred in the 1988 live action and animation hybrid Peanuts special &quot;It&#x27;s the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown&quot;.

===Kidnapping attempt===
On May 8, 1988, two gunmen in ski masks entered the Schulzes&#x27; home through an unlocked door, planning to kidnap Jean, but the attempt failed when Charles&#x27; daughter Jill drove up to the house, prompting the would-be kidnappers to flee. Jill called the police from a neighbor&#x27;s house. Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said, &quot;It was obviously an attempted kidnap-ransom. This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the victims were.&quot; Neither Schulz nor his wife were hurt during the incident.

===Sports===

Schulz had a long association with ice sports, and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons. In Santa Rosa, he owned the Redwood Empire Ice Arena, which opened in 1969 and featured a snack bar called &quot;The Warm Puppy&quot;. Schulz&#x27;s daughter Amy served as a model for the figure skating in the television special &quot;She&#x27;s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown&quot; (1980). Schulz also was very active in senior ice-hockey tournaments; in 1975, he formed Snoopy&#x27;s Senior World Hockey Tournament at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena, and in 1981, he was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to the sport of hockey in the United States. Schulz also enjoyed golf and was a member of the Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club from 1959 to 2000.

In 1998, Schulz hosted the first Over-75 Hockey Tournament. In 2000, the Ramsey County Board in St. Paul, Minnesota, voted to rename the Highland Park Ice Arena the Charles M. Schulz–Highland Arena in his honor.

Schulz also used his hockey rink for tennis exhibitions after meeting Billie Jean King. Many tennis pros played in the rink, including Roy Emerson.

===Art===
In addition to comics, Schulz was interested in art in general; his favorite artist in his later years was Andrew Wyeth. As a young adult, Schulz also developed a passion for classical music. Although the piano-playing character Schroeder in &quot;Peanuts&quot; adored Beethoven, Schulz&#x27;s personal favorite composer was Brahms. He had a strong personal respect for Murray Ball, creator of Footrot Flats; the two men influenced each other throughout their careers.

===Religion===
According to a 2015 &quot;spiritual biography&quot;, Schulz&#x27;s faith was complex and personal. He often touched on religious themes in his work, including in the classic television cartoon &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (1965), which features Linus quoting in the King James Version of the Bible to explain &quot;what Christmas is all about.&quot; In interviews, Schulz said that Linus represented his spiritual side, and the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references.

Brought up in a nominally Lutheran family, Schulz was active in the Church of God as a young adult and later taught Sunday school at a United Methodist Church. In the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in &quot;Peanuts&quot; as consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations in his lectures on the Gospel, as explained in his book &quot;The Gospel According to Peanuts&quot;, the first of several he wrote on religion, &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and popular culture.

Schulz&#x27;s daughter, Amy, was drawn to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by a Latter-day Saint boyfriend. According to Amy, Schulz told her that the &quot;church is either true or it&#x27;s a hoax. And I think it&#x27;s a hoax.&quot; Although Schulz was disenchanted by Mormonism and his daughter&#x27;s conversion, he continued to support her and, according to Amy, told her that he appreciated the bond between the two of them created by her belief &quot;in Christ and the scriptures.&quot;

From the late 1980s, Schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a &quot;secular humanist&quot; but that he did not know one way or the other:

In 2013, Schulz&#x27;s widow said:

===Failing health and retirement===

In July 1981, Schulz underwent heart bypass surgery. During his hospital stay, President Ronald Reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery.

In the 1980s, Schulz complained that &quot;sometimes my hand shakes so much I have to hold my wrist to draw.&quot; This led to an erroneous impression that Schulz had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. According to a letter from his physician, placed in the Archives of the Charles M. Schulz Museum by his widow, Schulz had essential tremor, a condition alleviated by beta blockers. Schulz still insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself, resulting in noticeably shakier lines over time.

In November 1999, Schulz suffered several small strokes and a blocked aorta, and he was later found to have colon cancer that had metastasized. Because of the chemotherapy and because he could not see clearly, he announced his retirement on December 14, 1999. The decision was difficult for Schulz, who told Al Roker on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;I never dreamed that this was what would happen to me. I always had the feeling that I would probably stay with the strip until I was in my early eighties. But all of a sudden it&#x27;s gone. It&#x27;s been taken away from me. I did not take this away from me.&quot;

Schulz was asked if, in his final &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football after so many decades (one of the many recurring themes in &quot;Peanuts&quot; was Charlie Brown&#x27;s attempts to kick a football while Lucy was holding it, only to have Lucy pull it back at the last moment, causing him to fall on his back). His response, &quot;Oh, no. Definitely not. I couldn&#x27;t have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century.&quot; But in a December 1999 interview, holding back tears, Schulz recounted the moment when he signed his final strip, saying, &quot;All of a sudden I thought, &#x27;You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick—he never had a chance to kick the football.&#x27;&quot;

==Death==

On February 12, 2000, Schulz died in his sleep of a heart attack at his home in Santa Rosa, California, at the age of 77. He was suffering from colorectal cancer. The last original &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip was published the following day. He had predicted that the strip would outlive him because the strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication. Schulz was buried at Pleasant Hills Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.

Schulz was honored on May 27, 2000, by cartoonists of more than 100 comic strips, who paid homage to him and &quot;Peanuts&quot; by incorporating his characters into their strips that day. 
While United Features retained ownership of the strip, Schulz requested that the syndicator allow no other artist to draw &quot;Peanuts&quot;. United Features honored his wishes, instead syndicating reruns. Because Schulz considered other media separate from the strip, new television specials and comic books with the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters have been made since his death.

==Awards==

Schulz received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Humor Comic Strip Award in 1962 for &quot;Peanuts&quot; and the Society&#x27;s Elzie Segar Award in 1980; he was the first two-time winner of their Reuben Award (for 1955 and 1964) and the winner of their Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. He was also an avid hockey fan; in 1981, Schulz was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to the sport of hockey in the United States, and he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993.

In 1988, Schulz received the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America, for his service to American youth. On June 28, 1996, Schulz was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, adjacent to Walt Disney&#x27;s. A replica of this star appears outside his former studio in Santa Rosa. On November 2, 2015, Snoopy was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On January 1, 1974, Schulz served as the Grand Marshal of the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. This led to the only &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip in which he made any reference to himself: Lucy was watching the parade, and told Linus that the Grand Marshal was somebody &quot;you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;. The same year, he received the Inkpot Award. In 1980, Schulz received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, presented by Awards Council member Judge John Sirica.

Schulz was a keen bridge player, and &quot;Peanuts&quot; occasionally included bridge references. In 1997, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) awarded both Snoopy and Woodstock the honorary rank of Life Master, and Schulz was delighted.
On February 10, 2000, two days before Schulz&#x27;s death, Congressman Mike Thompson introduced H.R. 3642, a bill to award Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor the United States legislature can bestow. The bill passed the House (with only Ron Paul voting no and 24 not voting) on February 15, and the bill was sent to the Senate, where it passed unanimously on May 2. The Senate also considered a related bill, S.2060 (introduced by Dianne Feinstein). President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on June 20, 2000. On June 7, 2001, Schulz&#x27;s widow Jean accepted the award on behalf of her late husband in a public ceremony.

Schulz was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2007.

Schulz was the inaugural recipient of The Harvey Kurtzman Hall of Fame Award, accepted by Karen Johnson, Director of the Charles M. Schulz Museum, at the 2014 Harvey Awards, held at the Baltimore Comic Convention in Baltimore, Maryland.

The U.S. Postal Service commemorated the 100th anniversary of Schulz&#x27;s birth with postage stamps honoring him &quot;alongside his beloved characters&quot;.

==Military awards and decorations==
==Biographies==
Multiple biographies have been written about Schulz, including Rheta Grimsley Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz&quot; (1989), which Schulz authorized.

The lengthiest biography, &quot;Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography&quot; (2007) by David Michaelis, has been heavily criticized by the Schulz family; Schulz&#x27;s son Monte stated it has &quot;a number of factual errors throughout  ... [including] factual errors of interpretation&quot;, and he extensively documents these errors in a number of essays. However, Michaelis maintains that there is &quot;no question&quot; his work is accurate. Although cartoonist Bill Watterson (creator of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;) feels the biography does justice to Schulz&#x27;s legacy, while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips, cartoonist and critic R.C. Harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing Schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling Michaelis&#x27; stated aim of &quot;understanding how Charles Schulz knew the world&quot;. Harvey believes that Michaelis‘ biography inductively bends the facts to a thesis rather than logically deducing a thesis from the facts. Dan Shanahan&#x27;s review, in the &quot;American Book Review&quot; (vol 29, no. 6), of Michaelis&#x27; biography faults the biography not for factual errors, but for &quot;a predisposition&quot; to finding problems in Schulz&#x27;s life to explain his art, regardless of how little the material lends itself to Michaelis&#x27; interpretations. Shanahan cites, in particular, such things as Michaelis&#x27; crude characterizations of Schulz&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family, and &quot;an almost voyeuristic quality&quot; to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of Schulz&#x27;s first marriage.

In light of Michaelis&#x27; biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of Charles Schulz&#x27;s personality, responses from Schulz&#x27;s family reveal some intimate details about Schulz&#x27;s persona beyond that of a mere artist.

In August 2023, &quot;Peanuts&quot; fans Luca Debus and Francesco Matteuzzi wrote and illustrated &quot;Funny Things: A Comic Strip Biography of Charles M. Schulz&quot;. In panels styled after his famous work, Schulz himself narrates the story of his own life, beginning with his childhood and going over the years as he grows up, fights in WWII, becomes a cartoonist, creates the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise, forms and loses relationships with family and friends alike, and comes to terms with his terminal diagnosis.

==Legacy==
A proponent of crewed spaceflight, Schulz was honored with the naming of Apollo 10 command module &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; and lunar module &quot;Snoopy&quot;, which launched on May 18, 1969. The Silver Snoopy award is given to NASA employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success. The award certificate states that it is in appreciation for &quot;professionalism, dedication and outstanding support that greatly enhanced space flight safety and mission success&quot;.

On July 1, 1983, Camp Snoopy opened at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm; it is a forested, mountain-themed area featuring the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters. It has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park. Since, similar Camp Snoopy and Planet Snoopy areas have opened at several Six Flags parks.

When the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, opened in 1992, its amusement park had a &quot;Peanuts&quot; theme, which was replaced by Nickelodeon Universe in 2006, when the mall lost the rights to use the characters.

The Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center at Sonoma State University opened in 2000 and now stands as one of the largest buildings in the California State University system, as well as in all of California, with a 400,000-volume general collection and a 750,000-volume automated retrieval system capacity. The $41.5 million building was named after Schulz, and his wife donated the $5 million needed to build and furnish the structure.

In 2000, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the county airport the Charles M. Schulz–Sonoma County Airport. The airport&#x27;s logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse.

Peanuts on Parade has been St. Paul, Minnesota&#x27;s tribute to its favorite native cartoonist. It began in 2000 with the placing of 101 statues of Snoopy throughout the city of St. Paul. Every summer for the following four years, statues of a different &quot;Peanuts&quot; character were placed on the sidewalks of St. Paul: &quot;Charlie Brown Around Town&quot; (2001), &quot;Looking for Lucy&quot; (2002), &quot;Linus Blankets St. Paul (2003)&quot; and Snoopy lying on his doghouse (2004). The statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer, so some remain around the city, but others have been relocated. The auction proceeds were used for artist&#x27;s scholarships and for permanent bronze statues of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters, which are in Landmark Plaza and Rice Park in downtown St. Paul.

The Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa opened in August 2002, two blocks away from his former studio, celebrating his life&#x27;s work and the art of cartooning. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

Santa Rosa, California, celebrated the 55th anniversary of the strip in 2005 by continuing the Peanuts on Parade tradition, beginning with &quot;It&#x27;s Your Town, Charlie Brown&quot; (2005), &quot;Summer of Woodstock&quot; (2006), &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Joe Cool Summer&quot; (2007), and &quot;Look Out For Lucy&quot; (2008).

In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Schulz as the third-highest-earning deceased celebrity, for he had earned $35 million in the previous year. In 2009, he was ranked sixth. According to Tod Benoit, Schulz&#x27;s income during his lifetime totaled more than $1.1 billion.

Schulz&#x27;s Santa Rosa home was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire, one of the October 2017 wildfires in California.

In 2019, Apple TV+ created a TV series titled &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, imagining what would have happened if the Russians had landed on the moon first. In later episodes, an American base is established on the moon, and the latest astronaut to arrive at the station is given a badge featuring Linus with the camp blanket and is known as Linus until a new member arrives.

On November 26, 2022, over 75 syndicated cartoonists throughout the United States honored Schulz on what would have been his 100th birthday.

In October 2023, &quot;Mutts&quot; creator Patrick McDonnell wrote a story line where the character Guard Dog was freed from being tethered after many years. Guard Dog was renamed Sparky, in honor of Schulz.

<text>Peanuts (briefly subtitled featuring Good ol&#x27; Charlie Brown) is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz. The strip&#x27;s original run extended from 1950 to 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. &quot;Peanuts&quot; is among the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with 17,897 strips published in all, making it &quot;arguably the longest story ever told by one human being&quot;. At the time of Schulz&#x27;s death in 2000, &quot;Peanuts&quot; ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of roughly 355 million across 75 countries, and had been translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States, and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion. In 2015, a movie adaptation was released by Blue Sky Studios.

&quot;Peanuts&quot; focuses on a social circle of young children, where adults exist but are rarely seen or heard. The main character, Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite, win a baseball game, or kick a football held by his irascible friend Lucy, who always pulls it away at the last instant. &quot;Peanuts&quot; is a literate strip with philosophical, psychological, and sociological overtones, which was innovative in the 1950s. Its humor is psychologically complex and driven by the characters&#x27; interactions and relationships. The comic strip has been adapted in animation and theater.

Schulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, including the lettering and coloring process.

==Title==

&quot;Peanuts&quot; had its origin in &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;, a weekly panel cartoon that appeared in Schulz&#x27;s hometown newspaper, the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, from 1947 to 1950. Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to &quot;Peanuts&quot;. The name &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.

Schulz submitted his &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; cartoons to United Features Syndicate (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in New York City and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip. When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as &quot;Li&#x27;l Folk&quot;, Tack Knight, who authored the retired 1930s comic strip &quot;Little Folks&quot;, sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of &quot;Little&quot; to &quot;Li&#x27;l&quot; was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that &quot;Little Folks&quot; was a registered trademark. Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the &quot;Peanut Gallery&quot;, and were referred to as &quot;Peanuts&quot;. This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.

Schulz hated the title &quot;Peanuts&quot;, which remained a source of irritation to him throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and he said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named &quot;Peanuts&quot;. On the day it was syndicated, Schulz&#x27;s friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried &quot;Peanuts&quot;, to which the newsdealer replied, &quot;No, and we don&#x27;t have any with popcorn either&quot;, which confirmed Schulz&#x27;s fears concerning the title. Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say, &quot;I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog&quot;. In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; on multiple occasions in the past but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.

==History==
===1950s===

The strip began as a daily strip on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers: the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot;, a hometown newspaper of Schulz (page 37, along with a short article); &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;; &quot;The Denver Post&quot;; &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;; and two newspapers in Pennsylvania, &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; (Allentown) and &quot;Globe-Times&quot; (Bethlehem). The first strip was four panels long and showed Charlie Brown walking by two other young children, Shermy and Patty. Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4. Its first Sunday strip appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), &quot;Peppermint&quot; Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968), Woodstock (introduced March 1966, officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).

Schulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz&#x27;s frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing &quot;its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.&quot; Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: &quot;This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business.&quot;

While the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown&#x27;s famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or rugby football. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. 

===1960s===
The 1960s is generally considered to be the &quot;golden age&quot; for &quot;Peanuts&quot;. During this period, some of the strip&#x27;s best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty, Snoopy as the &quot;World War One Flying Ace&quot;, Frieda and her &quot;naturally curly hair&quot;, and Franklin. &quot;Peanuts&quot; is remarkable for its deft social commentary, especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty&#x27;s athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin&#x27;s presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin&#x27;s creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz&#x27;s 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.) The fact that Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team had three girls on it was also at least ten years ahead of its time. The 1966 prime time television special &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot; dealt with Charlie Brown refusing sponsorship of his team on the condition he fire the girls and Snoopy, because the league does not allow girls or dogs to play.

Schulz threw satirical barbs at any number of topics when he chose. His child and animal characters satirized the adult world. Over the years he tackled everything from the Vietnam War to school dress codes to &quot;New Math&quot;. The May 20, 1962 strip featured an icon that stated &quot;Defend Freedom, Buy U.S. Savings Bonds.&quot; In 1963 he added a little boy named &quot;5&quot; to the cast, whose sisters were named &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4,&quot; and whose father had changed their family name to their ZIP Code, giving in to the way numbers were taking over people&#x27;s identities. Also in 1963, one strip showed Sally being secretive about school prayer, in reference to the Supreme Court decisions on it that year. In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2&#x27;s launch of Laika the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned Little Leagues and &quot;organized&quot; play when all the neighborhood kids join snowman-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.

&quot;Peanuts&quot; touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; from 1965, features the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible (Luke 2:8–14) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, many have interpreted Schulz&#x27;s work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.

During the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Jewish Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of Black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown&#x27;s beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam.

===1970s–1990s===
In 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips were formatted in a four-panel &quot;space saving&quot; format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on Leap Day in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.

In the late 1970s, during Schulz&#x27;s negotiations with United Feature Syndicate over a new contract, syndicate president William C. Payette hired superhero comic artist Al Plastino to draw a backlog of &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips to hold in reserve in case Schulz left the strip. When Schulz and the syndicate reached a successful agreement, United Media stored these unpublished strips, the existence of which eventually became public. Plastino himself also claimed to have ghostwritten for Schulz while Schulz underwent heart surgery in 1983.

In the 1980s and the 1990s, the strip remained the most popular comic in history, though other comics, such as &quot;Garfield&quot; and &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, rivaled &quot;Peanuts&quot; in popularity. Schulz continued to write the strip until announcing his retirement on December 14, 1999, due to his failing health.

===2000: End of &quot;Peanuts&quot;===

The last three &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips were run from Saturday, January 1, 2000, through Monday, January 3, 2000. The Saturday strip showed a snowball fight between Peppermint Patty and Marcie and Charlie Brown and Linus, with Snoopy sitting behind the fight trying to figure out how to throw a snowball. The strip was notable because, in addition to it being the last daily strip with a story, Schulz&#x27;s health had deteriorated to the point where the lettering in the strip had to be done by computer.

The Sunday strip featured the last appearances of Peppermint Patty and Marcie, with Peppermint Patty playing a game of football in the rain by herself. Marcie comes up, carrying an umbrella and remarking that everyone has gone home. Peppermint Patty laments that they never shook hands and said &quot;good game&quot;.

The January 3 strip consisted of a drawing of Snoopy sitting atop his doghouse with his typewriter, as he had done many times over the course of the strip&#x27;s lifespan. The drawing was accompanied by a printed note from Schulz which officially announced his retirement from drawing and thanking his readers for their support.

Although a series of reruns of older strips would begin on January 4, 2000, there were still six unpublished Sunday strips that Schulz had completed. The first of these ran on January 9, featuring Rerun and Snoopy playing in the snow. The second featured the last appearance of Woodstock, as he and Snoopy in one last fantasy sequence are called upon by George Washington to chop firewood. Rerun makes his final appearance in the fourth, trying to paint something other than flowers in art class, and Sally makes her last appearance in the fifth conversing with Charlie Brown about love letters.

The final &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, as shown here, ran on February 13, 2000, the night after Schulz died from a heart attack. It consisted of two small panels across the top and a large panel at the bottom. The title panel shows Charlie Brown talking to someone on the telephone, who is apparently asking to speak to Snoopy. Charlie Brown responds by telling the caller &quot;No, I think he&#x27;s writing&quot;. The second panel shows Snoopy sitting atop his doghouse typing on his typewriter as he had many times before, while the words &quot;Dear Friends…&quot; appeared above his head.

The larger panel at the bottom consisted of a larger scale drawing of the final daily strip, with Snoopy against a blue sky background. Above his head, several panels from past strips were overlaid. Underneath these panels, the full note that Schulz had written to his fans was printed (part of it had been omitted in the final daily strip). It read as follows:

Many other cartoonists paid tribute to &quot;Peanuts&quot; and Schulz by homages in their own strips, appearing on February 13, 2000, or in the week beforehand. The comic was reprinted the day after that, but only had the farewell letter. After &quot;Peanuts&quot; ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title &quot;Classic Peanuts&quot;. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.

&quot;Peanuts&quot; continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of &quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot;, the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and &quot;Peanuts Motion Comics&quot;. Additionally, BOOM! Studios has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips. One graphic novel, &quot;Scotland Bound, Charlie Brown&quot; adapts a cancelled Schulz and Melendez script.

In early 2011, United Media (the parent of United Feature Syndicate) struck a distribution deal with Universal Uclick (now known as Andrews McMeel Syndication) for syndication of the company&#x27;s 150 comic strip and news features, including &quot;Peanuts&quot;. On January 5, 2015, Universal Uclick&#x27;s website, GoComics, announced on that it would be launching &quot;Peanuts Begins&quot;, a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form. This was done to honor the 65th anniversary of the strip&#x27;s debut.

==Characters==


===Charlie Brown===
Charlie Brown is a young boy. He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip&#x27;s world and serving as an everyman. While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an inferiority complex. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully fly a kite. His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can be interpreted as either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable persistence. When he fails, however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity. The journalist Christopher Caldwell observed this tension between Charlie Brown&#x27;s negative and positive attitudes, stating: &quot;What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he&#x27;s not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth.&quot; Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at Art Instruction, whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.

Readers and critics have explored the question as to whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behavior of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz&#x27;s own life or childhood experiences. Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview, &quot;I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I&#x27;m really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.&quot; He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality. Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz&#x27;s &quot;wishy-washiness and determination&quot;. Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him. All in all, Charlie Brown is a purely wholesome character.

===Snoopy===
Snoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a beagle. While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts. Despite acting like a real dog some of the time, Snoopy possesses many different anthropomorphic traits. He frequently walks on his hind legs and is able to use tools, including his typewriter. He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through various alter egos. Many of these alter egos, such as a &quot;world-famous&quot; attorney, surgeon or secret agent were seen only once or twice. His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while on occasion being somewhat selfish. He has an arrogant commitment to his independence but is often shown to be dependent on humans. Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy&#x27;s life between that of a real dog and that of a fantastical character. While the interior of Snoopy&#x27;s small doghouse is described in the strip as having such things as a library and a pool table and being adorned with paintings of Wyeth and Van Gogh, it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of suspension of disbelief from readers.

===Linus and Lucy===
Linus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother, and Lucy is the older sister.

Lucy is bossy, selfish and opinionated, and she often delivers commentary in an honest albeit offensive and sarcastic way. Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but having the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth. He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters. Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and charges five cents for psychiatric advice to other characters (usually Charlie Brown) from her &quot;psychiatric booth&quot;, a booth parodying the setup of a lemonade stand. Lucy&#x27;s role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterized as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting that &quot;Lucy is very much the modern doctor&quot;.

Linus is Charlie Brown&#x27;s most loyal and uplifting friend and introduces intellectual, spiritual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, science, politics and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be &quot;very smart&quot; as well as &quot;dumb&quot;. He has a tendency of expressing lofty or pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked. He finds psychological security from thumb sucking and holding a blanket for comfort. The idea of his &quot;security blanket&quot; originated from Schulz&#x27;s own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus&#x27;s blanket as &quot;probably the single best thing that I ever thought of&quot;. He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase &quot;security blanket&quot; entered the dictionary.

===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===
Peppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends. They attend a different school than Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.

Peppermint Patty is a tomboy who is forthright and loyal and has what Schulz described as a &quot;devastating singleness of purpose&quot;. She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that her confusion serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepares for a &quot;skating&quot; competition, only to learn with disastrous results that it is for roller skating and not ice skating. She struggles at school and with her homework and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty&#x27;s single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.

Marcie is bookish and a good student. Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that &quot;she sees the truth in things&quot; (although she perpetually addresses Peppermint Patty as &quot;sir&quot;). The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as &quot;the unassuming one with sage-like insights&quot;.

In addition to the core cast, other characters appeared regularly for a majority of the strip&#x27;s duration:
* Sally Brown is the younger sister of Charlie Brown. She has a habit of fracturing the English language to comical effect. She reacts negatively to school and homework due to dealing with dogmatic memorization and obeying ambiguous instructions. She otherwise confidently delivers speeches in oral exams, using wordplay and puns while framing her topics with theatrics and suspense.
* Schroeder is a boy who is fanatic about Beethoven. Each year he celebrates Beethoven&#x27;s birthday, though on occasion he does forget and struggles to forgive himself. In this relatively innocent role, he serves as an outlet for the expressions of other characters. He most recognizably appears in the strip playing music on his toy piano, as the catcher on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team and the romantic foil to Lucy&#x27;s unrequited affections who is always after a kiss especially when it&#x27;s Beethoven&#x27;s birthday.
* Pig-Pen is a boy who is physically dirty, normally appearing with a cloud of dust surrounding him. Schulz acknowledged that the scope of his role is limited, but he continued to make appearances because of his popularity with readers.
* Franklin is an African American boy who first appeared at the suggestion of a reader following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Since it was Schulz&#x27;s intention to achieve this without being patronizing, he is a relatively normal character who mainly reacts to the oddness of other characters.
* Woodstock is a bird and Snoopy&#x27;s friend. He entirely communicates through peeps, which leaves it up to readers to guess what he says. Schulz said that Woodstock is aware that he is small and inconsequential, a role that serves as lighthearted existential commentary on coping with the much larger world.
* Spike is Snoopy&#x27;s brother who lives alone in the California desert.

Several early characters faded out of prominence during the strip&#x27;s run. For example Shermy, Patty and Violet were core characters during the initial years of the strip. By 1956, Patty and Violet&#x27;s roles were described only as an extension to Lucy&#x27;s, and Shermy, who was initially Charlie Brown&#x27;s closest friend, was then described merely as &quot;an extra little boy&quot;. In 1954, Schulz attempted to introduce Charlotte Braun, who was essentially a female version of Charlie Brown but with an excessively loud voice; poor reaction to her humorless personality led to Schulz &quot;killing her off&quot; in a tongue-in-cheek letter to a fan in 1955. Similarly Frieda, a girl with &quot;naturally curly hair&quot;, was introduced in 1962, but was already being phased out by the late 1960s after her comic value had seemed to have rapidly run its course; and after 1975, she made only background appearances. Conversely, Rerun, the youngest brother of Linus and Lucy, had only limited visibility after his introduction in 1973, but became a foreground character by the middle of the 1990s.

==Reception==
Schulz received the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award for &quot;Peanuts&quot; in 1962, the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the Elzie Segar Award in 1980, and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; won a Peabody Award and an Emmy; &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon specials have received a total of two Peabody Awards and four Emmys. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (as does Snoopy) and a place in the William Randolph Hearst Cartoon Hall of Fame. &quot;Peanuts&quot; was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article calling it &quot;the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.&quot;

The strip was declared second in a list of the &quot;greatest comics of the 20th century&quot; commissioned by &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; in 1999. The top-ranked comic was George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, a strip Schulz admired (and in fact was among his biggest inspirations), and he accepted the ranking in good grace, to the point of agreeing with it. In 2002 &quot;TV Guide&quot; declared Snoopy and Charlie Brown tied for 8th in its list of the &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot;, published to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

Schulz was included in the touring exhibition &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot;. His work was described as &quot;psychologically complex&quot;, and his style as &quot;perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.&quot;

Despite the widespread acclaim &quot;Peanuts&quot; has received, some critics have alleged a decline in quality in the later years of its run, as Schulz frequently digressed from the more cerebral socio-psychological themes that characterized his earlier work in favor of lighter, more whimsical fare. For example, in an essay published in the &quot;New York Press&quot; at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, &quot;Against Snoopy&quot;, Christopher Caldwell argued that Snoopy, and the strip&#x27;s increased focus on him in the 1970s, &quot;went from being the strip&#x27;s besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Among cartoonists===
Many cartoonists who came after Schulz have cited his work as an influence, including Lynn Johnston, Patrick McDonnell, and Cathy Guisewite, the latter of whom stated, &quot;A comic strip like mine would never have existed if Charles Schulz hadn&#x27;t paved the way&quot;.

The December 1997 issue of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; featured an extensive collection of testimonials to &quot;Peanuts.&quot; Over 40 cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz&#x27;s art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote, &quot;&quot;Peanuts&quot; was and still is for me a revelation. It&#x27;s mostly from &quot;Peanuts&quot; where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;. Schulz&#x27;s characters, the humor, the insight ... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel ...&quot; Tom Batiuk wrote: &quot;The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted.&quot; Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in &quot;Peanuts&quot;: &quot;Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.&quot;

Cartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz&#x27;s death in 2000 and are now displayed at the Charles Schulz Museum. On May 27, 2000, many cartoonists collaborated to include references to &quot;Peanuts&quot; in their strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz&#x27;s retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on October 30, 2005, several comic strips again included references to &quot;Peanuts&quot; and specifically the &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; television special. On November 26, 2022, several cartoonists included references to Peanuts and Charles Schulz in their strips to celebrate his 100th birthday.

===In broader culture===
Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in &quot;Peanuts&quot; as consistent with parts of Christian theology and used them as illustrations in his lectures on the gospel, as explained in his book &quot;The Gospel According to Peanuts&quot;, the first of several he wrote on religion, &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and popular culture.

Giant helium balloons of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Woodstock have been featured in the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City since 1968. This was referenced in a 2008 Super Bowl XLII commercial for Coca-Cola, in which the Charlie Brown balloon snags a Coca-Cola bottle from two battling balloons (Underdog and Stewie Griffin). The Snoopy balloon appeared outside the window of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s Central Park West apartment in a scene in the movie Maestro, released in 2023.

Snoopy has been the personal safety mascot for NASA astronauts since 1968, and NASA issues a Silver Snoopy award to its employees or contractors&#x27; employees who promote flight safety. The black-and-white communications cap carrying an audio headset worn since 1968 by the Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle astronauts was commonly referred to as a Snoopy cap.

The Apollo 10 lunar module&#x27;s call sign was &quot;Snoopy&quot;, and the command module&#x27;s call sign was &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;. While not included in the mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Charles Schulz drew an original picture of Charlie Brown in a spacesuit that was hidden aboard the craft to be found by the astronauts once they were in orbit. This drawing is now on display at the Kennedy Space Center.

The name of the Brazilian rock band Charlie Brown Jr., formed in 1992, is named after the character Charlie Brown. The idea came about when Chorão, the band&#x27;s lead singer, ran over a coconut water stand where there was an image of the character printed on the facade of the establishment.

&quot;Peanuts on Parade&quot; is St. Paul, Minnesota&#x27;s tribute to &quot;Peanuts&quot;. It began in 2000, with the placing of 101 statues of Snoopy throughout the city of Saint Paul. The statues were later auctioned at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2001, there was &quot;Charlie Brown Around Town&quot;, 2002 brought &quot;Looking for Lucy&quot;, and in 2003, &quot;Linus Blankets Saint Paul&quot;. Permanent bronze statues of the Peanuts characters are found in Landmark Plaza in downtown St. Paul.

Peanuts characters, and Charles Schulz have been recognized several times in U.S. commemorative postage stamps. A Peanuts World War I Flying Ace U.S. stamp was released on May 17, 2001. The value was 34 cents, first class. A Charlie Brown Christmas forever stamp was issued on Oct. 2, 2015. In 2022, the U.S. Postal Service commemorated the 100th anniversary of Schulz&#x27;s birth with postage stamps honoring him &quot;alongside his beloved characters&quot;.

In 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the Sonoma County Airport, located a few miles northwest of Santa Rosa, California, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport&#x27;s logo features Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace (goggles/scarf), taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse (the &quot;Sopwith Camel&quot;). A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

==Books==
The &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters have been featured in many books over the years. Some represented chronological reprints of the newspaper strip, while others were thematic collections such as &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Tennis Book&quot;, or collections of inspirational adages such as &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Puppy&quot;. Some single-story books were produced, such as &quot;Snoopy and the Red Baron.&quot; In addition, many of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.

The primary series of reprints was published by Rinehart &amp; Company (later Holt, Rinehart and Winston) beginning in 1952, with the release of a collection simply titled &quot;Peanuts&quot;. This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. Ballantine Books published the last original series of &quot;Peanuts&quot; reprints, including &quot;Peanuts 2000&quot;, which collected the final year of the strip&#x27;s run.

Coinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by Fawcett Publications. Drawing material from the main reprints, this paperback series began with &quot;The Wonderful World of Peanuts&quot; in 1962 and continued through &quot;Lead On, Snoopy&quot; in 1992.

Charles Schulz had always resisted republication of the earliest &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, which would end up with 17,897 strips in total, published chronologically in book form. In addition to the post-millennium &quot;Peanuts&quot; publications are BOOM! Studios restyling of the comics and activity books, and &quot;First Appearances&quot; series. Its content is produced by Peanuts Studio, subsequently an arm of Peanuts Worldwide LLC.

===&quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot;===

The entire run of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, covering nearly 50 years of comic strips, was reprinted in Fantagraphics&#x27; &quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot;, a 26-volume set published over a 12-year period, consisting of two years per volume published every May and October. The first volume (collecting strips from 1950 to 1952) was published in May 2004; the volume containing the final newspaper strips (including all the strips from 1999 and seven strips from 2000, along with the complete run of &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;) was published in May 2016, with a twenty-sixth volume containing outside-the-daily-strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; material by Schulz appeared in the fall of that year. A companion series, titled &quot;Peanuts Every Sunday&quot; and presenting the complete Sunday strips in color (as the main &quot;Complete Peanuts&quot; books reproduce them in black and white only), was launched in December 2013; this series will run ten volumes, with the last expected to be published in 2022.

In addition, almost all &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips are now also authoritatively available online at GoComics.com (there are some strips missing from the digital archive). &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips were previously featured on Comics.com.

===Anniversary books===
Several books have been released to commemorate key anniversaries of &quot;Peanuts&quot;:

==Adaptations==
===Animation===

The strip was first adapted into animation in &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot;. A TV documentary, &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; (1963), featured newly animated segments, but it did not air due to not being able to find a channel willing to broadcast it. It did, however, shape the team for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (1965), a half-hour Christmas special broadcast on CBS. It was met with extensive critical success. It was the first of a set of &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials (second counting the 1963 documentary), and forms a selection of holiday-themed specials which are aired annually in the US to the present day, including &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; (1966), and &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; (1973). The animated specials were significant to the cultural impact of &quot;Peanuts&quot;; by 1972, they were remarked as being &quot;among the most consistently popular television specials&quot; and &quot;regularly have been in the top 10 in the ratings&quot;. Many of the specials were acquired by Apple TV+ in 2020. The first feature-length film, &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, came in 1969, and was one of four which were produced before the comic strip ended. A Saturday morning television series aired in 1983, each episode consisting of three or four segments dealing with plot lines from the strip. An additional spin-off miniseries, &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot;, aired in 1988, exploring the history of the United States.

The characters continue to be adapted into animation after the comic strip ended in 2000, with the latest television special &quot;Welcome Home, Franklin&quot; made in 2024. A series of cartoon shorts premiered on iTunes in 2008, &quot;Peanuts Motion Comics&quot;, which directly lifted themes and plot lines from the strip. In 2014, the French network France 3 debuted &quot;Peanuts by Schulz&quot;, a series of episodes each consisting of several roughly one-minute shorts bundled together. The latest feature-length film, &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, was released in 2015 by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios. Two &quot;Peanuts&quot; Apple TV+ series, &quot;Snoopy in Space&quot; and &quot;The Snoopy Show&quot;, both premiered in 2019 and 2021, respectively. The characters also make a guest appearance in &quot;Mariah Carey&#x27;s Magical Christmas Special&quot; in 2020. On November 6, 2023, a new feature film from WildBrain (the company behind the Snoopy Webseries 2018-19) and Peanuts Worldwide was announced by Apple TV+. Production started in 2024.

===Music===
The album &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was recorded in 1965, the original soundtrack from the animated television special of the same name. It was performed by the jazz trio led by pianist Vince Guaraldi. It enjoys enduring critical, commercial, and cultural success; employing a sombre and whimsical style, songs such as &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot; evoke a muted and quiet melody, and arrangements such as the traditional carol &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; improvised in a light, off-center pace. The album has continued popularity to the present day; writer Chris Barton for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised it in 2013 as &quot;one of the most beloved holiday albums recorded&quot;, and Al Jazeera described it as &quot;one of the most popular Christmas albums of all time&quot;. The album was added to the national recording registry of the Library of Congress in 2012, being regarded as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot;.

The American rock band The Royal Guardsmen recorded four novelty songs from 1966 to 1968 as tributes to Snoopy. The first song was released as the single &quot;Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron&quot; (1966), based on the storyline of Snoopy sitting atop his dog house imagining himself as a World War I pilot, battling the German flying ace The Red Baron. The band would later release two more similar songs in 1967, &quot;Return of The Red Baron&quot; and &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. In 1968 they recorded &quot;Snoopy for President&quot;.

===Theater===
The characters first appeared in live stage production in 1967 with the musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, scored by Clark Gesner. It is a collection of musical sketches, where the characters explore their identities and discover the feelings they have for each other. The play was performed off-broadway, as well as later being performed as a live telecast on NBC. The play continued to have other professional performances, in the London West End, and later a Broadway revival, while also being a popular choice of musical by amateur theater groups such as schools.

A second musical premiered in 1975, &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot;, scored by Larry Grossman with lyrics by Hal Hackady. A sequel to &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Snoopy!&quot; is also a collection of musical sketches, though focused on Snoopy. It was first performed in San Francisco, and eventually off-Broadway for 152 performances.

&quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;Snoopy!!! The Musical&quot; were both further adapted as animated television specials, respectively, in 1985 and in 1988. Going in the opposite direction from animation to live production, is the 2016 &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, based on the animated television special of the same name. It is considered a generally faithful readaptation, although it features the additional characters Woodstock and Peppermint Patty who did not exist in the strip when the original was made.

==Licensing==
===Advertising and retail===
The characters from the comic have long been licensed for use on merchandise, the success of the comic strip helping to create a market for such items. In 1958, the Hungerford Plastics Corporation created a set of five vinyl dolls of the most famous characters (Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and Schroeder); they expanded this line in 1961 to make the dolls slightly larger and included Sally and Pig-Pen. An early example of the characters appearing in promotional material was strips and illustrations drawn by Schulz for the 1955 instructional booklet for the Kodak Brownie camera, &quot;The Brownie Book of Picture Taking&quot;. Another early campaign was on behalf of Ford Motor Company; magazine illustrations, brochure illustrations, and animated television spots featuring the characters were used to promote the Ford Falcon from January 1960 into 1964. Schulz credited the Ford campaign as the first time where licensing the characters earned &quot;a lot of money&quot;. However, he expressed a dislike of illustrating the adverts, describing it as &quot;hard work&quot; and would have preferred to dedicate equivalent effort to drawing the Sunday format strips.

Some licensing relationships were maintained long-term. Hallmark began printing greetings cards and party goods featuring the characters in 1960. In the late 1960s, Sanrio held the licensing rights in Japan for Snoopy. Sanrio is best known for Hello Kitty and its focus on the kawaii segment of the Japanese market. Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the MetLife insurance company, with the intention to make the business &quot;more friendly and approachable&quot;. Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing. In 2016, the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended. The relationship resumed in 2023 with Snoopy returning as a mascot for pet insurance.

In 1999, it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, Thermos bottles, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes. The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television, appearing on products such as Dolly Madison snack cakes, Chex Mix snacks, Bounty paper towels, Kraft macaroni cheese and A&amp;W Root Beer.

The sheer extent to which the characters are used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; pointed out that &quot;some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.&quot; Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating &quot;our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products&quot; while also adding &quot;Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we&#x27;re overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it&quot;.

===Games===
The Peanuts characters have appeared in several video games, such as &quot;Snoopy&quot; in 1984 by Radarsoft, &quot;Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game&quot; by The Edge, &quot;Snoopy and the Red Baron&quot; for the Atari 2600, &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Silly Sports Spectacular&quot; (1989, Nintendo Entertainment System), &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Magic Show&quot; (1990, Game Boy), &quot;Snoopy Tennis&quot; (2001, Game Boy Color), &quot;Snoopy Concert&quot; which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the Super NES, and in October 2006, a second game titled &quot;Snoopy vs. The Red Baron&quot; by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the &quot;Snoopy the Flying Ace&quot; mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Town Tale&quot; was launched for mobile by Pixowl, featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.

In 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the Funk &amp; Wagnalls publishing house also produced a children&#x27;s encyclopedia called the &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s &#x27;Cyclopedia&quot;. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.

In April 2002, The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly board game was released by USAopoly. The game was created by Justin Gage, a friend of Charles and Jeannie Schulz. Gage dedicated the game to Schulz in memory of his passing.

===Amusement parks===
In 1983, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters, creating the first Camp Snoopy area and making Snoopy the park&#x27;s mascot. Knott&#x27;s expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the Mall of America, called &quot;Knott&#x27;s Camp Snoopy&quot;. The Knott&#x27;s theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain Six Flags in 2024, which continued to operate &quot;Knott&#x27;s Camp Snoopy&quot; park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005. Six Flags had already licensed the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters for use in 1992 as an atmosphere, so its acquisition of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters.

Snoopy is currently one of the official mascots of the Six Flags parks. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Six Flags also operated a Camp Snoopy area at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom, Worlds of Fun, and Valleyfair featuring various &quot;Peanuts&quot;-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at Cedar Point, Carowinds, Kings Island, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and Michigan&#x27;s Adventure.

In 2008, Cedar Point introduced Planet Snoopy, a children&#x27;s area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children&#x27;s rides relocated from Cedar Point&#x27;s sister park Geauga Lake after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. In 2010, the Nickelodeon Central and Nickelodeon Universe areas in the former Paramount Parks (California&#x27;s Great America, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island) were replaced by Planet Snoopy. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to Valleyfair, Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom, and Worlds of Fun, replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. ″Carowinds″ Planet Snoopy was rethemed to Camp Snoopy.

Also, the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters can be found at Universal Studios Japan in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, and in the Snoopy&#x27;s World in Hong Kong.

===Exhibition===
An exhibition titled &quot;Good Grief, Charlie Brown! Celebrating Snoopy and the Enduring Power of Peanuts&quot; opened at Somerset House in London on 25 October 2018, running until 3 March 2019. The exhibition brought together Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s original Peanuts cartoons with work from a wide range of acclaimed contemporary artists and designers who have been inspired by the cartoon.

There is a trail called A Dog&#x27;s Trail Across Cardiff, Caerphilly and Porthcawl. The trail features Snoopy from Peanuts.

==Ownership==
On June 3, 2010, United Media sold all its Peanuts-related assets, including its strips and branding, to a new company, Peanuts Worldwide LLC, a joint venture of the Iconix Brand Group (which owned 80 percent) and Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates (20 percent). In addition, United Media sold its United Media Licensing arm, which represents licensing for its other properties, to Peanuts Worldwide. United Feature Syndicate continued to syndicate the strip, until February 27, 2011, when Universal Uclick took over syndication, ending United Media&#x27;s 60-plus-year stewardship of Peanuts.

In May 2017, Canada-based DHX Media (now WildBrain) announced that it would acquire Iconix&#x27;s entertainment brands, including the 80% stake of Peanuts Worldwide and full rights to the Strawberry Shortcake brand, for $345 million. DHX officially took control of the properties on June 30, 2017.

On May 13, 2018, DHX announced it had reached a strategic agreement in which Sony Music Entertainment Japan (whose consumer products division has been a licensing agent for the Peanuts brand since 2010) would acquire 49% of its 80% stake in Peanuts Worldwide for $185 million, with DHX holding a 41% stake and SMEJ owning 39%. The transaction was completed on July 23. Two months after the sale&#x27;s completion, DHX eliminated the rest of its debt by signing a five-year, multi-million-dollar agency agreement with CAA-GBG Global Brand Management Group (a brand management joint venture between Creative Artists Agency and Hong Kong-based Global Brands Group) to represent the Peanuts brand in China and the rest of Asia excluding Japan.

<text>Vincent Anthony Guaraldi (; né Dellaglio, July 17, 1928 – February 6, 1976) was an American jazz pianist best known for composing music for animated television adaptations of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. His compositions for this series included their signature melody &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; and the holiday standard &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;. Guaraldi is also known for his performances on piano as a member of Cal Tjader&#x27;s 1950s ensembles and for his own solo career. Guaraldi&#x27;s 1962 composition &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; became a radio hit and won a Grammy Award in 1963 for Best Original Jazz Composition. He died of a heart attack on February 6, 1976, at age 47, moments after concluding the first half of a nightclub performance in Menlo Park, California.

==Early life and career==

Vince Guaraldi was born in San Francisco’s North Beach, a neighborhood that later played a crucial role in his musical development. 

His surname changed to &quot;Guaraldi&quot; after his mother, Carmella (née Marcellino), divorced his biological father, Dellaglio, and remarried Tony Guaraldi, who adopted him. Influenced by his maternal uncles, Joe and Maurice &quot;Muzzy&quot; Marcellino—both prominent jazz bandleaders in San Francisco—Guaraldi cultivated an early passion for music. He graduated from Lincoln High School, briefly attended San Francisco State College, and served as a cook in the U.S. Army during the Korean War.

===Early career and first recordings=== 
Guaraldi&#x27;s first recording was an unreleased 1951 demo with Tom Hart. His official debut occurred in November of the same year with Cal Tjader’s Mambo Trio, featuring tracks such as &quot;Chopsticks Mambo&quot; and &quot;Lullaby of the Leaves&quot;, later released in 1953 on &quot;The Cal Tjader Trio&quot;. 

By mid-1954, he had formed his first trio with Eddie Duran (guitar) and Dean Reilly (double bass), performing regularly at the hungry i jazz club in San Francisco, often accompanying vocalist Faith Winthrop.

===Collaborations and early albums=== 
Guaraldi made his debut as a bandleader in August 1955 during a live session at the Black Hawk, where he recorded original compositions &quot;Ginza&quot; and &quot;Calling Dr. Funk&quot;. These tracks were included in &quot;Modern Music from San Francisco&quot;, released by Fantasy Records in March 1956. Impressed with his work, Fantasy offered Guaraldi an exclusive contract, leading to the release of his first album, &quot;Vince Guaraldi Trio&quot;, which featured Duran and Reilly but no drummer. Concurrently, he toured with Woody Herman&#x27;s Third Herd, delivering dynamic performances that contrasted with his more subdued recordings. 

Reuniting with Tjader in 1956, Guaraldi became a key member of two of the vibraphonist’s ensembles. The first, focused on straight-ahead jazz, featured Al Torre (drums), Eugene Wright (bass), and Luis Kant (percussion). The second, formed in 1958, incorporated Latin influences and included Al McKibbon (bass), Mongo Santamaría (congas), Willie Bobo (drums), and reed players Paul Horn and José &quot;Chombo&quot; Silva for select performances. 

Guaraldi recorded his second album, &quot;A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing&quot;, in April 1957, again with Duran and Reilly but without a drummer. Released in October 1957, the album struggled commercially, leading Fantasy Records to drop him.

==Mainstream success==
In early 1959, Guaraldi left his group to focus on solo projects. While he may have remained a respected yet minor jazz figure, his 1962 album &quot;Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus&quot; propelled him to prominence. Initially intended to complement covers of Antônio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá compositions, Guaraldi&#x27;s original piece, &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot;, unexpectedly gained traction when radio DJs favored it over its A-side, &quot;Samba de Orpheu&quot;. The song, a gentle and distinctive jazz instrumental, spent 19 weeks on the Top 100 chart, peaking at No. 22—an uncommon achievement for the genre. Guaraldi subsequently won the Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition.
He embraced its popularity, remarking, &quot;It&#x27;s like signing the back of a check,&quot; and when asked if he had &quot;sold out,&quot; he countered, &quot;I feel I bought in.&quot;

Capitalizing on this success, Fantasy Records released &quot;In Person&quot;, a live album recorded at The Trident in Sausalito, followed by &quot;Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends&quot;—a collaboration with guitarist Bola Sete. This partnership led Guaraldi to explore bossa nova and the electric piano, gaining further attention through an appearance on Ralph J. Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Casual&quot; and the subsequent release of &quot;From All Sides&quot; (1965). A live performance at El Matador in 1965 was later issued as &quot;Live at El Matador&quot; (1966). 

In 1964, Guaraldi experimented with Latin jazz and orchestral arrangements in &quot;The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi&quot;, enlisting arranger Jack Weeks. However, internal tensions arose, leading bassist Fred Marshall to depart after an alleged altercation at the 17th Berkeley Jazz Festival. Around this time, Guaraldi was commissioned to compose a jazz-infused mass for San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral. Incorporating Latin influences and waltz tempos, the performance was recorded on May 21, 1965, and released as &quot;At Grace Cathedral&quot;.

By 1965, tensions with Fantasy Records escalated when Guaraldi discovered he was receiving only five percent of record sales. He sued to sever ties, prompting a countersuit from Fantasy. In 1967, Fantasy was acquired by Saul Zaentz, leading both parties to drop their legal disputes, allowing Guaraldi to become an independent artist. However, decades later, in 2011, his children sued Fantasy’s parent company, Concord Music, alleging financial misrepresentation and unpaid royalties exceeding $2 million between 2005 and 2010. 

During this transitional period, Guaraldi launched his own label, D &amp; D Records, named after his children, David and Dia. In December 1967, he released his sole album under the imprint, &quot;Vince Guaraldi with the San Francisco Boys Chorus&quot;.

==Compositions for Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;==
===&quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;=== 
The genesis of Guaraldi&#x27;s association with the &quot;Peanuts&quot; frachise began in 1963 when television producer Lee Mendelson, searching for music for a planned &quot;Peanuts&quot; documentary titled &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, heard “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” on the radio. Recognizing its potential, Mendelson sought out Guaraldi, who enthusiastically accepted the offer to compose the documentary’s score. Soon after, Guaraldi excitedly played an untitled composition over the phone for Mendelson, unable to contain his excitement. That piece, &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;, would become the defining musical theme of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise. Reflecting on the moment, Mendelson remarked in 2008, &quot;It just blew me away. It was so right, and so perfect, for Charlie Brown and the other characters. I have no idea why, but I knew that song would affect my entire life. There was a sense, even before it was put to animation, that there was something very, very special about that music.&quot;

Although the documentary was never aired due to Mendelson’s inability to secure sponsorship, the music was recorded and released in 1964 as &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Encouraged by Guaraldi’s work, Mendelson and Schulz retained him for the upcoming &quot;Peanuts&quot; holiday special, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (1965). The soundtrack, recorded with the Vince Guaraldi Trio, featured enduring compositions such as &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;, &quot;Skating&quot;, &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot;, and &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;. Both the television special and its soundtrack were immensely successful, establishing Guaraldi as an integral part of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; legacy. 

Guaraldi historian Derrick Bang underscored Guaraldi’s impact, stating, &quot;Rarely has an entertainment icon been so quickly—and firmly—welded to a musical composition...Guaraldi defined the &quot;Peanuts&quot; sound, and it&#x27;s just as true today as it was in the 1960s. The compositions themselves are uniformly sparkling; it&#x27;s as if the jazz pianist and his trio were waiting for this precise inspiration&quot;. Mendelson concurred, highlighting Guaraldi&#x27;s jazz score as essential to &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;&#x27;s widespread appeal. &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that if we hadn&#x27;t had that Guaraldi score, we wouldn’t have had the franchise we later enjoyed.&quot; Despite Guaraldi&#x27;s inexperience in scoring and Mendelson’s documentary background, their shared affinity for jazz facilitated a meticulous, iterative process of reviewing and refining each cue—a method they applied across sixteen specials. While some material was repurposed or omitted, most of Guaraldi’s compositions remained integral to the final productions.

===&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;=== 
Following the unexpected success of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, the creative team produced another special, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot; (1966), which was also well received. With confidence in their ability to replicate their initial success, Schulz, Mendelson, and animator Bill Melendez set their sights on another holiday-themed special, &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; (1966). 

Guaraldi composed the score throughout the summer of 1966, advocating for &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; to become the franchise&#x27;s unofficial theme. Recognizing this oversight in &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot;, he ensured that the piece was featured prominently in &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;. Melendez responded by structuring the special&#x27;s opening sequence around a dialogue-free montage, accompanied solely by Guaraldi&#x27;s music. This version of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;, recorded with a sextet that included bassist Monty Budwig, drummer Colin Bailey, trumpeter Emmanuel Klein, guitarist John Gray, and flautist Ronnie Lang, became the definitive rendition of the piece and solidified its place as the &quot;Peanuts&quot; musical identity.

Guaraldi continued composing for &quot;Peanuts&quot;, scoring twelve additional animated television specials, as well as the feature film &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; and the documentary &quot;Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz&quot; (both 1969).

==Later years and artistic evolution== 
After nearly two years of navigating legal and contractual complexities to extricate himself from his agreement with Fantasy Records, Guaraldi signed with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1968. His first release under the new label, &quot;Oh Good Grief!&quot;, featured reimagined renditions of eight of his most popular &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions. His subsequent 1969 albums, &quot;The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi&quot; and &quot;Alma-Ville&quot;, marked a departure from his earlier work, incorporating jazz fusion, electric keyboards, and more avant-garde styles. However, these experimental efforts received mixed critical and commercial reception, leading Warner Bros.-Seven Arts to decline a contract renewal.

Following his work on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; feature film &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; and the release of &quot;Alma-Ville&quot;, Guaraldi was unable to secure a new recording contract. Frustrated by the industry&#x27;s lack of interest, he ceased releasing new material and redirected his focus toward live performances and television scoring. His later work blended jazz, rock, and funk, frequently featuring the Hammond B-3 and Fender Rhodes electric keyboards. His scores for &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; (1973) and &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown&quot; (1975) incorporated elements of funk and disco, reflecting the shifting musical trends of the era. He further expanded his sound with the use of Minimoog and ARP String Ensemble synthesizers. As rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll surged in the 1960s, leading to the decline of jazz clubs and job losses for many jazz musicians, Guaraldi adapted by incorporating electric keyboards into his style rather than resisting the changing musical landscape. Despite shifting musical trends, Guaraldi remained a respected figure in the Northern California jazz scene.

Financially secure from &quot;Peanuts&quot; royalties, Guaraldi chose to remain in Mill Valley, California, performing at local clubs rather than seeking broader fame. Mendelson recalled, &quot;Once the &quot;Peanuts&quot; music became famous, Vince could have gone out and done a whole lot more, but he was very provincial. He loved San Francisco, and he liked hanging out and playing at the local clubs.&quot;

==Death and impact==
Guaraldi passed away suddenly on February 6, 1976, at the age of 47, following a heart attack. The night before, he dined at Lee Mendelson&#x27;s home and complained of chest discomfort resembling indigestion. Guaraldi had recently consulted a doctor, who suspected a diaphragmatic hernia, and had also sought medical attention for persistent stomach issues. However, he was prescribed medication for ulcers and dismissed without further examination.

On the morning of February 6, Guaraldi awoke feeling unwell and remained in bed. That afternoon, he completed the recording for &quot;It&#x27;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&quot; at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco, alongside bassist Seward McCain and drummer Jim Zimmerman. Zimmerman recalled that although Guaraldi had recently been active, even skiing during a mountain concert trip, he began complaining of stomach pain once back in the studio.

That evening, after concluding the first set at Butterfield&#x27;s Nightclub in Menlo Park, California, with his interpretation of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, Guaraldi returned to his lodging at the adjacent Red Cottage Inn to rest before the next set. While in his room with Zimmerman, he collapsed while attempting to go to the bathroom. Despite efforts to revive him, he was pronounced dead on arrival at Stanford Hospital at 11:07 p.m. Reflecting on Guaraldi’s sudden passing, Zimmerman remarked in 2009, &quot;It is very romantic to think of someone going out just after they play. I wish he hadn&#x27;t.&quot; 

Friends and colleagues later speculated that Guaraldi’s persistent stomach pain may have been a sign of a more serious, undiagnosed condition. Guaraldi biographer Derrick Bang later suggested that an abdominal aortic aneurysm or another undetected ailment may have contributed to his fatal heart attack.

Guaraldi&#x27;s sudden passing deeply affected those who knew him. Mendelson described it as &quot;totally unexpected&quot; and recalled the emotional impact of hearing &quot;Peanuts&quot; music played at the funeral, as requested by Guaraldi&#x27;s mother, Carmella. &quot;It was not an easy day; he was so young,&quot; said Mendelson. &quot;It was one of the saddest days of my life.&quot; Animator Bill Melendez simply stated, &quot;He was a real good guy, and we miss him.&quot;

Drummer Mike Clark remembered being shocked by the news, as Guaraldi had always seemed full of energy and opportunity. &quot;I was in New York, and Vince Lateano told me. It was the last thing I could think of, that Guaraldi would die.&quot; Rev. Charles Gompertz, who had invited Guaraldi to perform at Grace Cathedral in 1965, reflected that Guaraldi never prioritized his health, often pushing himself to extremes both musically and physically. His mother later remarked that he passed the way he would have wanted—&quot;with the piano.&quot;

Guaraldi&#x27;s funeral was held at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Daly City, California, and he was laid to rest at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma.

==Personal life==
Guaraldi married his high school sweetheart, Shirley Moskowitz, on February 1, 1953. Their marriage produced two children, David Anthony Guaraldi (b. August 11, 1955) and Dia Lisa (b. February 16, 1960). Moskowitz initially filed for divorce on April 21, 1966, but later withdrew the petition. A second filing in June 1968 was finalized on December 8, 1970. 

Guaraldi maintained a long-term relationship with Gretchen Glanzer (later Katamay), who appeared on the cover of &quot;The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi&quot;. The two were also photographed together on the back cover of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;, among friends of the band. 

Guaraldi was a practicing Catholic.

==Revival, rediscovery, and posthumous releases==
Despite Guaraldi&#x27;s pivotal role in shaping &quot;Peanuts&quot; music, only three albums containing the music—&quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Oh Good Grief!&quot; (featuring reimagined versions of his compositions)—were released during his lifetime. The broader dissemination of his &quot;Peanuts&quot; work was hindered by the uncertain status of his original studio recordings, many of which were believed lost or misfiled after his passing, limiting commercial opportunities. Additionally, while &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was recorded in stereo for commercial distribution, the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials of the 1960s were produced in monaural sound, restricting their suitability for independent release.

Interest in Guaraldi&#x27;s oeuvre resurged in 1985 with David Benoit&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; on &quot;This Side Up&quot;, reintroducing the distinctive sound of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials to new audiences. This revival continued with tribute albums such as &quot;Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown!&quot; (1989), Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s &quot;Joe Cool&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1995), and Cyrus Chestnut Christmas-themed recordings. By 1996, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; had achieved double-platinum status, with sales increasing after Concord Records acquired Fantasy Records in 2004. 

New Age pianist George Winston further contributed to Guaraldi&#x27;s resurgence with &quot;Linus and Lucy: The Music of Vince Guaraldi&quot; (1996), a solo piano tribute that included previously unreleased &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions. Winston, who cited Guaraldi as a key influence, stated, &quot;I love his melodies and his chord progressions. He has a deeply personal way of voicing chords&quot;. He added, &quot;His music is part of our culture, and we know it even if we don&#x27;t know Vince. He had three bags: the Latin, the &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and the impressionistic &#x27;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&#x27; stuff. And those three bags are all his.&quot; The album&#x27;s success led to a second volume, &quot;Love Will Come: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 2&quot; (2010), and a planned third volume, &quot;Count the Ways: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 3&quot;, unreleased following Winston&#x27;s passing in June 2023.

In response to renewed interest, Guaraldi&#x27;s son, David Guaraldi, began licensing unreleased material from his father&#x27;s personal reel-to-reel tapes. This effort led to several archival releases, including &quot;The Charlie Brown Suite &amp; Other Favorites&quot; (2003), &quot;Oaxaca&quot; (2004), &quot;North Beach&quot; (2006), &quot;Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials&quot; (Volumes 1 and 2, 2007-2008), &quot;Live on the Air&quot; (2008) and &quot;An Afternoon with the Vince Guaraldi Quartet&quot; (2011). These releases offered deeper insight into Guaraldi&#x27;s extensive yet under-documented body of work. However, the absence of a formal recording contract and his limited engagement with the industry resulted in a fragmented catalog. His decision not to tour further diminished institutional interest in preserving his music. Additionally, while widely celebrated by audiences, his &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions were often regarded by jazz purists as overly commercial, which contributed to the industry&#x27;s lack of urgency in cataloging and promoting his television soundtracks.

A significant breakthrough in archival efforts occurred in 2017 with the rediscovery of Guaraldi&#x27;s original master recordings for the 1969 feature film &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. This led to Concord’s 2018 announcement of a long-awaited &quot;It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; soundtrack. However, as the original master tapes remained missing, the album had to be sourced from television broadcast audio, leading to some disappointment. During the COVID-19 lockdown, following Lee Mendelson&#x27;s passing in December 2019, his children discovered the original 1966 analog session reels, which contained nearly all of Guaraldi&#x27;s original music cues and alternate takes. This discovery enabled a more complete 2022 re-release of &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;, followed by remastered soundtracks produced by Jason and Sean Mendelson for &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; (2023), &quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot; (both 2024) and &quot;Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown&quot; (2025) under the Lee Mendelson Film Productions label. Additionally, &quot;It&#x27;s the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown&quot; is slated for release in March 2025. The rediscovery of these materials marked a critical step in addressing the archival challenges that had historically impeded broader distribution of Guaraldi&#x27;s work. Unlike his 1960s recordings, which were produced in mono for television, his &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions from the 1970s were recorded in stereo, making them more suitable for remastering and commercial release. 

===Recognition and cultural impact===
On November 18, 2021, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was ranked as the No. 1 Greatest Holiday 200 Album of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot;. In May 2022, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum, recognizing sales exceeding five million copies. This achievement established it as the second-best-selling jazz album of all time, surpassed only by Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959). 
In recognition of its artistic and cultural significance, Concord, through its Craft Recordings label, launched a series of reissues in 2022 and 2023. These included expanded deluxe editions of &quot;Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus&quot; and a five-disc super deluxe edition of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;. The latter, frequently reissued—particularly on vinyl—underscored the album&#x27;s enduring relevance.

==Legacy==
The revival of Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s music has been driven by tribute albums, archival rediscoveries, and growing recognition of his contributions to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise, which established a musical identity that was both sophisticated and widely accessible. Although the absence of a formal recording contract, misplaced master tapes, and skepticism within the jazz community initially impeded preservation efforts, dedicated archival work and sustained public enthusiasm have ensured the survival of his compositions. Guaraldi&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; scores remain among the most recognizable and influential works in television music history. His distinctive blend of jazz and lighthearted melodies became inseparable from Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s beloved characters, shaping the franchise’s sound for generations. With ongoing restoration projects and scheduled releases through 2025, Guaraldi&#x27;s legacy remains deeply embedded in both jazz and popular culture.

Lee Mendelson reflected on Guaraldi&#x27;s influence, remarking, &quot;Several generations have now grown up with Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s music. If people hear just one or two bass notes of the intro to &#x27;Linus and Lucy,&#x27; they cheer. The &quot;Peanuts&quot; programs and Vince&#x27;s music were such a wonderful marriage. It&#x27;s a shame it got cut off so soon.&quot;

A book-length biography of Guaraldi, titled &quot;Vince Guaraldi at the Piano&quot; by author and Guaraldi archivist Derrick Bang, was originally published in March 2012, with a second edition released in May 2024. The biography chronicles Guaraldi&#x27;s career and his contributions to the Northern California jazz scene, and includes a comprehensive discography and filmography, along with an appendix of quotations from Guaraldi&#x27;s former sidemen.

In the original 1964 liner notes for &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, Ralph J. Gleason observed that while self-expression is fundamental to art, a greater challenge lies in interpreting and responding to another artist&#x27;s work while preserving one&#x27;s own creative identity. He credited Guaraldi with successfully achieving this in his &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions, noting that Guaraldi effectively translated Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s artistic vision into music that was both empathetic to the imagery and unmistakably his own.

In his review of &quot;The Definitive Vince Guaraldi&quot; (2009), &quot;All About Jazz&quot; critic David Rickert credited Guaraldi with introducing many listeners to jazz, often before they consciously recognized the genre. Rickert highlighted Guaraldi&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; television soundtracks as an innovative approach to cartoon scoring that seamlessly complemented the sophisticated yet accessible narratives of &quot;Peanuts&quot;. He further praised Guaraldi’s original compositions as among the finest jazz works to emerge from the West Coast scene, attributing their success to the fusion of artistic inspiration and compositional talent.

===Documentary===
The 2010 documentary &quot;The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi&quot; premiered at various jazz and film festivals, showcasing newly discovered and restored footage of Guaraldi’s performances and recording sessions. The film featured new interpretations and commentary from artists including George Winston, Dave Brubeck, Dick Gregory, Jon Hendricks, Leonard Maltin, and Paul Krassner, as well as surviving Guaraldi collaborators Eddie Duran, Dean Reilly, and Jerry Granelli. Co-produced by Toby Gleason (son of Ralph J. Gleason) and filmmaker Andrew Thomas, the documentary received five &quot;Best Documentary&quot; awards and was a featured presentation at the Library of Congress and the Monterey Jazz Festival. Reflecting on Guaraldi&#x27;s influence, Gleason remarked, &quot;Let’s just agree that Vince Guaraldi re-invented the sound of the modern American Christmas.&quot;

==Sidemen and trio configurations== 
Throughout his career, Guaraldi collaborated with a diverse array of sidemen, though he primarily favored performing in a trio. The ensemble occasionally expanded to accommodate specific musical demands, including live performances and &quot;Peanuts&quot; soundtracks. His largest recorded ensemble appeared in 1969 for the soundtracks of &quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown&quot; (decet) and &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; (septet).

For bass and double bass, Guaraldi regularly worked with Monty Budwig, Dean Reilly, Fred Marshall, and Tom Beeson throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s, he primarily performed with Seward McCain, alongside occasional collaborations with Koji Kataoka.

Guitarist Eddie Duran was a frequent collaborator during the 1950s and 1960s, except between 1963 and 1965, when Guaraldi partnered with guitarist Bola Sete in a dual act. In the 1970s, Guaraldi occasionally played guitar himself but did not maintain a dedicated guitarist. 

Guaraldi’s first two albums were recorded without a drummer. From 1961 onward, Colin Bailey assumed the role, followed by Jerry Granelli. During the 1970s, Mike Clark became Guaraldi’s primary drummer for live performances. Other drummers included Lee Charlton, John Rae, Al Coster, Eliot Zigmund, Glenn Cronkhite, Vince Lateano, Mark Rosengarden, and Jim Zimmerman. 

The original Vince Guaraldi Trio featured Dean Reilly (bass) and Eddie Duran (guitar) and appeared on his first two albums. The first of two &quot;classic&quot; trio configurations included Monty Budwig (bass) and Colin Bailey (drums), performing on &quot;Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus&quot; and &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. The second &quot;classic&quot; trio, featuring Fred Marshall (double bass) and Jerry Granelli (drums), recorded more albums than any other iteration, including &quot;Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends&quot;, &quot;Jazz Casual: Paul Winter/Bola Sete and Vince Guaraldi&quot;, &quot;The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi&quot;, &quot;From All Sides&quot;, and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

<text>Western Christianity is one of two subdivisions of Christianity (Eastern Christianity being the other). Western Christianity is composed of the Latin Church and Western Protestantism, together with their offshoots such as the Old Catholic Church, Independent Catholicism and Restorationism.

The large majority of the world&#x27;s 2.3 billion Christians are Western Christians (about 2 billion: 1.2 billion Latin Catholic and 1.17 billion Protestant). One major component, the Latin Church, developed under the bishop of Rome. Out of the Latin Church emerged a wide variety of independent Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism and Anglicanism, starting from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, as did Independent Catholicism in the 19th century. Thus, the term &quot;Western Christianity&quot; does not describe a single communion or religious denomination but is applied to distinguish all these denominations collectively from Eastern Christianity.

The establishment of the distinct Latin Church, a particular church &quot;sui iuris&quot; of the Catholic Church, coincided with the consolidation of the Holy See in Rome, which claimed primacy since Antiquity. The Latin Church is distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches, also in full communion with the Pope in Rome, and from the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches, which are not in communion with Rome. These other churches are part of Eastern Christianity. The terms &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; in this regard originated with geographical divisions mirroring the cultural divide between the Hellenistic East and Latin West and the political divide between the Western and Eastern Roman empires. During the Middle Ages, adherents of the Latin Church, irrespective of ethnicity, commonly referred to themselves as &quot;Latins&quot; to distinguish themselves from Eastern Christians (&quot;Greeks&quot;).

Western Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization. With the expansion of European colonialism from the Early Modern era, the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the Americas, much of the Philippines, Southern Africa, pockets of West Africa, and throughout Australia and New Zealand. Thus, when used for historical periods after the 16th century, the term &quot;Western Christianity&quot; does not refer to a particular geographical area but is used as a collective term for all these.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute as in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, due to the spread of Christian missionaries, migrations, and globalisation. As such, the adjectives &quot;Western Christianity&quot; and &quot;Eastern Christianity&quot; are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in theology and liturgy rather than present geographical locations.

While the Latin Church maintains the use of the Latin liturgical rites, Protestant denominations and Independent Catholicism use various liturgical practices.

The earliest concept of Europe as a cultural sphere (instead of simply a geographic term) appeared during the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century, which included territories that practiced Western Christianity at the time.

== History ==

For much of its history, the Christian church has been culturally divided between the Latin-speaking West, whose centre was Rome, and the Greek-speaking East, whose centre was Constantinople. Cultural differences and political rivalry created tensions between the two churches, leading to disagreement over doctrine and ecclesiology and ultimately to schism.

Like Eastern Christianity, Western Christianity traces its roots directly to the apostles and other early preachers of the religion. In Western Christianity&#x27;s original area, Latin was the principal language. Christian writers in Latin had more influence there than those who wrote in Greek, Syriac, or other languages. Although the first Christians in the West used Greek (such as Clement of Rome), by the fourth century Latin had superseded it even in the cosmopolitan city of Rome, as well as in southern Gaul and the Roman province of Africa. There is evidence of a Latin translation of the Bible as early as the 2nd century (see also Vetus Latina).

With the decline of the Roman Empire, distinctions appeared also in organization, since the bishops in the West were not dependent on the Emperor in Constantinople and did not come under the influence of the Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church. While the see of Constantinople became dominant throughout the Emperor&#x27;s lands, the West looked exclusively to the see of Rome, which in the East was seen as that of one of the five patriarchs of the Pentarchy, &quot;the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees under the auspices of a single universal empire. Formulated in the legislation of the emperor Justinian I (527–565), especially in his Novella 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.&quot;

Over the centuries, disagreements separated Western Christianity from the various forms of Eastern Christianity: first from East Syriac Christianity after the Council of Ephesus (431), then from that of Oriental Orthodoxy after the Council of Chalcedon (451), and then from Eastern Orthodoxy with the East-West Schism of 1054. With the last-named form of Eastern Christianity, reunion agreements were signed at the Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439), but these proved ineffective.

Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is &quot;at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization&quot;. The rise of Protestantism led to major divisions within Western Christianity, which still persist, and wars—for example, the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604 had religious as well as economic causes.

In and after the Age of Discovery, Europeans spread Western Christianity to the New World and elsewhere. Roman Catholicism came to the Americas (especially South America), Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. Protestantism, including Anglicanism, came to North America, Australia-Pacific and some African locales.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is much less absolute, due to the great migrations of Europeans across the globe, as well as the work of missionaries worldwide over the past five centuries. 

== Features ==

=== Original sin ===
Original sin, also called ancestral sin, is a Christian belief in a state of sin in which humanity has existed since the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve&#x27;s rebellion in the Garden of Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Theologians have characterized this condition in many ways, seeing it as ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a &quot;sin nature&quot;, to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.

=== Filioque clause ===

Most Western Christians use a version of the Nicene Creed that states that the Holy Spirit &quot;proceeds from the Father and the Son&quot;, where the original text as adopted by the First Council of Constantinople had &quot;proceeds from the Father&quot; without the addition of either &quot;and the Son&quot; or &quot;alone&quot;. This Western version also has the additional phrase &quot;God from God&quot; (), which was in the Creed as adopted by the First Council of Nicaea, but which was dropped by the First Council of Constantinople.

=== Date of Easter ===

The date of Easter usually differs between Eastern and Western Christianity, because the calculations are based on the Julian calendar and Gregorian calendar respectively. However, before the Council of Nicea, various dates including Jewish Passover were observed. Nicea &quot;Romanized&quot; the date for Easter and anathematized a &quot;Judaized&quot; (i.e. Passover date for) Easter. The date of observance of Easter has only differed in modern times since the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582; and further, the Western Church did not universally adopt the Gregorian calendar at once, so that for some time the dates of Easter differed between the Eastern Church and the Roman Catholic Church, but not necessarily as between the Eastern Church and the Western Protestant churches. For example, the Church of England continued to observe Easter on the same date as the Eastern Church until 1753.

Even the dates of other Christian holidays often differ between Eastern and Western Christianity.

=== Lack of essence–energies distinction ===
Eastern Christianity, and particularly the Eastern Orthodox Church, has traditionally held a distinction between God&#x27;s essence, or that which He is, with God&#x27;s energies, or that which He does. They hold that while God is unknowable in His essence, He can be known (i.e. experienced) in His energies. This is an extension of Eastern Christianity&#x27;s apophatic theology, while Western Christians tend to prefer a view of divine simplicity, and claim that God&#x27;s essence can be known by its attributes.

== Western denominations ==
Today, Western Christianity makes up close to 90% of Christians worldwide with the Catholic Church accounting for over half and various Protestant denominations making up another 40%.

Hussite movements of 15th century Bohemia preceded the main Protestant uprising by 100 years and evolved into several small Protestant churches, such as the Moravian Church. Waldensians survived also, but blended into the Reformed tradition.

<doc id="42207" wikidata="Q245177" url="?curid=42207" title="Eastern Christianity">
<text>Eastern Christianity comprises Christian traditions and church families that originally developed during classical and late antiquity in the Eastern Mediterranean region or locations further east, south or north. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Eastern Christianity is a category distinguished from Western Christianity, which is composed of those Christian traditions and churches that originally developed further west.

Major Eastern Christian bodies include the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, along with those groups descended from the historic Church of the East (also called the Assyrian Church), as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (which are in communion with Rome while maintaining Eastern liturgies), and the Eastern Protestant churches. Most Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as &quot;Eastern&quot;, with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoot, the Ancient Church of the East.

The Eastern Orthodox are the largest body within Eastern Christianity with a worldwide population of 220 million, followed by the Oriental Orthodox at 60 million. The Eastern Catholic Churches consist of about 16–18 million and are a small minority within the Catholic Church. Eastern Protestant Christian churches do not form a single communion; churches like the Ukrainian Lutheran Church and Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church have under a million members. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, descendant churches of the Assyria-based Church of the East, have a combined membership of approximately 400,000.

Historically, Eastern Christianity was centered in the Middle East and surrounding areas, where Christianity originated. However, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the term Eastern Church increasingly came to be used for the Greek Church centered in Constantinople, in contrast with the (&quot;Western&quot;) Latin Church, centered on Rome, which uses the Latin liturgical rites. The terms &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; in this regard originated with geographical divisions in Christianity mirroring the cultural divide between the Hellenistic East and the Latin West, and the political divide of 395 AD between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. Since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the term &quot;Eastern Christianity&quot; may be used in contrast with &quot;Western Christianity&quot;, which contains not only the Latin Church but also forms of Protestantism and Independent Catholicism. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another.

Because the largest church in the East is the body currently known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term &quot;Orthodox&quot; is often used in a similar fashion to &quot;Eastern&quot;, to refer to specific historical Christian communions. However, strictly speaking, most Christian denominations, whether Eastern or Western, regard themselves as &quot;orthodox&quot; (meaning &quot;following correct beliefs&quot;) as well as &quot;catholic&quot; (meaning &quot;universal&quot;), and as sharing in the Four Marks of the Church listed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (381 AD): &quot;One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic&quot; ().

Eastern churches (excepting the non-liturgical dissenting bodies) utilize several liturgical rites: the Alexandrian Rite, the Armenian Rite, the Byzantine Rite, the East Syriac Rite (also known as Persian or Assyrian Rite), and the West Syriac Rite (also called the Antiochian Rite).

== Families of churches ==

Eastern Christians do not all share the same religious traditions, but many do share cultural traditions. Christianity divided itself in the East during its early centuries both within and outside of the Roman Empire in disputes about Christology and fundamental theology, as well as through national divisions (Roman, Persian, etc.). It would be many centuries later that Western Christianity fully split from these traditions as its own communion. Major branches or families of Eastern Christianity, each holding a distinct theology and dogma, include the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East.

In most Eastern churches, parish priests administer the sacrament of chrismation to infants after baptism, and priests are allowed to marry before ordination. The Eastern Catholic Churches recognize the authority of the Pope of Rome, but some of them who have originally been part of the Orthodox Church or Oriental Orthodox churches closely follow the traditions of Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy, including the tradition of allowing married men to become priests.

The Eastern churches&#x27; differences from Western Christianity have to do with theology, as well as liturgy, culture, language, and politics. For the non-Catholic Eastern churches, a definitive date for the commencement of schism cannot usually be given (see East–West Schism). The Church of the East declared independence from the churches of the Roman Empire at its general council in 424, which was before the Council of Ephesus in 431, and so had nothing to do with the theology declared at that council. Oriental Orthodoxy separated after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 but did not immediately form separate patriarchates until 518 (in the case of the Syriac Patriarchate of Antioch) and 536 (in the case of the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria).

Since the time of the historian Edward Gibbon, the split between the Church of Rome and the Orthodox Church has been conveniently dated to 1054, though the reality is more complex. This split is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Great Schism&quot;, but is now more usually called the East–West Schism. This final schism reflected a larger cultural and political division which had developed in Europe and Southwest Asia during the Middle Ages and coincided with Western Europe&#x27;s re-emergence from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

The Ukrainian Lutheran Church developed within Galicia around 1926, with its rites being based on the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, rather than on the Western &quot;Formula Missae&quot;.

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===


The Eastern Orthodox Church is a Christian body whose adherents are largely based in Western Asia (particularly Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Palestine) and Turkey, Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucasus (Georgia, Abkhazia, Ossetia etc.), with a growing presence in the Western world. Eastern Orthodox Christians accept the decisions of the first seven ecumenical councils.

Eastern Orthodox Christianity identifies itself as the original Christian church (see early centers of Christianity) founded by Christ and the Apostles, and traces its lineage back to the early Church through the process of apostolic succession and unchanged theology and practice. Characteristics of the Eastern Orthodox Church include the Byzantine Rite (shared with some Eastern Catholic Churches) and an emphasis on the continuation of Holy Tradition, which it holds to be apostolic in nature.

The Eastern Orthodox Church is organized into self-governing jurisdictions along geographical, national, ethnic or linguistic lines. Eastern Orthodoxy is thus made up of fourteen or sixteen autocephalous bodies. Smaller churches are autonomous and each have a mother church that is autocephalous.

All Eastern Orthodox are united in doctrinal agreement with each other, though a few are not in communion at present, for non-doctrinal reasons. This is in contrast to the Catholic Church and its various churches. Members of the latter are all in communion with each other, parts of a top-down hierarchy (see ). The Eastern Orthodox reject the Filioque clause as contrast to Catholics. The Catholic Church was once in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church, but the two split after the East–West Schism and are no longer in communion.

It is estimated that there are approximately 240 million Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world. Today, many adherents shun the term &quot;Eastern&quot; as denying the church&#x27;s universal character. They refer to Eastern Orthodoxy simply as the &quot;Orthodox Church&quot;.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===

Oriental Orthodoxy refers to the churches of Eastern Christian tradition that keep the faith of the first three ecumenical councils of the undivided Christian Church: the First Council of Nicaea (AD 325), the First Council of Constantinople (381) and the Council of Ephesus (431), while rejecting the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon (451). Hence, these churches are also called the &quot;Old Oriental churches&quot;. They comprise the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Church (India), the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Oriental Orthodoxy developed in reaction to Chalcedon on the eastern limit of the Byzantine Empire and in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia. In those locations, there are also Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, but the rivalry between the two has largely vanished in the centuries since the schism.

=== Church of the East ===

Historically, the Church of the East was the widest reaching branch of Eastern Christianity, at its height spreading from its heartland in Persian-ruled Assyria to the Mediterranean, India, and China. Originally the only Christian church recognized by Zoroastrian-led Sassanid Persia (through its alliance with the Lakhmids, the regional rivals to the Byzantines and its Ghassanid vassal), the Church of the East declared itself independent of other churches in 424 and over the next century became affiliated with Nestorianism, a Christological doctrine advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, which had been declared heretical in the Roman Empire. Thereafter it was often known in the West, possibly inaccurately, as the Nestorian Church. Surviving a period of persecution within Persia, the Church of the East flourished under the Abbasid Caliphate and branched out, establishing dioceses throughout Asia. After another period of expansion under the Mongol Empire, the church went into decline starting in the 14th century, and was eventually largely confined to its founding Assyrian adherent&#x27;s heartland in the Assyrian homeland, although another remnant survived on the Malabar Coast of India.

In the 16th century, dynastic struggles sent the church into schism, resulting in the formation of two rival churches: The Chaldean Catholic Church, which entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church, and the Assyrian Church of the East. The followers of these two churches are almost exclusively ethnic Assyrians. In India, the local Church of the East community, known as the Saint Thomas Christians, experienced its own rifts as a result of Portuguese influence.

==== Assyrian Church of the East ====

The Assyrian Church of the East emerged from the historical Church of the East, which was centered in Mesopotamia/Assyria, then part of the Persian Empire, and spread widely throughout Asia. The modern Assyrian Church of the East emerged in the 16th century following a split with the Chaldean Church, which later entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church.

The Church of the East was associated with the doctrine of Nestorianism, advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, which emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. Nestorius and his doctrine were condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, leading to the Nestorian Schism in which churches supporting Nestorius split from the rest of Christianity.

Many followers relocated to Persia and became affiliated with the local Christian community there. This community adopted an increasingly Nestorian theology and was thereafter often known as the Nestorian Church. As such, the Church of the East accepts only the first two ecumenical councils of the undivided Church—the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople—as defining its faith tradition, and rapidly took a different course from other Eastern Christians.

The Church of the East spread widely through Persia and into Asia, being introduced to India by the 6th century and to the Mongols and China in the 7th century. It experienced periodic expansion until the 14th century, when the church was nearly destroyed by the collapse of the Mongol Empire and the conquests of Timur. By the 16th century it was largely confined to Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and the Malabar Coast of India (Kerala). The split of the 15th century, which saw the emergence of separate Assyrian and Chaldean Churches, left only the former as an independent sect. Additional splits into the 20th century further affected the history of the Assyrian Church of the East.

==== Saint Thomas Syrian Christians ====

The Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are an ancient body of Syrian Christians in Kerala, Malabar coast of India who trace their origins to the evangelical activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Many Assyrian and Jewish communities like the Knanaya and the Cochin Jews assimilated into the Saint Thomas Syrian Christian community. By the 5th century the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians were part of the Church of the East (Nestorian Church). Until the middle of the 17th century and the arrival of the Portuguese, the Thomas Christians were all one in faith and rite. Thereafter, divisions arose among them, and consequently they are today of several different rites. The East Syriac Chaldean Rite (Edessan Rite) Churches among the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are the Syro Malabar Church and the Chaldean Syrian Church. The West Syriac Antiochian Rite Churches among the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, the Syro Malankara Church and the Thozhiyur Church.

=== Eastern Catholic Churches ===


The twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches are in communion with the Holy See at the Vatican whilst being rooted in the theological and liturgical traditions of Eastern Christianity. Most of these churches were originally part of the Orthodox East, but have since been reconciled to the Latin Church.

Many of these churches were originally part of one of the above families and so are closely related to them by way of ethos and liturgical practice. As in the other Eastern churches, married men may become priests, and parish priests administer the mystery of confirmation to newborn infants immediately after baptism, via the rite of chrismation; the infants are then administered Holy Communion.

The Syro-Malabar Church, which is part of the Saint Thomas Christian community in India, follows East Syriac traditions and liturgy. Other Saint Thomas Christians of India, who were originally of the same East Syriac tradition, passed instead to the West Syriac tradition and now form part of Oriental Orthodoxy (some from the Oriental Orthodox in India united with the Catholic Church in 1930 and became the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church). The Maronite Church claims never to have been separated from Rome, and has no counterpart Orthodox Church out of communion with the Pope. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to it as a &quot;Uniate&quot; Church. The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church has also never been out of communion with Rome, but, unlike the Maronite Church, it resembles the liturgical rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

=== Dissenting movements ===
In addition to these four mainstream branches, there are a number of much smaller groups which originated from disputes with the dominant tradition of their original areas. Most of these are either part of the more traditional Old Believer movement, which arose from a schism within Russian Orthodoxy, or the more radical Spiritual Christianity movement. The latter includes a number of diverse &quot;low-church&quot; groups, from the Bible-centered Molokans to the anarchic Doukhobors to the self-mutilating Skoptsy. None of these groups are in communion with the mainstream churches listed above. There are also national dissidents, where ethnic groups want their own nation-church, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Montenegrin Orthodox Church; both are domiciles of the Serbian Orthodox Church. There are also some Reformed Churches which share characteristics of Eastern Christianity, to varying extents.

====&quot;True Orthodox&quot; churches====

Starting in the 1920s, parallel hierarchies formed in opposition to local Orthodox churches over ecumenism and other matters. These jurisdictions sometimes refer to themselves as being &quot;True Orthodox&quot;. In Russia, underground churches formed and maintained solidarity with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia until the late 1970s. There are now traditionalist Orthodox in every area, though in Asia and Egypt their presence is negligible.

==== Eastern Protestant Churches ====

Eastern Protestant Christianity comprises a collection of heterogeneous Protestant denominations which are mostly the result of Protestant Churches adopting Reformation variants of Orthodox Christian liturgy and worship. Some others are the result of reformations of Orthodox Christian beliefs and practices, inspired by the teachings of Western Protestant missionaries. Denominations of this category include the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church ,
Ukrainian Lutheran Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Evangelical Orthodox Church, etc.

===== Byzantine Rite Lutheranism =====

Byzantine Rite Lutheranism arose in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church around 1926. It sprung up in the region of Galicia and its rites are based on the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom. The church suffered persecution under the Communist régime, which implemented a policy of state atheism.

== Catholic–Orthodox ecumenism ==
Ecumenical dialogue since the 1964 meeting between Pope Paul VI and Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I has awoken the nearly 1,000-year hopes for Christian unity. Since the lifting of excommunications during the Paul VI and Athenagoras I meeting in Jerusalem there have been other significant meetings between Popes and Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople. One of the most recent meetings was between Benedict XVI and Bartholomew I, who jointly signed the &quot;Common Declaration&quot;. It states that &quot;We give thanks to the Author of all that is good, who allows us once again, in prayer and in dialogue, to express the joy we feel as brothers and to renew &quot;our commitment to move towards full communion&quot;&quot;.

In 2013 Patriarch Bartholomew I attended the installation ceremony of the new Catholic Pope, Francis, which was the first time any Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had ever attended such an installation.

In 2019, Primate of the OCU Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphanius stated that &quot;theoretically&quot; the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church could in the future unite into a united church around the Kyiv throne. In 2019, the primate of the UGCC, Major Archbishop of Kyiv-Galicia Sviatoslav, stated that every effort should be made to restore the original unity of the Kyivan Church in its Orthodox and Catholic branches, saying that the restoration of Eucharistic communion between Rome and Constantinople is not a utopia.

=== Rejection of Uniatism ===
At a meeting in Balamand, Lebanon, in June 1993, the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church declared that these initiatives that &quot;led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with their Mother Churches of the East … took place not without the interference of extra-ecclesial interests&quot;; and that what has been called &quot;uniatism&quot; &quot;can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking&quot; (section 12).

At the same time, the Commission stated:
* 3) Concerning the Eastern Catholic Churches, it is clear that they, as part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful.
* 16) The Oriental Catholic Churches who have desired to re-establish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the rights and obligations which are connected with this communion.
* 22) Pastoral activity in the Catholic Church, Latin as well as Oriental, no longer aims at having the faithful of one Church pass over to the other; that is to say, it no longer aims at proselytizing among the Orthodox. It aims at answering the spiritual needs of its own faithful and it has no desire for expansion at the expense of the Orthodox Church. Within these perspectives, so that there will be no longer place for mistrust and suspicion, it is necessary that there be reciprocal exchanges of information about various pastoral projects and that thus cooperation between bishops and all those with responsibilities in our Churches, can be set in motion and develop.

== Migration trends ==
There has been a significant Christian migration in the 20th century from the Near East. Fifteen hundred years ago Christians were the majority population in today&#x27;s Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Egypt. In 1914 Christians constituted 25% of the population of the Ottoman Empire. At the beginning of the 21st century Christians constituted 6–7% of the region&#x27;s population: less than 1% in Turkey, 3% in Iraq, 12% in Syria, 39% in Lebanon, 6% in Jordan, 2.5% in Israel/Palestine and 15–20% in Egypt.

As of 2011 Eastern Orthodox Christians are among the wealthiest Christians in the United States. They also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, having a high number of graduate (68%) and post-graduate (28%) degrees per capita.

== Role of Christians in Arabic culture ==
Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the Middle East and North Africa and other areas. Byzantine science played an important and crucial role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world.

Christians, especially Nestorians, contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Umayyads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science (such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu etc.) and theology (such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub, etc.) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishus. Many scholars of the House of Wisdom were of Christian background.

A hospital and medical training center existed at Gundeshapur. The city of Gundeshapur was founded in AD 271 by the Sassanid king Shapur I. It was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population was Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khusraw I, refuge was granted to Greek Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa), also called the academy of Athens, a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts. The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur. It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory. Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at Baghdad. Daud al-Antaki was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers.

Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians, especially Maronites, played important roles in the Nahda, and because Arab Christians formed the educated upper and bourgeois classes, they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture, and most important figures of the Nahda movement were Christian Arabs. Today Arab Christians still play important roles in the Arab world, and Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate.

<text>Great Lent, or the Great Fast (Greek: Μεγάλη Τεσσαρακοστή, &quot;Megali Tessarakosti&quot; or Μεγάλη Νηστεία, &quot;Megali Nisteia&quot;, meaning &quot;Great 40 Days&quot;, and &quot;Great Fast&quot;, respectively), is the most important fasting season of the church year within many denominations of Eastern Christianity. It is intended to prepare Christians for the greatest feast of the church year, Pascha (Easter).
Great Lent shares its origins with the Lent of Western Christianity and has many similarities with it. There are some differences in the timing of Lent, besides calculating the date of Easter and how it is practiced, both liturgically in the public worship of the church and individually.

One difference between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity is the calculation of the date of Easter (see Computus). Most years, the Eastern Pascha falls after the Western Easter, and it may be as much as five weeks later; occasionally, the two dates coincide. Like Western Lent, Great Lent itself lasts for forty days, but in contrast to the West, Sundays are included in the count while Holy Week is not.

Great Lent officially begins on Clean Monday, seven weeks before Pascha (Ash Wednesday is not observed in Eastern Christianity), and runs for 40 continuous days, concluding with the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday of the Sixth Week. The next day is called Lazarus Saturday, the day before Palm Sunday. Thus, in case the Easter dates coincide, Clean Monday is two days before Ash Wednesday.

Fasting continues throughout the following week, known as Passion Week or Holy Week, and does not end until after the Paschal Vigil early in the morning of Pascha (Easter Sunday).

==Purpose==
The purpose of Great Lent is to prepare the faithful to not only commemorate, but to enter into the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus. The totality of the Byzantine Rite life centers around the Resurrection. Great Lent is intended to be a &quot;workshop&quot; where the character of the believer is spiritually uplifted and strengthened; where their life is rededicated to the principles and ideals of the Gospel; where fasting and prayer culminate in deep conviction of life; where apathy and disinterest turn into vigorous activities of faith and good works.

Lent is not for the sake of Lent itself, as fasting is not for the sake of fasting. Rather, these are means by which and for which the individual believer prepares himself to reach for, accept and attain the calling of their Savior. Therefore, the significance of Great Lent is highly appraised, not only by the monks who gradually increased the length of time of the Lent, but also by the lay people themselves. The Eastern Orthodox lenten rules are the monastic rules. These rules exist not as a Pharisaic law, &quot;burdens grievous to be borne&quot; , but as an ideal to be striven for; not as an end in themselves, but as a means to the purification of heart, the enlightening of mind, the liberation of soul and body from sin, and the spiritual perfection crowned in the virtue of love towards God and man.

In the Byzantine Rite, asceticism is not exclusively for the &quot;professional&quot; religious, but for each layperson as well, according to their strength. As such, Great Lent is a sacred Institute of the Church to serve the individual believer in participating as a member of the Mystical Body of Christ. It provides each person an annual opportunity for self-examination and improving the standards of faith and morals in their Christian life. The deep intent of the believer during Great Lent is encapsulated in the words of Saint Paul: &quot;forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus&quot; ().

Through spending more time than usual in prayer and meditation on the Holy Scripture and the Holy Traditions of the Church, the believer in Christ becomes through the grace of God more godlike. The emphasis towards this period differs somewhat from Western Christianity- the Eastern focus is less on repentance and more of an attempt to recapture humanity&#x27;s original state.

==Observance==

===Self-discipline===
Observance of Great Lent is characterized by fasting and abstinence from certain foods, intensified private and public prayer, self-examination, confession, personal improvement, repentance and restitution for sins committed, and almsgiving. Fasting is defined as not consuming food until evening (at sundown). The Lenten supper that is eaten after the fast is broken in the evening must not include certain foods. Foods most commonly abstained from are meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, wine, and oil. According to some traditions, only olive oil is abstained from; in others, all vegetable oils.

While wine and oil are permitted on Saturdays, Sundays, and a few feast days, and fish is permitted on Palm Sunday as well as the Annunciation when it falls before Palm Sunday, and caviar is permitted on Lazarus Saturday, meat and dairy are prohibited entirely until the fast is broken on Easter. Additionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians traditionally abstain from sexual relations during Lent.

Besides the additional liturgical celebrations described below, Christians are expected to pay closer attention to and increase their private prayer. According to Byzantine Rite theology, when asceticism is increased, prayer must be increased also. The Church Fathers have referred to fasting without prayer as &quot;the fast of the demons&quot; since the demons do not eat according to their incorporeal nature, but neither do they pray.

===Liturgical observances===

Great Lent is unique in that, liturgically, the weeks do not run from Sunday to Saturday, but rather begin on Monday and end on Sunday, and most weeks are named for the lesson from the Gospel which will be read at the Divine Liturgy on its concluding Sunday. This is to illustrate that the entire season is anticipatory, leading up to the greatest Sunday of all: Pascha.

During the Great Fast, a special service book is used, known as the Lenten Triodion, which contains the Lenten texts for the Daily Office (Canonical Hours) and Liturgies. The Triodion begins during the Pre-Lenten period to supplement or replace portions of the regular services. This replacement begins gradually, initially affecting only the Epistle and Gospel readings, and gradually increases until Holy Week when it entirely replaces all other liturgical material. During the Triduum even the Psalter is eliminated, and all texts are taken exclusively from the Triodion. The Triodion is used until the lights are extinguished before midnight at the Paschal Vigil, at which time it is replaced by the Pentecostarion, which begins by replacing the normal services entirely (during Bright Week) and gradually diminishes until the normal services resume following the Afterfeast of Pentecost.

On the weekdays of Great Lent, the full Divine Liturgy is not celebrated, because the joy of the Eucharist (literally &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;) is contrary to the attitude of repentance which predominates on these days. Since it is considered especially important to receive the Holy Mysteries (Holy Communion) during this season, the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts—also called the Liturgy of St. Gregory the Dialogist— may be celebrated on weekdays.

This service starts with Vespers during which a portion of the Body and Blood of Christ, which was reserved the previous Sunday, is brought to the prothesis table. This is followed by a solemn great entrance where the Holy Mysteries are brought to the altar table, and then, skipping the anaphora (eucharistic prayer), the outline of remainder of the divine liturgy is followed, including holy communion. Most parishes and monasteries celebrate this liturgy only on Wednesdays, Fridays and feast days, but it may be celebrated on any weekday of Great Lent.

Because the divine liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays, the Typica occupies its place in the canonical hours, whether or not a liturgy is celebrated at vespers. On Saturday and Sunday the Divine Liturgy may be celebrated as usual. On Saturdays, the usual Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated; on Sundays the longer Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great is used.

The services of the Canonical Hours are much longer during Great Lent and the structure of the services is different on weekdays. The usual evening small compline is replaced by the much longer service of Great Compline. While in the Russian tradition Great Compline is used on Friday night (though some parts are read rather than sung and some Lenten material is replaced by non-Lenten hymns), in the Greek practice, ordinary Compline is used together with, on the first four weeks, a quarter of the Akathist to the Theotokos. On the fifth Saturday, known as the Saturday of the Akathist, everywhere, the entire Akathist is sung at Matins.

In “The Typikon Decoded”, Archbishop Job Getcha offers this comparison of the commemorations associated with the Sundays of Great Lent in the “Ancient Triodion”. These more ancient commemorations are retained in the hymnography still in use for the “Contemporary” Sundays of St Gregory Palamas, St John of the Ladder, and St Mary of Egypt.  On each of these, the troparia of the 1st Canon at Matins reference the more ancient commemoration, the Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan, and the Rich Man and Lazarus respectively.  

During Palm Week, between the Sunday of St Mary of Egypt and Lazarus Saturday, the 1st Canon at Matins on each weekday references the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus as a parallel to the Lazarus of Bethany who falls ill and is raised from the dead after four days in the tomb (John 11:1–45). 
==== Theme of Lenten joy ====
A difference between the Eastern and Western observances is that while in the West the chanting of Alleluia ceases during Lent, in the East its use is increased. This is because for Christians, fasting should be joyous (cf. ), and the sense of unworthiness must always be tempered with hope in God&#x27;s forgiveness.

In fact, days which follow the Lenten pattern of services are referred to as &quot;days with Alleluia&quot;. This theme of &quot;Lenten joy&quot; is also found in many of the hymns of the Triodion, such as the stichera which begin with the words: &quot;The Lenten Spring has dawned!...&quot; (Vespers Aposticha, Wednesday of &quot;Maslenitsa&quot;) and &quot;Now is the season of repentance; let us begin it joyfully, O brethren...&quot; (Matins, Second Canon, Ode 8, Monday of &quot;Maslenitsa&quot;).

The making of prostrations during the services increases as well. The one prayer that typifies the Lenten services is the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, which is said at each service on weekdays, accompanied by full prostrations. One translation of it reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
O Lord and master of my life! a spirit of idleness, despondency, ambition and idle-talking, give me not. 
But rather, a spirit of chastity, humble-mindedness, patience and charity, bestow upon me Thy servant. 
Yea, my king and Lord, grant me to see my own failings and refrain from judging others: For blessed art Thou unto ages of ages. Amen. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

The public reading of Scripture is increased during Great Lent. The Psalter (Book of Psalms), which is normally read through once a week, is read through twice each week for the six weeks prior to Holy Week. Readings from the Old Testament are also increased, with the Books of Genesis, Proverbs and Isaiah being read through almost in their entirety at the Sixth Hour and Vespers. During Cheesefare Week, the readings at these services are taken from Joel and Zechariah, while during Holy Week they are from Exodus, Ezekiel and Job.

Uniquely, on weekdays of Great Lent there is no public reading of the Epistles or Gospels. This is because the readings are particular to the divine liturgy, which is not celebrated on weekdays of Great Lent. There are, however, Epistles and Gospels appointed for each Saturday and Sunday.

====Prayer for the dead====
During the Great Fast, the church also increases its prayer for the dead, not only reminding the believer of his own mortality, and thus increasing the spirit of penitence, but also to remind him of his Christian obligation of charity in praying for the departed. A number of Saturdays during Great Lent are Saturdays of the Dead, with many of the hymns of the Daily Office and at the Divine Liturgy dedicated to remembrance of the departed. These Saturdays are:
*The Saturday of Meatfare Week
*The Second Saturday of Great Lent
*The Third Saturday of Great Lent
*The Fourth Saturday of Great Lent
In addition, the Lity, a brief prayer service for the departed, may be served on each weekday of Great Lent, provided there is no feast day or special observance on that day.

====Feast days====
Since the season of Great Lent is moveable, beginning on different dates from year to year, accommodation must be made for various feast days on the fixed calendar (Menaion) which occur during the season. When these feasts fall on a weekday of Great Lent, the normal Lenten aspect of the services is lessened to celebrate the solemnity.

The most important of these fixed feasts is the Great Feast of the Annunciation (March 25), which is considered to be so important that it is never moved, even if it should fall on the Sunday of Pascha itself, a rare and special occurrence which is known as &quot;Kyrio-Pascha&quot;. The fast is also lessened, and the faithful are allowed to eat fish, unless it is Good Friday or Holy Saturday. Whereas on other weekdays of Great Lent, no celebration of the Divine Liturgy is permitted, there is a Liturgy (usually the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom) celebrated on Annunciation—even if it falls on Good Friday.

When the feast day of the patron saint of the parish church or monastery falls on a weekday of Great Lent, there is no liturgy (other than the Presanctified), but fish is allowed at the meal. In some churches the feast of a patron saint is moved to the nearest Saturday (excluding the Saturday of the Akathist), and in other churches, it is celebrated on the day of the feast itself.

When some other important feast occurs on a weekday, such as the First and Second Finding of the Head of John the Baptist (February 24), the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (March 9), etc., it is usually combined with the Lenten service, and wine and oil are allowed at the meal.

Regardless of the rank of the feast being celebrated, the Lenten hymns contained in the Triodion are never omitted, but are always chanted in their entirety, even on the feast of the Annunciation.

On the Saturdays, Sundays, and a number of weekdays during Great Lent, the service materials from the Triodion leave no room for the commemoration of the Saint of the day from the Menaion. In order that their services not be completely forgotten, a portion of them (their canon at Matins, and their stichera from &quot;Lord I Have Cried&quot; at Vespers) is chanted at Compline.

===Readings===
In addition to the added readings from Scripture, spiritual books by the Church Fathers are recommended during the Fast.

One book commonly read during Great Lent, particularly by monastics, is &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;, which was written in about the 7th century by St. John of the Ladder when he was the Hegumen (Abbot) of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai. &quot;The Ladder&quot; is usually read in the trapeza (refectory) during meals, but it may alternatively be read during the Little Hours on weekdays so that everyone can hear. Many of the laity also read &quot;The Ladder&quot; privately during Great Lent.

The theme of &quot;The Ladder&quot; is not Great Lent itself, but rather it deals with the ascent of the soul from earth to heaven. That is, from enslavement to the passions to the building up of the virtues and its eventual theosis (union with God), which is the goal of Great Lent.

Besides the &quot;Ladder&quot;, in some monasteries the &quot;Paradise of the Holy Fathers&quot; by Palladius and the penitential sermons of St. Ephrem the Syrian are read during Matins.

==Outline==

Liturgically, the period of the Triodion can be divided into three sections: (1) the Pre-Lenten period, (2) the Great Forty Days, and (3) Holy Week.

===Pre-Lenten period===

Before the forty days of Great Lent commence, there is a three-week Pre-Lenten season, to prepare the faithful for the spiritual work they are to accomplish during the Great Fast. During this period many of the themes which will be developed in the liturgical texts of the forty days are introduced. Each week runs from Monday to Sunday and is named for the Gospel theme of the Sunday which concludes it.

In the Slavic tradition, with the addition of Zacchaeus Sunday, some regard the pre-Lenten period as lasting four weeks, but there are no liturgical indications that the week following the fifth Sunday before Lent (whether preceded by Zacchaeus Sunday or otherwise) is in any way Lenten, because Zacchaeus Sunday falls outside the &quot;Triodion&quot;, the liturgical book which governs the pre-Lenten period and Lent itself.

====Zacchaeus Sunday====
In the Slavic liturgical traditions, Zacchaeus Sunday occurs on the fifth Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent (which starts on a Monday). Though there are no materials provided in the Lenten Triodion for this day, it is the very first day that is affected by the date of the upcoming Pascha (all the preceding days having been affected by the previous Pascha). This day has one sole Pre-Lenten feature: the Gospel reading is always the account of Zacchaeus from , for which reason this Sunday is referred to as &quot;Zacchaeus Sunday&quot; (though the week before is not called &quot;Zacchaeus week&quot;).

This reading actually falls at the end of the lectionary cycle, being assigned to the 32nd Week after Pentecost. However, depending upon the date of the upcoming Pascha, the readings of the preceding weeks are either skipped (if Pascha will be early) or repeated (if it will be late) so that the readings for the 32nd Sunday after Pentecost always occur on the Sunday preceding the Week of the Publican and the Pharisee.

In the Byzantine (&quot;Greek&quot;) liturgical traditions, the Gospel reading for Zacchaeus remains in the normal lectionary cycle and does not always fall on the fifth Sunday before Lent. In fact, it usually falls a few weeks before, and the fifth Sunday before Lent is known as the Sunday of the Canaanite Woman after the story in .

The Lenten significance of the Gospel account of Zacchaeus is that it introduces the themes of pious zeal (Zacchaeus&#x27; climbing up the sycamore tree; Jesus&#x27; words: &quot;Zacchaeus, make haste&quot;), restraint (Jesus&#x27; words: &quot;come down&quot;), making a place for Jesus in the heart (&quot;I must abide at thy house&quot;), overcoming gossip (&quot;And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner&quot;), repentance and almsgiving (&quot;And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold&quot;), forgiveness and reconciliation (&quot;And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham&quot;), and the reason for the Passion and Resurrection (&quot;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost&quot;).

The Epistle reading for Zacchaeus Sunday is , which in and of itself has no Lenten theme, other than as an admonition to righteous behaviour.

====Publican and Pharisee====
The reading on the Sunday which concludes this week is the Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (). The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is the first day the Lenten Triodion is used (at Vespers or All-Night Vigil on Saturday night), though it is only used for the Sunday services, with nothing pertaining to weekdays or Saturday. The theme of the hymns and readings on this Sunday is dedicated to the lessons to be learned from the parable: that righteous actions alone do not lead to salvation, that pride renders good deeds fruitless, that God can only be approached through a spirit of humility and repentance, and that God justifies the humble rather than the self-righteous. The week which follows the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is a fast-free week, to remind the faithful not to be prideful in their fasting as the Pharisee was ().

The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is also the first day that &quot;structural&quot; changes (as opposed to simply substituting Lenten hymns for normal hymns from the octoechos or menaion) are made to the Sunday services. For example, there begins to be a significant &#x27;split&#x27; after the Great Prokimenon at Vespers that night.

====Prodigal Son====
The theme of this week is the Parable of the Prodigal Son (). Again, the Triodion does not give propers for the weekdays. The Gospel Reading on Sunday lays out one of the most important themes of the Lenten season: the process of falling into sin, realization of one&#x27;s sinfulness, the road to repentance, and finally reconciliation, each of which is illustrated in the course of the parable.

The week following is the only week of the Triodion on which there is normal fasting (i.e. no meat, fish, wine, oil or animal products on Wednesday or Friday except if an important feast such as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple or Forty Martyrs of Sebaste falls on that day, in which case certain foods are allowed).

====Meatfare Week====
The Saturday of this week is the first Saturday of the Dead observed during the Great Lenten season. The proper name in the typikon for the Sunday of this week is &quot;The Sunday of the Last Judgment&quot;, indicating the theme of the Gospel of the day (). The popular name of &quot;Meatfare Sunday&quot; comes from the fact that this is the last day on which the laity are permitted to eat meat until Pascha (Byzantine Rite monks and nuns never eat meat).

====Cheesefare Week====

During Cheesefare Week the eating of dairy products is permitted on every day (even Wednesday and Friday, which are normally observed as fast days throughout the year), though meat may no longer be eaten any day of the week. On the weekdays of this week, the first Lenten structural elements are introduced to the cycle of services on weekdays (the chanting of &quot;Alleluia&quot;, the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, making prostrations, etc.).

Wednesday and Friday are the most lenten, but some lenten elements are also observed on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The office of Cheesefare Saturday celebrates the &quot;Holy Ascetic Fathers&quot;.

Cheesefare Week is concluded on Cheesefare Sunday. The proper name for this Sunday is &quot;The Sunday of Forgiveness&quot;, both because of the Gospel theme for the day () and because it is the day on which everyone asks forgiveness of their neighbor. The popular name of &quot;Cheesefare Sunday&quot; derives from the fact that it is the last day to eat dairy products before Pascha. On this Sunday, Eastern Christians identify with Adam and Eve, and forgive each other in order to obtain forgiveness from God, typically in a Forgiveness Vespers service that Sunday evening.

During Forgiveness Vespers (on Sunday evening) the hangings and vestments in the church are changed to somber Lenten colours to reflect a penitential mood. At the end of the service comes the &quot;Ceremony of Mutual Forgiveness&quot; during which all of the people one by one ask forgiveness of one another, that the Great Fast may begin in a spirit of peace.

===The Great Forty Days===
The forty days of Great Lent last from Clean Monday until the Friday of the Sixth Week. Each of the Sundays of Great Lent has its own special commemoration, though these are not necessarily repeated during the preceding week. An exception is the Week of the Cross (the Fourth Week), during which the theme of the preceding Sunday—the Veneration of the Cross—is repeated throughout the week. The themes introduced in the Pre-Lenten period continue to be developed throughout the forty days.

====Clean Week====

The first week of Great Lent starting on Clean Monday, the first day of Great Lent. The name &quot;Clean Week&quot; refers to the spiritual cleansing each of the faithful is encouraged to undergo through fasting, prayer, repentance, reception of the Holy Mysteries and begging forgiveness of his neighbor. It is also traditionally a time for spring cleaning so that one&#x27;s outward surroundings matches his inward disposition.

Throughout this week fasting is most strict. Those who have the strength are encouraged to fast completely, eating only on Wednesday and Friday evenings, after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to keep such a strict fast are encouraged to eat only a little, and then only xerophagy (see Prodigal Son) once a day. On Monday, no food should be eaten at all and only uncooked food on Tuesday and Thursday. Meals are served on Saturday and Sunday, but these are fasting meals at which meat, dairy products and fish are forbidden.

At Great Compline during the first four days of the Fast (Monday through Thursday) the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete is divided into four parts and one part is chanted each night.

The First Saturday is called &quot;St. Theodore Saturday&quot; in honor of St. Theodore the Recruit, a 4th-century martyr. At the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday (since, liturgically, the day begins at sunset) a special canon to St. Theodore, composed by St. John of Damascus, is chanted. Then the priest blesses kolyva (boiled wheat with honey and raisins) which is distributed to the faithful in commemoration of the following miracle worked by St. Theodore on the First Saturday of Great Lent.

Fifty years after the death of St Theodore, the emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363), as a part of his general policy of persecution of Christians, commanded the governor of Constantinople during the first week of Great Lent to sprinkle all the food provisions in the marketplaces with the blood offered to pagan idols, knowing that the people would be hungry after the strict fasting of the first week. St Theodore appeared in a dream to Archbishop Eudoxius, ordering him to inform all the Christians that no one should buy anything at the marketplaces, but rather to eat cooked wheat with honey (kolyva).

The First Sunday of Great Lent is the Feast of Orthodoxy, which commemorates the restoration of the veneration of icons after the Iconoclast controversy, which is considered to be the triumph of the Church over the last of the great heresies which troubled her (all later heresies being simply a rehashing of earlier ones). Before the Divine Liturgy on this day, a special service, known as the &quot;Triumph of Orthodoxy&quot; is held in cathedrals and major monasteries, at which the &quot;synodicon&quot; (containing anathemas against various heresies, and encomia of those who have held fast to the Christian faith) is proclaimed.

The theme of the day is the victory of the True Faith over heresy. &quot;This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith&quot; (). Also, the icons of the saints bear witness that man, &quot;created in the image and likeness of God&quot; (), may become holy and godlike through the purification of himself as God&#x27;s living image.

The First Sunday of Great Lent originally commemorated the Prophets such as Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The Liturgy&#x27;s Prokeimenon and alleluia verses as well as the Epistle (Hebrews 11:24-26,32-40) and Gospel () readings appointed for the day continue to reflect this older usage.

====Second Week====
The Second Sunday of Great Lent commemorates St. Gregory Palamas, the great defender of the Church&#x27;s doctrine of Hesychasm against its attack by Barlaam of Calabria. The Epistle is Hebrews 1:10-14; 2:1-3 and the Gospel is 

Throughout this week, and until the Sixth Friday in Lent, one meal may be taken a day with xerophagy. Until the Sixth Saturday in Lent, Saturday and Sunday fasting remains the same as in the First Week.

====Third Week====
The Veneration of the Cross is celebrated on the third Sunday. The veneration comes on this day because it is the midpoint of the forty days. The services for this day are similar to those on the Great Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14). During the All-Night Vigil the priest brings the cross out into the center of the church, where it is venerated by the clergy and faithful. It remains in the center of the church through Friday of the week following (the Fourth Week of Great Lent).

The Epistle is and the Gospel is .

====Fourth Week====
This week is celebrated as a sort of afterfeast of the Veneration of the Cross, during which some of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated each day. On Monday and Wednesday of the Fourth Week, a Veneration of the Cross takes place at the First Hour (repeating a portion of the service from the All-Night Vigil of the previous Sunday). On Friday of that week, the veneration takes place after the Ninth Hour, after which the cross is solemnly returned to the sanctuary by the priest and deacon.

The Sunday which ends the fourth week is dedicated to St. John Climacus, whose work, &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot; has been read throughout the Great Lenten Fast.

====Fifth Week====

On Thursday of the Fifth Week, the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete is chanted in its entirety during Orthros. This is the longest Canon of the church year, and during the course of its nine Odes, most every person mentioned in the Bible is called to mind and tied to the theme of repentance. In anticipation of the Canon, Vespers on Wednesday afternoon is longer than normal, with special stichera added in honor of the Great Canon. While the Great Canon itself is recited during Matins for Thursday, this service is usually celebrated by anticipation on the prior Wednesday evening, so that more people can attend.

As a part of the Matins of the Great Canon, the &quot;Life of St. Mary of Egypt&quot; by St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (634 - 638) is read, for her example of repentance and overcoming temptation. On this day also is chanted the famous kontakion, &quot;My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...&quot; by St. Romanos the Melodist. The next day (Thursday morning) a special Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated, and the fast is relaxed slightly (wine and oil are allowed) as consolation after the long service the night before.

Saturday of the Fifth Week is dedicated to the Theotokos (Mother of God), and is known as the &quot;Saturday of the Akathist&quot; because the Akathist to the Theotokos is prescribed to be chanted during Matins on that day, though as with the Great Canon, usually done in anticipation on Friday evening to allow more people to attend. 

The Fifth Sunday is dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt, whose &quot;Life&quot; was read earlier in the week during the Great Canon. At the end of the Divine Liturgy many churches celebrate a &quot;Blessing of Dried Fruit&quot;, in commemoration of St. Mary&#x27;s profound asceticism.

====Sixth Week====

During the Sixth Week the Lenten services are served as they were during the second and third weeks.

Great Lent ends at Vespers on the evening of the Sixth Friday, and the Lenten cycle of Old Testament readings is brought to an end. (Genesis ends with the account of the burial of Joseph, who is a type of Christ.) At that same service, the celebration of Lazarus Saturday begins. The resurrection of Lazarus is understood as a foreshadowing of the Resurrection of Jesus, and many of the Resurrection hymns normally chanted on Sunday (and which will be replaced the next day with hymns for Palm Sunday) are chanted at Matins on the morning of Lazarus Saturday.

Palm Sunday differs from the previous Sundays in that it is one of the Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church. None of the normal Lenten material is chanted on Palm Sunday, and fish, wine and oil are permitted in the trapeza. The blessing of palms (or pussywillow) takes place at Matins on Sunday morning, and everyone stands holding palms and lit candles during the important moments of the service.

This is especially significant at the Great Entrance during the Divine Liturgy on Palm Sunday morning, since liturgically that entrance recreates the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. The themes of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday are tied together, and some of the same hymns (including one of the apolytikia) are chanted on both days. The Holy Week services begin on the night of Palm Sunday, and the liturgical colours are changed from the festive hues of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday back to somber Lenten colours.

===Holy Week===

Although technically, Holy Week is separate from Great Lent, its services mirror those of Great Lent and are contained in the same book, the &quot;Lenten Triodion&quot;. Whereas, during Great Lent each week has its own theme, during Holy Week each day has its own theme, again based upon the Gospel readings for the day:
*Holy and Great Monday—Joseph the all-comely as a type of Christ, and the account of The Fig Tree ()
*Holy and Great Tuesday—the Parable of the Ten Virgins ()
*Holy and Great Wednesday—The anointing of Jesus at Bethany ()

Note that for the previous three days, one meal a day is taken a day with xerophagy.
*Holy and Great Thursday—The Mystical Supper
One meal may be eaten on this day with wine and oil.
*Holy and Great Friday—The Passion ()
No food is to be eaten on this day.
*Holy and Great Saturday—The Burial of Jesus and the Harrowing of Hell ()
One meal may be eaten with xerophagy.

During Holy Week, the order of services is often brought forward by several hours: Matins being celebrated by anticipation the evening before, and Vespers in the morning. This &quot;reversal&quot; is not something mandated by the typicon but has developed out of practical necessity. Since some of the most important readings and liturgical actions take place at Matins, it is celebrated in the evening (rather than early in the morning before dawn, as is usual for Matins) so that more people can attend.

Since during Holy Week Vespers is usually joined to either the Presanctified Liturgy or the Divine Liturgy, and since the faithful must observe a total fast from all food and drink before receiving Holy Communion, it is celebrated in the morning. Vespers on Good Friday is an exception to this, usually being celebrated in late morning or in the afternoon.

The Matins services for Holy Monday through Thursday are referred to as &quot;Bridegroom Prayer&quot; because the troparion of the day and the exapostilarion (the hymn that concludes the Canon) develop the theme of &quot;Christ the Bridegroom&quot;. Thursday has its own troparion, but uses the same exapostilarion. The icon often displayed on these days depicts Jesus and is referred to as &quot;the Bridegroom&quot; because the crown of thorns and the robe of mockery are parallel to the crown and robe worn by a bridegroom on his wedding day.

This icon is often confused with the visually similar icon of Christ as the Man of Sorrows, which shows Him post-Crucifixion in the same pose but lacking the rod and robe, dead, showing the marks of the nails in his Hands and the spear wound in His side. Incidentally, Thursday has its own icon showing either the Mystical Supper or the Washing of Feet, or both. The Passion of Christ is seen as the wedding of the Saviour with his bride, the Church.

====Holy Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday====
The first three days of Holy Week (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), the services all follow the same pattern and are nearly identical to the order followed on weekdays during the Great Forty Days; however, the number of Kathismata (sections from the Psalter) is reduced and the Old Testament readings are taken from different books. The Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated on each of the first three days, and there is a Gospel reading at each one (during the Forty Days there was no Gospel reading unless it was a feast day). There is also a Gospel reading at Matins on each day and the Canon chanted at Matins is much shorter, consisting of only three or four odes rather than the usual nine.

In addition to the Gospel readings at Matins and Vespers, there is a reading of all four Gospels which takes place during the Little Hours (Third Hour, Sixth Hour and Ninth Hour) on these first three days. Each Gospel is read in its entirety and in order, beginning with , and continuing through (the rest of the Gospel of John will be read during the remainder of Holy Week). The Gospels are divided up into nine sections with one section being read by the priest at each of the Little Hours.

The Prayer of Saint Ephrem is said for the last time at the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Holy and Great Wednesday. From this moment on, there will be no more prostrations made in the church (aside from those made before the epitaphios) until Vespers on the afternoon of Pentecost.

In some churches, the Holy Mystery (Sacrament) of Unction is celebrated on Holy and Great Wednesday, in commemoration of the anointing of Jesus&#x27; feet in preparation for his burial ().

The remaining three days of Holy Week retain a smaller degree of Lenten character, but each has elements that are unique to it.

====Holy (Maundy) Thursday====
Holy and Great Thursday is a more festive day than the others of Holy Week in that it celebrates the institution of the Eucharist. The hangings in the church and the vestments of the clergy are changed from dark Lenten hues to more festive colours (red, in the Russian tradition).

Whereas the Divine Liturgy is forbidden on other Lenten weekdays, the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil (combined with Vespers) is celebrated on this day. Many of the standard hymns of the Liturgy are replaced with the Troparion of Great Thursday. In some churches, the Holy Table (altar) is covered with a simple white linen cloth, in commemoration of the Mystical Supper (Last Supper).

During this Divine Liturgy, the reserved Mysteries are renewed (a new Lamb being consecrated, and the old Body and Blood of Christ being consumed by the deacon after the Liturgy). Also, when the supply of Chrism runs low, it is at this Liturgy that the heads of the autocephalous churches will Sanctify new Chrism, After the Little Entrance the Gospel reading is a concatenation of the four Evangelists&#x27; accounts of the Crucifixion and the Descent from the Cross. At the point during the reading which mentions Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, two clergymen approach the large cross in the center of the church, remove the &quot;soma&quot;, wrap it in a piece of white linen, and carry it into the sanctuary.

Later, during the Troparion, the clergy carry the epitaphios (a cloth icon symbolizing the winding sheet in which Jesus was prepared for burial) into the center of the church, where it is venerated by all the faithful. Special chants and prayers and chanted along with biblical readings and psalms chanted.

That night, the Matins of Lamentation is normally celebrated in the evening. At this service, special hymns and prayers are chanted. The Lamentations of Great and Holy Friday are the main chants of the service. The Lamentation Praises are chanted to very movingly beautiful ancient tones and words which reflect the lament of the Theotokos over her son Christ. The epitaphios is placed on a beautifully ornate and decorate catafalque or bier before the Lamentations representing the tomb of Christ.

The priest then sprinkles rosewater and fresh rose petals all over the tomb, the congregation, and the temple/church. A procession with the ornate tomb then takes place around the church and back into the church where it will be venerated by everyone. As more special prayers and chants are sung especially the chant: &quot;The Noble Joseph...&quot; as the service finishes.

====Holy Saturday====
Holy and Great Saturday (known also as the Great Sabbath, because on it Jesus &quot;rested&quot; from his labours on the Cross) combines elements of deep sorrow and exultant joy. This, like Good Friday is also a day of strict fasting, though a meal may be served after the Divine Liturgy at which wine (but not oil) may be used.

The Matins of Lamentation (usually celebrated on Friday evening) resembles the Byzantine Rite funeral service, in that its main component is the chanting of Psalm 118 (the longest Psalm in the Bible), each verse of which is interspersed with laudations (&quot;ainoi&quot;) of the dead Christ. The service takes place with the clergy and people gathered around the epitaphios in the center of the church. Everyone stands holding lighted candles during the psalm. Next are chanted the &quot;Evlogitaria of the Resurrection&quot;, hymns which are normally chanted only on Sundays.

This is the first liturgical mention of the impending Resurrection of Jesus. At the end of the Great Doxology the epitaphios is carried in procession around the outside of the church, as is the body at a priest&#x27;s funeral, and then is brought back in. By local custom, the clergy may raise the epitaphios at the door so that all may pass under it as they enter in, symbolically entering into the death and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospel () is not read at its usual place during Matins, but rather, following readings of the vision in Ezekiel of the dry bones returning to life and an Epistle, near the end of the service, in front of the epitaphios.

The next morning (Saturday), the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated (combined with Vespers). At the beginning of the service, the hangings and vestments are still black. The service is much longer than usual, and includes 15 Old Testament readings recounting the history of salvation, including two canticles, the Song of Moses and the Song of the Three Holy Children, and showing types of the death and resurrection of Jesus.

Many parts of the liturgy which are normally performed in front of the Holy Doors are instead done in front of the epitaphios. Just before the Gospel reading, the hangings and vestments are changed to white, and the entire atmosphere of the service is transformed from sorrow to joy. In the Greek practice, the priest strews the entire church with fresh bay leaves, symbolizing Christ&#x27;s victory over death. This service symbolizes the descent of Christ into Hades and the Harrowing of Hell.

Thus, according to Byzantine Rite theology, Jesus&#x27; salvific work on the Cross has been accomplished, and the righteous departed in the Bosom of Abraham have been released from their bondage; however, the Good News of the Resurrection has not yet been proclaimed to the living on earth, the celebration of which commences at midnight with Matins. For this reason, neither is the fast broken nor the Paschal greeting exchanged.

At the end of the Divine Liturgy, the priest blesses wine and bread which are distributed to the faithful. This is different from the Sacred Mysteries (Holy Communion) which were received earlier in the service. This bread and wine are simply blessed, not consecrated. They are a remnant of the ancient tradition of the church (still observed in some places) whereby the faithful did not leave the church after the service, but were each given a glass of wine, and some bread and dried fruit to give them strength for the vigil ahead. They would listen to the reading of the Acts of the Apostles, read in full, and await the beginning of the Paschal Vigil. However, this is not usually done nowadays.

The last liturgical service in the Lenten Triodion is the Midnight Office which forms the first part of the Paschal Vigil. During this service the Canon of Great Saturday is repeated, near the end of which, during the ninth ode, the priest and deacon take the epitaphios into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors and lay it on the Holy Table (altar), where it remains until the feast of the Ascension. After the concluding prayers and a dismissal, all of the lights and candles in the church are extinguished, and all wait in silence and darkness for the stroke of midnight, following which the Pentecostarion replaces the Lenten Triodion, commencing with the resurrection of Christ being proclaimed.

<text>Arms trafficking or gunrunning is the illicit trade of contraband small arms, explosives, and ammunition, which constitutes part of a broad range of illegal activities often associated with transnational criminal organizations. The illegal trade of small arms, unlike other organized crime commodities, is more closely associated with exercising power in communities instead of achieving economic gain. Scholars estimate illegal arms transactions amount to over US$1 billion annually.

To keep track of imports and exports of several of the most dangerous armament categories, the United Nations, in 1991, created a Register for Conventional Arms. Participation, however, is not compulsory, and lacks comprehensive data in regions outside of Europe. Africa, due to a prevalence of corrupt officials and loosely enforced trade regulations, is a region with extensive illicit arms activity. In a resolution to complement the Register with legally binding obligations, a Firearms Protocol was incorporated into the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, which requires states to improve systems that control trafficked ammunition and firearms.

The 1999 Report of the UN Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms provides a more refined and precise definition, which has become internationally accepted. This distinguishes between small arms (revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, submachine guns, assault rifles, and light machine guns), which are weapons designed for personal use, and light weapons (heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of calibres less than 100 mm), which are designed for use by several persons serving as a unit. Ammunition and explosives also form an integral part of small arms and light weapons used in conflict.

==Impact==
===Areas===
Although arms trafficking is widespread in regions of political turmoil, it is not limited to such areas, and for example, in South Asia, an estimated 63 million guns have been trafficked into India and Pakistan.

The suppression of gunrunning is one of the areas of interest in the context of international law. In the United Nations, there has been widespread support to implement international legislation to prevent arms trafficking, however, it has been difficult to implement, due to many different factors that allow for arms trafficking to occur.

In the United States, the term &quot;Iron Pipeline&quot; is sometimes used to describe Interstate Highway 95 and its connector highways as a corridor for arms trafficking into the New York City Metro Area.

===United States===

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Confederacy lacked the financial and manufacturing capacity to wage war against the industrial and prosperous North. The Union Navy was enforcing the blockade along 3,500 miles of coast in the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico to prevent the smuggling of any material from or into the South. In order to increase its arsenal, the Confederacy looked to Britain as a major source of arms. British merchants and bankers funded the purchase of arms and construction of ships being outfitted as blockade runners which later carried war supplies bound for Southern ports. The chief figures for these acts were Confederate foreign agents James Dunwoody Bulloch and Charles K. Prioleau and Fraser, Trenholm and Co. based in Liverpool, England and merchants in Glasgow, Scotland. The smuggling of arms into the South by blockade runners carrying British supplies were easily facilitated using ports in the British colonies of Canada and the Bahamas, where the Union Navy could not enter. A British publication in 1862 summed up the country&#x27;s involvement in blockade running:
Score after score of the finest, swiftest British steamers and ships, loaded with British material of war of every description, cannon, rifles by the hundreds of thousand, powder by the thousand of tons, shot, shell, cartridges, swords, etc, with cargo after cargo of clothes, boots, shoes, blankets, medicines and supplies of every kind, all paid for by British money, at the sole risk of British adventurers, well insured by Lloyds and under the protection of the British flag, have been sent across the ocean to the insurgents by British agency.
It was estimated the Confederates received thousands of tons of gunpowder, half a million rifles, and several hundred cannons from British blockade runners. As a result, due to blockade running operating from Britain, the war was escalated by two years in which 400,000 additional soldiers and civilians on both sides were killed. Under U.S. law and Article 10 of the 1842 U.S.–UK extradition treaty (Webster-Ashburton Treaty) at the time, President Abraham Lincoln had the power to prosecute gunrunners (Americans and foreigners alike) and request Britain to hand over its arms traffickers engaged in &quot;Piracy&quot;, but the British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Lyons, threatened retaliation if British smugglers were subject to criminal prosecution. As a result, Lincoln was forced to release the captured British blockade runners instead of prosecuting them to avoid a diplomatic fallout, a move that led to the released crew joining another blockade-running expedition.

Ulysses S. Grant III, President of the American Civil War Centennial in 1961, remarked for example:
[B]etween October 26, 1864 and January 1865, it was still possible for 8,632,000 lbs of meat, 1,507,000 lbs of lead, 1,933,000 lbs of saltpeter, 546,000 pairs of shoes, 316,000 blankets, half a million pounds of coffee, 69,000 rifles, and 43 cannon to run the blockade into the port of Wilmington alone, while cotton sufficient to pay for these purchases was exported[. I]t is evident that the blockade runners made an important contribution to the Confederate effort to carry on.
===Mexico===

During the Mexican Revolution, gunrunning into Mexico reached rampant levels with the majority of the arms being smuggled from the United States. As Mexico manufactured no weapons of its own, acquiring arms and ammunition were one of the main concerns of the various rebels, intent on armed revolution. Under American law at the time, arms smugglers into Mexico could be prosecuted only if one was caught &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; crossing the border as merely buying arms with the intention of gunrunning into Mexico was not a criminal offense. Given the length and often rugged terrain of the American-Mexican border, the undermanned American border service simply could not stop the massive gunrunning into Mexico.

In February 1913-February 1914, President Woodrow Wilson imposed an arms embargo on both sides of the Mexican civil war, and not until February 1914 was the embargo lifted on arms sales to the Constitutionalist rebels. Despite the arms embargo, there was much gunrunning into Mexico, as one American official complained in 1913: &quot;our border towns are practically their commissary and quartermaster depots&quot;. Guns were smuggled into Mexico via barrels, coffins, and false bottoms of automobiles. General Huerta avoided the American arms embargo by buying weapons from Germany.

===Philippines===
Aside from internal theft and cross-border smuggling, criminals and insurgents in the Philippines source weapons from unlicensed workshops making firearms ranging from imitations of the 1911 pistol to single-shot .50 BMG long guns. 
=== Africa ===
==== Liberia and Sierra Leone conflicts ====
The civil war in Sierra Leone lasted from 1991 to 2002, and left 75,000 people dead. Gunrunning played a significant role in this conflict. Weapons of all sorts were shipped to all sides in both Sierra Leone, and Liberia from abroad. These included small arms, such as, pistols, assault rifles, grenades, Claymores, knives, machetes, etc. Larger weapons such as missiles, light machine guns, mortars, anti-tank missiles, tanks, and planes were also used. During this time a civil war was occurring in nearby Liberia. The Liberian Civil Wars took place from 1989 through 1997. The war was between the existing government and the National Patriotic Front. Leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, Charles Taylor, helped to create the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone. Taylor was the recipient of thousands of illegally trafficked arms from eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine). Taylor then sold some of these weapons to the RUF in exchange for diamonds. President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, &quot;directly facilitated Liberia&#x27;s arms-for-diamonds trade&quot; with Liberia and Sierra Leone. Compaore would give guns to Taylor, who would then sell them to the RUF in exchange for diamonds. These blood diamonds would then be sold back to Compaore for more guns. The cyclical exchange allowed Compaore the ability to deny directly sending arms to Sierra Leone.

The Liberian government received arms through an elaborate front company in Guinea. The arms were intended to be shipped (legally) from Uganda to Slovakia. However, the arms were diverted to Guinea as a part of &quot;an elaborate bait and switch&quot;. Additionally the British government &quot;encouraged Sandline International, a private security firm and non state entity, to supply arms and ammunitions to the loyal forces of the exiled government of President Kabbah.&quot; Sandline proceeded 35 tons of arms from Bulgaria, to Kabbah&#x27;s forces.

====The South Sudanese civil war====
Ever since the South Sudanese civil war began in December 2013, gunrunning into that nation has reached rampant levels. As South Sudan has hardly any electricity and no manufacturing, both sides were entirely dependent upon buying arms from abroad to fight their war. President Salva Kiir Mayardit used shadowy networks of arms dealers from China, Uganda, Israel, Egypt and Ukraine to arm his forces. As oil companies paid rent for their concessions in South Sudan, the government was able to afford to buy arms on a lavish scale. In June 2014, the government&#x27;s National Security Service signed a deal worth $264 million US dollars with a Seychelles-based shell company to buy 30 tanks, 50,000 AK-47 assault rifles and 20 million bullets. The owner of the shell company currently remains unknown. In July 2014, the Chinese arms manufacturer Norinco delivered a shipment to South Sudan of 95,000 assault rifles and 20 million rounds of ammunition, supplying enough bullets to kill every person in South Sudan twice over. The American arms dealer and private military contractor, Erik Prince, sold to the government for $43 million three Mi-24 attack helicopters and two L-39 jets together with the services of Hungarian mercenary pilots to operate the aircraft. The majority of the arms supplied to South Sudan from Uganda originated from Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, all which are members of the European Union (EU), and were supposed to abide by an EU arms embargo placed on South Sudan in 2011.  

Less is known about the very secretive arms dealers supplying the rebel Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) led by Riek Machar other than that the majority of the gunrunners appeared to be European. A rare exception was with the Franco-Polish arms dealer Pierre Dadak who was arrested on 14 July 2016 at his villa in Ibiza on charges of gunrunning into South Sudan. At his villa, the Spanish National Police Corps allege that they found documents showing he was negotiating to sell Machar 40,000 AK-47 assault rifles, 30,000 PKM machine guns and 200,000 boxes of ammunition.

The United Nations Panel of Experts on South Sudan in a 2017 report declared: &quot;Reports from independent sources indicate that the border areas between South Sudan and the Sudan and Uganda remain key entry points for arms, with some unsubstantiated reports of smaller numbers of weapons also crossing into South Sudan from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are also persistent reports and public accusations of shipments to forces affiliated with the leadership in Juba from further afield, specifically from Egypt&quot;. The same report stated that a Ukrainian Air Force IL-76 transport jet flew in two L-39 jets to Uganda on 27 January 2017 in the full knowledge the L-39 jets were intended to go on to South Sudan, thereby violating the arms embargo Ukraine had placed on arms sales to South Sudan. In 2018, the United Nations Security Council imposed a worldwide arms embargo on South Sudan, but the embargo has been widely ignored where despite a ceasefire signed the same year, both sides have continued to import arms on a massive scale, suggesting that they are preparing for another bout of the civil war.

=== Europe ===

Since 1996, countries throughout Europe have taken notice of arms trafficking. Europe has been an overall large exporter of illicit weapons with the United Kingdom, Germany, and France in the national lead for the most exports. Imports to Europe from 2004 to 2013 have decreased by 25%, with the United Kingdom importing the most overall in Europe. The firearms that are imported and passed around are commonly small arms and lighter weapons (SALW) compared to large machinery, such as tanks and aircraft. The SALW bought in Europe tends to be secondhand weapons that are cheap and regularly available. Gun cultures, such as in Germany, where the &quot;taken-for-granted cultural practice of carrying a handgun,&quot; increases illicit SALW because guns are viewed as a way to enhance masculinity and status. In 2000, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) started on regional solutions and security measures to address the firearms trafficking problem.

==Global market value==
Though one of the least profitable illegal trades, arms trafficking made an estimated $1.7-3.5 billion in 2014, making it the 9th largest criminal market, which was valued at $1.6-2.2 trillion.

The AK-47 is one of the most appealing weapons in the illegal weapons trade due to its low cost and reliability. In Iraq, a smuggled AK-47 typically costs $150–300. In the first sixth months of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the influx of new weapons lowered the AK-47&#x27;s price, to the point the weapon was sold for as low as $25, or sometimes, nothing. Comparatively, AK-47s sold on the Dark web in the United States can cost as much as $3,600, as the price of illegal arms is increased greatly by the distance it must travel, due to the induced risk. A handgun trafficked from the United States to Canada can have its price increase by 560% from just crossing the border. Weapons smuggled overseas will usually take several, short trips with multiple companies to mask the country of origin and the original sellers.

In the United States, biker gangs have been connected to arms trafficking. United States law enforcement agencies started investigating bike gangs in the late 90s, and started classifying them as organized criminal organizations. This was mainly due to the fact that they were able to get control of the prostitution market and the smuggling of stolen goods such as weapons, motorcycles, and car parts.

== Regulation ==
Prosecuting arms traffickers and brokers has proven difficult due to loopholes in national laws. In 2000, Israeli arms dealer Leonid Minin was arrested in Italy for drug possession, and while serving his sentence, Italian police found over 1,500 pages of forged end-user certificates and transfers of money which implicated him in trafficking arms to the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone. Minin was released in December 2002, as according to Italian law, he could not be tried because the weapons he had sold had never reached Italy. Additionally, some arms dealers will operate in countries where they cannot be extradited. Arms traffickers are also able to evade capture due to a lack of co-operation between nations, especially in Africa and ex-Soviet states.

== Related theories ==
In the international criminal scholarly community, rational choice theory is commonly referenced in explanations as to why individuals engage in and justify criminal activity. According to Jana Arsovska and Panos Kostakos, leading scholars on organized crime, the causes of arms trafficking are not solely based on rational choice theory but rather have been more closely linked to the intimacy of one&#x27;s personal social networks as well as the &quot;perception of risks, effort and rewards in violating criminal laws.&quot;

==In popular culture==
===Film===
*&quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005), a crime war film in which Nicolas Cage plays a fictional arms dealer named Yuri Orlov, who was based on the real Viktor Bout. The film was endorsed by Amnesty International for highlighting arms trafficking. &quot;Lord of War&#x27;s&quot; DVD release featured &quot;Making a Killing: Inside the International Arms Trade,&quot; a 15-minute documentary about arms trafficking.
*&quot;War Dogs&quot; (2016), a dark comedy drama biographical film based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America&#x27;s allies in Afghanistan and later became involved in arms trafficking.

===Television===

<text>Zhores Ivanovich Alferov (; ; 15 March 19301 March 2019) was a Soviet and Russian physicist and academic who contributed significantly to the creation of modern heterostructure physics and electronics. He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for the development of the semiconductor heterojunction for optoelectronics. He also became a politician in his later life, serving in the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, as a member of the Communist Party from 1995.

==Early life and education==
Alferov was born in Vitebsk, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union, to a Russian father, Ivan Karpovich Alferov, a factory manager, and a Jewish mother, Anna Vladimirovna Rosenblum. He was named after French socialist Jean Jaurès while his older brother was named Marx after Karl Marx. Alferov graduated from secondary school in Minsk in 1947 and enrolled in the Belarusian Polytechnic Academy. In 1952, he received his B.S. from the V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Electrotechnical Institute (LETI) in Leningrad. Starting in 1953, Alferov worked in the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. From the institute, he earned several scientific degrees: a Candidate of Sciences in Technology in 1961 and a Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Mathematics in 1970.

Alferov then served as the director of the Ioffe Institute from 1987 to 2003. He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1972, and a full member in 1979. From 1989, he was Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences and President of its Saint Petersburg Scientific Center. 

==Research==
Starting at Ioffe Institute in 1953, Alferov worked with a group led by Vladimir Tuchkevich, who became director of the Ioffe Institute in 1967, on planar semiconductor amplifiers for use in radio receivers. These planar semiconductor amplifiers would be referred to as transistors in the present day. Alferov&#x27;s contribution included work on germanium diodes for use as a rectifier.

In the early 1960s, Alferov organized an effort at Ioffe Institute to develop semiconductor heterostructures. Semiconductor heterojunctions transistors enabled higher frequency use than their homojunction predecessors, and this capability plays a key role in modern mobile phone and satellite communications. Alferov and colleagues worked on GaAs and AlAs III-V heterojunctions. A particular focus was the use of heterojunctions to create semiconductor lasers capable of lasing at room temperature. In 1963, Alferov filed a patent application proposing double-heterostructure lasers; Herbert Kroemer independently filed a US patent several months later. In 1966, Alferov&#x27;s lab created the first lasers based on heterostructures, although they did not lase continuously. Then in 1968, Alferov and coworkers produced the first continuous-wave semiconductor heterojunction laser operating at room temperature. This achievement came a month ahead of Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of Bell Labs also producing a continuous-wave room-temperature heterojunction laser.

It was for this work that Alferov received the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Herbert Kroemer, &quot;for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and optoelectronics&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s Alferov continued his work on the physics and technology of semiconductor heterostructures in his lab at the Ioffe Institute. Alferov&#x27;s investigations of injection properties of semiconductors and his contributions to the development of lasers, solar cells, LEDs, and epitaxy processes, led to the creation of modern heterojunction physics and electronics. The development of semiconductor heterojunctions revolutionized semiconductor design, and had a range of immediate commercial applications including LEDs, barcode readers and CDs. Hermann Grimmeiss of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said: &quot;Without Alferov, it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the Earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities.&quot;

Alferov had an almost messianic conception of heterostructures, writing: &quot;Many scientists have contributed to this remarkable progress, which not only determines in large measure the future prospects of solid state physics but in a certain sense affects the future of human society as well.&quot;

==Scientific administration==

In 1987, Alferov became the fifth director of the Ioffe Institute. In 1989, Alferov gained the administrative position of chairman of the Leningrad Scientific Center, now referred to as the St. Petersburg Scientific Center. In the Leningrad region, this scientific center is an overarching organization comprising 70 institutions, organizations, enterprises, and scientific societies.

Alferov worked to foster relationships between early educational institutions and scientific research institutions to train the next generation of scientists, citing Peter the Great&#x27;s vision for the Russian Academy of Sciences to be organized with a scientific research core in close contact with a gymnasium (secondary school). In 1987, Alferov and colleagues at the Ioffe Institute established a secondary school in Saint Petersburg, the School of Physics and Technology, under the umbrella of the Ioffe charter. In 1997 Alferov founded the Research and Education Center at the Ioffe Institute and in 2002, this center officially became the Saint Petersburg Academic University after gaining a charter to award masters and PhD degrees.

In the 2000s, through his role in academic administration and in parliament, Alferov advocated for and worked to advance Russia&#x27;s nanotechnology sector. The primary research charter of the Saint Petersburg Academic University, which Alferov founded, was the development of nanotechnology. Alferov provided a consistent voice in parliament in favor of increased scientific funding. In 2006, Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov announced the creation of a federal agency, Rosnanotekh to pursue nanotechnology applications.

==Political activity==
Alferov was elected to the Russian Parliament, the State Duma, in 1995 as a deputy for the political party Our Home – Russia, generally considered to be supportive of the policies of President Boris Yeltsin. In 1999 he was elected again, this time on the list of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. He was re-elected in 2003 and again in 2007, when he was placed second on the party&#x27;s federal electoral list behind Gennady Zyuganov and ahead of Nikolai Kharitonov, even though he was not a member of the party.

==Non-profit service==
Alferov served on the advisory council of CRDF Global.

==Illness and death==
Since November 2018, Alferov suffered from hypertensive emergency. He died at the age of 88 on 1 March 2019. 

==Personal life== 
Alferov&#x27;s wife was named Tamara Darskaya. Together they had two children, a son Ivan and a daughter Olga.

Alferov was an atheist and expressed objections to religious education. He was one of the signers of the open letter to President Vladimir Putin from members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation of Russia.

<text>Yaroslav I Vladimirovich ( 978 – 20 February 1054), better known as Yaroslav the Wise, was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1019 until his death in 1054. He was also earlier Prince of Novgorod from 1010 to 1034 and Prince of Rostov from 987 to 1010, uniting the principalities for a time. Yaroslav&#x27;s baptismal name was George after Saint George.

Yaroslav was a son of Vladimir the Great and Rogneda of Polotsk. Yaroslav ruled the northern lands around Rostov before being transferred to Novgorod in 1010. He had a strained relationship with his father and refused to pay tribute to Kiev in 1014. Following Vladimir&#x27;s death in 1015, Yaroslav waged a complicated war for the Kievan throne against his half-brother Sviatopolk, ultimately emerging victorious in 1019.

As the Grand Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav focused on foreign policy, forming alliances with Scandinavian countries and weakening Byzantine influence on Kiev. He successfully captured the area around present-day Tartu, Estonia, establishing the fort of Yuryev, and forced nearby regions to pay tribute. Yaroslav also defended his state against nomadic tribes such as the Pechenegs by constructing a line of forts. He was a patron of literary culture, sponsoring the construction of Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037 and promoting the first work of Old East Slavic literature by Hilarion of Kiev.

Yaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter in 1019 and had several children who married into foreign royal families. His children from his second marriage went on to rule various parts of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Yaroslav was known for promoting unity among his children and emphasizing the importance of living in peace. After his death, his body was placed in a sarcophagus within Saint Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral, but his remains were later lost or stolen. Yaroslav&#x27;s legacy includes founding several towns and having numerous monuments and institutions named after him.

==Rise to the throne==
The early years of Yaroslav&#x27;s life are mostly unknown. He was one of the numerous sons of Vladimir the Great, presumably his second by Rogneda of Polotsk, although his actual age (as stated in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and corroborated by the examination of his skeleton in the 1930s) would place him among the youngest children of Vladimir.

It has been suggested that he was a child begotten out of wedlock after Vladimir&#x27;s divorce from Rogneda and marriage to Anna Porphyrogenita, or even that he was a child of Anna Porphyrogenita herself. French historian Jean-Pierre Arrignon argues that he was indeed Anna&#x27;s son, as this would explain his interference in Byzantine affairs in 1043. William Humphreys also favors a reconstruction making Yaroslav the son, rather than the step-son, of Anna, by invoking onomastic arguments. It is curious that Yaroslav named his elder son Vladimir (after his own father) and one of his daughters Anna (as if after his own mother). There is a certain pattern in his sons having Slavic names, and his daughters having Greek names only. Furthermore, Yaroslav&#x27;s maternity by Rogneda of Polotsk had been questioned by Mykola Kostomarov in the 19th century. 

Yaroslav figures prominently in the Norse sagas under the name Jarisleif the Lame; his legendary lameness (probably resulting from an arrow wound) was corroborated by the scientists who examined his remains.

In his youth, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule the northern lands around Rostov. He was transferred to Veliky Novgorod, as befitted a senior heir to the throne, in 1010. While living there, he founded the town of Yaroslavl (literally, &quot;Yaroslav&#x27;s&quot;) on the Volga River. His relations with his father were apparently strained, and grew only worse on the news that Vladimir bequeathed the Kievan throne to his younger son, Boris. In 1014 Yaroslav refused to pay tribute to Kiev and only Vladimir&#x27;s death, in July 1015, prevented a war.

During the next four years Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk I of Kiev, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Bolesław I the Brave (King of Poland from 1025). During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; accused Sviatopolk of planning those murders. The saga is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris&#x27; assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.

However, the victim&#x27;s name is given there as &quot;Burizaf&quot;, which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav&#x27;s struggle against Sviatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish duke), and not against Boris.

Yaroslav defeated Sviatopolk in their first battle, in 1016, and Sviatopolk fled to Poland. Sviatopolk returned in 1018 with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law, seized Kiev, and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. Yaroslav prevailed over Sviatopolk, and in 1019 firmly established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians, who had helped him to gain the Kievan throne, numerous freedoms and privileges.

Thus, the foundation of the Novgorod Republic was laid. For their part, the Novgorodians respected Yaroslav more than they did other Kievan princes; and the princely residence in their city, next to the marketplace (and where the often convened) was named Yaroslav&#x27;s Court after him. It probably was during this period that Yaroslav promulgated the first code of laws in the lands of the East Slavs, the .

==Reign==

===Power struggles between siblings===
Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav&#x27;s claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of his brothers, Nestor the Chronicler and later Russian historians often presented him as a model of virtue, styling him &quot;the Wise&quot;. A less appealing side of his personality is revealed by his having imprisoned his youngest brother Sudislav for life. In response, another brother, Mstislav of Chernigov, whose distant realm bordered the North Caucasus and the Black Sea, hastened to Kiev.

Despite reinforcements led by Yaroslav&#x27;s brother-in-law King Anund Jacob of Sweden (as &quot;Yakun&quot; - &quot;blind and dressed in a gold suit&quot; or &quot;handsome and dressed in a gold suit&quot;) Mstislav inflicted a heavy defeat on Yaroslav in 1024. Yaroslav and Mstislav then divided Kievan Rus&#x27; between them: the area stretched east from the Dnieper River, with the capital at Chernigov, was ceded to Mstislav until his death in 1036.

===Allies along the Baltic coast===
In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on a Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Olaf the Swede made an alliance with Yaroslav, even though the alliance was not liked in Sweden, in order to declare war against Olaf II of Norway. This was sealed in 1019 when King Olof of Sweden married his daughter to Yaroslav instead of the Norwegian king. That led to protests in Sweden because the Swedes wanted to reestablish control over their lost eastern territories and bring in tribute from Kievan Rus&#x27;, as his father Eric the Victorious had, but after years of war against Norway, Sweden no longer had the power to collect regular tributes from Kievan Rus&#x27;, according to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. In 1022 Olaf was deposed and forced to give power to his son Anund Jakob.

He defended the Eastern countries from invaders, ensuring Swedish military interests.

In a successful military raid in 1030, he captured Tartu, Estonia and renamed it Yuryev (named after Yury, Yaroslav&#x27;s patron saint) and forced the surrounding Ugandi County to pay annual tribute.

In 1031, he conquered Cherven cities from the Poles followed by the construction of Sutiejsk to guard the newly acquired lands. In c.1034 Yaroslav concluded an alliance with Polish King Casimir I the Restorer, sealed by the latter&#x27;s marriage to Yaroslav&#x27;s sister, Maria.

Yaroslav&#x27;s eldest son, Vladimir, ruled in Novgorod from 1034 and supervised relations in the north.

Later in Yaroslav&#x27;s reign, around c.1035, Ingvar the Far-Travelled, Anund Jakob&#x27;s jarl, sent Swedish soldiers into Kievan Rus due to Olof&#x27;s son wanting to assist his father&#x27;s ally Yaroslav in his wars against the Pechenegs and Byzantines. Later, in c.1041 Anund Jakob tried to reestablish Swedish control over the Eastern trade routes and reopen them. The Georgian annals report 1000 men coming into Georgia but the original force was likely much larger, around 3,000 men.

Ingvar&#x27;s fate is unknown, but he was likely captured in battle during the Byzantine campaigns or killed, supposedly in 1041. Only one ship returned to Sweden, according to the legend.

===Campaign against Byzantium===

Yaroslav presented his second direct challenge to Constantinople in 1043, when a Rus&#x27; flotilla headed by one of his sons appeared near Constantinople and demanded money, threatening to attack the city otherwise. Whatever the reason, the Byzantines refused to pay and preferred to fight. The Rus&#x27; flotilla defeated the Byzantine fleet but was almost destroyed by a storm and came back to Kiev empty-handed.

===Protecting the inhabitants of the Dnieper from the Pechenegs===

To defend his state from the Pechenegs and other nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of forts, composed of Yuriev, Bohuslav, Kaniv, Korsun, and Pereyaslavl. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1036, who thereafter were never a threat to Kiev, he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037.

In 1037 the monasteries of Saint George and Saint Irene were built, named after patron saints of Yaroslav and his wife. Some mentioned and other celebrated monuments of his reign such as the Golden Gate of Kiev were destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, but later restored.

===Establishment of law===

Yaroslav was a notable patron of literary culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Slavic monk, Hilarion of Kiev, proclaimed the metropolitan bishop of Kiev, thus challenging the Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Hilarion&#x27;s discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old East Slavic literature.

==Family life and posterity==
In 1019, Yaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter, daughter of Olof Skötkonung, the king of Sweden. He gave Ladoga to her as a marriage gift.

Saint Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral in Kiev houses a fresco representing the whole family: Yaroslav, Irene (as Ingegerd was known in Rus&#x27;), their four daughters and six sons. Yaroslav had at least three of his daughters married to foreign princes who lived in exile at his court:
* Elisiv of Kiev to Harald Hardrada (who attained her hand by his military exploits in the Byzantine Empire);
* Anastasia of Kiev to the future Andrew I of Hungary;
* Anne of Kiev married Henry I of France and was the regent of France during their son&#x27;s minority (she was Yaroslav the Wise&#x27;s most beloved daughter);
* (possibly) Agatha, wife of Edward the Exile, of the royal family of England, the mother of Edgar the Ætheling and Saint Margaret of Scotland.

Yaroslav had one son from the first marriage (his Christian name being Ilya (?–1020)), and six sons from the second marriage. Apprehending the danger that could ensue from divisions between brothers, he exhorted them to live in peace with each other. The eldest of these, Vladimir of Novgorod, best remembered for building the Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod, predeceased his father. Vladimir succeeded Yaroslav as prince of Novgorod in 1034.

Three other sons—Iziaslav I, Sviatoslav II, and Vsevolod I—reigned in Kiev one after another. The youngest children of Yaroslav were Igor Yaroslavich (1036–1060) of Volhynia and Vyacheslav Yaroslavich (1036–1057) of the Principality of Smolensk. There is almost no information about Vyacheslav. Some documents point out the fact of him having a son, Boris Vyacheslavich, who challenged Vsevolod I sometime in 1077–1078.

==Grave==
Following his death, the body of Yaroslav the Wise was entombed in a white marble sarcophagus within Saint Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1936, the sarcophagus was opened and found to contain the skeletal remains of two individuals, one male and one female. The male was determined to be Yaroslav. The identity of the female was never established, though some believe them to be those of Yaroslav&#x27;s spouse Ingegerd. The sarcophagus was again opened in 1939 and the remains removed for research, not being documented as returned until 1964.

In 2009, the sarcophagus was opened and surprisingly found to contain only one skeleton, that of a female. It seems the documents detailing the 1964 reinterment of the remains were falsified to hide the fact that Yaroslav&#x27;s remains had been lost. Subsequent questioning of individuals involved in the research and reinterment of the remains seems to point to the idea that Yaroslav&#x27;s remains were purposely hidden prior to the German occupation of Ukraine and then either lost completely or stolen and transported to the United States, where many ancient religious artifacts were placed to avoid &quot;mistreatment&quot; by the communists.

==Legacy==
Four towns in four countries were named after Yaroslav, three of which he also founded: Yaroslavl (in today&#x27;s Russia), Jarosław in Poland, Yuryev (now Bila Tserkva, Ukraine), and another Yuryev in place of conquered Tarbatu (now Tartu) between 1030 and 1061 in Estonia. Following the Russian custom of naming military objects such as tanks and planes after historical figures, the helmet worn by many Russian soldiers during the Crimean War was called the &quot;Helmet of Yaroslav the Wise&quot;. It was the first pointed helmet to be used by a modern army, even before German troops wore pointed helmets.

In 2008 Yaroslav was placed first (with 40% of the votes) in their ranking of &quot;our greatest compatriots&quot; by the viewers of the TV show . Afterwards, one of the producers of The Greatest Ukrainians claimed that Yaroslav had only won because of vote manipulation and that (if that had been prevented) the real first place would have been awarded to Stepan Bandera.

In 2003, a monument to Yaroslav the Wise was erected in Kyiv, Ukraine. The creators of the monument are Boris Krylov and Oles Sydoruk. There is also a Yaroslavska Street in Kiev, and there are various streets named after him in cities throughout Ukraine.

The Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University in Kharkiv is named after him.

&quot;Iron Lord&quot; was a 2010 feature film based on Yaroslav&#x27;s early life as a regional prince on the frontier.

On December 12, 2022, on the Constitution Day of the Russian Federation, a monument to Yaroslav the Wise was unveiled at the site near the Novgorod Technical School. The author of the monument is sculptor Sergey Gaev.
== Veneration ==
Yaroslav was at the earliest named a saint by Adam of Bremen in his &quot;Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church&quot; in 1075, but he was not formally canonized. On 9 March 2004, on his 950th death anniversary he was included in the calendar of saints of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). On 8 December 2005, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow added his name to the Menologium as a local saint. On 3 February 2016, the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church held in Moscow established church-wide veneration of Yaroslav as a local saint.

<text>Estrid (Old Norse: &quot;Æstriðr&quot;, &quot;Ástríðr&quot;) was a rich and powerful 11th-century Swedish woman whose long family saga has been recorded on five or six runestones in Uppland, Sweden. This Estrid was the maternal grandmother of the chieftain Jarlabanke of the Jarlabanke clan. The family were rich landowners and belonged to the higher echelons of Swedish society. Her family saga has been the centre of a dramatisation at the Stockholm County Museum. 

It is safe to assume that five of the 11 runestones that mention an Estrid in eastern Svealand refer to this Estrid because of the locations of the runestones and the people who are mentioned on them.

A sixth runestone, U 329, deals with an Estrid who is only mentioned as the sister of a Ragnfast and a Gyrid. This Ragnfast appears on the Hillersjö stone and the Snottsta and Vreta stones as the husband of Inga and the son-in-law of Gerlög. Since Fot, the runemaster of U 329, also made runestones for the Jarlabanke clan, and Gerlög and Inga also belonged to the same regional elite, it is probable that U 329 refers to the same Estrid as the five other runestones. This would mean that Estrid was born in Snottsta (also spelled Snåttsta) as the daughter of the rich landowner Sigfast. 

The Broby bro Runestones tell that Estrid and her husband Östen had a son by the name Gag, who died while Östen still was alive, and three other sons named Ingefast, Östen and Sven. The runestones further tell that a barrow and a bridge were built and that two of the runestones were raised by the brothers Ingefast, Östen and Sven in memory of their father Östen, who had gone to Jerusalem and died in the Byzantine Empire.

The story of her life is continued on the Hargs bro runic inscriptions, where we learn that Estrid had married a man named Ingvar, and this Ingvar had a son prior to marrying Estrid whose name was Ragnvald. It also appears that Estrid and Ingvar had three sons named Sigvid, Ingvar and Jarlabanke. We further learn that Estrid had a bridge constructed, which apparently was a tradition in her family.
She appears to have become quite old and moved back to Täby where she had family, because the last chapter of her life is documented on two runestones in south-western Täby. They tell that Estrid cleared a road and built bridges together with her grandson Jarlabanke (by her son Ingefast) and his family, and she dedicated the constructions to her sons Ingvar (her son with Ingvarr at Harg) and Ingefast (her son with Östen at Broby bro).

When Stockholm County Museum made an archaeological excavation at Broby bro, in 1995, they found three graves. The three were buried in Christian manner, i.e. with the head towards the west, they were not burned and there were few gifts. Some coins that were found helped to date the graves to the 11th century. One of the graves was located just beside Östen&#x27;s barrow and it was for a rich and very old woman. The buried woman was probably Estrid.

<text>In the card game contract bridge, the Losing-Trick Count (LTC) is a method of hand evaluation that is generally only considered suitable to be used in situations where a trump suit has been established and when shape and fit are more significant than high card points (HCP) in determining the optimum level of the contract. The method is generally not considered suitable for no trump or misfit hands; also, the trump suit is generally considered to require at least eight cards in length with no partner holding fewer than three.

However, the LTC method of hand evaluation has been used successfully to evaluate unbalanced and balanced opening hands, and overcalls, since 1938 (combined with ‘quick trick’ evaluation and defined biddable suits), and by itself since 2017, before a fit and trump suit have been established based on the premise that a fit could usually be found later.

Based on a set of empirical rules, the number of &quot;losing tricks&quot; held in each of the partnership&#x27;s hands is estimated and their sum deducted from either 24 (the result is the number of tricks the partnership can expect to take when playing in their established suit, assuming normal suit distributions and assuming required finesses work about half the time) or 18 (the result is the bidding level the partnership can expect to make their contract when playing in their established suit, assuming normal suit distributions and assuming required finesses work about half the time). F. Dudley Courtenay originally referred to the latter option as the “Rule of 18”.

==History==
The origins of the Losing Trick Count (LTC)—without that name—can be traced back at least to 1910 in Joseph Bowne Elwell&#x27;s book &quot;Elwell on Auction Bridge&quot; wherein he sets out, in tabular form, a scheme for counting losers in trump contracts similar to the basic counting method given below.

The term &quot;Losing Trick Count&quot; was originally put forward by the American F. Dudley Courtenay in his 1934 book &quot;The System the Experts Play&quot; (which ran to at least 21 printing editions). Among various acknowledgments, the author writes: &#x27;To Mr. Arnold Fraser-Campbell the author is particularly indebted for permission to use material and quotations from his manuscript in which is described his method of hand valuation by counting losing tricks, and from which the author has developed the Losing Trick Count described herein.&#x27;

The Englishman George Walshe and Courtenay edited the American edition and retitled it &quot;The Losing Trick Count&quot; for the British market; first published in London in 1935, the ninth edition came out in 1947. Subsequently, it has been republished by print-on-demand re-publishers.

The LTC was also popularised by Maurice Harrison-Gray in &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine in the 1950s and 1960s. 

In recent decades, others have suggested refinements to the basic counting method.

==The original LTC==
The underlying premise of LTC is that if a suit is evenly distributed, i.e. three players hold three cards in the suit and one player holds four, a maximum of three losers can be assumed in any one suit held by the partnership and, in turn, the maximum number of losers held by the partnership in all four suits is 24 (three in each of the four suits in each of two hands, i.e. 3 x 4 x 2 = 24). The LTC method estimates the total number of losers held by the partnership and deducts that total from either 24 to estimate the number of tricks which the partnership may expect to win or 18 to estimate the bidding level the partnership may expect to make their contract. Using either of the LTC method options thus provides guidance as to how high to bid in the auction.

===Methodology===
The basic LTC methodology consists of three steps:
===Example===
You hold and partner opens 1. If playing five-card majors, you know you have at least an 8 card heart fit.

At this stage in the bidding, one estimates that the partnership can take at least 10 tricks and bid to the 4 level.

==Refinements==
Thinking that the method tended to overvalue unsupported queens and undervalue supported jacks, Eric Crowhurst and Andrew Kambites refined the scale, as have others:
* AQ doubleton = ½ loser according to Ron Klinger.
* KQ doubleton = 1 loser (obvious).
* Kx doubleton = 1½ losers according to others.
* AJ10 = 1 loser according to Harrison-Gray.
* KJ10 = 1½ losers according to Bernard Magee.
* Qxx = 3 losers (or possibly 2.5) unless trumps.
* Subtract a loser if there is a known 9-card trump fit.

In his book &quot;The Modern Losing Trick Count&quot;, Ron Klinger advocates adjusting the number of losers based on the control count of the hand believing that the basic method undervalues an ace but overvalues a queen and undervalues short honor combinations such as Qx or a singleton king. Also it places no value on cards jack or lower.

==New Losing-Trick Count (NLTC)==

A &quot;New&quot; Losing-Trick Count (NLTC) was introduced in &quot;The Bridge World&quot;, May 2003, by Johannes Koelman. Designed to be more precise than LTC, the NLTC method of hand evaluation utilizes the concept of &quot;half-losers&quot;, and it distinguishes between &#x27;missing-Ace losers&#x27;, &#x27;missing-King losers&#x27; and &#x27;missing-Queen losers.&#x27; NLTC intrinsically assigns greater value to Aces than it assigns to Kings, and it assigns greater value to Kings than it assigns to Queens. Some users of LTC make adjustments to the loser count to compensate for the imbalance of Aces and Queens held. Koelman argues that adjusting a hand&#x27;s value for the imbalance between Aces and Queens &quot;held&quot; isn&#x27;t the same as correcting for the imbalance between Aces and Queens &quot;missing&quot;. Because of singletons and doubletons [and because losing-trick counts assign losers for the first three rounds of a suit], the number of losers from missing Aces tends to be greater than the number of losers from missing Queens.

NLTC differs from LTC in two significant ways. First, NLTC uses a different method to count losers (explanation and loser-count lists below). Consequently, with NLTC, the number of losers in a singleton or doubleton suit can exceed the number of cards in the suit. Second, with NLTC the number of combined losers between two hands is subtracted from 25, not from 24 (explanation below), to predict the number of tricks the two hands will produce when declarer plays the hand in the agreed trump suit. As with LTC, the NLTC formula assumes normal suit breaks, it assumes that required finesses work about half the time, and it must only be applied after an 8-card trump fit or better is discovered. When counting NLTC losers in a hand, consider only the three highest ranking cards in each suit:

* Count 1.5 losers for a missing Ace in a suit of at least 1 card in length
* Count 1.0 losers for a missing King in a suit of at least 2 cards in length
* Count 0.5 losers for a missing Queen in a suit of at least 3 cards in length
* Count 0 losers for a void suit

The following hands highlight the differences between the LTC and NLTC methods:

 - 8 LTC losers, but only 6 NLTC losers&lt;br&gt; 
 - 8 LTC losers, and also 8 NLTC losers&lt;br&gt;
 - only 8 LTC losers, but 10 NLTC losers

Here is the basic NLTC list. For simplicity, cards below the rank of Queen are represented by &quot;x&quot;:
All singletons, except singleton A, are initially counted as 1.5 losers, and all doubletons that are missing both the A and K are initially counted as 2.5 losers. Professional bridge player, Kevin Wilson, explains this concept of a suit that contains more losers than it contains cards: &quot;Think about how much of declarer play is about timing. When you&#x27;re missing an Ace, you&#x27;re losing more than just a trick; you&#x27;re losing &quot;timing&quot; because the King, Queen and Jack that you might hold can&#x27;t score immediate tricks. First you must force out the Ace [and when the opponents win their Ace, they might immediately score more tricks, or they might establish winning tricks for later in the play]. The idea of 1.5 losers for a singleton [and 2.5 losers for a doubleton] should be within your grasp.&quot; In Kevin&#x27;s article, he coins the term &quot;modified&quot; losing-trick count, or MLTC.

As with LTC, players seeking greater accuracy can also make adjustments to the NLTC. While the LTC normally uses only whole numbers and players who adjust with LTC commonly adjust in ½-loser increments, because NLTC uses fractions already, adjustments are usually made in ¼-loser increments or smaller. Players might prefer to adjust for the presence of Jacks and Tens, as these honor cards are assigned no value in the NLTC, but they&#x27;re valuable holdings, particularly when they&#x27;re together in the same suit, and especially when they&#x27;re together and they support higher honors in the suit. Similarly, players might prefer to consider a singleton King as being more valuable than a singleton 2. As with other methods of evaluation, players can upgrade or downgrade the value of a given holding based on the ensuing auction.

As previously stated, NLTC uses a value of 25 (instead of 24 with LTC) in the formula for determining the trick-taking potential for two hands. Here&#x27;s a basic pair of hands that helps illustrate why:

♠ xxxx
♥ xxx
♦ xxx
♣ xxx

♠ xxxx
♥ xxx
♦ xxx
♣ xxx

With both LTC and NLTC, the combined loser count with these two very weak and flat-shaped hands is 24 (12 losers in each hand). According to the LTC formula, there is no trick-taking potential with these hands (24-24 combined losers = 0 winning tricks). We must remember, however, that both forms of the losing-trick count are used only after the partnership knows it has an 8-card fit or better. In addition, losing-trick count predictions assume that all suits will break normally. In this example, given we possess an 8-card spade fit, and assuming the outstanding spades (trumps) split 3-2, the defenders can&#x27;t prevent the (hypothetical) declarer from scoring one trump trick with these otherwise worthless hands. A losing-trick count formula that doesn&#x27;t predict one winning trick with these two hands poses a theoretical concern. With NLTC we deduct the total combined losers from 25, not from 24, so the NLTC formula accurately predicts the trick-taking potential of these two hands (25-24 losers = 1 winner).

It&#x27;s worth noting that these two example hands are flat shaped and are therefore poorly suited to considering losing trick counts, as losing-trick counts are not designed for notrump hand evaluation. Instead, losing-trick counts are intended primarily for suit contract evaluations, particularly when one or both hands are unbalanced. Indeed, when one partner has 12 losers - which can only occur with 4333 shape - basic LTC can&#x27;t predict 13 tricks. NLTC however can predict a grand slam with balanced hands (examples below). For more information about NLTC, including new losing-trick counts in balanced hands, refer to Lawrence Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Mastering Hand Evaluation&quot;.

Also similar to basic LTC, NLTC users may employ an alternate formula to determine the appropriate contract level for two fitting hands. The NLTC alternate formula is: 19 (instead of 18 with LTC) minus the sum of the losers in the two hands = the projected safe contract level when declarer plays the hand in the agreed trump suit. So, 7.5 losers opposite 7.5 losers leads to: 19-(7.5+7.5) = 19-15 = 4 (4-level contract). Players who use the basic LTC variation of this formula (i.e. 18 - total combined losers = suggested safe contract level) will recognize the difference between 25 and 19 as the number of tricks required by declarer to secure a &quot;book&quot;, which is 6.

So, with 6.5 losers opposite 9.5 losers, we would calculate (19-16) = 3-level contract, or (25-16) = 9 tricks. With 4.5 losers opposite 7.5 losers: (19-12) = 7-level contract, or (25-12) = 13 tricks. This can help guide the bidding, as a standard opening hand typically has no more than 7.5 losers, and a typical hand with enough strength to respond typically has no more than 9.5 losers. So, when an 8-card or longer major-suit fit has been established, if the opening bidder holds a hand that has one less loser than a minimum opening hand, then opener can safely invite to game and bid to the three-level. If opener holds a hand that has two fewer losers than a minimum opening hand, then opener can force to game.

If an uncontested auction has proceeded as 1D-1H, then opener with four-card heart support would act according to the following guidelines:
* 7.5 losers: minimum values (simple raise)
* 6.5 losers: game-invitational values (a jump to three, for example)
* 5.5 losers: game-forcing values
* 4.5 losers: consider investigating slam
* 3.5 losers: investigate slam

Next consider responder&#x27;s hand. Opposite partner&#x27;s 1H or 1S opening, with 3-card support, responder knows an 8+ fit exists and can bid according to the following table:
* 9.5 losers: minimum values (simple raise)
* 8.5 losers: game-invitational values
* 7.5 losers: game-forcing values
* 6.5 losers: consider investigating slam
* 5.5 losers: investigate slam

N.B. since this response system focuses on major-fits, it can be seen that to reach a minor-suit game at the 5-level, the hand must have one less loser for each of the above-listed actions.

The NLTC solves the problem that the LTC method underestimates the trick taking potential by one on hands with a balance between &#x27;ace-losers&#x27; and &#x27;queen-losers&#x27;. For instance, the LTC can never predict a grand slam when both hands are 4333 distribution:
will yield 13 tricks when played in spades on around 95% of occasions (failing only on a 5:0 trump break or on a ruff of the lead from a 7-card suit). However this combination is valued as only 12 tricks using the basic method (24 minus 4 and 8 losers = 12 tricks); whereas using the NLTC it is valued at 13 tricks (25 minus 12/2 and 12/2 losers = 13 tricks). Note, if the west hand happens to hold a small spade instead of the jack, both the LTC as well as the NLTC count would remain unchanged, whilst the chance of making 13 tricks falls to 67%.

The NLTC also helps to prevent overstatement on hands which are missing aces. For example: 

will yield 10 tricks. The NLTC predicts this accurately (13/2 + 17/2 = 15 losers, subtracted from 25 = 10 tricks); whereas the basic LTC predicts 12 tricks (5 + 7 = 12 losers, subtracted from 24 = 12).

==Further bidding==

Whichever method is being used, utilizing LTC evaluation need not stop after the opening bid and the response. Assuming opener bids 1 and partner responds 2; opener will know from this bid that partner has 9 losers (using basic LTC), if opener has 5 losers rather than the systemically assumed 7, then the calculation changes to (5 + 9 = 14 deducted from 24 = 10) and game becomes apparent!

A small number of modern bidding systems systemically utilize multiple responses and rebids after the opening bid to refine LTC evaluation and to allow further adjustments to be made based on combined suit length, shortages found, and high cards held. The Imperspicuity losing trick count bridge bidding system uses the Law of Total Losers, shape asking relay bidding, loser asking relay bidding, CROSS and CRO relay bidding, and LTC techniques, to systemically determine the final bidding level, after opening bids and overcalls are initially made based on LTC evaluation methods.

==Limitations of the method==

All LTC methods are only valid if trump fit (4-4, 5-3 or better) is evident and, even then, care is required to avoid counting double values in the same suit e.g. KQxx (1 loser in LTC) opposite a singleton x (also 1 loser in LTC).

Regardless which hand evaluation is used (HCP, LTC, NLTC, etc.) without the partners exchanging information about specific suit strengths and suit lengths, a suboptimal evaluation of the trick taking potential of the combined hands will often result. Consider the examples:

Both layouts are the same, except for the swapping of West&#x27;s minor suits. So in both cases East and West have exactly the same strength in terms of HCP, LTC, NLTC etc. Yet, the layout on the left may be expected to produce 10 tricks in spades, whilst on a bad day the layout to the right would even fail to produce 9 tricks.

The difference between the two layouts is that on the left the high cards in the minor suits of both hands work in combination, whilst on the right hand side the minor suit honours fail to do so. Obviously on hands like these, it does not suffice to evaluate each hand individually. When inviting for game, both partners need to communicate in which suit they can provide assistance in the form of high cards, and adjust their hand evaluations accordingly. Conventional agreements like helpsuit trials and short suit trials are available for this purpose.

<text>A Century of Progress International Exposition, also known as the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, was a world&#x27;s fair held in the city of Chicago, Illinois, United States, from 1933 to 1934. The fair, registered under the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), celebrated the city&#x27;s centennial. Designed largely in Art Deco style, the theme of the fair was technological innovation, and its motto was &quot;Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms&quot;, trumpeting the message that science and American life were wedded. Its architectural symbol was the Sky Ride, a transporter bridge perpendicular to the shore on which one could ride from one side of the fair to the other.

One description of the fair noted that the world, &quot;then still mired in the malaise of the Great Depression, could glimpse a happier not-too-distant future, all driven by innovation in science and technology&quot;. Fair visitors saw the latest wonders in rail travel, automobiles, architecture and even cigarette-smoking robots. The exposition &quot;emphasized technology and progress, a utopia, or perfect world, founded on democracy and manufacturing.&quot;

==Context==
A Century of Progress was organized as an Illinois nonprofit corporation in January 1928 for the purpose of planning and hosting a World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago in 1934. City officials designated three and a half miles of newly reclaimed land along the shore of Lake Michigan between 12th and 39th streets on the Near South Side for the fairgrounds. Held on a portion of Burnham Park, the $37,500,000 exposition was formally opened on May 27, 1933, by U.S. Postmaster General James Farley at a four-hour ceremony at Soldier Field. The fair&#x27;s opening night began with a nod to the heavens. Lights were automatically activated when the rays of the star Arcturus were detected. The star was chosen as its light had started its journey at about the time of the previous Chicago world&#x27;s fair—the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition—in 1893. The rays were focused on photoelectric cells in a series of astronomical observatories and then transformed into electrical energy which was transmitted to Chicago.

==Exhibits==
The fair buildings were multi-colored, to create a &quot;Rainbow City&quot; as compared to the &quot;White City&quot; of Chicago&#x27;s earlier World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. The buildings generally followed Moderne architecture in contrast to the neoclassical themes used at the 1893 fair. One famous feature of the fair were the performances of fan dancer Sally Rand. Hal Pearl then known as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Youngest Organist&quot; and later &quot;The King of the Organ&quot; was the official organist of the fair. Mary Ann McArdle and her sister Isabel (from the UK) performed Irish Dancing. Other popular exhibits were the various auto manufacturers, the Midway (filled with nightclubs such as the Old Morocco, where future stars Judy Garland, the Cook Family Singers, and the Andrews Sisters performed), and a recreation of important scenes from Chicago&#x27;s history. The fair also contained exhibits that would seem shocking to modern audiences, including offensive portrayals of African Americans, a &quot;Midget City&quot; complete with &quot;sixty Lilliputians&quot;, and an exhibition of s containing real babies.

The fair included an exhibit on the history of Chicago. In the planning stages, several African American groups from the city&#x27;s newly growing population campaigned for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable to be honored at the fair. At the time, few Chicagoans had even heard of Point du Sable, and the fair&#x27;s organizers presented the 1803 construction of Fort Dearborn as the city&#x27;s historical beginning. The campaign was successful, and a replica of Point du Sable&#x27;s cabin was presented as part of the &quot;background of the history of Chicago&quot;. Also on display was the &quot;Lincoln Group&quot; of reconstructions of buildings associated with the biography of Abraham Lincoln, including his birth cabin, the Lincoln-Berry General Store, the Chicago Wigwam (in reduced scale), and the Rutledge Tavern which served as a restaurant.

Admiral Byrd&#x27;s polar expedition ship the &quot;City of New York&quot; was visited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he came to the fair on October 2, 1933. The &quot;City&quot; was on show for the full length of the exhibition.
One of the highlights of the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair was the arrival of the German airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; on October 26, 1933. After circling Lake Michigan near the exposition for two hours, Commander Hugo Eckener landed the 776-foot airship at the nearby Curtiss-Wright Airport in Glenview. It remained on the ground for twenty-five minutes (from 1 to 1:25 pm) then took off ahead of an approaching weather front, bound for Akron, Ohio.

The &quot;dream cars&quot; which American automobile manufacturers exhibited at the fair included Rollston bodywork on a Duesenberg chassis, and was called the &quot;Twenty Grand&quot; ultra-luxury sedan; Cadillac&#x27;s introduction of its V-16 limousine; Nash&#x27;s exhibit had a variation on the vertical (i.e., paternoster lift) parking garage—all the cars were new Nashes; Lincoln presented its rear-engined &quot;concept car&quot; precursor to the Lincoln-Zephyr, which went on the market in 1936 with a front engine; Pierce-Arrow presented its modernistic Pierce Silver Arrow for which it used the byline &quot;Suddenly it&#x27;s 1940!&quot; But it was Packard which won the best of show with the reintroduction of the Packard Twelve.
An enduring exhibit was the 1933 Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition that demonstrated modern home convenience and creative practical new building materials and techniques with twelve model homes sponsored by several corporations affiliated with home decor and construction.
Marine artist Hilda Goldblatt Gorenstein painted twelve murals for the Navy&#x27;s exhibit in the Federal Building for the fair. The frieze was composed of twelve murals depicting the influence of sea power on America, beginning with the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607 when sea power first reached America and carrying through World War I. Another set of murals, painted for the Ohio State Exhibit by William Mark Young, was relocated afterwards to the Ohio Statehouse. Young also painted scenes of the exhibition buildings.

The first Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held at Comiskey Park (home of the Chicago White Sox) in conjunction with the fair.
In May 1934, the Union Pacific Railroad exhibited its first streamlined train, the M-10000, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad its famous &quot;Zephyr&quot; which, on May 26, made a record-breaking dawn-to-dusk run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago in 13 hours and 5 minutes, called the &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk Dash&quot;. To cap its record-breaking speed run, the &quot;Zephyr&quot; arrived dramatically on-stage at the fair&#x27;s &quot;Wings of a Century&quot; transportation pageant. The two trains launched an era of industrial streamlining. Both trains later went into successful revenue service, the Union Pacific&#x27;s as the &quot;City of Salina&quot;, and the Burlington &quot;Zephyr&quot; as the first &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot;. The &quot;Zephyr&quot; is now on exhibit at Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry.

Frank Buck furnished a wild animal exhibit, Frank Buck&#x27;s Jungle Camp. Over two million people visited Buck&#x27;s reproduction of the camp he and his native assistants lived in while collecting animals in Asia. After the fair closed, Buck moved the camp to a compound he had created at Amityville, New York.

Planning for the design of the Exposition began over five years prior to Opening Day. According to an official resolution, decisions regarding the site layout and the architectural style of the exposition were relegated to an architectural commission, which was led by Paul Cret and Raymond Hood. Local architects on the committee included Edward Bennett, John Holabird, and Hubert Burnham. Frank Lloyd Wright was specifically left off the commission due to his inability to work well with others, but did go on to produce three conceptual schemes for the fair. Members of this committee ended up designing most of the large, thematic exhibition pavilions.

From the beginning, the commission members shared a belief that the buildings should not reinterpret past architectural forms – as had been done at earlier fairs, such as Chicago&#x27;s 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition—but should instead reflect new, modern ideas, as well as suggest future architectural developments. Because the fairgrounds was on new man-made land that was owned by the state and not the city, the land was initially free from Chicago&#x27;s strict building codes, which allowed the architects to explore new materials and building techniques. This allowed the design and construction of a wide array of experimental buildings, that eventually included large general exhibition halls, such as the Hall of Science (Paul Cret) and the Federal Building (Bennet, Burnham, and Holabird); corporate pavilions, including the General Motors Building (Albert Kahn) and the Sears Pavilion (Nimmons, Carr, and Wright); futuristic model houses, most popular was the twelve-sided House of Tomorrow (George Frederick Keck); as well as progressive foreign pavilions, including the Italian Pavilion (Mario de Renzi and Adalberto Libera); and historic and ethnic entertainment venues, such as the Belgian Village (Burnham Brothers with Alfons De Rijdt), and the Streets of Paris (Andrew Rebori and John W. Root) where fan dancer Sally Rand performed. These buildings were constructed out of five-ply Douglas fir plywood, ribbed-metal siding, and prefabricated boards such as Masonite, Sheetrock, Maizewood, as well as other new man-made materials. The exhibited buildings were windowless (but cheerfully lighted) buildings. Structural advances also filled the fairgrounds. These included the earliest catenary roof constructed in the United States, which roofed the dome of the Travel and Transport Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird) and the first thin shell concrete roof in the United States, on the small, multi-vaulted Brook Hill Farm Dairy built for the 1934 season of the fair.

==Later history==

===Amoebic dysentery outbreak===
From June to November 1933, there was an outbreak of amoebic dysentery associated with the fair. There were more than a thousand cases, resulting in 98 deaths. Joel Connolly of the Chicago Bureau of Sanitary Engineering brought the outbreak to an end when he found that defective plumbing permitted sewage to contaminate drinking water in two hotels.

===Extension===
Originally, the fair was scheduled only to run until November 12, 1933, but it was so successful that it was opened again to run from May 26 to October 31, 1934. The fair was financed through the sale of memberships, which allowed purchases of a certain number of admissions once the park was open. More than $800,000 was raised in this manner as the country was in the Great Depression. A $10 million bond was issued on October 28, 1929, the day before the stock market crashed. By the time the fair closed in 1933, half of these notes had been retired, with the entire debt paid by the time the fair closed in 1934. For the first time in American history, an international fair had paid for itself. In its two years, it had attracted 48,769,227 visitors. According to James Truslow Adams&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of American History&quot;, during the 170 days beginning May 27, 1933, there were 22,565,859 paid admissions; during the 163 days beginning May 26, 1934, there were 16,486,377; a total of 39,052,236.

==Legacy==

Much of the fair site is now home to Northerly Island park (since the closing of Meigs Field) and McCormick Place. The Balbo Monument, given to Chicago by Benito Mussolini to honor General Italo Balbo&#x27;s 1933 trans-Atlantic flight, still stands near Soldier Field. The city added a third red star to its flag in 1933 to commemorate the Century of Progress Exposition (the Fair is now represented by the fourth of four stars on the flag). In conjunction with the fair, Chicago&#x27;s Italian-American community raised funds and donated a statue of Genoese navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus. It was placed at the south end of Grant Park, near the site of the fair.

The Polish Museum of America possesses the painting of &quot;Pulaski at Savannah&quot; by Stanisław Kaczor-Batowski, which was exhibited at the Century of Progress fair and where it won first place. After the close of the fair, the painting went on display at The Art Institute of Chicago where it was unveiled by Eleanor Roosevelt on July 10, 1934. The painting was on display at the Art Institute until its purchase by the Polish Women&#x27;s Alliance on the museum&#x27;s behalf.

The U.S. Post Office Department issued a special fifty-cent Air Mail postage stamp, (Scott catalogue number C-18) to commemorate the visit of the German airship depicting the fair&#x27;s Federal Building, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; in flight, and its home hangar in Friedrichshafen, Germany. This stamp is informally known as the &quot;Baby Zep&quot; to distinguish it from the much more valuable 1930 Graf Zeppelin stamps (C13–15). Separate from this issue, for the Fair the Post Office also printed 1 and 3 cent commemorative postage stamps, showing respectively Fort Dearborn and the modernistic Federal Building. These were also printed in separate souvenir sheets as blocks of 25 (catalog listings 728–31). In 1935 the sheets were reprinted (Scott 766–67).

From October 2010 through September 2011, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled &quot;Designing Tomorrow: America&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fairs of the 1930s&quot;. This exhibition prominently featured the Century of Progress fair in Chicago.

===In popular culture===
* Nelson Algren&#x27;s 1935 novel &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot; features the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1933–34, with the Century of Progress being described as &quot;the brief city sprung out of the prairie and falling again into dust.&quot;
* Jean Shepherd wrote about attending the Century of Progress as a boy in the 1966 book &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot;
* Roy J. Snell, author of books for boys and girls, used Chicago, the building of the Fair site, the Fair itself -including the Sky Ride – and then certain portions of the Fair after it closed in several of his books. Publisher, Reilly &amp; Lee. Books now in Public Domain.
* &quot;Beverly Gray at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, originally the sixth book in Clair Blank&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Gray&quot; series, was published in 1935 and is set at the Century of Progress. The book was dropped when the series changed publishers due to fears that readers would find it dated, and has since become a sought after volume by collectors of the series.
* In &quot;True Detective&quot;, the 1983 private eye novel by Max Allan Collins, and the first to feature his long-running character Nate Heller, Heller is hired as a security consultant by the Fair, and a good deal of the novel is set there. The suspenseful action climax takes place at the Fair. The novel went on to win the Shamus from the Private Eye Writers of America for Best Novel.
* Brief footage of the fairground sideshows is used in the 1933 film &quot;Hoop-La&quot;, the plot of which revolves around the fair. It was the last film made by Clara Bow. Also shown is a panorama of the Century of Progress concourse.
* In her novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Ayn Rand describes a world fair named &quot;The March of the Centuries&quot;. Despite having taken place in 1936, &quot;The March of the Centuries&quot; bears a striking similarity to the Century of Progress exposition: it, too, is designed by a group of architects; architect Howard Roark was initially invited but later denied opportunity to participate in planning (as his prototype Frank Lloyd Wright was left off the commission), the fair opened in May. Rand described the fair as &quot;a ghastly flop&quot; and mentioned that its only attraction was &quot;somebody named Juanita Fay who danced with a live peacock as sole garment&quot; (a description clearly based on Sally Rand&#x27;s performance).
* In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2024 novel Polostan, the main character works as a shoe model and salesperson for a shop on the fairway that fits shoes using an X-ray machine. She sees the arrival of the Decennial Air Cruise and events in Soldier&#x27;s Field.

<text>Developing is a 1994 short film (28 minutes) directed by Marya Cohn, about the relationship between a girl and her single mother, who has breast cancer. The film, shot in 1993, stars Natalie Portman in her first film role and Frances Conroy. The short was Cohn&#x27;s thesis film.

==Plot==
Photographer Clare (Frances Conroy) learns she has breast cancer and must have a mastectomy. Returning home post-surgery, she struggles against her feelings of self-consciousness but tries to act as if all is normal in order to protect her daughter, Nina (Natalie Portman). However, she begins to begrudge Nina, and Nina, in turn, begins to resent being used by Clare as a model in her photographs.

Clare puts together a show of her photographs mostly featuring Nina. The show is a success but Clare feels uncomfortable as people constantly mention both her illness and her surgery. At the gallery, Clare and Nina fight when Nina accuses her of not letting her in and runs away. Clare then has a meltdown where she screams at a photographer covering the event after he takes numerous photos of her.

Failing to find Nina after returning home, Clare begins to take self-portraits using a mirror, gradually stripping off all her clothes. After finally confronting her own image in the mirror, she cries profusely. Later, as she is developing her self-portraits in her darkroom, Nina enters and apologizes for running away. Clare gives her a prolonged hug and Nina listens to her heart beat.

==Release==
The film premiered at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.

<text>Beautiful Girls is a 1996 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Ted Demme and written by Scott Rosenberg. Its story follows New York jazz pianist Willie Conway, as he heads back to his hometown of Knight&#x27;s Ridge, Massachusetts for his high school reunion, where he finds his friends evaluating their lives and relationships. 

The film stars Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino and Uma Thurman. It was produced by Cary Woods and was released on February 9, 1996, by Miramax. It received positive reviews and grossed $27 million worldwide.

==Plot==
New York jazz pianist Willie returns to his hometown of Knight&#x27;s Ridge, Massachusetts for his 10-year high school reunion, staying with his widower father and younger brother.

Willie reunites with three old friends: Mo is a successful family man, while Paul and Tommy, who own a snowplowing business, have relationship issues. Paul was recently dumped by his longtime girlfriend Jan because he refused her ultimatum of marriage. Believing that she is now seeing Victor the meat cutter, he vindictively blocks her driveway with snow every night. Tommy is cheating on his girlfriend Sharon with his married high school sweetheart Darian.

Willie meets 13-year-old neighbor girl Marty, and they strike up a witty rapport. She presses him about his relationship: he has been with his girlfriend Tracy for a year but is unsure if he wants to marry her. He is considering taking a steady job as a salesman, but Mo urges him not to quit his music.

Paul desperately proposes to Jan, but she turns him down. Sharon argues with Tommy about his infidelity and seeks advice from her girlfriends. The outspoken Gina advises her to break up with Tommy, but Sharon tries to salvage the relationship by planning a surprise birthday party.

When the attractive Andera comes to town from Chicago, the guys compete for her attention. The next day, Gina lectures Willie and Tommy about men&#x27;s unrealistic expectations of women set by supermodels and pornography. Willie feels jealous when he sees that Marty has a boyfriend.

Darian shows up at Tommy&#x27;s surprise party drunk and openly tries to seduce him, causing Sharon to leave, heartbroken. Tommy drives Darian home but refuses her advances, and unsuccessfully tries to patch things up with Sharon. Willie tells Mo about his feelings for Marty but is reminded how young she is and says that he just doesn&#x27;t want to grow up.

Willie again encounters Marty, who says she has broken up with her boyfriend because she is interested in him, asking him to wait five years until she is 18 and they can be together. Willie declines, saying that she will outgrow her feelings for him as she matures.

Paul takes Andera out, trying to make Jan jealous. Andera plays along, but when Paul tries to kiss her she smacks him and leaves. Willie chastises Paul about his obsession with supermodels; he responds that beautiful girls represent hope and promise. Tommy breaks things off with Darian, but she states her intent to win him back at the reunion.

Andera approaches Willie, turning down his flirtations but accompanying him to Paul&#x27;s ice shanty, where they discuss their respective relationships. He misses the emotional rush of new love, but she feels truly happy with her boyfriend and returns to Chicago the next day. Tracy arrives from New York, and Willie&#x27;s feelings for her are rekindled. Marty is downhearted by this, but Willie assures her that she will grow up to do amazing things.

At the reunion, Darian is confronted by a former classmate who she bullied; he tells her that she was beautiful, but &quot;mean as a snake&quot;. Tommy skips the reunion to avoid Darian but encounters her husband Steve and his friends at a bar. Steve reveals he knows about the affair; a fight ensues, and Tommy is badly beaten. Learning of this, the guys rush to Steve&#x27;s house to confront him. Steve calls his friends, but Willie pushes their car into a snowbank using Paul&#x27;s snowplow. Mo is about to beat Steve up but stops when Steve&#x27;s daughter comes to the door. Darian arrives home in the aftermath of the confrontation. Tommy ends up in the hospital with a concussion and two broken ribs. Sharon stays with him overnight, and they make up. Paul, overcome with emotion, clears Jan&#x27;s driveway of snow.

Willie says his goodbyes the next day, having decided to head back to New York with Tracy and not take the sales job. Paul announces that Jan and Victor are engaged. Willie introduces Tracy to Marty and kisses Marty on the cheek before departing.

==Production==
Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg was living in Needham, Massachusetts, waiting to see if Disney would use his script for &quot;Con Air&quot;. He said in an interview, &quot;It was the worst winter ever in this small hometown. Snow plows were coming by, and I was just tired of writing these movies with people getting shot and killed. So I said, &#x27;There is more action going on in my hometown with my friends dealing with the fact that they cannot deal with turning 30 or with commitment&#x27;—all that became &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;.&quot;

Originally, James L. Brooks was interested in directing the film, according to actress Leslie Mann, who auditioned for a role but was not cast.

Ted Demme had the entire cast come to Minneapolis and live together for two to three weeks so that they could bond. Filming took place in the Twin Cities Metro Area communities of Edina, Marine-on-St. Croix and Stillwater, with Demme wanting to make sure that the setting was a character unto itself. He &quot;wanted to make it look like it&#x27;s Anytown USA, primarily East Coast. And I also wanted it to feel like a real working-class town&quot;. To this end, Demme drew inspiration from Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). &quot;The first third of the film is really an amazing buddy movie with those five actors. You could tell they were best friends, but they all had stuff amongst them that was personal to each one of them&quot;.

Principal photography took place between February and May 1995.

===Additional tracks (not included on soundtrack)===
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on February 9, 1996, in 752 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $2.7 million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $10.5 million in the United States and Canada and $27 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film received fairly positive reviews and has a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A warm, thoughtful dramedy about male insecurity, &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; is buoyed by an excellent cast - particularly Natalie Portman in a stunning early role&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;What&#x27;s nicest about the film is the way it treasures the good feelings people can have for one another.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe praised Natalie Portman&#x27;s performance: &quot;As a self-described &#x27;old soul&#x27; who connects spiritually with Hutton (they&#x27;re both existential searchers), she&#x27;s the movie&#x27;s most poignant and witty presence.&quot;

However, Jack Mathews, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote that the film was &quot;about as much fun as a neighborhood bar on a Tuesday night. Its crisis: not much happening.&quot; In her &quot;New York Times&quot; review Janet Maslin wrote that Natalie Portman got the film&#x27;s &quot;archest dialogue&quot;, and called her &quot;a budding knockout, and scene-stealingly good even in an overly showy role.&quot;

==&quot;October Road&quot;==
Scott Rosenberg co-produced and co-wrote for the 2007-2008 TV series &quot;October Road&quot;. The show is loosely based on what happened after &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; came out and how his friends reacted to a movie about their lives. Both &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; and &quot;October Road&quot; take place in the fictional Massachusetts town of Knight&#x27;s Ridge, and have similar characters, jobs, plot lines.

<text>Edward Kern Demme ( ; October 26, 1963 – January 14, 2002) was an American director, producer, and actor.

==Early life==

Demme was born in New York City, the son of Gail (née Kern) and Frederick Rogers Demme. He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York on Long Island and attended South Side Senior High School. He graduated from SUNY-Cortland in 1985. He was the nephew of film producer and director Jonathan Demme.

==Career==
Demme&#x27;s media career may have begun with a radio show at WSUC-FM (SUNY-Cortland), a mix of comedy and talk radio with the usual sidekick, as well as some music and was widely listened to on and off campus. His career had modest beginnings—starting as a production assistant at MTV, he later became a producer in the On-Air Promotions Department and created the cable network&#x27;s hip-hop show &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; (with Peter Dougherty), and directed other projects for them, including the black-and-white rants starring then-unknown chain-smoking comedian Denis Leary.

Over the course of his career, he established a group of actors that he chose to work with on more than one occasion. The most frequently used of these was Leary, whom he directed as a lead or star in Leary&#x27;s stand-up specials &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot; and &quot;Lock n&#x27; Load&quot;, as well as the films &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;, &quot;The Ref&quot;, and &quot;Monument Ave.&quot; Leary produced the 2001 crime drama film &quot;Blow&quot;, which starred Johnny Depp as George Jung and was directed by Demme.

==Personal life==
Demme was married to Amanda Scheer, with whom he had two children. Scheer later opened several popular Los Angeles bars, including Teddy&#x27;s at the Roosevelt Hotel, named in honor of her late husband. He was a fan of the Green Bay Packers. 

==Death==
On January 14, 2002, while playing a celebrity basketball game, Demme collapsed and died of a heart attack which may have been related to cocaine later found in his system during an autopsy. Demme was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.

== Tributes ==
Much of one edition of the IFC program &quot;Dinner for Five&quot; was given over to a description of Demme&#x27;s last night and fond reminiscences about his life, mostly by Denis Leary and the show&#x27;s host Jon Favreau. This touched on Demme&#x27;s being a fan of the Green Bay Packers and his fondness for playing practical jokes.

At the 2002 Golden Globe awards show, one week following Demme&#x27;s death, Kevin Spacey wore a picture of Demme on his suit jacket. He was also in the 74th Academy Awards In Memoriam tribute that was also presented by Kevin Spacey.

&quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot;, his uncle Jonathan Demme&#x27;s remake of &quot;Charade&quot;, was dedicated in his memory.

The 2003 album &quot;Blackberry Belle&quot; by The Twilight Singers led by Greg Dulli, was written in tribute to Demme, Dulli&#x27;s close friend. Dulli had been working on another project, titled &quot;Amber Headlights&quot; (which would later see the light of day in 2005), but abandoned those sessions due to Demme&#x27;s death. The recordings which followed, fueled in part by the memory of Demme, resulted in &quot;Blackberry Belle&quot;.

The 2002 film &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is dedicated to Demme.

<text>Anywhere but Here is a 1999 American coming-of-age comedy drama film based on the novel of the same name by Mona Simpson. It was directed by Wayne Wang from a screenplay by Alvin Sargent, and stars Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, and Shawn Hatosy.

Filming began in late June 1998. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 17, 1999, before being released in the United States on November 12.

== Plot ==

Adele August and her reluctant teenage daughter, Ann, leave their small town in Wisconsin and move to Beverly Hills. Adele hopes Ann will become a Hollywood actress despite Ann&#x27;s interest in going to Brown University. They rent a run-down apartment and Adele becomes a speech-language pathologist at a high school in a bad part of town.

While at the beach one afternoon, Adele meets a handsome orthodontist, Josh; they date and have sex, leaving Adele to fall in love with him, but he later dumps her for a younger woman. Adele improvises day to day, often unable to pay bills, and eventually quits her job. Adele and Ann spend their days hanging out together but over time, Ann grows tired of her mother&#x27;s eccentric behavior and dreams of running away.

Ann&#x27;s cousin Benny arrives in Los Angeles for a visit. Upon his return home, Adele is notified that Benny has tragically died in a car accident, leaving Ann distraught. They attend his funeral in Bay City, and Adele argues with her intoxicated brother-in-law. Back home, Ann begins dating her crush, Peter, interested in experiencing sex for the first time after she turns seventeen. Her friends also help her reach out to her estranged father, but he isn&#x27;t pleased to hear from her.

Meanwhile, Adele gets a new job in a care home as a speech therapist and gives makeup and style tips to its elderly residents. Ann works part-time in a supermarket and attends acting auditions, but continues to emphasize her desire to go to Brown. Adele rejects the idea, telling her they cannot afford the tuition. However, soon, Adele sells her expensive Mercedes and decides to help her, eventually accepting her dream.

Adele and Ann part ways at the airport as Ann goes off to college. They express their love for one another, and Ann admits that, even though her mother drives her crazy, she cannot imagine life without her.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
Mona Simpson&#x27;s novel &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot; was first optioned by Disney in the late 1980s and envisioned as a star vehicle for Meryl Streep, but Streep chose to do &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; instead and the adaptation did not materialize. The project stalled for nearly a decade until 20th Century Fox revived it and cast Susan Sarandon as the lead. Natalie Portman became attached to star as the co-lead and left her role on Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; to commit to the film. However, Portman, who was then 17, said she would not do the film if it required her to do a love scene with nudity. Sarandon, who had co-star approval, made Portman&#x27;s casting a condition of her own participation. Alvin Sargent did a rewrite of the scene, enabling Portman’s involvement.

Director Wayne Wang initially kept some of the book&#x27;s darker elements in the film, such as a suggestion of domestic abuse. Test audiences reacted negatively to this version, so Wang and Sargent went with a version that softened the dynamics of Adele and Ann&#x27;s relationship.

The film was primarily shot in Los Angeles locations, including Beverly Hills High School, the Beverly Hills Hotel, LAX Airport, and Westwood Village.

==Release==
&quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; was initially slated for a spring of 1999 release, but Fox deemed the film was not ready for release until that September. Fox then set an October 22 release date, which ultimately changed to November 12.

===Box office===
The film opened at #5 at the North American box office and made $5.6 million USD in its opening weekend.

===Critical reception===
The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 63% based on reviews from 89 critics. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The strong chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as a mother and daughter trying to make a fresh start in L.A. helps to elevate &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; above its occasional forays into melodrama.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars and noted &quot;The movie&#x27;s interest is not in the plot, which is episodic and &#x27;colorful,&#x27; but in the performances. Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. Sarandon&#x27;s role is trickier and more difficult, but Portman&#x27;s will get the attention. In &#x27;Anywhere But Here,&#x27; she gets yanked along by her out-of-control mother, and her best scenes are when she fights back, not emotionally, but with incisive observations.&quot;

===Accolades===
Golden Globe Awards
* Nominated - Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture - Natalie Portman
Young Artist Awards
* Nominated - Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actress - Natalie Portman
Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards
* Nominated - Best Contemporary Hair Styling (Feature) - Paul LeBlanc

Rimes&#x27; song, &quot;Leaving&#x27;s Not Leaving&quot;, was released as a B-side track with her single, &quot;Big Deal&quot;, on September 28, 1999.

<doc id="42225" wikidata="Q1334572" url="?curid=42225" title="Everyone Says I Love You">
<text>Everyone Says I Love You is a 1996 American musical romantic comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen. It stars Alan Alda, Allen, Drew Barrymore, Lukas Haas, Goldie Hawn, Gaby Hoffmann, Natasha Lyonne, Edward Norton, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Tim Roth, and David Ogden Stiers. Set in New York City, Venice, and Paris, it features singing by actors not usually known for musical roles. The film had a box-office bomb, but is among the more critically successful of Allen&#x27;s films, with &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert even ranking it as one of Allen&#x27;s best.

The emotions of an extended upper-class family in Manhattan are followed in song in New York City, Paris, and Venice. Many characters act, interact, and sing in each city. They include young lovers Holden and Skylar, Skylar&#x27;s parents Bob and Steffi, Steffi&#x27;s ex-husband Joe, Steffi and Joe&#x27;s daughter Djuna &quot;DJ&quot;, a lady Joe meets named Von, and recently-released prison inmate Charles Ferry.

==Plot==
Skylar and Holden are an upper-class Manhattan couple (&quot;Just You, Just Me&quot;). Holden enlists DJ, Skylar&#x27;s younger sister, to help him choose an expensive diamond engagement ring (&quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;). Skylar wants a &quot;take-charge&quot; kind of guy (&quot;I&#x27;m a Dreamer, Aren&#x27;t We All&quot;). Holden’s romantic gesture, at DJ’s urging, backfires when Skylar swallows the ring he slipped into her parfait, resulting in a trip to the ER (&quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;).

Bob and Steffi Dandridge, liberal Democratic lawyers (&quot;Looking at You&quot;) who have a blended family from previous marriages, are aghast at having a Republican son, Scott, who wants criminals taken off the street and disapproves of Steffi&#x27;s work rehabilitating felons. Steffi, who volunteers with the American Civil Liberties Union (&quot;He was an abused child who made one mistake.&quot;), brings to the engagement party one of her causes, Charles, who scares guests with accounts of prison stabbings. Initially alarmed by Charles&#x27;s aggressive passes (&quot;If I Had You&quot;), Skylar eventually falls under his spell (&quot;I&#x27;ve never been kissed by a sociopath before.&quot;), breaking up with Holden.

Steffi and Bob are friendly with Steffi&#x27;s neurotic ex-husband Joe, who lives in Paris, and has just broken up with his latest drug-using nymphomaniac girlfriend (&quot;I&#x27;m through with Love&quot;). Steffi wants to fix Joe up with a more suitable woman, but Joe is still hung up on Steffi.

On vacation with her father Joe in Venice, Italy, DJ and her friend, whose mother is a psychologist, listen through a hole in the wall on the clientele&#x27;s therapy sessions. Von, an art historian, relates to the therapist that she is discontented with her husband, longing for romance and discussing her fantasies. DJ suggests Joe &quot;run into&quot; Von jogging and then coaches Joe on how to woo her by faking interest in art, music, travel, African daisies, and a hastily bought Parisian garret, and by setting up &quot;coincidental&quot; meetings at a museum and a concert. Convinced she has met the man of her dreams (&quot;All My Life&quot;), the unsuspecting Von leaves her husband for Joe.

DJ falls for a gondolier and plans to drop out of college to marry him until she meets her next &quot;flame&quot;: a student at Columbia University (&quot;Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine&quot;). She then falls for a rapper in New York, and finally falls in love with a dashing Parisian.

Competitive sisters Lane and Laura, DJ&#x27;s half-sisters, both have crushes on a local lad, heir to the Vandermost millions, but 14-year-old Laura is heartbroken when Vandermost falls for Lane (&quot;I&#x27;m Through with Love&quot;).

Grandpa, an 88-year-old with dementia, occasionally wanders off, corralled by Freda the maid, who DJ jokingly claims was Hitler&#x27;s maid at Berchtesgaden (&quot;It&#x27;s Bavarian pasta, it doesn’t need any sauce; Italian pasta needs sauce. The Italians were weak!&quot;). At foot fetishist Grandpa’s funeral, the corpses at the chapel sing and dance to &quot;Enjoy Yourself (It&#x27;s Later than You Think)&quot;.

Skylar encourages ex-con Charles to study law, but he has other plans, involving the unwitting Skylar in a grocery store robbery with his gang. Begging to be let out of the getaway car, Skylar successfully escapes and eventually reconciles at a Halloween Party with a forgiving Holden (&quot;Chiquita Banana&quot;). This time Skylar swallows the engagement ring Holden has slipped in a box of Cracker Jack.

Scott is diagnosed with a brain tumor and has successful surgery. He immediately resigns from the Young Republicans Club and starts to espouse left-wing causes.

Having lived out all her fantasies with &quot;the man of her dreams&quot;, Von no longer yearns for them; she leaves Joe to return to her husband.

The family goes to Paris for Christmas and attends a Groucho Marx-themed New Years party (&quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;). When Bob comes down with a cold, Steffi reunites with Joe and they reminisce, acknowledging that although their marriage didn&#x27;t work out (&quot;I&#x27;m Through With Love&quot;), they still have feelings for each other. Although Steffi loves Bob &quot;wholeheartedly&quot;, she and Joe kiss while accepting the boundaries of their mutually supportive relationship. Steffi encourages Joe to find someone who will make him happy. The family dances to &quot;Everyone Says I love You&quot; as DJ falls for a dance partner in a Harpo Marx costume.

# &quot;Enjoy Yourself (It&#x27;s Later than You Think)&quot; (Carl Sigman, Herb Magidson) — Patrick Crenshaw
# &quot;Chiquita Banana&quot; (Leonard McKenzie, Garth Montgomery, William Wirges) — Christy Carlson Romano
# &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding/Vive Le Capitaine Spaulding&quot; (Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Philippe Videcoq) — The Helen Miles Singers
# &quot;I&#x27;m Through with Love&quot; (Kahn, Malneck, Livingston) — Goldie Hawn/Edward Norton
# &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (Kalmar, Ruby) — The Helen Miles Singers

Most of the performers sing in their own voices, with two exceptions: Goldie Hawn, who was told by Allen to intentionally sing worse because she sang too well to be believable as a normal person just breaking into song, and Drew Barrymore, who convinced Allen that her singing was too awful even for the &quot;realistic singing voice&quot; concept he was going for. Her voice was dubbed by Olivia Hayman.

The title song was written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby and was used as a recurring theme song in the Marx Brothers film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932). Allen is a well-known Groucho Marx fan. Marx&#x27;s theme song from &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1930) &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; is featured, sung in French by a chorus of Groucho Marxes. The songs, film score, and subsequent album were recorded, mixed, and co-produced by Dick Hyman and Roy Yokelson.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, the film grossed $131,678 from three theaters, with an average of $43,892 per theater. It ended with its run with $9.8 million.

===Critical response===
The film was well received. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A likable, infectious musical, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; is sometimes uneven but always toe-tapping and fun.&quot; Janet Maslin wrote a strongly positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing the film as &quot;a delightful and witty compendium of [Allen&#x27;s] favorite things.&quot; Among the film&#x27;s strongest detractors was Jonathan Rosenbaum, who described it as &quot;creepy&quot; and claimed, &quot;this characterless world of Manhattan-Venice-Paris, where love consists only of self-validation, and political convictions of any kind are attributable to either hypocrisy or a brain condition, the me-first nihilism of Allen&#x27;s frightened worldview is finally given full exposure, and it&#x27;s a grisly thing to behold.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 54th Golden Globe Awards.

<doc id="42228" wikidata="Q5417289" url="?curid=42228" title="Everleigh Club">
<text>The Everleigh Club was a high-class brothel which operated in Chicago, Illinois, from February 1900 until October 1911. It was owned and operated by Ada and Minna Everleigh.

==Opening==
Ada Everleigh, the elder, was born in Greene County, Virginia on February 15, 1864, and died in Charlottesville, Virginia on January 5, 1960. Minna was born in Greene County on July 13, 1866 and died in New York City on September 16, 1948.

Initially born with the surname Simms, the sisters took the name Everleigh, which was inspired by their grandmother&#x27;s tradition to sign her letters, &quot;Everly yours.&quot; According to the sisters, after two unsuccessful marriages (of which there is no record), the Everleigh sisters left the small town they were raised on in Kentucky (another story concocted by the sisters) for Omaha, Nebraska. It was there where Minna and Ada established their first brothel using money they invested from their $35,000 estate inheritance. In only two years, the women doubled their investment in addition to earning a considerable profit. Minna and Ada closed the brothel, and with their recent earnings, sought more lucrative investment opportunities.

Before relocating to Chicago, the Everleigh sisters toured brothels in many cities, trying to find a location which had &quot;plenty of wealthy men but no superior houses.&quot; They were directed to Chicago by Cleo Maitland, a madam in Washington, D.C., who suggested they contact Effie Hankins in Chicago. After buying Hankins&#x27;s brothel at 2131–2133 South Dearborn Street, they
fired all the women and completely redecorated the entire building with the most luxurious appointments available. Silk curtains, damask easy chairs, oriental rugs, mahogany tables, gold rimmed china and silver dinner ware, perfumed fountains in every room, a $15,000 gold-leafed piano for the Music Room, mirrored ceilings, a library filled with finely bound volumes, an art gallery featuring nudes in gold frames—no expense was spared. While the heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson thought the $57 gold spittoons in his café were worth boasting about, the patrons of the Everleigh Club were obliged to expectorate in $650 gold cuspidors.

The Everleigh Club was described by Chicago&#x27;s Vice Commission as &quot;probably the most famous and luxurious house of prostitution in the country&quot;.

Before the opening of the Everleigh Club, Ada was responsible for recruiting staff for the club. She started by contacting her former employees in Omaha and spreading the word through brothels across the country. She conducted face-to-face interviews with all the applicants. The brothel opened on February 1, 1900 with little fanfare, and turned away many of the clients who initially appeared because the Everleigh Sisters did not deem them to be the suitably upscale clientele they were seeking. Once the club was open, Ada, who was quieter and more reserved than her sister, took on the responsibility of making sure the club was kept up to standard. She oversaw cleaning and renovations.

==Expenses==
After the club was closed, Minna Everleigh claimed in testimony that she &quot;always entertained state legislators free in the club.&quot;

==The sisters&#x27; separate responsibilities==

The Everleigh sisters Minna and Ada—the madams of the Everleigh Club— carried out very different duties in the operation of the club. Ada, the soft-spoken sister, mainly focused on the business transactions, which included managing the books and allocating finances. She took care of the logistics of running the club and was responsible for hiring new girls. Minna, the outgoing sister, was responsible for teaching new girls charm and culture, as well as any duties that required personal interaction. Her personality lent her the ability to effortlessly interact with guests. Often Minna was seen socializing with guests near the parlors or welcoming them with a friendly greeting into the club.

The Everleigh quickly gained a reputation as an upscale gentlemen&#x27;s club, so much so that the Everleigh sisters were forced to turn away prospective clients even on opening day on February 1, 1900. The club&#x27;s extensive popularity afforded Minna and Ada the opportunity to select their clientele. Only those men deemed suitable by Minna and Ada gained admittance into the Everleigh Club. The Everleigh sisters deemed a prospective client &quot;worthy&quot; to be admitted into the club if: the prospective client provided a letter of recommendation from an existing member, an engraved card, or through a formal introduction by Minna or Ada. These standards made the club extremely exclusive, indulging the desires of only the wealthy and influential men. Author Karen Abbott wrote, &quot;The cachet of being able to go there, just because they turned down so many people. It became an exclusive badge of honor just to be admitted.&quot;

On March 3, 1902, Prince Henry of Prussia visited the club while in the United States to collect a ship built for his brother, German Kaiser Wilhelm II. Although the city had sponsored numerous events for Henry, his main interest was a visit to the club. The sisters planned a bacchanalia for the visiting prince, including dancing, dining and a recreation of the dismemberment of Zeus&#x27;s son. During one of the dances, a prostitute&#x27;s slipper came off and spilled champagne. When one of the prince&#x27;s entourage drank the champagne, he started the trend of drinking champagne from a woman&#x27;s shoe.

The club employed 15 to 25 cooks and maids.

==Scandals==
On November 22, 1905, Marshall Field, Jr., son of department store founder Marshall Field, suffered a gunshot to the abdomen; he died of complications several days later. Although newspapers reported it was an accident and occurred at his home, there is some evidence that he was shot by a prostitute at the Everleigh Club. A rival madam maliciously accused the Everleigh sisters of murdering Field.

On January 9, 1910, Nathaniel Moore died of natural causes in the Chez Shaw brothel in Chicago&#x27;s Levee district after spending much of the previous night at the Everleigh Club.

==Closing==
The Everleigh sisters operated their brothel as a place of luxury, made available only to the wealthier and more prominent clients. This made it more difficult when it came time for reform. Other brothels during this time period simply were raided by the police and shut down, but because the Everleigh Club in particular had such a reputation for its high standards and exclusivity, officials were not able to dismantle the club so easily.

The Chicago Vice Commission sought to close the Everleigh Club and the entire red-light district of Chicago in an attempt to rehabilitate prostitutes, curb the spread of venereal disease, and cease the crime and violence that often were associated with prostitution (not necessarily within the Everleigh Club). Because of the Everleigh sisters and their lavish club, prostitution during this time period became a glamorized activity, which made it harder to eradicate. Local politics played a large role in deciding how and when the club would be shut down. The Everleigh sisters were known for their tendency to bribe local aldermen to look the other way when it came to legal manners. Following a 1910 Vice Commission report that noted there were nearly 600 brothels in Chicago, Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. ordered the Everleigh Club to be closed on October 24, 1911. The sisters retired with an estimated $1 million in cash and traveled in Europe, then eventually changed their name back to Lester and settled in New York City. When their brothel business closed, Ada was 45 years old and Minna was 47 years old.

Minna, always the more outspoken of the two, responded philosophically, stating &quot;If the Mayor says we must close, that settles it...I&#x27;ll close up shop and walk out with a smile on my face.&quot; And so they did. She later stated &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for married men, we couldn&#x27;t have carried on at all, and if it weren&#x27;t for cheating married women, we could have made another million.&quot;

Shortly after the brothel was closed, Minna Everleigh testified against Chicago aldermen &quot;Bathhouse&quot; John Coughlin and &quot;Hinky Dink&quot; Kenna. Although Everleigh announced she would make her testimony public, threats by &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo to kill Minna and her sister if the testimony were made public kept her silent. Nevertheless, Chief Justice Harry Olson of Chicago&#x27;s Municipal Court released her testimony that outlined the schedule of graft due to the aldermen in return for allowing operations to continue in the Levee District.

The building that housed the Everleigh Club eventually was razed in July 1933. Today, the Chicago Housing Authority&#x27;s Hilliard Homes, designed by Bertrand Goldberg, stand on the site.

==In popular fiction==
The novel &quot;The Golden Room&quot; by Irving Wallace (1989) gives a fictionalized account of the events surrounding the visit of Prince Henry of Prussia to the Everleigh Club, taking great liberties with dates and historical characters.

The fictional novel “The Race - An Issac Bell Adventure“ by [Clive Cussler &amp; Justin Scott](2011) includes a reference in Chapter 26 to the Everleigh Club.

<text>Purushottam Laxman Deshpande (alternatively written as Pu La Deshpande; 8 November 1919 – 12 June 2000), popularly known by his initials (&quot;Pu. La.&quot;) or as P. L. Deshpande, was a Marathi writer and humorist from Maharashtra. He was also an accomplished film and stage actor, script writer, author, composer, musician, singer and orator. He was often referred to as &quot;Maharashtra&#x27;s beloved personality&quot;.

Deshpande&#x27;s works have been translated into several languages including English and Kannada.

== Early life ==

Purushottam Laxman Deshpande was born in Gamdevi Street, Chowpati, Mumbai in a Gaud Saraswat Brahmin (GSB) family to Laxman Trimbak Deshpande and Laxmibai Laxman Deshpande. His maternal grandfather, Vaman Mangesh Dubhashi, was a Marathi poet and writer. He had translated Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Gitanjali into Marathi, with the title, &quot;Abhang Gitanjali&quot;.

The family used to stay at Kenway House, Procter Road in the Grant Road locality in Mumbai. His family then moved to Jogeshwari. His first 8 years at the newly formed Saraswati Baug Colony are described in the story titled &#x27;Balpanicha Kaal Sukhacha&#x27; or &quot;Bālpaṇicā Kāḷ Sukhācā&quot; (translation: the happy days of childhood) in his book &quot;Purchundi&quot;. The family then moved to Vile Parle.

== Education ==

Deshpande studied at Parle Tilak Vidyalaya. He attended Ismail Yusuf College after high school and then Fergusson College in Pune for BA. Later, he attended Government Law College, Mumbai for LLB. He completed Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1950 and then a Master of Arts (MA) degree from Willingdon College, Sangli. He also took lessons in playing the harmonium from Dattopant Rajopadhye of &quot;Bhaskar Sangitalaya&quot;.

== Personal life ==
His first wife, Sundar Divadkar, died soon after their wedding. On 12 June 1946, Deshpande married his colleague, Sunita Thakur. She (Sunita Deshpande) was to go on to become an accomplished writer in her own right. The couple did not have any children of their own. They raised Sunitabai&#x27;s nephew, Dinesh Thakur as their own son. Pu La wrote on Dinesh in his book Gangot.
