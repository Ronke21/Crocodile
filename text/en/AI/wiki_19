<text>While the word religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion used in religious studies courses defines it as
Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws, or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions, churches, denominations, religious bodies, faith groups, tribes, cultures, movements, or ultimate concerns.

The word &quot;religion&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the words &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;belief system&quot;, but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized behaviours, including clerical hierarchies, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregations of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural) or religious texts. Certain religions also have a sacred language often used in liturgical services. The practice of a religion may also include sermons, commemoration of the activities of a God or gods, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trance, rituals, liturgies, ceremonies, worship, initiations, funerals, marriages, meditation, invocation, mediumship, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain parapsychological phenomena such as out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and reincarnation, along with many other paranormal and supernatural experiences.

Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories: world religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international faiths; Indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and new religious movements, which refers to recently developed faiths. One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings, and thus believes that religion, as a concept, has been applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.

<text>Digital electronics is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use or produce them. This is in contrast to analog electronics which work primarily with analog signals. Despite the name, digital electronics designs include important analog design considerations.

Digital electronic circuits are usually made from large assemblies of logic gates, often packaged in integrated circuits. Complex devices may have simple electronic representations of Boolean logic functions.

==History==
The binary number system was refined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (published in 1705) and he also established that by using the binary system, the principles of arithmetic and logic could be joined. Digital logic as we know it was the brain-child of George Boole in the mid-19th century. In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. Eventually, vacuum tubes replaced relays for logic operations. Lee De Forest&#x27;s modification of the Fleming valve in 1907 could be used as an AND gate. Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition 5.101 of &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, shared the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, for creating the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924.

Mechanical analog computers started appearing in the first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations. In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first electronic digital computers were developed, with the term &quot;digital&quot; being proposed by George Stibitz in 1942. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern PCs.

Claude Shannon, demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship, ultimately laid the foundations of digital computing and digital circuits in his master&#x27;s thesis of 1937, which is considered to be arguably the most important master&#x27;s thesis ever written, winning the 1939 Alfred Noble Prize.

The Z3 was an electromechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse. Finished in 1941, it was the world&#x27;s first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. Its operation was facilitated by the invention of the vacuum tube in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming.

At the same time that digital calculation replaced analog, purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents. John Bardeen and Walter Brattain invented the point-contact transistor at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by William Shockley inventing the bipolar junction transistor at Bell Labs in 1948.

At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of vacuum tubes. Their &quot;transistorised computer&quot;, and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. From 1955 and onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the &quot;second generation&quot; of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors were smaller, more reliable, had indefinite lifespans, and required less power than vacuum tubes - thereby giving off less heat, and allowing much denser concentrations of circuits, up to tens of thousands in a relatively compact space.

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick discovered silicon dioxide surface passivation effects. In 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch and Derick technique and transistors was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni, who would later invent the planar process in 1959 while at Fairchild Semiconductor. At Bell Labs, J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/SiO2 stack and published their results in 1960. Following this research at Bell Labs, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. The team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.

While working at Texas Instruments in July 1958, Jack Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit (IC), then successfully demonstrated the first working integrated circuit on 12 September 1958. Kilby&#x27;s chip was made of germanium. The following year, Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor invented the silicon integrated circuit. The basis for Noyce&#x27;s silicon IC was Hoerni&#x27;s planar process.

The MOSFET&#x27;s advantages include high scalability, affordability, low power consumption, and high transistor density. Its rapid on–off electronic switching speed also makes it ideal for generating pulse trains, the basis for electronic digital signals, in contrast to BJTs which, more slowly, generate analog signals resembling sine waves. Along with MOS large-scale integration (LSI), these factors make the MOSFET an important switching device for digital circuits. The MOSFET revolutionized the electronics industry, and is the most common semiconductor device.

In the early days of integrated circuits, each chip was limited to only a few transistors, and the low degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple. Manufacturing yields were also quite low by today&#x27;s standards. The wide adoption of the MOSFET transistor by the early 1970s led to the first large-scale integration (LSI) chips with more than 10,000 transistors on a single chip. Following the wide adoption of CMOS, a type of MOSFET logic, by the 1980s, millions and then billions of MOSFETs could be placed on one chip as the technology progressed, and good designs required thorough planning, giving rise to new design methods. The transistor count of devices and total production rose to unprecedented heights. The total amount of transistors produced until 2018 has been estimated to be (13sextillion).

The wireless revolution (the introduction and proliferation of wireless networks) began in the 1990s and was enabled by the wide adoption of MOSFET-based RF power amplifiers (power MOSFET and LDMOS) and RF circuits (RF CMOS). Wireless networks allowed for public digital transmission without the need for cables, leading to digital television, satellite and digital radio, GPS, wireless Internet and mobile phones through the 1990s2000s.

==Properties==
An advantage of digital circuits when compared to analog circuits is that signals represented digitally can be transmitted without degradation caused by noise. For example, a continuous audio signal transmitted as a sequence of 1s and 0s, can be reconstructed without error, provided the noise picked up in transmission is not enough to prevent identification of the 1s and 0s.

In a digital system, a more precise representation of a signal can be obtained by using more binary digits to represent it. While this requires more digital circuits to process the signals, each digit is handled by the same kind of hardware, resulting in an easily scalable system. In an analog system, additional resolution requires fundamental improvements in the linearity and noise characteristics of each step of the signal chain.

With computer-controlled digital systems, new functions can be added through software revision and no hardware changes are needed. Often this can be done outside of the factory by updating the product&#x27;s software. This way, the product&#x27;s design errors can be corrected even after the product is in a customer&#x27;s hands.

Information storage can be easier in digital systems than in analog ones. The noise immunity of digital systems permits data to be stored and retrieved without degradation. In an analog system, noise from aging and wear degrade the information stored. In a digital system, as long as the total noise is below a certain level, the information can be recovered perfectly. Even when more significant noise is present, the use of redundancy permits the recovery of the original data provided too many errors do not occur.

In some cases, digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to accomplish the same tasks, thus producing more heat which increases the complexity of the circuits such as the inclusion of heat sinks. In portable or battery-powered systems this can limit the use of digital systems. For example, battery-powered cellular phones often use a low-power analog front-end to amplify and tune the radio signals from the base station. However, a base station has grid power and can use power-hungry, but very flexible software radios. Such base stations can easily be reprogrammed to process the signals used in new cellular standards.

Many useful digital systems must translate from continuous analog signals to discrete digital signals. This causes quantization errors. Quantization error can be reduced if the system stores enough digital data to represent the signal to the desired degree of fidelity. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem provides an important guideline as to how much digital data is needed to accurately portray a given analog signal.

If a single piece of digital data is lost or misinterpreted, in some systems only a small error may result, while in other systems the meaning of large blocks of related data can completely change. For example, a single-bit error in audio data stored directly as linear pulse-code modulation causes, at worst, a single audible click. But when using audio compression to save storage space and transmission time, a single bit error may cause a much larger disruption.

Because of the cliff effect, it can be difficult for users to tell if a particular system is right on the edge of failure, or if it can tolerate much more noise before failing. Digital fragility can be reduced by designing a digital system for robustness. For example, a parity bit or other error management method can be inserted into the signal path. These schemes help the system detect errors, and then either correct the errors, or request retransmission of the data.
==Construction==
A digital circuit is typically constructed from small electronic circuits called logic gates that can be used to create combinational logic. Each logic gate is designed to perform a function of Boolean logic when acting on logic signals. A logic gate is generally created from one or more electrically controlled switches, usually transistors but thermionic valves have seen historic use. The output of a logic gate can, in turn, control or feed into more logic gates.

Another form of digital circuit is constructed from lookup tables, (many sold as &quot;programmable logic devices&quot;, though other kinds of PLDs exist). Lookup tables can perform the same functions as machines based on logic gates, but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the wiring. This means that a designer can often repair design errors without changing the arrangement of wires. Therefore, in small-volume products, programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution. They are usually designed by engineers using electronic design automation software.

Integrated circuits consist of multiple transistors on one silicon chip and are the least expensive way to make a large number of interconnected logic gates. Integrated circuits are usually interconnected on a printed circuit board which is a board that holds electrical components, and connects them together with copper traces.

==Design==
Engineers use many methods to minimize logic redundancy in order to reduce the circuit complexity. Reduced complexity reduces component count and potential errors and therefore typically reduces cost. Logic redundancy can be removed by several well-known techniques, such as binary decision diagrams, Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, the Quine–McCluskey algorithm, and the heuristic computer method. These operations are typically performed within a computer-aided design system.

Embedded systems with microcontrollers and programmable logic controllers are often used to implement digital logic for complex systems that do not require optimal performance. These systems are usually programmed by software engineers or by electricians, using ladder logic.

===Representation===
A digital circuit&#x27;s input-output relationship can be represented as a truth table. An equivalent high-level circuit uses logic gates, each represented by a different shape (standardized by IEEE/ANSI 91–1984). A low-level representation uses an equivalent circuit of electronic switches (usually transistors).

Most digital systems divide into combinational and sequential systems. The output of a combinational system depends only on the present inputs. However, a sequential system has some of its outputs fed back as inputs, so its output may depend on past inputs in addition to present inputs, to produce a &quot;sequence&quot; of operations. Simplified representations of their behavior called state machines facilitate design and test.

Sequential systems divide into two further subcategories. &quot;Synchronous&quot; sequential systems change state all at once when a clock signal changes state. &quot;Asynchronous&quot; sequential systems propagate changes whenever inputs change. Synchronous sequential systems are made using flip flops that store inputted voltages as a bit only when the clock changes.

===Synchronous systems===
The usual way to implement a synchronous sequential state machine is to divide it into a piece of combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a &quot;state register&quot;. The state register represents the state as a binary number. The combinational logic produces the binary representation for the next state. On each clock cycle, the state register captures the feedback generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and feeds it back as an unchanging input to the combinational part of the state machine. The clock rate is limited by the most time-consuming logic calculation in the combinational logic.

===Asynchronous systems===
Most digital logic is synchronous because it is easier to create and verify a synchronous design. However, asynchronous logic has the advantage of its speed not being constrained by an arbitrary clock; instead, it runs at the maximum speed of its logic gates.

Nevertheless, most systems need to accept external unsynchronized signals into their synchronous logic circuits. This interface is inherently asynchronous and must be analyzed as such. Examples of widely used asynchronous circuits include synchronizer flip-flops, switch debouncers and arbiters.

Asynchronous logic components can be hard to design because all possible states, in all possible timings must be considered. The usual method is to construct a table of the minimum and maximum time that each such state can exist and then adjust the circuit to minimize the number of such states. The designer must force the circuit to periodically wait for all of its parts to enter a compatible state (this is called &quot;self-resynchronization&quot;). Without careful design, it is easy to accidentally produce asynchronous logic that is unstable—that is—real electronics will have unpredictable results because of the cumulative delays caused by small variations in the values of the electronic components.

===Register transfer systems===
Many digital systems are data flow machines. These are usually designed using synchronous register transfer logic and written with hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog.

In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers. A sequential state machine controls when each register accepts new data from its input. The outputs of each register are a bundle of wires called a &quot;bus&quot; that carries that number to other calculations. A calculation is simply a piece of combinational logic. Each calculation also has an output bus, and these may be connected to the inputs of several registers. Sometimes a register will have a multiplexer on its input so that it can store a number from any one of several buses.

Asynchronous register-transfer systems (such as computers) have a general solution. In the 1980s, some researchers discovered that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs by using first-in-first-out synchronization logic. In this scheme, the digital machine is characterized as a set of data flows. In each step of the flow, a synchronization circuit determines when the outputs of that step are valid and instructs the next stage when to use these outputs.

===Computer design===
The most general-purpose register-transfer logic machine is a computer. This is basically an automatic binary abacus. The control unit of a computer is usually designed as a microprogram run by a microsequencer. A microprogram is much like a player-piano roll. Each table entry of the microprogram commands the state of every bit that controls the computer. The sequencer then counts, and the count addresses the memory or combinational logic machine that contains the microprogram. The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, including the microsequencer itself. In this way, the complex task of designing the controls of a computer is reduced to the simpler task of programming a collection of much simpler logic machines.

Almost all computers are synchronous. However, asynchronous computers have also been built. One example is the ASPIDA DLX core. Another was offered by ARM Holdings. They do not, however, have any speed advantages because modern computer designs already run at the speed of their slowest component, usually memory. They do use somewhat less power because a clock distribution network is not needed. An unexpected advantage is that asynchronous computers do not produce spectrally-pure radio noise. They are used in some radio-sensitive mobile-phone base-station controllers. They may be more secure in cryptographic applications because their electrical and radio emissions can be more difficult to decode.

===Computer architecture===
Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to arrange the registers, calculation logic, buses and other parts of the computer in the best way possible for a specific purpose. Computer architects have put a lot of work into reducing the cost and increasing the speed of computers in addition to boosting their immunity to programming errors. An increasingly common goal of computer architects is to reduce the power used in battery-powered computer systems, such as smartphones.

===Design issues in digital circuits===
Digital circuits are made from analog components. The design must assure that the analog nature of the components does not dominate the desired digital behavior. Digital systems must manage noise and timing margins, parasitic inductances and capacitances.

Bad designs have intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishingly fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, runt pulses that do not reach valid threshold voltages.

Additionally, where clocked digital systems interface to analog systems or systems that are driven from a different clock, the digital system can be subject to metastability where a change to the input violates the setup time for a digital input latch.

Since digital circuits are made from analog components, digital circuits calculate more slowly than low-precision analog circuits that use a similar amount of space and power. However, the digital circuit will calculate more repeatably, because of its high noise immunity.

===Automated design tools===

Much of the effort of designing large logic machines has been automated through the application of electronic design automation (EDA).

Simple truth table-style descriptions of logic are often optimized with EDA that automatically produce reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still produce the desired outputs. The most common example of this kind of software is the Espresso heuristic logic minimizer. Optimizing large logic systems may be done using the Quine–McCluskey algorithm or binary decision diagrams. There are promising experiments with genetic algorithms and annealing optimizations.

To automate costly engineering processes, some EDA can take state tables that describe state machines and automatically produce a truth table or a function table for the combinational logic of a state machine. The state table is a piece of text that lists each state, together with the conditions controlling the transitions between them and their associated output signals.

Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using a &quot;tool flow&quot;. The tool flow is usually controlled with the help of a scripting language, a simplified computer language that can invoke the software design tools in the right order. Tool flows for large logic systems such as microprocessors can be thousands of commands long, and combine the work of hundreds of engineers. Writing and debugging tool flows is an established engineering specialty in companies that produce digital designs. The tool flow usually terminates in a detailed computer file or set of files that describe how to physically construct the logic. Often it consists of instructions on how to draw the transistors and wires on an integrated circuit or a printed circuit board.

Parts of tool flows are debugged by verifying the outputs of simulated logic against expected inputs. The test tools take computer files with sets of inputs and outputs and highlight discrepancies between the simulated behavior and the expected behavior. Once the input data is believed to be correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness. Some tool flows verify designs by first producing a design, then scanning the design to produce compatible input data for the tool flow. If the scanned data matches the input data, then the tool flow has probably not introduced errors.

The functional verification data are usually called &quot;test vectors&quot;. The functional test vectors may be preserved and used in the factory to test whether newly constructed logic works correctly. However, functional test patterns do not discover all fabrication faults. Production tests are often designed by automatic test pattern generation software tools. These generate test vectors by examining the structure of the logic and systematically generating tests targeting particular potential faults. This way the fault coverage can closely approach 100%, provided the design is properly made testable (see next section).

Once a design exists, and is verified and testable, it often needs to be processed to be manufacturable as well. Modern integrated circuits have features smaller than the wavelength of the light used to expose the photoresist. Software that are designed for manufacturability add interference patterns to the exposure masks to eliminate open-circuits and enhance the masks&#x27; contrast.

===Design for testability===
There are several reasons for testing a logic circuit. When the circuit is first developed, it is necessary to verify that the design circuit meets the required functional, and timing specifications. When multiple copies of a correctly designed circuit are being manufactured, it is essential to test each copy to ensure that the manufacturing process has not introduced any flaws.

A large logic machine (say, with more than a hundred logical variables) can have an astronomical number of possible states. Obviously, factory testing every state of such a machine is unfeasible, for even if testing each state only took a microsecond, there are more possible states than there are microseconds since the universe began!

Large logic machines are almost always designed as assemblies of smaller logic machines. To save time, the smaller sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed &quot;design for test&quot; circuitry and are tested independently. One common testing scheme provides a test mode that forces some part of the logic machine to enter a &quot;test cycle&quot;. The test cycle usually exercises large independent parts of the machine.

Boundary scan is a common test scheme that uses serial communication with external test equipment through one or more shift registers known as &quot;scan chains&quot;. Serial scans have only one or two wires to carry the data, and minimize the physical size and expense of the infrequently used test logic. After all the test data bits are in place, the design is reconfigured to be in &quot;normal mode&quot; and one or more clock pulses are applied, to test for faults (e.g. stuck-at low or stuck-at high) and capture the test result into flip-flops or latches in the scan shift register(s). Finally, the result of the test is shifted out to the block boundary and compared against the predicted &quot;good machine&quot; result.

In a board-test environment, serial-to-parallel testing has been formalized as the JTAG standard.

===Trade-offs===

====Cost====

Since a digital system may use many logic gates, the overall cost of building a computer correlates strongly with the cost of a logic gate. In the 1930s, the earliest digital logic systems were constructed from telephone relays because these were inexpensive and relatively reliable.

The earliest integrated circuits were constructed to save weight and permit the Apollo Guidance Computer to control an inertial guidance system for a spacecraft. The first integrated circuit logic gates cost nearly US$50, which in would be equivalent to $. Mass-produced gates on integrated circuits became the least-expensive method to construct digital logic.

With the rise of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used represented another way to save costs. The goal of a designer is not just to make the simplest circuit, but to keep the component count down. Sometimes this results in more complicated designs with respect to the underlying digital logic but nevertheless reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption.

====Reliability====

Another major motive for reducing component count on printed circuit boards is to reduce the manufacturing defect rate due to failed soldered connections and increase reliability. Defect and failure rates tend to increase along with the total number of component pins.

The failure of a single logic gate may cause a digital machine to fail. Where additional reliability is required, redundant logic can be provided. Redundancy adds cost and power consumption over a non-redundant system.

The &quot;reliability&quot; of a logic gate can be described by its mean time between failure (MTBF). Digital machines first became useful when the MTBF for a switch increased above a few hundred hours. Even so, many of these machines had complex, well-rehearsed repair procedures, and would be nonfunctional for hours because a tube burned-out, or a moth got stuck in a relay. Modern transistorized integrated circuit logic gates have MTBFs greater than 82 billion hours (). This level of reliability is required because integrated circuits have so many logic gates.

====Fan-out====

Fan-out describes how many logic inputs can be controlled by a single logic output without exceeding the electrical current ratings of the gate outputs. The minimum practical fan-out is about five. Modern electronic logic gates using CMOS transistors for switches have higher fan-outs.

====Speed====

The &quot;switching speed&quot; describes how long it takes a logic output to change from true to false or vice versa. Faster logic can accomplish more operations in less time. Modern electronic digital logic routinely switches at , and some laboratory systems switch at more than ..

==Logic families==
Digital design started with relay logic which is slow. Occasionally a mechanical failure would occur. Fan-outs were typically about 10, limited by the resistance of the coils and arcing on the contacts from high voltages.

Later, vacuum tubes were used. These were very fast, but generated heat, and were unreliable because the filaments would burn out. Fan-outs were typically 5 to 7, limited by the heating from the tubes&#x27; current. In the 1950s, special computer tubes were developed with filaments that omitted volatile elements like silicon. These ran for hundreds of thousands of hours.

The first semiconductor logic family was resistor–transistor logic. This was a thousand times more reliable than tubes, ran cooler, and used less power, but had a very low fan-out of 3. Diode–transistor logic improved the fan-out up to about 7, and reduced the power. Some DTL designs used two power supplies with alternating layers of NPN and PNP transistors to increase the fan-out.

Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) was a great improvement over these. In early devices, fan-out improved to 10, and later variations reliably achieved 20. TTL was also fast, with some variations achieving switching times as low as 20 ns. TTL is still used in some designs.

Emitter coupled logic is very fast but uses a lot of power. It was extensively used for high-performance computers, such as the Illiac IV, made up of many medium-scale components.

By far, the most common digital integrated circuits built today use CMOS logic, which is fast, offers high circuit density and low power per gate. This is used even in large, fast computers, such as the IBM System z.

==Recent developments==

In 2009, researchers discovered that memristors can implement a Boolean state storage and provides a complete logic family with very small amounts of space and power, using familiar CMOS semiconductor processes.

The discovery of superconductivity has enabled the development of rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) circuit technology, which uses Josephson junctions instead of transistors. Most recently, attempts are being made to construct purely optical computing systems capable of processing digital information using nonlinear optical elements.

<doc id="39070" wikidata="Q150726" url="?curid=39070" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Maximilian I (22 March 1459 – 12 January 1519) was King of the Romans from 1486 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1508 until his death in 1519. He was never crowned by the Pope, as the journey to Rome was blocked by the Venetians. He proclaimed himself elected emperor in 1508 at Trent, with Pope Julius II later recognizing it. This broke the tradition of requiring a papal coronation for the adoption of the Imperial title. Maximilian was the only surviving son of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Eleanor of Portugal. Since his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486, he ran a double government, or &quot;Doppelregierung&quot;, with his father until Frederick&#x27;s death in 1493.

Maximilian expanded the influence of the House of Habsburg through war and his marriage in 1477 to Mary, Duchess of Burgundy. However, he also lost his family&#x27;s lands in Switzerland to the Swiss Confederacy. Through the marriage of his son Philip the Handsome to eventual queen Joanna of Castile in 1496, Maximilian helped to establish the Habsburg dynasty in Spain, which allowed his grandson Charles to hold the thrones of both Castile and Aragon. Historian Thomas A. Brady Jr. describes him as &quot;the first Holy Roman Emperor in 250 years who ruled as well as reigned&quot; and the &quot;ablest royal warlord of his generation&quot;.

Nicknamed &quot;Coeur d&#x27;acier&quot; (&quot;Heart of steel&quot;) by Olivier de la Marche and later historians (either as praise for his courage and soldierly qualities or reproach for his ruthlessness as a warlike ruler), Maximilian has entered the public consciousness, at least in the German-speaking world, as &quot;the last knight&quot; (&quot;der letzte Ritter&quot;), especially since the eponymous poem by Anastasius Grün was published (although the nickname likely existed even in Maximilian&#x27;s lifetime). Scholarly debates still discuss whether he was truly the last knight (either as an idealized medieval ruler leading people on horseback, or a Don Quixote-type dreamer and misadventurer), or the first Renaissance prince—an amoral politician who carried his family &quot;to the European pinnacle of dynastic power&quot; largely on the back of loans. 

Historians of the late nineteenth century like Leopold von Ranke often criticized Maximilian for putting the interest of his dynasty above that of Germany, hampering the nation&#x27;s unification process. Since Hermann Wiesflecker&#x27;s &quot;Kaiser Maximilian I. Das Reich, Österreich und Europa an der Wende zur Neuzeit&quot; (1971–1986) became the standard work, a more positive image of the emperor has emerged. He is seen as a modern, innovative ruler who carried out important reforms and promoted significant cultural achievements, even if the financial costs weighed down the Austrians and his military expansion and caused the deaths and sufferings of many people.

Through an &quot;unprecedented&quot; image-building program, with the help of many notable scholars and artists, in his lifetime, the emperor—&quot;the promoter, coordinator, and prime mover, an artistic impresario and entrepreneur with seemingly limitless energy and enthusiasm and an unfailing eye for detail&quot;—had built for himself &quot;a virtual royal self&quot; of a quality that historians call &quot;unmatched&quot; or &quot;hitherto unimagined&quot;. To this image, new layers have been added by the works of later artists in the centuries following his death, both as continuation of deliberately crafted images developed by his program as well as development of spontaneous sources and exploration of actual historical events, creating what Elaine Tennant dubs the &quot;Maximilian industry&quot;.

==Background and childhood==
Maximilian was born at Wiener Neustadt on 22 March 1459. His father, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, named him after Maximilian of Tebessa, who Frederick believed had once warned him of imminent peril in a dream. In his infancy, he and his parents were besieged in Vienna by Albert of Austria. One source relates that, during the siege&#x27;s worst days, he wandered around the castle garrison, begging the servants and men-at-arms for bread. He was the favourite child of his mother, whose personality contrasted his father&#x27;s. Reportedly she told Maximilian that, &quot;If I had known, my son, that you would become like your father, I would have regretted having born you for the throne.&quot; Her early death pushed him even more towards a man&#x27;s world, where one grew up first as a warrior rather than a politician.
Despite the efforts of his father Frederick and his tutor Peter Engelbrecht, whom Maximilian held in contempt, he became an indifferent and belligerent student, who preferred physical activities than learning. Although the two remained on good terms overall, Frederick was horrified by his only surviving son and heir&#x27;s overzealousness in chivalric contests, extravagance, and heavy tendencies towards wine, feasts and young women, which became evident during their trips in 1473 and 1474. Even though he was very young, the prince&#x27;s skills and physical attractiveness often made him the center of attention. Although Frederick had forbidden the princes of the Empire from fighting with Maximilian in tournaments, Maximilian gave himself the necessary permission at the first chance he got. Frederick did not allow him to participate in the 1474 war against Burgundy though and placed him under the care of the Bishop of Augsburg instead.

The Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was the chief political opponent of Maximilian&#x27;s father Frederick III. Frederick was concerned about Burgundy&#x27;s expansionist tendencies on the western border of his Holy Roman Empire, and, to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles&#x27; daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to Maximilian. After the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), he was successful and secured the marriage.

Perhaps as preparation for his task in the Netherlands, in 1476 at the age of 17, Maximilian commanded a military campaign against Hungary. This was the first actual battlefield experience in his life, even though the responsibility was likely shared with more experienced generals.

The Maximilian and Mary&#x27;s wedding took place on 19 August 1477.

==Reign in Burgundy and the Netherlands==

Maximilian&#x27;s wife had inherited the large Burgundian domains in France and the Low Countries upon her father&#x27;s death in the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477.

The southern part of the Duchy of Burgundy (sometimes called &quot;Burgundy proper&quot;) was also claimed by the French crown under Salic law, with Louis XI of France vigorously asserting his claim through military force. Maximilian at once undertook the defence of his wife&#x27;s dominions. Without support from the Empire and with an empty treasury left by Charles the Bold&#x27;s campaigns, he carried out a campaign against the French during 1478–1479 and reconquered Le Quesnoy, Conde and Antoing. He defeated the French forces at the Battle of Guinegate, in modern Enguinegatte, on 7 August 1479. 

Despite winning, Maximilian had to abandon the siege of Thérouanne and disband his army, either because the Netherlanders did not want him to become too strong or because his treasury was empty. The battle was an important landmark in military history though: the Burgundian pikemen were the precursors of the Landsknechte, while the French side derived the momentum for military reform from their loss.
According to some, Maximilian and Mary&#x27;s wedding contract stipulated that their children would succeed them but that the couple could not be each other&#x27;s heirs. Mary tried to bypass this rule with a promise to transfer territories as a gift in case of her death, but her plans were confounded. After Mary&#x27;s death in a riding accident on 27 March 1482 near the Wijnendale Castle, Maximilian&#x27;s aim was now to secure the inheritance to his and Mary&#x27;s son, Philip the Handsome. According to Haemers and Sutch, the original marriage contract stipulated that Maximilian could not inherit her Burgundian lands if they had children.

The Guinegate victory made Maximilian popular, but as an inexperienced ruler, he hurt himself politically by trying to centralize authority without respecting traditional rights and consulting relevant political bodies. The Belgian historian Eugène Duchesne comments that these years were among the saddest and most turbulent in the history of the country, and despite his later great imperial career, Maximilian unfortunately could never compensate for the mistakes he made as regent in this period. Some of the Netherlander provinces were hostile to Maximilian, and, in 1482, they signed a treaty with Louis XI in Arras that forced Maximilian to give up Franche-Comté and Artois to the French crown. 

They openly rebelled twice in the period 1482–1492, attempting to regain the autonomy they had enjoyed under Mary. Flemish rebels managed to capture Philip and even Maximilian himself, but they released Maximilian when Frederick III intervened. In 1489, as he turned his attention to his hereditary lands, he left the Low Countries in the hands of Albert of Saxony, who proved to be an excellent choice, as he was less emotionally committed to the Low Countries and more flexible as a politician than Maximilian, while also being a capable general. By 1492, rebellions were completely suppressed. Maximilian revoked the Great Privilege and established a strong ducal monarchy undisturbed by particularism. But he would not reintroduce Charles the Bold&#x27;s centralizing ordinances. Since 1489 (after his departure), the government under Albert of Saxony had made more efforts in consulting representative institutions and showed more restraint in subjugating recalcitrant territories. Notables who had previously supported rebellions returned to city administrations. The Estates General continued to develop as a regular meeting place of the central government. 

The harsh suppression of the rebellions did have an unifying effect, in that provinces stopped behaving like separate entities each supporting a different lord. Helmut Koenigsberger opines that it was not the erratic leadership of Maximilian, who was brave but hardly understood the Netherlands, but the Estates&#x27; desire for the survival of the country that made the Burgundian monarchy survive. Jean Berenger and C.A. Simpson argue that Maximilian, as a gifted military champion and organizer, did save the Netherlands from France, although the conflict between the Estates and his personal ambitions caused a catastrophic situation in the short term. Peter Spufford opines that the invasion was prevented by a combination of the Estates and Maximilian, although the cost of war, Maximilian&#x27;s spendthrift liberality and the interests enforced by his German bankers did cause huge expenditure while income was falling. Jelle Haemers comments that the Estates stopped their support towards the young and ambitious &quot;impresario&quot; (director) of war because they knew that after Guinegate, the nature of the war was not defensive anymore. 

Maximilian and his followers had managed to achieve remarkable success in stabilizing the situation though, and a stalemate was kept in Ghent as well as in Bruges, before the tragic death of Mary in 1482 completely turned the political landscape in the whole country upside down. According to Haemers, while Willem Zoete&#x27;s indictment of Maximilian&#x27;s government was a one-sided picture that exaggerated the negative points and the Regency Council displayed many of the same problems, Maximilian and his followers could have been more prudent when dealing with the complaints of their opponents before matters became bigger.
During his time in the Low Countries, he had experimented with all kinds of military models available, first urban militia and vassalic troops, then French-style companies that were too rigid and costly, and finally Germanic mercenaries. The brutal efficiency of Germanic mercenaries, together with the financial support of cities outside Flanders like Antwerp, Amsterdam, Mechelen and Brussels as well as a small group of loyal landed nobles proved decisive in the Burgundian-Habsburg regime&#x27;s final triumph. Reviewing the French historian Amable Sablon du Corail&#x27;s &quot;La Guerre, le prince et ses sujets. Les finances des Pays-Bas bourguignons sous Marie de Bourgogne et Maximilien d&#x27;Autriche (1477–1493)&quot;, Marc Boone comments that the brutality described shows Maximilian and the Habsburg dynasty&#x27;s insatiable greed of expansion and inability to adapt to local traditions, while Jean-François Lassalmonie opines that the nation building process (successful, with the establishment of a common tax) was remarkably similar to the same process in France, including the hesitation in working with local levels of the political society, except that the struggle was shorter and after 1494 a peaceful dialogue between the prince and the estates was reached. Jelle Haemers suggests that the level of violence associated with the suppression of the revolts as traditionally imagined has been exaggerated and that most of the violence happened in a symbolical manner, but also cautions against the tendency to consider the &quot;central state&quot; in the sense of a modern state.

While it has been suggested that Maximilian displayed a class-based mentality that favoured the aristocrats, recent studies suggest that, as evidenced by the court ordinance of 1482 among others, he sought to promote &quot;parvenus&quot; who were beholden to himself, and at an alarming speed for the traditional elites. After the rebellions, concerning the aristocracy, although Maximilian punished few with death, their properties were largely confiscated and they were replaced with a new elite class loyal to the Habsburgs—among whom, there were noblemen who had been part of traditional high nobility but elevated to supranational importance only in this period. The most important of these were John III and Frederik of Egmont, Engelbrecht II of Nassau, Henry of Witthem and the brothers of Glymes–Bergen.
In early 1486, he retook Mortaigne, l&#x27;Ecluse, Honnecourt and even Thérouanne, but the same thing like in 1479 happened—he lacked financial resources to exploit and keep his gains. Only in 1492, with a stable internal situation, he was able to reconquer and keep Franche-Comté and Arras on the pretext that the French had repudiated his daughter. In 1493, Maximilian and Charles VIII of France signed the Treaty of Senlis, with which Artois and Franche-Comté returned to Burgundian rule while Picardy was confirmed as French possession. The French also continued to keep the Duchy of Burgundy. Thus a large part of the Netherlands (known as the Seventeen Provinces) stayed in the Habsburg patrimony.

On 8 January 1488, using a similar 1373 French ordinance as the model, together with Philip, he issued the Ordinance of Admiralty, that organized the Admiralty as a state institution and strove to centralize maritime authority (this was a departure from the policy of Philip the Good, whose 1458 ordinance tried to restore maritime order by decentralizing power). This was the beginning of the Dutch navy, although initially the policy faced opposition and unfavourable political climate, which only improved with the appointment of Philip of Burgundy-Beveren in 1491. A permanent navy only took shape after 1555 under the governorship of his granddaughter Mary of Hungary.

In 1493, Frederick III died, thus Maximilian I became de facto leader of the Holy Roman Empire. He decided to transfer power to the 15-year-old Philip. During the time in the Low Countries, he contracted such emotional problems that except for rare, necessary occasions, he would never return to the land again after gaining control. When the Estates sent a delegation to offer him the regency after Philip&#x27;s death in 1506, he evaded them for months.
As suzerain, Maximilian continued to involve himself with the Low Countries from afar. His son&#x27;s and daughter&#x27;s governments tried to maintain a compromise between the states and the Empire. Philip, in particular, sought to maintain an independent Burgundian policy, which sometimes caused disagreements with his father. As Philip preferred to maintain peace and economic development for his land, Maximilian was left fighting Charles of Egmond over Guelders on his own resources. At one point, Philip let French troops supporting Guelders&#x27;s resistance to his rule pass through his own land. Only at the end of his reign, Philip decided to deal with this threat together with his father. 

By this time, Guelders had been affected by the continuous state of war and other problems. The duke of Cleves and the bishop of Utrecht, hoping to share spoils, gave Philip aid. Maximilian invested his own son with Guelders and Zutphen. Within months and with his father&#x27;s skilled use of field artillery, Philip conquered the whole land and Charles of Egmond was forced to prostrate himself in front of Philip. Maximilian would have liked to see the Guelders matter to be dealt with once and for all, but as Charles later escaped and Philip was at haste to make his 1506 fatal journey to Spain, troubles would soon arise again, leaving Margaret to deal with the problems. Maximilian was exasperated by the attitude of Philip (who, in Maximilian&#x27;s imagination, was probably influenced by insidious French agency) and the Estates, whom he considered to be unbelievably nonchalant and tightfisted about a threat to their own country&#x27;s security. Philip&#x27;s death in Burgos was a heavy blow personally (Maximilian&#x27;s entourage seem to have concealed it from him for more than ten days) and also politically, as by this time, he had become his father&#x27;s most important international ally, although he retained his independent judgement. All their joint ventures fell apart, including the planned Italian expedition in 1508.
The Estates preferred to maintain peace with France and Guelders. But Charles of Egmont, the de facto lord of Guelders continued to cause trouble. In 1511, Margaret made an alliance with England and besieged Venlo, but Charles of Egmont invaded Holland so the siege had to be lifted. James D. Tracy opines that Maximilian and Margaret were reasonable in demanding more stern measures against Guelders, but their critics in the Estates General (that had continuously voted against providing funds for wars against Guelders) and among the nobles naively thought that Charles of Egmont could be controlled by maintaining the peaceful relationship with the King of France, his patron. Leading Renaissance humanists in the Netherlands like Erasmus and Hadrianus Barlandus displayed a distrust towards the government and especially the person of Maximilian, whom they believed to be a warlike and greedy prince. After the brutal 1517 campaign of Charles of Egmont in Friesland and Holland, these humanists, in their mistaken belief, spread the stories that the emperor and other princes were concocting clever schemes and creating wars just to expand the Habsburg dominion and extracting money.

By the time Margaret became Regent, Maximilian was less inclined to help regarding the Guelders matter. He suggested to her that the Estates in the Low Countries should defend themselves, forcing her to sign the 1513 treaty with Charles. Habsburg Netherlands would only be able to incorporate Guelders and Zutphen under Charles V.

Following Margaret&#x27;s strategy of defending the Low Countries with foreign armies, in 1513, at the head of Henry VIII&#x27;s army, Maximilian gained a victory against the French at the Battle of the Spurs, at little cost to himself or his daughter (in fact according to Margaret, the Low Countries got a profit of one million of gold from supplying the English army). For the sake of his grandson Charles&#x27;s Burgundian lands, he ordered Thérouanne&#x27;s walls to be demolished (the stronghold had often served as a backdoor for French interference in the Low Countries).

==Reign in the Holy Roman Empire==

===Recapture of Austria===
Maximilian was elected King of the Romans on 16 February 1486 in Frankfurt-am-Main and was crowned on 9 April 1486 in Aachen. Much of the Austrian territories and Vienna were under the rule of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, as a result of the Austrian–Hungarian War (1477–1488). Maximilian was now a king without lands. Matthias Corvinus offered Emperor Frederick and his son Maximilian, the return of Austrian provinces and Vienna, if they would renounce the treaty of 1463 and accept Matthias as Frederick&#x27;s designated heir and favoured successor as Holy Roman Emperor. Before this was settled, Matthias died in Vienna in 1490. However, after Matthias Corvinus&#x27; death, civil war broke out in Hungary between the supporters of John Corvinus and the supporters of Vladislaus of Bohemia. Due to the Hungarian civil war, new possibilities were opened for Maximilan. 

In July 1490, Maximilian began a series of short sieges that reconquered cities and fortresses that his father had lost in Austria. Maximilian entered Vienna, already evacuated by the Hungarians, in August 1490. He was injured while attacking the citadel guarded by a garrison of 400 Hungarians troops who repelled his forces twice, but after a few days they surrendered.

In addition, the County of Tyrol and Duchy of Bavaria went to war in the late 15th century. Bavaria demanded money from Tyrol that had been loaned on the collateral of Tyrolean lands. In 1490, the two states demanded that Maximilian I step in to mediate the dispute. His Habsburg cousin, the childless Archduke Sigismund, was negotiating to sell Tyrol to their Wittelsbach rivals rather than let Emperor Frederick inherit it. Maximilian&#x27;s mediation led to a reconciliation and a reunited dynastic rule in the 1490. Because Tyrol had no law code at this time, the nobility freely expropriated money from the populace, which caused the court in Innsbruck to fester with corruption. After taking control, Maximilian instituted immediate financial reform. Gaining control of Tyrol for the Habsburgs was of strategic importance because it linked the Swiss Confederacy to the Habsburg-controlled Austrian lands, which facilitated some imperial geographic continuity.

From 1497 to 1498, Maximilian negotiated an inheritance contract with the last Meinhardin prince, Count Leonhard of Gorizia, which was intended to bring the County of Gorizia to the Habsburgs. However, it was only after a dispute with the Republic of Venice that the Gorizia stadtholder, Virgil von Graben, finally succeeded in realizing this contract.

===Expedition in Hungary===
Beatrice of Naples, Matthias Corvinus&#x27;s widow, initially supported Maximilian out of hope that he would marry her, but Maximilian did not want this. The Hungarian magnates found Maximilian impressive, but they wanted a king they could dominate. The crown of Hungary thus fell to King Vladislaus II, who was deemed weaker in personality and also agreed to marry Beatrice. Tamás Bakócz, the Hungarian chancellor, allied himself with Maximilian and helped him to circumvent the 1505 Diet which declared that no foreigner could be elected as King of Hungary.

With money from Innsbruck and southern German towns, he raised enough cavalry and Landsknechte to campaign into Hungary. Despite Hungary&#x27;s gentry&#x27;s hostility to the Habsburg, he managed to gain many supporters from higher aristocracy, including several of Corvinus&#x27;s supporters. One of them, Jakob Székely, handed over Styrian castles to him. He claimed his status as King of Hungary. In the meantime, Vladislas was proclaimed King of Hungary on July 15, 1490, and was crowned at Székesfehérvár in September. Maximilian responded with great force, using a massive grant of funds from the Tyrolean Estates to invade Hungary with an army of around 17,000 men. Crossing the Raab River in late October, Maximilian encountered little resistance in Hungary, as the unprepared Vladislas was not inclined towards action. Maximilian was joined by numerous Hungarian nobles and even magnates. Despite stiff resistance, the city was bombarded, and eventually captured. This resulted in looting and slaughter that Maximilian and his officers were unable to prevent. The next day became a turning point in the campaign, as his mercenaries mutinied due to the prohibition of looting. 

Faced with a severe winter, his troops refused to continue fighting, requesting Maximilian to double their pay, which he could not afford. The revolt turned the situation in favour of the Jagiellonian forces and Maximilian was forced to return. He depended on his father and the territorial estates for financial support. Soon he reconquered Lower and Inner Austria for his father, who returned and settled at Linz. Worrying about his son&#x27;s adventurous tendencies, Frederick decided to starve him financially.

In 1491, they signed the Peace of Pressburg, which provided that Maximilian recognized Vladislaus as King of Hungary, but the Habsburgs would inherit the throne on the extinction of Vladislaus&#x27;s male line and the Austrians also received 100,000 golden florins as war reparations. It was Maximilian that the Croatians began to harbour a connection with. However, the Croatian nobility wanted him as King. Worrying that a multi-fronted war would leave him overextended , Maximilian evacuated from Croatia and accepted the treaty with the Jagiellons.

===Italian and Swiss wars===


As the Treaty of Senlis had resolved French differences with the Holy Roman Empire, King Louis XII of France had secured borders in the north and turned his attention to Italy, where he made claims to the Duchy of Milan. In 1499 and 1500 he conquered it and drove Lodovico il Moro into exile. This brought him into a potential conflict with Maximilian, who on 16 March 1494 had married Bianca Maria Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, duke of Milan. However, Maximilian was unable to prevent Louis from capturing Milan. The Italian Wars resulted in Maximilian joining the Holy League to counter the French. His campaigns in Italy generally went poorly, and his progress was quickly stopped. Maximilian&#x27;s campaigns tend to be criticized for being wasteful and gaining him little. Despite his work in enhancing his army, due to financial difficulties, the forces he could muster were too small to make a difference. In Italy, he gained the nickname of &quot;Massimiliano di pochi denari&quot; (Maximilian the Moneyless). One particularly humiliating campaign occurred in 1508, with a force mustered from hereditary lands and with limited resources, he decided to attack Venice. The force under Sixt Trautson were routed by Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, while Maximilian&#x27;s advance was blocked by the Venetian force under Niccolò di Pitigliano and a French army under Alessandro Trivulzio. Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano then pushed into the Imperial territory, seizing Gorizia and Trieste, and forcing Maximilian to sign a very unfavourable truce. 

Afterwards, he formed the League of Cambrai with Spain, France and Pope Julius II and won back territories he had conceded and some Venetian land. Most of the Slovenian areas were transferred to the Habsburgs. But atrocities and expenses for war devastated Austria and Carniola. Lack of financial means meant that he depended on allies&#x27; resources. When Schiner suggested they should let war feed war, he did not agree and was not brutal enough to do that. He acknowledged French control of Milan in 1515.

The situation in Italy wasn&#x27;t the only problem Maximilian had then. The Swiss won a decisive victory against the Empire at Dornach on 22 July 1499. Maximilian had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on 22 September 1499 in Basel that granted the Swiss Confederacy independence.

===Jewish and Romani policies===

Jewish policy under Maximilian fluctuated greatly, usually influenced by financial considerations and the emperor&#x27;s vacillating attitude when facing opposing views. In 1496, Maximilian issued a decree which expelled all Jews from Styria and Wiener Neustadt. Between 1494 and 1510, he authorized thirteen expulsions of Jews in return for fiscal compensations from local government. 

After 1510, this happened only once, and he showed resistance in a campaign to expel Jews from Regensburg. David Price comments that during the first seventeen years of his reign, he was a great threat to the Jews, but after 1510, even if his attitude was still exploitative, his policy gradually changed. A factor that probably played a role in the change was Maximilian&#x27;s success in expanding imperial taxing over German Jewry, at this point, he likely considered the possibility of generating taxes from stable Jewish communities, instead of temporary compensations from local jurisdictions. Noflatscher and Péterfi note that Maximilian had a deep dislike for Jews since childhood, the reason of which is unknown, since both of his parents greatly favoured the Jews.

In 1509, relying on the influence of Kunigunde, Maximilian&#x27;s pious sister and the Cologne Dominicans, the anti-Jewish agitator Johannes Pfefferkorn was authorized by Maximilian to confiscate all offending Jewish books, except the Bible. The confiscations happened in Frankfurt, Bingen, Mainz and other German cities. Responding to the order, the archbishop of Mainz, the city council of Frankfurt and various German princes tried to intervene in defense of the Jews. Maximilian consequently ordered the confiscated books to be returned. On 23 May 1510 though, influenced by a supposed &quot;host desecration&quot; and blood libel in Brandenburg, as well as pressure from Kunigunde, he ordered the creation of an investigating commission and asked for expert opinions from German universities and scholars. The prominent humanist Johann Reuchlin argued strongly in defense of the Jewish books, especially the Talmud. Reuchlin&#x27;s arguments seemed to leave an impression on the emperor, who gradually developed an intellectual interest in the Talmud and other Jewish books. Maximilian later urged the Hebraist Petrus Galatinus to defend Reuchlin&#x27;s position. Galatinus dedicated his work &quot;De Arcanis Catholicae Veritatis&quot;, which provided &#x27;a literary &quot;threshold&quot; where Jews and gentiles might meet&#x27;, to the emperor. 

It was Maximilian&#x27;s support that enabled Reuchlin to fully devote himself to Jewish literature. Like his father Frederick III and his grandson Ferdinand I, he held Jewish physicians and teachers in high esteem. In 1514, he appointed Paulus Ricius, a Jew who converted to Christianity, as his personal physician. He was more interested in Ricius&#x27;s Hebrew skills than in his medical abilities though. In 1515, he reminded his treasurer Jakob Villinger that Ricius was admitted for the purpose of translating the Talmud into Latin, and urged Villinger to keep an eye on him. Perhaps overwhelmed by the emperor&#x27;s request, Ricius only managed to translate two out of sixty-three Mishna tractates before the emperor&#x27;s death. Ricius managed to publish a translation of Joseph Gikatilla&#x27;s Kabbalistic work &quot;The Gates of Light&quot;, which was dedicated to Maximilian, though. It was under Frederick and Maximilian that the foundation of Modern Judaism arose, steeped in Humanism.

It was under Maximilian that policies concerning the Romani became harsher. In 1500, a notice was given to the Romani that they had to leave Germany by the next Easter, or become outlaws (the Romani had to evade the law by following a constant circuit from an area to another, and at times, obtain patronage from aristocrats). The Reformation beginning in 1517 did not consider them foreigners anymore, but as local beggars, they also faced discrimination. The change in policy was seemingly linked to the fear of the Turks (the Romani were accused of being spies for the Turks). Kenrich and Puxon explains that connect the situation with the consolidation of European nation-states, that also stimulated similar policies elsewhere.

===Reforms===

Within the Holy Roman Empire, there was consensus that reforms were needed to preserve the unity of the Empire. For most of his reign, Frederick III had considered reform as a threat to his imperial prerogatives and wanted to avoid confrontations on the matter. However, in his last years, mainly to secure election for Maximilian, he presided over the initial phase of reform. Maximilian was more open to reform. From 1488 through his reign as sole ruler, he practiced a policy of brokerage, acting as the impartial judge between options suggested by the princes. Many measures were launched in the 1495 Reichstag at Worms. A new court was introduced, the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, that was largely independent from the Emperor. A new tax was launched to finance the Empire&#x27;s affairs, the &quot;Gemeine Pfennig&quot;. It was levied for the first time between 1495 and 1499, raising 136,000 florins, and another five times during the 1512–1551 period, before being supplanted by the matricular system which allowed common burdens to be assessed at imperial as well as Kreis level. 

To create a rival for the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, Maximilian established the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot;, which had its seat in Vienna. Unlike the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot; looked into criminal matters and even allowed the emperors the means to depose rulers who did not live up to expectations. Pavlac and Lott note that, during Maximilian&#x27;s reign, this council was not popular though. According to Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger though, throughout the early modern period, the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot; remained the faster and more efficient among the two Courts. The &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; on the other hand was often torn by matters related to confessional alliance. Around 1497–1498, as part of his administrative reforms, he restructured his Privy Council (&quot;Geheimer Rat&quot;), a decision which today induces much scholarly discussion. Apart from balancing the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; with the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot;, this act of restructuring seemed to suggest that, as Westphal quoting Ortlieb, the &quot;imperial ruler—independent of the existence of a supreme court—remained the contact person for hard pressed subjects in legal disputes as well, so that a special agency to deal with these matters could appear sensible&quot;.

In 1500, as Maximilian urgently needed assistance for his military plans, he agreed to establish an organ called the &quot;Reichsregiment&quot; (central imperial government, consisting of twenty members including the Electors, with the Emperor or his representative as its chairman), first organized in 1501 in Nuremberg and consisted of the deputies of the Emperor, local rulers, commoners, and the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian resented the new organization as it weakened his powers, and the Estates failed to support it. The new organ proved politically weak, and its power returned to Maximilian in 1502.

According to Thomas Brady Jr. and Jan-Dirk Müller, the most important governmental changes targeted the chancery. Early in Maximilian&#x27;s reign, the Court Chancery at Innsbruck competed with the Imperial Chancery. By referring the political matters in Tyrol as well as Imperial problems to the Court Chancery, Maximilian gradually centralized its authority. The two chanceries became combined in 1502. Jan-Dirk Müller opines that this chancery became the decisive government institution since 1502. In 1496, the emperor created a general treasury (&quot;Hofkammer&quot;) in Innsbruck, which became responsible for all the hereditary lands. The chamber of accounts (&quot;Raitkammer&quot;) at Vienna was made subordinate to this body. Under Paul von Liechtenstein, the &quot;Hofkammer&quot; was entrusted with not only hereditary lands&#x27; affairs, but Maximilian&#x27;s affairs as the German king too.

Historian Joachim Whaley points out that there are usually two opposite views on Maximilian&#x27;s rulership: one side is represented by the works of nineteenth century historians like Heinrich Ullmann or Leopold von Ranke, which criticize him for selfishly exploiting the German nation and putting the interest of his dynasty over his Germanic nation, thus impeding the unification process; the more recent side is represented by Hermann Wiesflecker&#x27;s biography of 1971–86, which praises him for being &quot;a talented and successful ruler, notable not only for his Realpolitik but also for his cultural activities generally and for his literary and artistic patronage in particular&quot;.
According to Brady Jr., Ranke is right regarding the fact Berthold von Henneberg and other princes did play the leading role in presenting the proposals for creating institutions (that would also place the power in the hands of the princes) in 1495. However, what Maximilian opposed was not reform per se. He generally shared their sentiments regarding ending feuds, sounder administrative procedures, better record-keeping, qualifications for offices etc. Responding to the proposal that an Imperial Council (the later &quot;Reichsregiment&quot;) should be created, he agreed and welcomed the participation of the Estates, but he alone should be the one who appointed members and the council should function only during his campaigns. He supported modernizing reforms (which he himself pioneered in his Austrian lands), but also wanted to tie it to his personal control, above all by permanent taxation, which the Estates consistently opposed. In 1504, when he was strong enough to propose his own ideas of such a Council, the cowered Estates tried to resist. At his strongest point though, he still failed to find a solution for the common tax matter, which led to disasters in Italy later. Stollberg-Rilinger notes that had the Common Penny been successful, modern governmental structures would likely emerge on the Empire&#x27;s level, but that was why it failed as it was not in the interest of territorial lords. Meanwhile, he explored Austria&#x27;s potential as a base for Imperial power and built his government largely with officials drawn from the lower aristocracy and burghers in Southern Germany. 

Whaley notes that the real foundation of his Imperial power lay with his networks of allies and clients, especially the less powerful Estates, who helped him to recover his strength in 1502—his first reform proposals as King of the Romans in 1486 were about the creation of a network of regional unions. According to Whaley, &quot;More systematically than any predecessor, Maximilian exploited the potential of regional leagues and unions to extend imperial influence and to create the possibility of imperial government in the Reich.&quot; To the Empire, the mechanisms involving such regional institutions bolstered the Land Piece (&quot;Ewiger Landfriede&quot;) declared in 1495 as well as the creation of the &quot;Reichskreise&quot; (&quot;Imperial Circles&quot;, which would serve the purpose of organize imperial armies, collect taxes and enforce orders of the imperial institutions: there were six at first; in 1512, the number increased to ten), between 1500 and 1512, although they were only fully functional some decades later. While Brady describes Maximilian&#x27;s thinking as &quot;dynastic and early modern&quot;, Heinz Angermeier (also focusing on his intentions at the 1495 Diet) writes that for Maximilian, &quot;the first politician on the German throne&quot;, dynastic interests and imperial politics had no contradiction. Rather, the alliance with Spain, imperial prerogatives, anti-Ottoman agenda, European leadership and inner politics were all tied together. In Austria, Maximilian defined two administrative units: Lower Austria and Upper Austria (Further Austria was included in Upper Austria).

Another development arising from the reform was that, amidst the prolonged struggles between the monarchical-centralism of the emperor and the estates-based federalism of the princes, the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) became the all-important political forum and the supreme legal and constitutional institution (without any declared legal basis or inaugural act), which would act as a guarantee for the preservation of the Empire in the long run.

Ultimately, the results of the reform movement presided over by Maximilian, as presented in the shape of newly formed structures as well as the general framework (functioning as a constitutional framework), were a compromise between emperor and estates, who more or less shared common cause but separate interests. Although the system of institutions that arose from this was not complete, a flexible, adaptive problem-solving mechanism for the Empire was formed. Stollberg also links the development of the reform to the concentration of supranational power in the Habsburgs&#x27; hand, which manifested in the successful dynastic marriages of Maximilian and his descendants (and the successful defense of those lands, notably the rich Low Countries) as well as Maximilian&#x27;s development of a revolutionary post system that helped the Habsburgs to maintain control of their territories (Additionally, the communication revolution created by the combination of the postal system with printing would boost the empire&#x27;s capability of disseminating orders and policies as well as its coherence in general, elevating cultural life, and also help reformers like Luther to broadcast their views effectively.).

Recent German research explores the importance of the Reichstags that followed the 1495 one in Worms. The 1512 Reichstag in Trier that Maximilian assembled, for example, was decisive for the development of the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, the Land Peace and the &quot;Gemeine Pfennig&quot;, although by this point it was clear that Maximilian was already past his best years (the early signs of crisis seemed to have showed already in Cologne, 1505)—which, according to Dietmar Heil, resulted in the fact that the &quot;Gemeine Pfennig&quot; was only partially approved and then partially implemented. Seyboth notes that, in his later years, he became more irritable, obstinate and closed, which led to growing alienation with the Estates. He recognized the trend of the Reichstag to become a more modern institution, the concern of the Estates with internal problems, and contributed to the solutions, but only so that his own interests will not be ignored.

According to Whaley, if Maximilian ever saw Germany as a source of income and soldiers only, he failed miserably in extracting both. His hereditary lands and other sources always contributed much more (the Estates gave him the equivalent of 50,000 gulden per year, a lower than even the taxes paid by Jews in both the Reich and hereditary lands, while Austria contributed 500,000 to 1 million gulden per year). On the other hand, the attempts he demonstrated in building the imperial system alone shows that he did consider the German lands &quot;a real sphere of government in which aspirations to royal rule were actively and purposefully pursued.&quot; Whaley notes that, despite struggles, what emerged at the end of Maximilian&#x27;s rule was a strengthened monarchy and not an oligarchy of princes. If he was usually weak when trying to act as a monarch and using imperial instituations like the Reichstag, Maximilian&#x27;s position was often strong when acting as a neutral overlord and relying on regional leagues of weaker principalities such as the Swabian league, as shown in his ability to call on money and soldiers to mediate the Bavaria dispute in 1504, after which he gained significant territories in Alsace, Swabia and Tyrol. His fiscal reform in his hereditary lands provided a model for other German princes. 

Benjamin Curtis suggests that while Maximilian was not able to fully create a common government for his lands (although the chancellery and court council were able to coordinate affairs across the realms), he strengthened key administrative functions in Austria and created central offices to deal with financial, political and judicial matters—these offices replaced the feudal system and became representative of a more modern system that was administered by professionalized officials. After two decades of reforms, the emperor retained his position as first among equals, while the empire gained common institutions through which the emperor shared power with the estates. Dietmar Heil argues that the Estates actually offered Maximilian considerable financial help, in consideration of their financial capacity. According to Heil, historians have traditionally been too receptive to the statements of the deceptive emperor (who tried to create such an impression in order to generate motivation).

In 1508, Maximilian, with the assent of Pope Julius II, took the title &quot;Erwählter Römischer Kaiser&quot; (&quot;Elected Roman Emperor&quot;), thus ending the centuries-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope.
At the 1495 Diet of Worms, the Reception of Roman Law was accelerated and formalized. The Roman Law was made binding in German courts, except in the case it was contrary to local statutes. In practice, it became the basic law throughout Germany, displacing Germanic local law to a large extent, although Germanic law was still operative at the lower courts. Other than the desire to achieve legal unity and other factors, the adoption also highlighted the continuity between the Ancient Roman empire and the Holy Roman Empire. 

To realize his resolve to reform and unify the legal system, the emperor frequently intervened personally in matters of local legal matters, overriding local charters and customs. This practice was often met with irony and scorn from local councils, who wanted to protect local codes. Maximilian had a general reputation of justice and clemency, but could occasionally act in a violent and resentful manner if personally affronted.
In 1499, as the ruler of Tyrol, he introduced the &quot;Maximilianische Halsgerichtsordnung&quot; (the Penal Code of Maximilian). This was the first codified penal law in the German speaking world. The law attempted to introduce regularity into contemporary discrete practices of the courts. This would be part of the basis for the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina established under Charles V in 1530. Regarding the use of torture, the court needed to decide whether someone should be tortured. If such a decision was made, three council members and a clerk should be present and observe whether a confession was made only because of the fear of torture or the pain of torture, or that another person would be harmed.

During the Austrian-Hungarian war (1477–1488), Maximilian&#x27;s father Frederick III issued the first modern regulations to strengthen military discipline. In 1508, using this ordinance as the basis, Maximilian devised the first military code (&quot;Articles&quot;). This code included 23 articles. The first five articles prescribed total obedience to imperial authority. Article 7 established the rules of conduct in camps. Article 13 exempted churches from billeting while Article 14 forbade violence against civilians: &quot;You shall swear that you will not harm any pregnant women, widows and orphans, priests, honest maidens and mothers, under the fear of punishment for perjury and death&quot;. These actions that indicated the early developments of a &quot;military revolution&quot; in European laws had a tradition in the Roman concept of a just war and ideas of sixteenth-century scholars, who developed this ancient doctrine with a main thesis which advocated that war was a matter between two armies and thus the civilians (especially women, children and old people) should be given immunity. The code would be the basis for further ordinances by Charles V and new &quot;Articles&quot; by Maximilian II, which became the universal military code for the whole Holy Roman Empire until 1642.

The legal reform seriously weakened the ancient Vehmic court (&quot;Vehmgericht&quot;, or Secret Tribunal of Westphalia, traditionally held to be instituted by Charlemagne but this theory is now considered unlikely), although it would not be abolished completely until 1811 (when it was abolished under the order of Jérôme Bonaparte).

In 1518, after a general diet of all Habsburg hereditary lands, the emperor issued the &quot;Innsbrucker Libell&quot; which set out the general
defence order (Verteidigungsordnung) of Austrian provinces, which &quot;gathered together all the elements that had appeared and developed over the preceding centuries.&quot;. The provincial army, based on noble cavalry, was for defence only; bonded labourers were conscripted using a proportional conscription system; upper and lower Austrian provinces agreed on a mutual defence pact in which they would form a joint command structure if either were attacked. The military system and other reforms were threatened after Maximilian&#x27;s deạth but would be restored and reorganized later under Ferdinand I.

According to Brady Jr., Maximilian was no reformer of the church though. Personally pious, he was also a practical caesaropapist who was only interested in the ecclesiastical organization as far as reforms could bring him political and fiscal advantages. He met Luther once at the Diet of Augsburg in 1518, &quot;a rehearsal for Worms in 1521&quot;. He saw the grievances and agreed with Luther on some points. However as the religious question was a matter of money and power to him, he had no interest in stopping the indulgences. At this point, he was too busy with his grandson&#x27;s election. As Luther was about to be arrested by the papal legate, he granted him a letter of safe passage. Brady notes that blindness to the need to reform from above would lead to the reform from below.

===Finance and Economy===

Maximilian was always troubled by financial shortcomings; his income never seemed to be enough to sustain his large-scale goals and policies. For this reason he was forced to take substantial credits from Upper German banker families, especially from the Gossembrot, Baumgarten, Fugger, and Welser families. Jörg Baumgarten even served as Maximilian&#x27;s financial advisor. The connection between the emperor and banking families in Augsburg was so widely known that Francis I of France derisively nicknamed him &quot;the Mayor of Augsburg&quot; (another story recounts that a French courtier called him the alderman of Augsburg, to which Louis XII replied: &quot;Yes, but every time that this alderman rings the tocsin from his belfry, he makes all France tremble.&quot;, referring to Maximilian&#x27;s military ability). Around 70 percent of his income went to wars (and by the 1510s, he was waging wars on almost all sides of his border). At the end of Maximilian&#x27;s rule, the Habsburgs&#x27; mountain of debt totalled six million gulden to six and a half million gulden, depending on the sources. By 1531, the remaining amount of debt was estimated at 400,000 gulden (about 282,669 Spanish ducats). 

In his entire reign, he had spent around 25 million gulden, much of which was contributed by his most loyal subjects—the Tyrolers. The historian Thomas Brady comments: &quot;The best that can be said of his financial practices is that he borrowed democratically from rich and poor alike and defaulted with the same even-handedness&quot;. By comparison, when he abdicated in 1556, Charles V left Philip a total debt of 36 million ducats (equal to the income from Spanish America for his entire reign), while Ferdinand I left a debt of 12.5 million gulden when he died in 1564. Economy and economic policies under the reign of Maximilian is a relatively unexplored topic, according to Benecke.
Overall, according to Whaley, &quot;The reign of Maximilian I saw recovery and growth but also growing tension. This created both winners and losers.&quot;, although Whaley opines that this is no reason to expect a revolutionary explosion (in connection to Luther and the Reformation). Whaley points out, though, that because Maximilian and Charles V tried to promoted the interests of the Netherlands, after 1500, the Hanseatic League was negatively affected and their growth relative to England and the Netherlands declined.

In the Low Countries, during his regency, to get more money to pay for his campaigns, he resorted to debase coins in the Burgundian mints, causing more conflicts with the interests of the Estates and the merchant class.

In Austria, although this was never enough for his needs, his management of mines and salt works proved efficient, with a marked increase in revenue, the fine silver production in Schwaz increased from 2,800 kg in 1470 to 14,000 kg in 1516. Benecke remarks that Maximilian was a ruthless, exploitative businessman while Hollegger sees him as a clearheaded manager with sober cost-benefit analysis. Ultimately, he had to mortgage these properties to the Fuggers to get quick cash. The financial price would ultimately fall on the Austrian population. Fichtner states that Maximilian&#x27;s pan-European vision was very expensive, and his financial practices antagonized his subjects both high and low in Burgundy, Austria and Germany (who tried to temper his ambitions, although they never came to hate the charismatic ruler personally), this was still modest in comparison with what was about to come, and the Ottoman threat gave the Austrians a reason to pay.

For both economic and military purposes, he encouraged the mining of copper, silver and calamine, coining, brass manufacturing and the arms industry. He took pains to protect the local economy, especially in Tyrol, where there was a mining boom (accompanied by a population boom), although Safley notes that he also enabled families like the Hochstetters to exploit the economy for their own ends. Agriculture also developed significantly, except in Lower Austria which suffered from the war with Matthias Corvinus.

Augsburg benefitted majorly from the establishment and expansion of the Kaiserliche Reichspost as well as Maximilian&#x27;s personal attachment to the city. The imperial city became &quot;the dominant centre of early capitalism&quot; of the 16th century, and &quot;the location of the most important post office within the Holy Roman Empire&quot;. From Maximilian&#x27;s time, as the &quot;terminuses of the first transcontinental post lines&quot; began to shift from Innsbruck to Venice and from Brussels to Antwerp, in these cities, the communication system and the news market started to converge. As the Fuggers as well as other trading companies based their most important branches in these cities, these traders gained access to these systems as well. (Despite a widely circulated theory which holds that the Fuggers themselves operated their own communication system, in reality they relied upon the imperial posts, presumably from the 1490s onwards, as official members of the court of Maximilian I).

Leipzig started its rise into one of the largest European trade fair cities after Maximilian granted them wide-ranged privileges in 1497 (and raised their three markets to the status of Imperial Fair in 1507).

==&quot;Tu felix Austria nube&quot;==
===Background===
Traditionally, German dynasties had exploited the potential of the imperial title to bring Eastern Europe into the fold, in addition to their lands north and south of the Alps. Under Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, the House of Luxembourg, predecessors of the Habsburgs as the Imperial dynasty, had managed to gain an empire almost comparable in scale to the later Habsburg empire, although at the same time they lost the Kingdom of Burgundy and control over Italian territories. Their focus on the East, especially Hungary (which was outside the Holy Roman Empire and also gained by the Luxembourgs with a marriage), allowed the new Burgundian rulers from the House of Valois to foster discontent among German princes. Thus, the Habsburgs were forced to refocus their attention on the West. Frederick III&#x27;s cousin and predecessor, Albert II (who was Sigismund&#x27;s son-in-law and heir through his marriage with Elizabeth of Luxembourg) had managed to combine the crowns of Germany, Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia under his rule, but he died young. During his rule, Maximilian had a double focus on both the East and the West. The successful expansion (with the notable role of marriage policy) under Maximilian bolstered his position in the Empire, and also created more pressure for an imperial reform, so that they could get more resources and coordinated help from the German territories to defend their realms and counter hostile powers such as France.

===Marriage and foreign policy under Maximilian===
As part of the Treaty of Arras, Maximilian betrothed his three-year-old daughter Margaret to the Dauphin of France (later Charles VIII), son of his adversary Louis XI. The betrothal was the result of clandestine negotiations between Louis XI and Ghent—as Maximilian&#x27;s position was temporarily weakened by his wife&#x27;s death, he had no say in the matter.

Dying shortly after signing the Treaty of Le Verger, Francis II, Duke of Brittany, left his realm to his daughter Anne. In search of alliances to protect her domain from neighboring interests, she betrothed herself to Maximilian I in 1490. About a year later, they married by proxy.

However, Charles VIII and his sister Anne wanted her inheritance for France. So, when the former came of age in 1491, and taking advantage of Maximilian and his father&#x27;s interest in the succession of their adversary Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary, Charles repudiated his betrothal to Margaret, invaded Brittany, forced Anne of Brittany to repudiate her unconsummated marriage to Maximilian, and married her himself.

Margaret then remained in France as a hostage of sorts until 1493, when she was finally returned to her father with the signing of the Treaty of Senlis.

In the same year, as the hostilities of the lengthy Italian Wars with France were in preparation, Maximilian contracted another marriage for himself, this time to Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, with the intercession of his brother, Ludovico Sforza, then regent of the duchy after the former&#x27;s death.

In the East, Maximilian faced the need to reduce the growing pressures on the Empire brought about by treaties between the rulers of France, Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, and Russia, as well as to bolster his dynasty&#x27;s position—temporarily threatened by the union between Anne of Foix-Candale and Vladislaus II of Hungary, in addition to resistance of the Hungarian magnates—in Bohemia and Hungary (that the Habsburgs claimed through inheritance and overlordship). Maximilian met with the Jagiellonian kings Ladislaus II of Hungary and Bohemia and Sigismund I of Poland at the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. There they arranged for Maximilian&#x27;s granddaughter Mary to marry Louis, the son of Ladislaus, and for Anne (the sister of Louis) to marry Maximilian&#x27;s grandson Ferdinand (both grandchildren being the children of Philip the Handsome, Maximilian&#x27;s son, and Joanna of Castile). The marriages arranged there brought Habsburg kingship over Hungary and Bohemia in 1526. In 1515, Louis was adopted by Maximilian. Maximilian had to serve as the proxy groom to Anna in the betrothal ceremony, because only in 1516 did Ferdinand agree to enter into the marriage, which would happen in 1521.

These political marriages were summed up in the following Latin elegiac couplet, reportedly spoken by Matthias Corvinus: &quot;Bella gerant aliī, tū fēlix Austria nūbe/ Nam quae Mars aliīs, dat tibi regna Venus&quot;, &quot;Let others wage war, but thou, O happy Austria, marry; for those kingdoms which Mars gives to others, Venus gives to thee.&quot;

Contrary to the implication of this motto though, Maximilian waged war aplenty (In four decades of ruling, he waged 27 wars in total). Late in his life though, only the military situation in the East worked well—the Magyars was said to fear him more than the Turks or the Devil. In the West, he could do no more than blocking French expansion and only with Spanish aid. His general strategy was to combine his intricate systems of alliance, military threats and offers of marriage to realize his expansionist ambitions. Using overtures to Russia, Maximilian succeeded in coercing Bohemia, Hungary and Poland into acquiesce in the Habsburgs&#x27; expansionist plans. Combining this tactic with military threats, he was able to gain the favourable marriage arrangements In Hungary and Bohemia (which were under the same dynasty). According to Bence Péterfi, many Hungarian nobles maintained dual loyalty to both the Habsburgs and the Jagiellons. After the Peace of Pressburg (1491) legalized this phenomenon, there was a change in dynamic: &quot;While at the time of the conflicts between Frederick III and Matthias Corvinus it was primarily those who took the side of the Hungarian king who were able to pursue successful careers, after 1491, the situation reversed, and those who were
on the side of the Habsburgs seemed to have more opportunities.&quot;

At the same time, his sprawling panoply of territories as well as potential claims constituted a threat to France, thus forcing Maximilian to continuously launch wars in defense of his possessions in Burgundy, the Low Countries and Italy against four generations of French kings (Louis XI, Charles VIII, Louis XII, Francis I). Coalitions he assembled for this purpose sometimes consisted of non-imperial actors like England. Edward J. Watts comments that the nature of these wars was dynastic, rather than imperial.

Fortune was also a factor that helped to bring about the results of his marriage plans. The double marriage could have given the Jagiellon a claim in Austria, while a potential male child of Margaret and John, a prince of Spain, would have had a claim to a portion of the maternal grandfather&#x27;s possessions as well. But as it turned out, Vladislaus&#x27;s male line became extinct, while the frail John died without offspring, so Maximilian&#x27;s male line was able to claim the thrones.

==Death and succession==

During his last years, Maximilian began to focus on the question of his succession. His goal was to secure the throne for Charles. According to the traditional view, a credit of one million gulden was provided (to Charles, after Maximilian&#x27;s death, according to Wiesflecker and Koenigsberger) by the Fuggers (the Cortes had voted over 600,000 crowns for Charles&#x27;s election campaign, but money from Spain could not arrive quick enough), which was used for advertising and to bribe the prince-electors, and that this was the decisive factor in Charles&#x27;s successful election. Others point out that while the electors were paid, this was not the reason for the outcome, or at most played only a small part. The important factor that swayed the final decision was that Frederick refused the offer, and made a speech in support of Charles on the ground that they needed a strong leader against the Ottomans, Charles had the resources and was a prince of German extraction. The death of Maximilian in 1519 seemed to put the succession at risk, but in a few months the election of Charles V was secured.

In 1501, Maximilian fell from his horse and badly injured his leg, causing him pain for the rest of his life. Some historians have suggested that Maximilian was &quot;morbidly&quot; depressed: from 1514, he travelled everywhere with his coffin. In 1518, feeling his death near after seeing an eclipse, he returned to his beloved Innsbruck, but the city&#x27;s innskeepers and purveyors did not grant the emperor&#x27;s entourage further credit. The resulting fit led to a stroke that left him bedridden on 15 December 1518. However, he continued to read documents and received foreign envoys right until the end. Maximilian died in Wels, Upper Austria, at three o&#x27;clock in the morning on 12 January 1519. Different historians have listed different diseases as the main cause of death, including cancer (likely stomach cancer or intestinal cancer), pneumonia, syphilis, gall stones, stroke (he did have a combination of dangerous medical problems) etc.

Maximilian was succeeded as Emperor by his grandson Charles V, his son Philip the Handsome having died in 1506. For penitential reasons, Maximilian gave very specific instructions for the treatment of his body after death. He wanted his hair to be cut off and his teeth knocked out, and the body was to be whipped and covered with lime and ash, wrapped in linen, and &quot;publicly displayed to show the perishableness of all earthly glory&quot;. Gregor Reisch, the emperor&#x27;s friend and confessor who closed his eyes, did not obey the instruction though. He placed a rosary in Maximilian&#x27;s hand and other sacred objects near the corpse. He was buried in the Castle Chapel at Wiener Neustadt on borrowed money. The casket was opened during renovation under Maria Theresa. After that, the body was reinterred in a Baroque sarcophagus, that later was found unscathed amidst the wreckage of the chapel (due to the Second World War) on 6 August 1946. The emperor was ceremoniously buried again in 1950.

==Official style==

&quot;We, Maximilian, by the Grace of God, elected Roman Emperor, always Augmenter of the Empire, King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, etc. Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brittany, Lorrain, Brabant, Stiria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limbourg, Luxembourg, and Guelders; Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Pfiert, Kybourg, Artois, and Burgundy; Count Palatine of Haynault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, and Zutphen; Marquess of the Roman Empire and of Burgau, Landgrave of Alsatia, Lord of Frisia, the Wendish Mark, Portenau, Salins, and Malines, etc. etc.&quot;

===Chivalric orders===
On 30 April 1478, Maximilian was knighted by Adolph of Cleves, a senior member of the Order of the Golden Fleece and on the same day he became the sovereign of this exalted order. As its head, he did everything in his power to restore its glory as well as associate the order with the Habsburg lineage. He expelled the members who had defected to France and rewarded those loyal to him, and also invited foreign rulers to join its ranks.

Maximilian I was a member of the Order of the Garter, nominated by King Henry VII of England in 1489. His Garter stall plate survives in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

Maximilian was patron of the Order of Saint George founded by his father, and also the founder of its secular confraternity.

==Appearance and personality==
Maximilian was strongly built, had an upright posture, was over six feet tall, had blue eyes, neck length blond or reddish hair, a large hooked nose and a jutting jaw (like his father, he always shaved his beard. Although not conventionally handsome, he was well-proportioned and considered physically attractive, with abiding youthfulness and an affable, pleasing manner. A womanizer since his teenager days, he increasingly sought distraction from the tragedy of the first marriage and the frustration of the second marriage in the company of &quot;sleeping women&quot; in all corners of his empire. Sigrid-Maria Grössing describes him as a charming heartbreaker for all his life. He could manoeuvre with one hand a seven-meter lance comfortably.

Maximilian was a late developer. According to his teacher Johannes Cuspinian, he did not speak until he was nine-years-old, and after that only developed slowly. Frederick III recalled that when his son was twelve, he still thought that the boy was either mute or stupid. In his adulthood, he spoke six languages (he learned French from his wife Mary) and was a genuinely talented author. Other than languages, mathematics and religion, he painted and played various instruments and was also trained in farming, carpentry and blacksmithing, although the focus of his education was naturally kingship. According to Fichtner, he did not learn much from formal training though, because even as a boy, he never sat still and tutors could not do much about that. Gerhard Benecke opines that by nature he was the man of action, a &quot;vigorously charming extrovert&quot; who had a &quot;conventionally superficial interest in knowledge, science and art combined with excellent health in his youth&quot; (he remained virile into his late thirties and although later his health was damaged due to a leg accident and other ailments, the emperor displayed remarkable self-discipline and hardly ever recognized a weakness; at the 1510 Reichstag in Augsburg, Maximilian, 51, fought against Frederick of Saxony, 47, in front of a large audience.). He was brave to the point of recklessness, and this did not only show in battles. He once entered a lion&#x27;s enclosure in Munich alone to tease the lion, and at another point climbed to the top of the Cathedral of Ulm, stood on one foot and turned himself round to gain a full view, at the trepidation of his attendants. In the nineteenth century, an Austrian officer lost his life trying to repeat the emperor&#x27;s &quot;feat&quot;, while another succeeded. While he paid magnificently for a princely style, he required little for personal needs. In his mature years, he exerted restraint on personal habits, except during his depressive phases (when he drank night and day, sometimes incapacitating the government, to the great annoyance of Chancellor Zyprian von Sernteiner) or in the companion of his artist friends. The artists got preferential treatment in criminal matters too, such as the case of Veit Stoss, whose sentence (imprisonment and having his hands chopped off for an actual crime) issued by Nuremberg got cancelled on the sole basis of genius. The emperor&#x27;s reasoning was that, what came as a gift from God should not be treated according to usual norms or human proportions. To the astonishment of contemporaries, he laughed at the satire directed against his person and organized celebrations after defeats.

Historian Ernst Bock, with whom Benecke shares the same sentiment, writes the following about him:
His rosy optimism and utilitarianism, his totally naive amorality in matters political, both unscrupulous and machiavellian; his sensuous and earthy naturalness, his exceptional receptiveness towards anything beautiful especially in the visual arts, but also towards the various fashions of his time whether the nationalism in politics, the humanism in literature and philosophy or in matters of economics and capitalism; further his surprising yearning for personal fame combined with a striving for popularity, above all the clear consciousness of a developed individuality: these properties Maximilian displayed again and again.
Historian Paula Fichtner describes Maximilian as a leader who was ambitious and imaginative to a fault, with self-publicizing tendencies as well as territorial and administrative ambitions that betrayed a nature both &quot;soaring and recognizably modern&quot;, while dismissing Benecke&#x27;s presentation of Maximilian as &quot;an insensitive agent of exploitation&quot; as influenced by the author&#x27;s personal political leaning.

Berenger and Simpson consider Maximilian a greedy Renaissance prince, and also, &quot;a prodigious man of action whose chief fault was to have &#x27;too many irons in the fire&#x27;&quot;. On the other hand, Steven Beller criticizes him for being too much of a medieval knight who had a hectic schedule of warring, always crisscrossing the whole continent to do battles (for example, in August 1513, he commanded Henry VIII&#x27;s English army in the second Guinegate, and a few weeks later joined the Spanish forces in defeating the Venetians) with little resources to support his ambitions. According to Beller, Maximilian should have spent more time at home persuading the estates to adopt a more efficient governmental and fiscal system.

Thomas A. Brady Jr. praises the emperor&#x27;s sense of honour, but criticizes his financial immorality—according to Geoffrey Parker, both points, together with Maximilian&#x27;s martial qualities and hard-working nature, would be inherited from the grandfather by Charles V:
[...]though punctilious to a fault about his honor, he lacked all morals about money. Every florin was spent, mortgaged, and promised ten times over before it ever came in; he set his courtiers a model for their infamous venality; he sometimes had to leave his queen behind as pledge for his debts; and he borrowed continuously from his servitors—large sums from top officials, tiny ones from servants—and never repaid them. Those who liked him tried to make excuses.

Certain English sources describe him as a ruler who habitually failed to keep his words. According to Wiesflecker, people could often depend on his promises more than those of most princes of his days, although he was no stranger to the &quot;clausola francese&quot; and also tended to use a wide variety of statements to cover his true intentions, which unjustly earned him the reputation of being fickle. Hollegger concurs that Maximilian&#x27;s court officials, except Eitelfriedrich von Zollern and Wolfgang von Fürstenberg, did expect gifts and money for tips and help, and the emperor usually defended his counselors and servants even if he acted against the more blatant displays of material greed. Maximilian though was not a man who could be controlled or influenced easily by his officials. Hollegger also opines that while many of his political and artistic schemes leaned towards megalomania, there was a sober realist who believed in progression and relied on modern modes of management underneath. Personally, &quot;frequently described as humane, gentle, and friendly, he reacted with anger, violence, and vengefulness when he felt his rights had been injured or his honor threatened, both of which he valued greatly.&quot; The price for his warlike ruling style and his ambition for a globalized monarchy (that ultimately achieved considerable successes) was a continuous succession of war, that earned him the sobriquet &quot;Heart of steel&quot; (Coeur d&#x27;acier).

==Marriages and offspring==

Maximilian was married three times, but only the first marriage produced offspring:
* Maximilian&#x27;s first wife was Mary of Burgundy. They were married in Ghent on 19 August 1477, but she died in a riding accident in 1482. Mary was the love of his life. Even in old age, the mere mention of her name moved him to tears (although his sexual life, contrary to his chivalric ideals, was unchaste). The grand literary projects commissioned and composed in large part by Maximilian many years after her death were in part tributes to their love, especially &quot;Theuerdank&quot;, in which the hero saved the damsel in distress as he had saved her inheritance in real life. His heart is buried inside her sarcophagus in Bruges according to his wish. Beyond her beauty, the inheritance and the glory she brought, Mary corresponded to Maximilian&#x27;s ideal of a woman: the spirited grand &quot;Dame&quot; who could stand next to him as sovereign. To their daughter Margaret, he described Mary: from her eyes shone the power (&quot;Kraft&quot;) that surpassed any other woman.
The marriage produced three children, of whom only two survived:
# Philip I of Castile (1478–1506) who inherited his mother&#x27;s domains following her death, but predeceased his father. He married Joanna of Castile, becoming king-consort of Castile upon her accession in 1504, and was the father of the Holy Roman Emperors Charles V and Ferdinand I.
# Margaret of Austria (1480–1530), who was first engaged at the age of two to the French dauphin (who became Charles VIII of France a year later) to confirm peace between France and Burgundy. She was sent back to her father in 1492 after Charles repudiated their betrothal to marry Anne of Brittany. She was then married to John, Prince of Asturias, crown prince of Castile and Aragon, and after his death to Philibert II of Savoy. She undertook the guardianship of her deceased brother Philip&#x27;s children, and governed Burgundy for the heir, Charles.
# Francis of Austria, who died shortly after his birth in 1481.
* Maximilian was also married to Anne of Brittany (1477–1514). They were married by proxy in Rennes on 18 December 1490. The contract was dissolved by Pope Innocent VIII in early 1492, after Charles VIII had repudiated his betrothal to Margaret and forced Anne to marry him instead.

The drive behind this marriage, to the great annoyance of Frederick III (who characterized it as &quot;disgraceful&quot;), was the desire of personal revenge against the French (Maximilian blamed France for the great tragedies of his life: Mary of Burgundy&#x27;s death, political upheavals that followed, his troubled relationship with his son, and later, Philip&#x27;s death). The young King of the Romans had in mind a pincer grip against France, while Frederick wanted him to focus on expansion towards the east and maintenance of stability in newly reacquired Austria. But Brittany was so weak that by itself it could not resist French attack even briefly as the Burgundian State had done, while Maximilian could not even personally come to Brittany to consummate the marriage.
* Maximilian&#x27;s third wife was Bianca Maria Sforza (1472–1510). They were married in 1493, the marriage bringing Maximilian a rich dowry and allowing him to assert his rights as imperial overlord of Milan. The marriage was unhappy, and they had no children. In Maximilian&#x27;s view, while Bianca might surpass his first wife Mary in physical beauty, she was just a &quot;child&quot; with &quot;a mediocre mind&quot;, who could neither make decisions nor be presented as a respectable lady to society. Benecke opines that this seems unfair, as while Bianca was always concerned with trivial, private matters (Recent research though indicates that Bianca was an educated woman who was politically active), she was never given the chance to develop politically, unlike the other women in Maximilian&#x27;s family, such as Margaret of Austria or Catherine of Saxony. Despite her unsuitability as an empress, Maximilian has often been criticized for treating her with coldness and neglect, which after 1500 only became worse. Bianca, on the other hand, loved the emperor deeply and always tried to win his heart with heartfelt letters, expensive jewels and allusions to sickness, but did not even get back a letter, developed eating disorders and mental illness, and died a childless woman. Court historian and physician Joseph Grünpeck, criticized the emperor, who in his opinion was responsible for Bianca&#x27;s death through neglect.

In addition, he had several illegitimate children, but the number and identities of those are a matter of great debate. Johann Jakob Fugger writes in &quot;Ehrenspiegel&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Honour&quot;) that the emperor began fathering illegitimate children after becoming a widower, and that there were eight children in total, four boys and four girls.

These were:
* By a widow in Den Bosch, whom Maximilian met in a campaign:
# Barbara Disquis (1482–1568): Her birth and Mary of Burgundy&#x27;s death seemed to connect to Maximilian&#x27;s near fatal illness in 1482 and later pilgrimage to Amsterdam in 1484. In her teenage years, she rebelled against her father and entered St Gertrude&#x27;s convent. Philip the Fair was introduced to her in 1504 when he and Maximilian went to Den Bosch to prepare for the war against Guelders. On their father&#x27;s behalf, Philip urged her to leave the convent and get married, but she refused. The place she was buried is now a square named after her. In 2021, a recently built city walk close to Maximilian&#x27;s statue was named &quot;Mijn lieven dochter&quot; (&quot;My dear daughter&quot;).
* By an unknown mistress:
# Margarethe von Helfenstein or Martha, Margaretha, Mathilde, Margareta, née von Edelsheim (?–1537), wife of Johann von Hille (died 1515), remarried Count Ludwig Helferich von Helfenstein (1493–1525, married in 1517 or 1520); Ludwig was killed by peasants on 16 April 1525 in the Massacre of Weinsberg during the German Peasants&#x27; War. They had a surviving son named Maximilian (1523–1555) Some sources reported that she was born in 1480 or her mother was Margareta von Edelsheim, née Rappach.
* By Margareta von Edelsheim, née Rappach (?–1522) Dingel reports that she was born around 1470 while others report that in 1494 she was still a minor when she married von Rottal:
# Barbara von Rottal (1500–1550), wife of Siegmund von Dietrichstein, member of the House of Dietrichstein. Some report that she was the daughter of Margareta von Edelsheim, née Rappach, while Benecke lists the mother as unidentified.
# George of Austria (1505–1557), Prince-Bishop of Liège.
* By Anna von Helfenstein:
# Cornelius (1507–).
# Maximilian Friedrich von Amberg (1511–1553), Lord of Feldkirch.
# Anna Maria (1512–1562) wife of Bartold Dienger 
# Leopold (), bishop of Córdoba, Spain (1541–1557), with illegitimate succession.
# Dorothea (1516–1572), heiress of Falkenburg, Durbuy and Halem, lady in waiting to Queen Maria of Hungary; wife of Johan I of East Frisia.
# Anna Margareta (1517–1545), lady in waiting to Queen Maria of Hungary; wife of François de Melun (?–1547), 2nd count of Epinoy. 
# Anne (1519–?). She married Louis d&#x27;Hirlemont.
# Elisabeth (d. 1581–1584), wife of Ludwig III von der Marck, Count of Rochefort.
# Barbara, wife of Wolfgang Plaiss.
# Christoph Ferdinand ( ).
* By unknown mistress (parentage uncertain):
# Guielma, wife of Rudiger (Rieger) von Westernach.

<text>Samuel de Champlain (; 13 August 1574 – 25 December 1635) was a French explorer, navigator, cartographer, draftsman, soldier, geographer, ethnologist, diplomat, and chronicler. He made between 21 and 29 trips across the Atlantic Ocean, and founded Quebec City, and New France, on 3 July 1608. An important figure in Canadian history, Champlain created the first accurate coastal map during his explorations and founded various colonial settlements.

Born into a family of sailors, Champlain began exploring North America in 1603, under the guidance of his uncle, François Gravé Du Pont. After 1603, Champlain&#x27;s life and career consolidated into the path he would follow for the rest of his life. From 1604 to 1607, he participated in the exploration and creation of the first permanent European settlement north of Florida, Port Royal, Acadia (1605). In 1608, he established the French settlement that is now Quebec City. Champlain was the first European to describe the Great Lakes, and published maps of his journeys and accounts of what he learned from the natives and the French living among the Natives. He formed long time relationships with local Montagnais and Innu, and, later, with others farther west—tribes of the Ottawa River, Lake Nipissing, and Georgian Bay, and with Algonquin and Wendat. He agreed to provide assistance in the Beaver Wars against the Iroquois. He learned and mastered their languages.

Late in the year of 1615, Champlain returned to the Wendat and stayed with them over the winter, which permitted him to make the first ethnographic observations of this important nation, the events of which form the bulk of his book &quot;Voyages et Découvertes faites en la Nouvelle France, depuis l&#x27;année 1615&quot; published in 1619. In 1620, Louis XIII of France ordered Champlain to cease exploration, return to Quebec, and devote himself to the administration of the country.

In every way but formal title, Samuel de Champlain served as Governor of New France, a title that may have been formally unavailable to him owing to his non-noble status. Champlain established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the St. Lawrence River valley until his death in 1635. Many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America today bear his name, most notably Lake Champlain.

== Early life ==
Champlain was born to Antoine Champlain (also written &quot;Anthoine Chappelain&quot; in some records) and Marguerite Le Roy, in either Hiers-Brouage, or the port city of La Rochelle, in the French province of Aunis.

He was born on or before 13 August 1574, according to a recent baptism record found by Jean-Marie Germe, French genealogist.

Although in 1870, the Canadian Catholic priest Laverdière, in the first chapter of his &quot;Œuvres de Champlain&quot;, accepted Pierre-Damien Rainguet&#x27;s estimate of Champlain&#x27;s birth year as 1567 and tried to justify it, his calculations were based on assumptions now believed, or proven, to be incorrect.

Although Léopold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of &quot;l&#x27;Académie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle&quot;) wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet&#x27;s estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdière have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous monuments dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate.

In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain&#x27;s birth year and concluded, &quot;Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France.&quot;

Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdière, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).
Champlain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be &quot;Saintongeois&quot; in the title of his second book (1613).

He belonged to a Roman Catholic family in Brouage which was most of the time a Catholic city, Brouage was a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1635, was Cardinal Richelieu. The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in Brouage.
Born into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make nautical charts, and write practical reports. His education did not include Ancient Greek or Latin, so he did not read or learn from any ancient literature.

As each French fleet had to assure its own defense at sea, Champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time: he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of King Henry IV during the later stages of France&#x27;s religious wars in Brittany from 1594 or 1595 to 1598, beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses.

During this time he claimed to go on a &quot;certain secret voyage&quot; for the king, and saw combat (including maybe the Siege of Fort Crozon, at the end of 1594). By 1597 he was a &quot;capitaine d&#x27;une compagnie&quot; serving in a garrison near Quimper.

==Early travels==
In year 3, his uncle-in-law, a navigator whose ship &quot;Saint-Julien&quot; was to transport Spanish troops to Cádiz under the Treaty of Vervins, allowed Champlain to accompany him.

After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cádiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the West Indies, again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.

This journey lasted two years and allowed Champlain to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to Mexico City. Along the way, he took detailed notes, wrote an illustrated report on what he learned on this trip, and gave this secret report to King Henry, who rewarded Champlain with an annual pension.

This report was published for the first time in 1870, by Laverdière, as &quot;Brief Discours des Choses plus remarquables que Samuel Champlain de Brouage a reconneues aux Indes Occidentalles au voiage qu&#x27;il en a faict en icettes en l&#x27;année 1599 et en l&#x27;année 1601, comme ensuite&quot; (and in English as &quot;Narrative of a Voyage to the West Indies and Mexico 1599–1602&quot;).

The authenticity of this account as a work written by Champlain has frequently been questioned, due to inaccuracies and discrepancies with other sources on some points; however, recent scholarship indicates that the work probably was authored by Champlain.

On Champlain&#x27;s return to Cádiz in August 1600, his uncle Guillermo Elena (Guillaume Allene), who had fallen ill, asked him to look after his business affairs. This Champlain did, and when his uncle died in June 1601, Champlain inherited his substantial estate. It included an estate near La Rochelle, commercial properties in Spain, and a 150-ton merchant ship.

This inheritance, combined with the king&#x27;s annual pension, gave the young explorer a great deal of independence, as he did not need to rely on the financial backing of merchants and other investors.

From 1601 to 1603 Champlain served as a geographer in the court of King Henry IV. As part of his duties, he traveled to French ports. He learned much about North America from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from Nantucket to Newfoundland to capitalize on the rich fishing grounds there.

He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of Pierre de Chauvin at Tadoussac. When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on the fur trade in North America in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to Aymar de Chaste. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king&#x27;s assent.

Champlain&#x27;s first trip to North America was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by François Gravé Du Pont. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship&#x27;s captain on Chauvin&#x27;s expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship.

He educated Champlain about navigation in North America, including the Saint Lawrence River. In dealing with the natives there (and in Acadia after). The &quot;Bonne-Renommée&quot; (the &quot;Good Fame&quot;) arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see all of the places that Jacques Cartier had seen and described sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible.

Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to France on 20 September, published an account as &quot;Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l&#x27;an 1603&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in New France in the year 1603&quot;).

Included in his account were meetings with Begourat, chief of the Montagnais at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some Algonquin friends.

Promising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as Acadia. It was led by Pierre Dugua de Mons, a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement.

After exploring possible sites in the Bay of Fundy, Champlain selected Saint Croix Island in the St. Croix River as the site of the expedition&#x27;s first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established Port Royal. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.

In 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as Cape Cod, searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident Nausets dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day Chatham, Massachusetts. He named the area Mallebar (&quot;bad bar&quot;).

==Founding of Quebec==


In the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading centre on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of Honfleur. The main ship, called &quot;Don-de-Dieu&quot; (French for &quot;Gift of God&quot;), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, &quot;Lévrier&quot; (&quot;Hunt Dog&quot;), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at Tadoussac on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the Saguenay River ending there, they left the ships and continued up the &quot;Big River&quot; in small boats bringing the men and the materials.

Upon arriving in Quebec, Champlain later wrote: &quot;I arrived there on the third of July, when I searched for a place suitable for our settlement; but I could find none more convenient or better suited than the point of Quebec, so called by the savages, which was covered with nut-trees.&quot; Champlain ordered his men to gather lumber by cutting down the nut-trees for use in building habitations.

Some days after Champlain&#x27;s arrival in Quebec, Jean du Val, a member of Champlain&#x27;s party, plotted to kill Champlain to the end of securing the settlement for the Basques or Spaniards and making a fortune for himself. Du Val&#x27;s plot was ultimately foiled when an associate of Du Val confessed his involvement in the plot to Champlain&#x27;s pilot, who informed Champlain. Champlain had a young man deliver Du Val, along with 3 co-conspirators, two bottles of wine and invite the four worthies to an event on board a boat. Soon after the four conspirators arrived on the boat, Champlain had them arrested. Du Val was strangled and hung in Quebec and his head was displayed in the &quot;most conspicuous place&quot; of Champlain&#x27;s fort. The other three were sent back to France to be tried.

==Relations and war with Native Americans==
During the summer of 1609, Champlain attempted to form better relations with the local First Nations tribes. He made alliances with the Wendat (called &quot;Huron&quot; by the French) and with the Algonquin, the Montagnais and the Etchemin, who lived in the area of the St. Lawrence River. These tribes sought Champlain&#x27;s help in their war against the Iroquois, who lived farther south. Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the &quot;Rivière des Iroquois&quot; (now known as the Richelieu River), and became the first European to map Lake Champlain. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.

On 29 July, somewhere in the area near Ticonderoga and Crown Point, New York (historians are not sure which of these two places, but Fort Ticonderoga historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle that began the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain&#x27;s position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his arquebus and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. While this cowed the Iroquois for some years, they would later return to successfully fight the French and Algonquin for the rest of the century.

The Battle of Sorel occurred on 19 June 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the Kingdom of France and his allies, the Wendat people, Algonquin people and Innu people against the Mohawk people in New France at present-day Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. Champlain&#x27;s forces armed with the arquebus engaged and slaughtered or captured nearly all of the Mohawks. The battle ended major hostilities with the Mohawks for 20 years.

==Marriage==
One route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old Hélène Boullé. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boullé, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on 27 December 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. Champlain was then 43 years old. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.

Champlain&#x27;s marriage was initially quite troubled, as Hélène rallied against joining him in August 1613. Their relationship, while it apparently lacked any physical connection, recovered and was apparently good for many years. Hélène lived in Quebec for several years, but returned to Paris and eventually decided to enter a convent. The couple had no children, and Champlain adopted three Montagnais girls named Faith, Hope, and Charity in the winter of 1627–28.

==Exploration of New France==
On 29 March 1613, arriving back in New France, he first ensured that his new royal commission be proclaimed. Champlain set out on May 27 to continue his exploration of the Huron country and in hopes of finding the &quot;northern sea&quot; he had heard about (probably Hudson Bay). He travelled the Ottawa River, later giving the first description of this area. Along the way, he apparently dropped or left behind a cache of silver cups, copper kettles, and a brass astrolabe dated 1603 (Champlain&#x27;s Astrolabe), which was later found by a farm boy named Edward Lee near Cobden, Ontario. It was in June that he met with Tessouat, the Algonquin chief of Allumettes Island, and offered to build the tribe a fort if they were to move from the area they occupied, with its poor soil, to the locality of the Lachine Rapids. However, Champlain&#x27;s ownership of the astrolabe has been questioned by modern scholars.

By 26 August, Champlain was back in Saint-Malo. There, he wrote an account of his life from 1604 to 1612 and his journey up the Ottawa river, his &quot;Voyages&quot; and published another map of New France. In 1614, he formed the &quot;Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo&quot; and &quot;Compagnie de Champlain&quot;, which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four Recollects in order to further religious life in the new colony. The Roman Catholic Church was eventually given &quot;en seigneurie&quot; large and valuable tracts of land, estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the French Crown in New France.

In 1615, Champlain reunited with Étienne Brûlé, his capable interpreter, following separate four-year explorations. There, Brûlé reported North American explorations, including that he had been joined by another French interpreter named Grenolle with whom he had travelled along the north shore of &quot;la mer douce&quot; (the calm sea), now known as Lake Huron, to the great rapids of Sault Ste. Marie, where Lake Superior enters Lake Huron, some of which was recorded by Champlain.
Champlain continued to work to improve relations with the natives, promising to help them in their struggles against the Iroquois. With his native guides, he explored further up the Ottawa River and reached Lake Nipissing. He then followed the French River until he reached Lake Huron.

In 1615, Champlain was escorted through the area that is now Peterborough, Ontario by a group of Wendat. He used the ancient portage between Chemong Lake and Little Lake (now Chemong Road) and stayed for a short period of time near what is now Bridgenorth.

==Military expedition==

On 1 September 1615, at Cahiagué (a Wendat community on what is now called Lake Simcoe), he and the northern tribes started a military expedition against the Iroquois. The party passed Lake Ontario at its eastern tip where they hid their canoes and continued their journey by land. They followed the Oneida River until they arrived at the main Onondaga fort on October 10. The exact location of this place is still a matter of debate. Although the traditional location, Nichols Pond, is regularly disproved by professional and amateur archaeologists, many still claim that Nichols Pond is the location of the battle, south of Canastota, New York. Champlain attacked the stockaded Oneida village. He was accompanied by 10 Frenchmen and 300 Wendat. Pressured by the Huron Wendat to attack prematurely, the assault failed. Champlain was wounded twice in the leg by arrows, one in his knee. The conflict ended on October 16 when the French Wendat were forced to flee.

Although he did not want to, the Wendat insisted that Champlain spend the winter with them. During his stay, he set off with them in their great deer hunt, during which he became lost and was forced to wander for three days living off game and sleeping under trees until he met up with a band of First Nations people by chance. He spent the rest of the winter learning &quot;their country, their manners, customs, modes of life&quot;. On 22 May 1616, he left the Wendat country and returned to Quebec before heading back to France on 2 July.

==Improving administration in New France==

Champlain returned to New France in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration. Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.

Champlain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.

In 1627 the Caen brothers&#x27; company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and Cardinal Richelieu (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the Compagnie des Cent-Associés (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade. Champlain was one of the 100 investors, and its first fleet, loaded with colonists and supplies, set sail in April 1628.

Champlain had overwintered in Quebec. Supplies were low, and English merchants sacked Cap Tourmente in early July 1628. A war had broken out between France and England, and Charles I of England had issued letters of marque that authorized the capture of French shipping and its colonies in North America. Champlain received a summons to surrender on July 10 from the Kirke brothers, two Scottish brothers who were working for the English government. Champlain refused to deal with them, misleading them to believe that Quebec&#x27;s defenses were better than they actually were (Champlain had only 50 pounds of gunpowder to defend the community). Successfully bluffed, they withdrew, but encountered and captured the French supply fleet, cutting off that year&#x27;s supplies to the colony. By the spring of 1629 supplies were dangerously low and Champlain was forced to send people to Gaspé and into Indian communities to conserve rations. On July 19, the Kirke brothers arrived before Quebec after intercepting Champlain&#x27;s plea for help, and Champlain was forced to surrender the colony. Many colonists were transported first to England and then to France by the Kirkes, but Champlain remained in London to begin the process of regaining the colony. A peace treaty had been signed in April 1629, three months before the surrender, and, under the terms of that treaty, Quebec and other prizes that were taken by the Kirkes after the treaty were to be returned. It was not until the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, however, that Quebec was formally given back to France. (David Kirke was rewarded when Charles I knighted him and gave him a charter for Newfoundland.) Champlain reclaimed his role as commander of New France on behalf of Richelieu on 1 March 1633, having served in the intervening years as commander in New France &quot;in the absence of my Lord the Cardinal de Richelieu&quot; from 1629 to 1635. In 1632 Champlain published &quot;Voyages de la Nouvelle-France&quot;, which was dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu, and &quot;Traitté de la marine et du devoir d&#x27;un bon marinier&quot;, a treatise on leadership, seamanship, and navigation. (Champlain made more than 25 round-trip crossings of the Atlantic in his lifetime, without losing a single ship.)

==Last return, and last years working in Quebec==
Champlain returned to Quebec on 22 May 1633, after an absence of four years. Richelieu gave him a commission as Lieutenant General of New France, along with other titles and responsibilities, but not that of governor. Despite this lack of formal status, many colonists, French merchants, and Indians treated him as if he had the title; writings survive in which he is referred to as &quot;our governor&quot;. On 18 August 1634, he sent a report to Richelieu stating that he had rebuilt on the ruins of Quebec, enlarged its fortifications, and established two more habitations. One was 15 leagues upstream, and the other was at Trois-Rivières. He also began an offensive against the Iroquois, reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or &quot;brought to reason&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Champlain had a severe stroke in October 1635, and died on 25 December, leaving no immediate heirs. Jesuit records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor Charles Lallemant.

Although his will (drafted on 17 November 1635) gave much of his French property to his wife Hélène Boullé, he made significant bequests to the Catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of Quebec. However, Marie Camaret, a cousin on his mother&#x27;s side, challenged the will in Paris and had it overturned. It is unclear exactly what happened to his estate.

Samuel de Champlain was temporarily buried in the church while a standalone chapel was built to hold his remains in the upper part of the city. This small building, along with many others, was destroyed by a large fire in 1640. Though immediately rebuilt, no traces of it exist. His exact burial site is still unknown, despite much research since about 1850, including several archaeological digs in the city. There is general agreement that the previous Champlain chapel site, and the remains of Champlain, should be somewhere near the Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral.

The search for Champlain&#x27;s remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer Louise Penny&#x27;s 2010 novel, &quot;Bury Your Dead&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Many sites and landmarks have been named to honour Champlain, who was a prominent figure in many parts of Acadia, Ontario, Quebec, New York, and Vermont. Memorialized as the &quot;Father of New France&quot; and &quot;Father of Acadia&quot;, his historic significance endures in modern times. Lake Champlain, which straddles the border between northern New York and Vermont, extending slightly across the border into Canada, was named by him, in 1609, when he led an expedition along the Richelieu River, exploring a long, narrow lake situated between the Green Mountains of present-day Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of present-day New York. The first European to map and describe it, Champlain claimed the lake as his namesake.

Memorials include:

<text>A sifaka (; ) is a lemur of the genus Propithecus from the family Indriidae within the order Primates. The common name is an onomatopoeia of their characteristic &quot;shi-fak&quot; alarm call. Like all lemurs, they are found only on the island of Madagascar. All species of sifakas are threatened, ranging from endangered to critically endangered.

== Anatomy and physiology ==
Sifakas are medium-sized indriids with a head and body length of and a weight of . Their tail is just as long as their body, which differentiates them from the Indri. Their fur is long and silky, with coloration varying by species from yellowish-white to blackish-brown. Their round, hairless face is always black. As with all lemurs, the sifaka has special adaptations for grooming, including a toilet-claw on its second toe and a toothcomb.

Sifakas move by vertical clinging and leaping, meaning they maintain an upright position leaping from tree trunk to tree trunk and moving along branches. They are skillful climbers and powerful jumpers, able to make leaps up to from one tree to the next. On the ground, they move like all indrids, with bipedal, sideways hopping movements of the hind legs, holding their fore limbs up for balance. Sifakas are diurnal and arboreal. 

Sifakas are herbivores, eating leaves, flowers, and fruits. When not searching for food, they spend a good part of the day sunbathing, stretched on the branches. Sifakas live in larger groups than the other indrids (up to 13 animals). They have a firm territory, which they mark with scent glands. Edges of different sifaka territories can overlap. Though they defend their territory from invasion by others of their species, they may peacefully co-exist with other lemur species such as the red-bellied lemur and the common brown lemur. Successful invasions are known to result in death of male members, group takeover, and infanticide.
Predators of the sifaka include the fossa, a puma-like mammal native to Madagascar, and aerial hunters such as hawks. The sifaka usually avoids these attacks with its agile acrobatics through the trees high above the ground. However, they have been known to attack by biting and scratching and have even been witnessed fighting off a Madagascar ground boa.

A four- to five-month gestation period ends with the birth of a single offspring in July. The young holds fast to the mother&#x27;s belly when small, but then later is carried on her back. Young are weaned after about six months and reach full maturity at the age of two to three years. The life expectancy of the sifakas is up to 20 years.

== Threats ==
Conservative estimates show that the utilization of fire for slash and burn cultivation, cattle raising, logging, and mining activities has contributed to the loss of 52% of the forested land since the 1950s, impacting the survival of sifakas. For instance, Perrier&#x27;s sifaka relies solely on vast forest cover, so little to no institutions are addressing these threats or the species&#x27; conservation status.

<text>Spiro Theodore Agnew (; November 9, 1918 – September 17, 1996) was the 39th vice president of the United States, serving from 1969 until his resignation in 1973. He is the second of two vice presidents to resign, the first being John C. Calhoun in 1832.

Agnew was born in Baltimore to a Greek immigrant father and an American mother. He attended Johns Hopkins University and graduated from the University of Baltimore School of Law. He was a campaign aide for U.S. Representative James Devereux in the 1950s, and was appointed to the Baltimore County Board of Zoning Appeals in 1957. In 1962, he was elected Baltimore county executive. In 1966, Agnew was elected governor of Maryland, defeating his Democratic opponent George P. Mahoney and independent candidate Hyman A. Pressman.

At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Richard Nixon asked Agnew to place his name in nomination, and named him as running mate. Agnew&#x27;s centrist reputation interested Nixon; the law and order stance he had taken in the wake of civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket of incumbent vice president Hubert Humphrey and his running mate, Senator Edmund Muskie, and American Independent Party candidates George Wallace and Curtis LeMay. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration&#x27;s enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In the presidential election of 1972, Nixon and Agnew were re-elected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern and his running mate Sargent Shriver in one of the largest landslides in American history.

In 1973, Agnew was investigated by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland on suspicion of criminal conspiracy, bribery, extortion, and tax fraud. Agnew took kickbacks from contractors during his time as Baltimore county executive and governor of Maryland. The payments had continued into his time as vice president, but had nothing to do with the Watergate scandal, in which he was not implicated. After months of maintaining his innocence, Agnew pleaded no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion and resigned from office. Nixon replaced him with House Republican leader Gerald Ford. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances and blaming Zionists for forcing him out of office. He wrote a novel and a memoir, both of which defended his actions. Agnew died at home in 1996 at age 77 of undiagnosed acute leukemia.

==Early life==

===Family background===

Spiro Agnew&#x27;s father was born Theophrastos Anagnostopoulos in about 1877, in the Greek town of Gargalianoi, Messenia. The family may have been involved in olive growing and been impoverished during a crisis in the industry in the 1890s. Anagnostopoulos emigrated to the United States in 1897 (some accounts say 1902) and settled in Schenectady, New York, where he changed his name to Theodore Agnew and opened a diner. A passionate self-educator, Agnew maintained a lifelong interest in philosophy; one family member recalled that &quot;if he wasn&#x27;t reading something to improve his mind, he wouldn&#x27;t read.&quot; Around 1908, he moved to Baltimore, where he purchased a restaurant. Here he met William Pollard, who was the city&#x27;s federal meat inspector. The two became friends; Pollard and his wife Margaret were regular customers of the restaurant. After Pollard died in April 1917, Agnew and Margaret Pollard began a courtship which led to their marriage on December 12, 1917. Spiro Agnew was born 11 months later, on November 9, 1918.

Margaret Pollard, born Margaret Marian Akers in Bristol, Virginia, in 1883, was the youngest in a family of 10 children. As a young adult she moved to Washington, D.C., and found employment in various government offices before marrying Pollard and moving to Baltimore. The Pollards had one son, Roy, who was 10 years old when Pollard died. After the marriage to Agnew in 1917 and Spiro&#x27;s birth the following year, the new family settled in a small apartment at 226 West Madison Street, near downtown Baltimore.

===Childhood, education, early career, and marriage===

In accordance with his mother&#x27;s wishes, the infant Spiro was baptized as an Episcopalian, rather than into the Greek Orthodox Church of his father. Nevertheless, Theodore was the dominant figure within the family, and a strong influence on his son. When in 1969, after his vice presidential inauguration, Baltimore&#x27;s Greek community endowed a scholarship in Theodore Agnew&#x27;s name, Spiro Agnew told the gathering: &quot;I am proud to say that I grew up in the light of my father. My beliefs are his.&quot;

During the early 1920s, the Agnews prospered. Theodore acquired a larger restaurant, the Piccadilly, and moved the family to a house in the Forest Park northwest section of the city, where Spiro attended Garrison Junior High School and later Forest Park High School. This period of affluence ended with the crash of 1929, and the restaurant closed. In 1931, the family&#x27;s savings were wiped out when a local bank failed, forcing them to sell the house and move to a small apartment. Agnew later recalled how his father responded to these misfortunes: &quot;He just shrugged it off and went to work with his hands without complaint.&quot; Theodore Agnew sold fruit and vegetables from a roadside stall, while the youthful Spiro helped the family&#x27;s budget with part-time jobs, delivering groceries and distributing leaflets. As he grew up, Spiro was increasingly influenced by his peers, and began to distance himself from his Greek background. He refused his father&#x27;s offer to pay for Greek language lessons, and preferred to be known by a nickname, &quot;Ted&quot;.

In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University at their new Homewood campus in north Baltimore as a chemistry major. After a few months, he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family&#x27;s continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company at their Rotunda building on 40th Street in Roland Park.

During the three years Agnew spent at the company he rose to the position of assistant underwriter. At the office, he met a young filing clerk, Elinor Judefind, known as &quot;Judy&quot;. She had grown up in the same part of the city as Agnew, but the two had not previously met. They began dating, became engaged, and were married in Baltimore on May 27, 1942. They had four children; Pamela Lee, James Rand, Susan Scott, and Elinor Kimberly.

==War and after==
===World War II (1941–1945)===
By the time of the marriage, Agnew had been drafted into the United States Army. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he began basic training at Camp Croft in South Carolina. There, he met people from a variety of backgrounds: &quot;I had led a very sheltered life—I became unsheltered very quickly.&quot; Eventually, Agnew was sent to the Officer Candidate School at Fort Knox in Kentucky, and on May 24, 1942—three days before his wedding—he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

After a two-day honeymoon, Agnew returned to Fort Knox. He served there, or at nearby Fort Campbell, for nearly two years in a variety of administrative roles, before being sent to England in March 1944 as part of the pre-D-Day build-up. He remained on standby in Birmingham until late in the year, when he was posted to the 54th Armored Infantry Battalion in France as a replacement officer. After briefly serving as a rifle platoon leader, Agnew commanded the battalion&#x27;s service company. The battalion became part of Combat Command &quot;B&quot; of the 10th Armored Division, which saw action in the Battle of the Bulge, including the Siege of Bastogne—in all, &quot;thirty-nine days in the hole of the doughnut&quot;, as one of Agnew&#x27;s men put it. Thereafter, the 54th Battalion fought its way into Germany, seeing action at Mannheim, Heidelberg, and Crailsheim, before reaching Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria as the war concluded. Agnew returned home for discharge in November 1945, having been awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Bronze Star.

===Postwar years (1945–1956)===
On return to civilian life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured a job as a law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until that time, Agnew had been largely non-political; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father&#x27;s beliefs. The firm&#x27;s senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics, he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett&#x27;s advice; on moving with family to the suburb of Lutherville in 1947, Agnew registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.

In 1947, Agnew graduated with a Bachelor of Laws and passed the bar examination in Maryland. He started a law practice in downtown Baltimore, but was not successful, and took a job as an insurance investigator. A year later, Agnew moved to Schreiber&#x27;s, a supermarket chain, where his role was store detective. He remained there for four years, a period briefly interrupted in 1951 by a recall to the Army after the outbreak of the Korean War. Agnew resigned from Schreiber&#x27;s in 1952, and resumed his legal practice, specializing in labor law.

In 1955, Barrett was appointed a judge in Towson, the county seat of Baltimore. Agnew moved his office there; at the same time, he moved his family from Lutherville to Loch Raven. There, he led a typical suburban lifestyle, serving as president of the local school district&#x27;s Parent-Teacher Association, joining Kiwanis, and participating in a range of social and community activities. Historian William Manchester summed up Agnew in those days: &quot;His favorite musician was Lawrence Welk. His leisure interests were all : watching the Baltimore Colts on television, listening to Mantovani, and reading the sort of prose the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; liked to condense. He was a lover of order and an almost compulsive conformist.&quot;

==Beginnings in public life==
===Political awakening===
In the 1950s, Agnew volunteered for the congressional campaigns of U.S. Representative James Devereux. Agnew made his first bid for political office in 1956, when he sought to be a Republican candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958, he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term and became its chairman.

In the November 1960 elections, Agnew decided to seek election to the county circuit court, against the local tradition that sitting judges seeking re-election were not opposed. He was unsuccessful, finishing last of five candidates. This failed attempt raised his profile, and he was regarded by his Democratic opponents as a Republican on the rise. The 1960 elections saw the Democrats win control of the county council, and one of their first actions was to remove Agnew from the Zoning Appeals Board. According to Agnew&#x27;s biographer, Jules Witcover, &quot;The publicity generated by the Democrats&#x27; crude dismissal of Agnew cast him as the honest servant wronged by the machine.&quot; Seeking to capitalize on this mood, Agnew asked to be nominated as the Republican candidate in the 1962 U.S. congressional elections, in Maryland&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. The party chose the more experienced J. Fife Symington, but wanted to take advantage of Agnew&#x27;s local support. He accepted their invitation to run for county executive, the county&#x27;s chief executive officer; Democrats had held the executive&#x27;s post and its predecessor, chairman of the board of county commissioners, since 1895.

Agnew&#x27;s chances in 1962 were boosted by a feud in the Democratic ranks, as the retired former county executive, Michael Birmingham, fell out with his successor and defeated him in the Democratic primary. By contrast with his elderly opponent, Agnew was able to campaign as a &quot;White Knight&quot; promising change; his program included an anti-discrimination bill requiring public amenities such as parks, bars and restaurants be open to all races, policies that neither Birmingham nor any Maryland Democrat could have introduced at that time without angering supporters. In the November election, despite an intervention by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on Birmingham&#x27;s behalf, Agnew beat his opponent by 78,487 votes to 60,993. When Symington lost to Democrat Clarence Long in his congressional race, Agnew became the highest-ranking Republican in Maryland.

===County executive===

Agnew&#x27;s four-year term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, which included the building of new schools, increases to teachers&#x27; salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, and gave him a reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.

As county executive, Agnew was sometimes criticized for being too close to rich and influential businessmen, and was accused of cronyism after bypassing the normal bidding procedures and designating three of his Republican friends as the county&#x27;s insurance brokers of record, ensuring them large commissions. Agnew&#x27;s standard reaction to such criticisms was to display moral indignation, denounce his opponents&#x27; &quot;outrageous distortions&quot;, deny any wrongdoing and insist on his personal integrity; tactics which, Cohen and Witcover note, were to be seen again as he defended himself against the corruption allegations that ended his vice presidency.

In the 1964 presidential election, Agnew was opposed to the Republican frontrunner, the conservative Barry Goldwater, initially supporting the moderate California senator Thomas Kuchel, a candidacy that, Witcover remarks, &quot;died stillborn&quot;. After the failure of moderate Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton&#x27;s candidacy at the party convention, Agnew gave his reluctant support to Goldwater, but privately opined that the choice of so extremist a candidate had cost the Republicans any chance of victory.

==Governor of Maryland (1967–1969)==
===Election 1966===
As his four-year term as executive neared its end, Agnew knew that his chances of re-election were slim, given that the county&#x27;s Democrats had healed their rift. Instead, in 1966 he sought the Republican nomination for governor, and with the backing of party leaders won the April primary by a wide margin.

In the Democratic party, three candidates—a moderate, a liberal, and an outright segregationist—battled for their party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination, which to general surprise was won by the segregationist George P. Mahoney, a perennially unsuccessful candidate for office. Mahoney&#x27;s candidacy split his party, provoking a third-party candidate, Comptroller of Baltimore City Hyman A. Pressman. In Montgomery County, the state&#x27;s wealthiest area, a &quot;Democrats for Agnew&quot; organization flourished, and liberals statewide flocked to the Agnew standard. Mahoney, a fierce opponent of integrated housing, exploited racial tensions with the slogan: &quot;Your Home is Your Castle. Protect it!&quot; Agnew painted him as the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and said voters must choose &quot;between the bright, pure, courageous flame of righteousness and the fiery cross&quot;. In the November election Agnew, helped by 70 percent of the black vote, beat Mahoney by 455,318 votes (49.5 percent) to 373,543, with Pressman taking 90,899 votes.

After the campaign, it emerged that Agnew had failed to report three alleged attempts to bribe him that had been made on behalf of the slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000, and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: &quot;Nobody sat down in front of me with a suitcase of money.&quot; Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew&#x27;s partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.

===In office===

Agnew&#x27;s term as governor was marked by an agenda which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew&#x27;s fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line. Agnew&#x27;s attempt to adopt a new state constitution was rejected by the voters in a referendum.

For the most part, Agnew remained somewhat aloof from the state legislature, preferring the company of businessmen. Some of these had been associates in his county executive days, such as Lester Matz and Walter Jones, who had been among the first to encourage him to seek the governorship. Agnew&#x27;s close ties to the business community were noted by officials in the state capital of Annapolis: &quot;There always seemed to be people around him who were in business.&quot; Some suspected that, while not himself corrupt, he &quot;allowed himself to be used by the people around him.&quot;
Agnew publicly supported civil rights, but deplored the militant tactics used by some black leaders. During the 1966 election, his record had won him the endorsement of Roy Wilkins, leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In mid-1967, racial tension was rising nationally, fueled by black discontent and an increasingly assertive civil rights leadership. Several cities exploded in violence, and there were riots in Cambridge, Maryland, after an incendiary speech there on July 24, 1967, by radical student leader H. Rap Brown. Agnew&#x27;s principal concern was to maintain law and order, and he denounced Brown as a professional agitator, saying, &quot;I hope they put him away and throw away the key.&quot; When the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson to investigate the causes of the unrest, reported that the principal factor was institutional white racism, Agnew dismissed these findings, blaming the &quot;permissive climate and misguided compassion&quot; and adding: &quot;It is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but ... that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occasionally stylish form of dissent&quot;. In March 1968, when faced with a student boycott at Bowie State College, a historically black institution, Agnew again blamed outside agitators and refused to negotiate with the students. When a student committee came to Annapolis and demanded a meeting, Agnew closed the college and ordered more than 200 arrests.

Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, there was widespread rioting and disorder across the US. The trouble reached Baltimore on April 6, and for the next three days and nights the city burned. Agnew declared a state of emergency and called out the National Guard. When order was restored there were six dead, more than 4,000 were under arrest, the fire department had responded to 1,200 fires, and there had been widespread looting. On April 11, Agnew summoned more than 100 moderate black leaders to the state capitol, where instead of the expected constructive dialogue he delivered a speech roundly castigating them for their failure to control more radical elements, and accused them of a cowardly retreat or even complicity. One of the delegates, the Rev. Sidney Daniels, rebuked the governor: &quot;Talk to us like we are ladies and gentlemen&quot;, he said, before walking out. Others followed him; the remnant was treated to further accusations as Agnew rejected all socio-economic explanations for the disturbances. Many white suburbanites applauded Agnew&#x27;s speech: over 90 percent of the 9,000 responses by phone, letter or telegram supported him, and he won tributes from leading Republican conservatives such as Jack Williams, governor of Arizona, and former senator William Knowland of California. To members of the black community the April 11 meeting was a turning point. Having previously welcomed Agnew&#x27;s stance on civil rights, they now felt betrayed, one state senator observing: &quot;He has sold us out ... he thinks like George Wallace, he talks like George Wallace&quot;.

==Vice presidential candidate (1968)==
===Background: Rockefeller and Nixon===

At least until the April 1968 disturbances, Agnew&#x27;s image was that of a liberal Republican. Since 1964 he had supported the presidential ambitions of Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, and early in 1968, with that year&#x27;s elections looming, he became chairman of the &quot;Rockefeller for President&quot; citizens&#x27; committee. When in a televised speech on March 21, 1968, Rockefeller shocked his supporters with an apparently unequivocal withdrawal from the race, Agnew was dismayed and humiliated; despite his very public role in the Rockefeller campaign, he had received no advance warning of the decision. He took this as a personal insult and as a blow to his credibility.

Within days of Rockefeller&#x27;s announcement, Agnew was being wooed by supporters of the former vice president Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller&#x27;s withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his &quot;second choice&quot;. When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew&#x27;s words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew&#x27;s reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a &quot;formidable candidate&quot; but did not commit his support: &quot;A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal ... I think I&#x27;ve got to take another look at this situation&quot;.

In mid-May, Nixon, interviewed by David Broder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, mentioned the Maryland governor as a possible running mate. As Agnew continued to meet with Nixon and with the candidate&#x27;s senior aides, there was a growing impression that he was moving into the Nixon camp. At the same time, Agnew denied any political ambitions beyond serving his full four-year term as governor.

===Republican National Convention===
As Nixon prepared for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California; and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, with Lindsay in particular unacceptable to Southern conservatives, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew&#x27;s name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending to go to the convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.

At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew abandoned his favorite son status, placing Nixon&#x27;s name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Agnew was seen as a candidate who could appeal to Rockefeller Republicans, was acceptable to Southern Conservatives, and had a solid law-and-order record. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates was little more than a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.

In his acceptance speech, Agnew told the convention he had &quot;a deep sense of the improbability of this moment&quot;. Agnew was not yet a national figure, and a widespread reaction to the nomination was &quot;Spiro who?&quot; In Atlanta, three pedestrians gave their reactions to the name when interviewed on television: &quot;It&#x27;s some kind of disease&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s some kind of egg&quot;; &quot;He&#x27;s a Greek that owns that shipbuilding firm.&quot;

===Campaign===
In 1968, the Nixon–Agnew ticket faced two principal opponents. The Democrats, at a convention marred by violent demonstrations, had nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Maine Senator Edmund Muskie as their standard-bearers. The segregationist former Governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ran as a third-party candidate and was expected to do well in the Deep South. Nixon, mindful of the restrictions he had labored under as Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s running mate in 1952 and 1956, was determined to give Agnew a much freer rein and to make it clear his running mate had his support. Agnew could also usefully play an &quot;attack dog&quot; role, as Nixon had in 1952.

Initially, Agnew played the centrist, pointing to his civil rights record in Maryland. As the campaign developed, he quickly adopted a more belligerent approach, with strong law-and-order rhetoric, a style which alarmed the party&#x27;s Northern liberals but played well in the South. John Mitchell, Nixon&#x27;s campaign manager, was impressed, some other party leaders less so; Senator Thruston Morton described Agnew as an &quot;asshole&quot;.

Throughout September, Agnew was in the news, generally as a result of what one reporter called his &quot;offensive and sometimes dangerous banality&quot;. He used the derogatory term &quot;Polack&quot; to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as &quot;the fat Jap&quot;, and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating that &quot;if you&#x27;ve seen one slum you&#x27;ve seen them all.&quot; He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain&#x27;s prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message &quot;Agnew for Vice President?&quot; against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter that degenerated into a painful cough, before a final message: &quot;This would be funny if it weren&#x27;t so serious...&quot; Agnew&#x27;s comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew&#x27;s rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize &quot;white backlash&quot; into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as &quot;orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order&quot;.

In late October, Agnew survived an exposé in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that questioned his financial dealings in Maryland, with Nixon denouncing the paper for &quot;the lowest kind of gutter politics&quot;. In the election on November 5, the Republicans were victorious, with a narrow popular vote plurality – 500,000 out of a total of 73 million votes cast. The Electoral College result was more decisive: Nixon 301, Humphrey 191 and Wallace 46. The Republicans narrowly lost Maryland, but Agnew was credited by pollster Louis Harris with helping his party to victory in several border and Upper South states that might easily have fallen to Wallace—South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky—and with bolstering Nixon&#x27;s support in suburbs nationally. Had Nixon lost those five states, he would have had only the minimum number of electoral votes needed, 270, and any defection by an elector would have thrown the election to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

==Vice presidency (1969–1973)==

=== Transition and early days ===
Immediately after the 1968 election, Agnew was still uncertain what Nixon would expect of him as vice president. He met with Nixon several days after the election in Key Biscayne, Florida. Nixon, vice president himself for eight years under Eisenhower, wanted to spare Agnew the boredom and lack of a role he had sometimes experienced in that office. Nixon initially gave Agnew an office in the West Wing of the White House, a first for a vice president, although in December 1969 it was given to deputy assistant Alexander Butterfield and Agnew had to move to an office in the Executive Office Building. When they stood before the press after the meeting, Nixon pledged that Agnew would not have to undertake the ceremonial roles usually undertaken by the holders of the vice presidency, but would have &quot;new duties beyond what any vice president has previously assumed&quot;. Nixon told the press that he planned to make full use of Agnew&#x27;s experience as county executive and as governor in dealing with matters of federal-state relations and in urban affairs.

Nixon established transition headquarters in New York, but Agnew was not invited to meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt &quot;exhilarated&quot; with his new responsibilities, but did not explain what those were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on St. Croix, where he played a round of golf with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon&#x27;s daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence for the vice president, and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington formerly occupied by Johnson while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved there with them, the others remaining in Maryland.

During the transition, Agnew hired a staff, choosing several aides who had worked with him as county executive and as governor. He hired Charles Stanley Blair as chief of staff; Blair had been a member of the House of Delegates and served as Maryland Secretary of State under Agnew. Arthur Sohmer, Agnew&#x27;s long-time campaign manager, became his political advisor, and Herb Thompson, a former journalist, became press secretary.

Agnew was sworn in along with Nixon on January 20, 1969; as was customary, he sat down immediately after being sworn in, and did not make a speech. Soon after the inauguration, Nixon appointed Agnew as head of the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, to head government commissions such as the National Space Council and assigned him to work with state governors to bring down crime. It became clear that Agnew would not be in the inner circle of advisors. The new president preferred to deal directly with only a trusted handful, and was annoyed when Agnew tried to call him about matters Nixon deemed trivial. After Agnew shared his opinions on a foreign policy matter in a cabinet meeting, an angry Nixon sent Bob Haldeman to warn Agnew to keep his opinions to himself. Nixon complained that Agnew had no idea how the vice presidency worked, but did not meet with Agnew to share his own experience of the office. Herb Klein, director of communications in the Nixon White House, later wrote that Agnew had allowed himself to be pushed around by senior aides such as Haldeman and John Mitchell, and that Nixon&#x27;s &quot;inconsistent&quot; treatment of Agnew had left the vice president exposed.

Agnew&#x27;s pride had been stung by the negative news coverage of him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual for the vice president to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have previously been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the Parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon&#x27;s absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower&#x27;s illnesses, did not sit in the president&#x27;s chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.

=== &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Nixon&quot;: attacking the left ===
The public image of Agnew as an uncompromising critic of the violent protests that had marked 1968 persisted into his vice presidency. At first, he tried to take a more conciliatory tone, in line with Nixon&#x27;s own speeches after taking office. Still, he urged a firm line against violence, stating in a speech in Honolulu on May 2, 1969, that &quot;we have a new breed of self-appointed vigilantes arising—the counterdemonstrators—taking the law into their own hands because officials fail to call law enforcement authorities. We have a vast faceless majority of the American public in quiet fury over the situation—&quot;and with good reason&quot;.&quot;

On October 14, 1969, the day before the anti-war Moratorium, North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong released a letter supporting demonstrations in the United States. Nixon resented this, but on the advice of his aides, thought it best to say nothing, and instead had Agnew give a press conference at the White House, calling upon the Moratorium protesters to disavow the support of the North Vietnamese. Agnew handled the task well, and Nixon tasked Agnew with attacking the Democrats generally, while remaining above the fray himself. This was analogous to the role Nixon had performed as vice president in the Eisenhower White House; thus Agnew was dubbed &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Nixon&quot;. Agnew had finally found a role in the Nixon administration, one he enjoyed.

Nixon had Agnew deliver a series of speeches attacking their political opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators: &quot;a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals&quot;. The following day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican dinner, &quot;for too long the South has been the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals ... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very fiber of America.&quot; Denying Republicans had a Southern Strategy, Agnew stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew&#x27;s rhetoric &quot;could have served as the blueprint for the culture wars of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving&quot;. The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew&#x27;s attacks were overbroad.

In the wake of these remarks, Nixon delivered his Silent Majority speech on November 3, 1969, calling on &quot;the great silent majority of my fellow Americans&quot; to support the administration&#x27;s policy in Vietnam. The speech was well received by the public, but less so by the press, who strongly attacked Nixon&#x27;s allegations that only a minority of Americans opposed the war. Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan penned a speech in response, to be delivered by Agnew on November 13 in Des Moines, Iowa. The White House worked to assure the maximum exposure for Agnew&#x27;s speech, and the networks covered it live, making it a nationwide address, a rarity for vice presidents. According to Witcover, &quot;Agnew made the most of it&quot;.

Historically, the press had enjoyed considerable prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon&#x27;s speech, &quot;his words and policies were subjected to instant analysis and querulous criticism ... by a small band of network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed in one way or another their hostility to what he had to say ... It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance.&quot; Agnew continued, &quot;I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men ... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases&quot;.

Agnew thus put into words feelings that many Republicans and conservatives had long felt about the news media. Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an &quot;appeal to prejudice ... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press&quot;. Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments

On November 20 in Montgomery, Alabama, Agnew reinforced his earlier speech with an attack on &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, again originated by Buchanan. Both papers had enthusiastically endorsed Agnew&#x27;s candidacy for governor in 1966 but had castigated him as unfit for the vice presidency two years later. The &quot;Post&quot; in particular had been hostile to Nixon since the Hiss case in the 1940s. Agnew accused the papers of sharing a narrow viewpoint alien to most Americans. Agnew alleged that the newspapers were trying to circumscribe his First Amendment right to speak of what he believed, while demanding unfettered freedom for themselves, and warned, &quot;the day when the network commentators and even the gentlemen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoyed a form of diplomatic immunity from comment and criticism of what they said is over.&quot;

After Montgomery, Nixon sought a détente with the media, and Agnew&#x27;s attacks ended. Agnew&#x27;s approval rating soared to 64 percent in late November, and the &quot;Times&quot; called him &quot;a formidable political asset&quot; to the administration. The speeches gave Agnew a power base among conservatives, and boosted his presidential chances for the 1976 election.

=== 1970: Protesters and midterm elections ===
Agnew&#x27;s attacks on the administration&#x27;s opponents, and the flair with which he made his addresses, made him popular as a speaker at Republican fundraising events. He traveled over on behalf of the Republican National Committee in early 1970, speaking at a number of Lincoln Day events, and supplanted Reagan as the party&#x27;s leading fundraiser. Agnew&#x27;s involvement had Nixon&#x27;s strong support. In his Chicago speech, the vice president attacked &quot;supercilious sophisticates&quot;, while in Atlanta, he promised to continue speaking out lest he break faith with &quot;the Silent Majority, the everyday law-abiding American who believes his country needs a strong voice to articulate his dissatisfaction with those who seek to destroy our heritage of liberty and our system of justice&quot;.

Agnew continued to try to increase his influence with Nixon, against the opposition of Haldeman, who was consolidating his power as the second most powerful person in the administration. Agnew was successful in being heard at an April 22, 1970, meeting of the National Security Council. An impediment to Nixon&#x27;s plan for Vietnamization of the war in Southeast Asia was increasing Viet Cong control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew&#x27;s support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation.

The continuing student protests against the war brought Agnew&#x27;s scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, &quot;When a fire takes place, a man doesn&#x27;t run into the room and whisper ... he yells, &#x27;Fire!&#x27; and I am yelling &#x27;Fire!&#x27; because I think &#x27;Fire!&#x27; needs to be called here&quot;. The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to &quot;a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate&quot;. Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.

Nixon&#x27;s agenda had been impeded by the fact that Congress was controlled by Democrats and he hoped to take control of the Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew&#x27;s role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.

On September 10 in Springfield, Illinois, speaking on behalf of Republican Senator Ralph Smith, Agnew began his campaign, which would be noted for harsh rhetoric and memorable phrases. Agnew attacked the &quot;pusillanimous pussyfooting&quot; of the liberals, including those in Congress, who Agnew said cared nothing for the blue- and white-collar workers, the &quot;Forgotten Man of American politics&quot;. Addressing the California Republican Convention in San Diego, Agnew targeted &quot;the nattering nabobs of negativism. They have formed their own 4-H Club—the &#x27;Hopeless, Hysterical, Hypochondriacs of History&#x27;.&quot; He warned that candidates of any party who espoused radical views should be voted out, a reference to New York Senator Charles Goodell, who was on the ballot that November, and who opposed the Vietnam War. Believing that the strategy was working, Nixon met with Agnew at the White House on September 24, and urged him to continue.

Nixon wanted to get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been appointed by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon&#x27;s support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell&#x27;s defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew&#x27;s successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.

=== Re-election in 1972 ===
Through 1971, it was uncertain if Agnew would be retained on the ticket as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew&#x27;s independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew&#x27;s popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon&#x27;s stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon&#x27;s rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid at the start of 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.
Nixon instructed Agnew to avoid personal attacks on the press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party&#x27;s future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration&#x27;s accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew&#x27;s exclusion from Nixon&#x27;s inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern&#x27;s initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, Nixon renewed those instructions for former ambassador Sargent Shriver, who had become the new candidate for vice president.

Nixon took the high road in the campaign, but still wanted McGovern attacked for his positions, and the task fell in part to Agnew. The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, and wanted to be perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a &quot;desperate candidate who can&#x27;t seem to understand that the American people don&#x27;t want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them&quot;.

The race was never close, as the McGovern/Shriver ticket&#x27;s campaign was effectively over before it even began. The Nixon/Agnew ticket easily won reelection, winning 49 states (losing only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia) and over 60 percent of the vote. Trying to position himself as the front-runner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew&#x27;s efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.

===Criminal investigation and resignation===

In early 1972, George Beall, the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall&#x27;s target was the then-current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, so any wrongdoing potentially committed while he held that office could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz&#x27;s engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew five percent of the value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.

Investigative reporters and Democratic operatives had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt during his years as a Maryland official, but had been unable to substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The vice president&#x27;s personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew&#x27;s name. In June, Matz&#x27;s attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. The statute of limitations would not prevent Agnew from being prosecuted for these later payments. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson. At the end of the month Nixon, through his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew&#x27;s attorney, formally advising that the vice president was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland&#x27;s road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, &quot;every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew&quot;.

Richardson, whom Nixon had ordered to take personal responsibility for the investigation, met with Agnew and his attorneys on August 6 to outline the case, but Agnew denied culpability, saying the selection of Matz&#x27;s firm had been routine, and the money was a campaign contribution. The story broke in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later that day. Agnew publicly proclaimed his innocence and on August 8 held a press conference at which he called the stories &quot;damned lies&quot;. Nixon, at a meeting on August 7, assured Agnew of his complete confidence, but Haig visited Agnew at his office and suggested that if the charges could be sustained, Agnew might want to take action before being indicted. By this time, the Watergate investigation that would lead to Nixon&#x27;s resignation was well advanced. For the next two months, fresh revelations in each scandal were almost daily fare in the newspapers.

Under increasing pressure to resign, Agnew took the position that a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded that it would be improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain on the condition that he would not serve jail time. He wrote in his memoirs that he entered the plea bargain because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.

On October 10, 1973, Agnew appeared before the federal court in Baltimore, and pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed that there would be no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years&#x27; unsupervised probation. Immediately prior to entering court, Agnew had an aide submit his formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the United States.

==Post-vice presidency (1973–1996)==
===Subsequent career: 1973–1990===
Soon after his resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City. To cover urgent tax and legal bills, and living expenses, he borrowed $200,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from his friend Frank Sinatra. He had hoped he could resume a career as a lawyer, but in 1974, the Maryland Court of Appeals disbarred him, calling him &quot;morally obtuse&quot;. To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. One deal concerned a contract for the supply of uniforms to the Iraqi Army, involving negotiations with Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceauşescu of Romania.

Agnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer Doug Sanders over a beer distributionship in Texas. In 1976 he published a novel, &quot;The Canfield Decision&quot;, about an American vice president&#x27;s troubled relationship with his president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, with Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone. The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George Canfield, refers to &quot;Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies&quot; and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted was true in real life. This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for re-election. Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: &quot;My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities&quot;. Also in 1976, Agnew announced that he was establishing a charitable foundation &quot;Education for Democracy&quot;, but nothing more was heard of this after B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith accused it of being a front for Agnew&#x27;s anti-Israeli views. Agnew&#x27;s anti-Zionist views seemed to have developed after leaving office—as vice president, he expressed admiration for Israel and was friendly with his Jewish staff members.

In 1977, Agnew was wealthy enough to move to a new home at The Springs Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, and shortly afterwards to repay the Sinatra loan. That year, in a series of televised interviews with British TV host David Frost, Nixon claimed that he had had no direct role in the processes that had led to Agnew&#x27;s resignation and implied that his vice president had been hounded by the liberal media: &quot;He made mistakes ... but I do not think for one minute that Spiro Agnew consciously felt that he was violating the law&quot;.

In 1980, Agnew wrote to Fahd bin Abdulaziz, at the time Crown Prince and &quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, claiming that he had been bled dry by attacks on him by Zionists, whom he blamed for forcing him out of office. He requested an interest-free three-year loan of $2 million, to be deposited in a Swiss bank account, on which the interest would be available to Agnew. He stated that he would use the funds to &quot;continue my effort to inform the American people of their (i.e., Zionists&#x27;) control of the media and other influential sectors of American society.&quot; He also congratulated the crown prince on his call for jihad against Israel, whose declaration of Jerusalem as its capital he characterized as &quot;the final provocation&quot;. A month later he thanked the crown prince for giving him &quot;the resources to continue the battle against the Zionist community here in the U.S.&quot;
In 1980, Agnew published a memoir, &quot;Go Quietly ... or Else&quot;. In it, he protested his total innocence of the charges that had brought his resignation. His assertions of innocence were undermined when his former lawyer George White testified that his client had admitted statehouse bribery to him, saying it had been going on &quot;for a thousand years&quot;. Agnew also made a new claim: that he resigned because he had been warned by White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig to &quot;go quietly&quot; or face an unspoken threat of possible assassination. Haig denied the story, saying that it was &quot;preposterous&quot;, and the Agnew aide who supposedly reported this warning to Agnew also denied it, saying there was &quot;never any threat of bodily harm&quot;. Agnew biographer Joseph P. Coffey describes the claim as &quot;absurd&quot;.

After the publication of &quot;Go Quietly&quot;, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. Students of Professor John F. Banzhaf III from the George Washington University Law School found three residents of the state of Maryland willing to put their names on a case that sought to have Agnew repay the state $268,482, the amount it was said he had taken in bribes, including interest and penalties, as a public employee. In 1981, a judge ruled that &quot;Mr. Agnew had no lawful right to this money under any theory,&quot; and ordered him to pay the state $147,500 for the kickbacks and $101,235 in interest. After two unsuccessful appeals by Agnew, he finally paid the sum in 1983. In 1989, Agnew applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible.

Agnew also was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he revealed information about his then-recent business activities through his company, Pathlite, Inc. Among other activities, Agnew arranged contracts in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, and represented a conglomerate based in South Korea, a German aircraft manufacturer, a French company that made uniforms, and a dredging company from Greece. He also represented the Hoppmann Corporation, an American company attempting to arrange for communications work in Argentina. He also discussed with local businessmen a potential concert by Frank Sinatra in Argentina. Agnew wrote in court papers &quot;I have one utility, and that&#x27;s the ability to penetrate to the top people.&quot;

===Final years and death===

For the remainder of his life, Agnew kept distant from news media and Washington politics. Stating he felt &quot;totally abandoned&quot;, Agnew declined to take any and all phone calls from President Nixon. When Nixon died in 1994, his daughters invited Agnew to attend the funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; over the years he had rejected various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. &quot;I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside&quot;, he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: &quot;I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don&#x27;t deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony has less to do with Spiro Agnew than with the office I held&quot;.

On September 16, 1996, Agnew collapsed at his summer home in Ocean City, Maryland. He was taken to Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, Maryland, where he died the following evening. The cause of death was undiagnosed acute leukemia. Agnew remained fit and active into his seventies, playing golf and tennis regularly, and was scheduled to play tennis with a friend on the day of his death. The funeral, at Timonium, Maryland, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew&#x27;s former Secret Service detail also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president and combat Veteran, an honor guard of the combined military services fired a rifle volley at the graveside. Agnew&#x27;s wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012.

==Legacy==
At the time of his death, Agnew&#x27;s legacy was perceived largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall from public life, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians—Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Jack Kemp, Joe Lieberman, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden—some of whom themselves became their party&#x27;s nominee for president.

Some recent historians have seen Agnew as important in the development of the New Right, arguing that he should be honored alongside the acknowledged founding fathers of the movement such as Goldwater and Reagan; Victor Gold, Agnew&#x27;s former press secretary, considered him the movement&#x27;s &quot;John the Baptist&quot;. Goldwater&#x27;s crusade in 1964, at the height of Johnsonian liberalism, came too early, but by the time of Agnew&#x27;s election, liberalism was on the wane, and as Agnew moved to the right after 1968, the country moved with him. Agnew&#x27;s fall shocked and saddened conservatives, but it did not inhibit the growth of the New Right. Agnew, the first suburban politician to achieve high office, helped to popularize the view that much of the national media was controlled by elitist and effete liberals. Levy noted that Agnew &quot;helped recast the Republicans as a Party of &#x27;Middle Americans&#x27; and, even in disgrace, reinforced the public&#x27;s distrust of government.&quot;

For Agnew himself, despite his rise from his origins in Baltimore to next in line to the presidency, &quot;there could be little doubt that history&#x27;s judgment was already upon him, the first Vice President of the United States to have resigned in disgrace. All that he achieved or sought to achieve in his public life ... had been buried in that tragic and irrefutable act&quot;.

Levy sums up the &quot;might-have-been&quot; of Agnew&#x27;s career thus:
It is not a far stretch to imagine that if Agnew had contested corruption charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate—as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to—today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.

<text>The Battle of Mohács (; , or Mohaç Savaşı) was fought on 29 August 1526 near Mohács, Kingdom of Hungary, between the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary and its allies, led by Louis II, and those of the Ottoman Empire, led by Suleiman the Magnificent. The Ottoman victory led to the partition of Hungary for several centuries between the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg monarchy, and the Principality of Transylvania. Further, the death of Louis II as he fled the battle marked the end of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Hungary and Bohemia, whose dynastic claims passed to the House of Habsburg.

During the battle, the Ottomans utilised the firearm kneeling position, the first of its kind, with 200 &quot;tüfenks&quot; (muskets) forming &quot;nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row&quot; in a &quot;kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest&quot;. This method was later adopted by the Chinese, with writer Zhao Shizhen deeming Turkish muskets superior to European ones. Volley fire with matchlocks was also first used in this battle by Janissaries.

It has been argued that the size of the Ottoman army was the main reason for the defeat of the well-armed Hungarian army, which could not withstand an enemy three times its size.

==Background==
===Decline of the royal power in Hungary (1490–1526)===
After the death of the absolutist King Matthias Corvinus in 1490, the Hungarian magnates, who did not want another heavy-handed king, procured the accession of the notoriously weak-willed King Vladislaus of Bohemia, who reigned as King Vladislaus II of Hungary from 1490 to 1516. He was known as King Dobře (or &quot;Dobzse&quot; in Hungarian orthography), meaning &quot;all right&quot;, for his habit of accepting, without question, every petition and document laid before him. The freshly-elected King Vladislaus II donated most of the Hungarian royal estates, régales, and royalties to the nobility. Thus the king tried to stabilize his new reign and preserve his popularity among the magnates.

Given the naive fiscal and land policy of the royal court, the central power began to experience severe financial difficulties, largely due to the enlargement of feudal lands at royal expense. The noble estate of the parliament succeeded in reducing their tax burden by 70–80%, at the expense of the country&#x27;s ability to defend itself. Vladislaus became the magnates&#x27; helpless &quot;prisoner&quot;; he could make no decision without their consent.

Europe&#x27;s largest standing mercenary army (the Black Army) of Matthias Corvinus was dissolved by the aristocracy. The magnates also dismantled the national administration systems and bureaucracy throughout the country. The country&#x27;s defenses sagged as border-guards and castle garrisons went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives to increase taxes to reinforce defenses were stifled. Hungary&#x27;s international role declined, its political stability shaken; social progress was deadlocked. The arrival of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

In 1514, the weakened and old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by György Dózsa, which was ruthlessly crushed by the nobles, led by John Zápolya. After the Dózsa Rebellion, the brutal suppression of the peasants greatly aided the 1526 Turkish invasion as the Hungarians were no longer a politically united people. The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman pre-eminence.

===Jagiellonian-Habsburg attempt to organize defence against the Ottomans===
King Louis II of Hungary married Mary of Habsburg in 1522. The Ottomans saw this Jagiellonian–Habsburg marital alliance as a threat to their power in the Balkans and worked to break it. After Suleiman I came to power in Constantinople in 1520, the High Porte made the Hungarians at least one and possibly two offers of peace. For unclear reasons, Louis refused. It is possible that Louis was well aware of Hungary&#x27;s situation (especially after the Ottomans defeated Persia in the Battle of Chaldiran (1514) and the Polish-Ottoman peace from 1525) and believed that war was a better option than peace. Even in peacetime, the Ottomans raided Hungarian lands and conquered small territories (with border castles), but a final battle still offered Louis a glimmer of hope. Accordingly, another Ottoman–Hungarian war ensued, and in June 1526 an Ottoman expedition advanced up the Danube.

In the early 1500s, Vladislav II (ruled 1490–1516), Louis II and Croatian nobles repeatedly asked Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I for help, but during Maximilian&#x27;s reign, assistance for Hungary remained a plan. After the first chain of fortresses fell however, assessing the threat to his own provinces, Archduke Ferdinand (later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I) made a significant effort to help his brother-in-law. When Nándorfehérvár was being besieged, he summoned his estates and proposed sending troops to Hungary. In the end, 2,000 German infantry troops were sent. From 1522 to the 1526 defeat at Mohács, field troops from Austria frequently arrived but were not placed into fortresses at the border as regular garrisons yet. Even though this military aid purportedly strengthened this area of the border, it had the undesired effect of dissolving the unified leadership that the &quot;ban&quot; had held until that time.

Alfred Kohler opines that the coordination effort attempted by Ferdinand, Mary and Louis failed because the young Hungarian king showed a lack of vigour, which was also recognized by Hungarian nobles. Mary, on the other hand, was much more decisive and vigorous, but the non-Hungarian advisors she relied on created distrust.

===The loss of Belgrade===
The Hungarians had long opposed Ottoman expansion in southeastern Europe, but in 1521 the Turks advanced up the Danube River and took Nándorfehérvár (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) – the strongest Hungarian fortress on the Danube – and Szabács (now Šabac, Serbia). This left most of southern Hungary indefensible.

The loss of Nándorfehérvár caused great alarm in Hungary.

On October 18, 1523, the Hungarian aristocrats united for the recapture of Belgrade, pledging funds that would support an army of 60,000 troops and 100 cannons—an undertaking that was an unprecedentedly huge and costly military force by contemporary European standards.

The huge 60,000-strong royal army – led by the king, but recruited too late and too slowly – neglected to take food along and bad organization of logistics. Therefore, the army disbanded spontaneously under pressure from hunger and disease without even trying to recapture Belgrade from the newly installed Turkish garrisons. In 1523, Archbishop Pál Tomori, a valiant priest-soldier, was made captain of Southern Hungary.

===European events, and the Franco-Ottoman alliance===
In Europe, especially in Germany, negative trends had started to unfold. The Fuggers, who had taken control of the finances, &quot;by around 1503 had a veritable monopoly of &#x27;favoritism&#x27; in Germany, Hungary, Poland and Scandinavia, to the extent that any priest who wanted to get access to even the most modest parish had to turn to the merchants of Augsburg.&quot;

The Fugger family controlled the distribution of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s indulgences, which, among other reasons, soon led to an international scandal and then to strong social unrest. After 1517, European public opinion became increasingly preoccupied and divided by the Reformation launched by Martin Luther. The religious upheaval was compounded by the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1524–1526, which mobilised considerable forces and, in addition to the material damage, caused more than 100,000 deaths.

Between 1521 and 1526, the Western European powers were preoccupied with the current episode of the Italian wars (which lasted from 1494 to 1559, with minor interruptions). France first sought allies in Eastern Europe against Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. French envoy Antonio Rincon visited Poland and Hungary several times between 1522 and 1525. After the Battle of Bicocca (1522), King Francis I of France tried – unsuccessfully – to ally himself with King Sigismund I of Poland. The Hungarian royal court also rejected the French offer. However, John Zápolya, the Voivode of Transylvania, showed a willingness to cooperate with the French, although the formal treaty was not signed until 1528.

King Francis I of France was defeated at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525 by the troops of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. After several months in prison, Francis I was forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid.

In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis formed a formal Franco-Ottoman alliance with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent as an ally against Charles V. The French-Ottoman strategic, and sometimes tactical, alliance lasted for about three centuries.

To relieve the Habsburg pressure on France, in 1525 Francis asked Suleiman to make war on the Holy Roman Empire, and the road from Turkey to the Holy Roman Empire led across Hungary. The request of the French king coincided well with the ambitions of Suleiman in Europe and gave him an incentive to attack Hungary in 1526, leading to the Battle of Mohács.

At the news of the war, the young King Louis II of Hungary appealed to the European princes for help, but only King Henry VIII of England offered aid (which arrived only in 1527 to Queen Mary of Hungary in Pozsony) and the Pope offered 50,000 gold pieces, while neither Charles V nor Ferdinand Habsburg (Archduke of Austria, the Hungarian king&#x27;s brother-in-law) did anything. The fact is that the Habsburgs&#x27; armies were still on the battlefields of Italy.

==Preparation for Mohács==
The general apathy that had characterized the country forced Tomori to lean on his own bishopric revenues when he started to repair and reinforce the second line of Hungary&#x27;s border defense system. (Pétervárad would fall to the Turks on July 15, 1526, due to the chronic lack of castle garrisons.) Three years later, an Ottoman army set out from Constantinople on 16 April 1526, led by Suleiman the Magnificent personally. The Danube River was an extremely important transport route for the Ottoman army in the region, so it was clear to everyone that the Ottoman army would follow the line of the Danube. For about along the banks of the Danube between Pétervárad and Buda there was no single Hungarian fortification, town, or even a village of any sort.

The Hungarian nobles, who still did not realize the magnitude of the approaching danger, did not immediately heed their king&#x27;s call for troops. Eventually, the Hungarians assembled in three main units: the Transylvanian army under John Zápolya, charged with guarding the passes in the Transylvanian Alps, with between 8,000 and 13,000 men; the main army, led by Louis himself (beside numerous Spanish, German, Czech, and Serbian mercenaries); and another smaller force, commanded by the Croatian count Christoph Frankopan, numbering around 5,000 men. The Ottomans deployed the largest field artillery of the era, comprising some 300 cannons, while the Hungarians had only 85 cannons, though even this number was greater than other contemporary Western European armies deployed on the battlefields during the major conflicts of Western European powers.

The number of regular professional paid soldiers (Kapıkulu) employed by the High Porte throughout the Ottoman Empire did not exceed 15,000–16,000 men in the first third of the 16th century. During this time Suleiman could raise an army between 50,000–60,000 for campaigns.

The Ottomans obtained most of the arquebuses for their janissary army from Hungarian and Venetian gunsmiths. This phenomenon was so widespread and severe, that in 1525 the Hungarian Parliament had to pass a law against the export of Hungarian-made arquebuses for the Ottoman Empire.

Contrary to popular belief, the Hungarian infantry was so well equipped with arquebuses that, it had an unusually high firepower in a comparison with contemporary Western European standards. Both armies faced a tactical challenge, namely that they could not move their firepower very well. As a result, they were only able to use it effectively if they fired from a defensive position.
The question was who could force the other to start the attack on the battlefield, that is, to attack positions that could then be defended with cannons and arquebuses.

The currently known division of the Hungarian army by arms includes: 3,000 armoured knights from the Hungarian noble banderiums, the king&#x27;s bodyguard (1,000 armoured knights), 4,500 light cavalry (mainly hussars of Serbian origin), 6,700 mainly Hungarian infantry, 5,300 papal infantry (mainly German , but Italian and Spanish contingents were also represented in smaller numbers) and 1,500 Polish infantry, with an unknown number of artillerymen. Available data do not allow a detailed reconstruction of the rest of the army.

The geography of the area meant that the Hungarians could not know the Ottomans&#x27; ultimate goal until the latter crossed the Balkan Mountains, and when they did, the Transylvanian and Croatian forces were farther from Buda than the Ottomans were. Contemporary historical records, though sparse, indicate that Louis preferred a plan of retreat, in effect ceding the country to Ottoman advances, rather than directly engaging the Ottoman army in open battle. The Hungarian war council – without waiting for reinforcements from Croatia and Transylvania only a few days march away – made a serious tactical error by choosing the battlefield near Mohács, an open but uneven plain with some swampy marshes.

Fichtner writes that before the Battle of Mohács, there was a breakdown of communication between Louis and his brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand. Ferdinand was unaware of the urgency of the situation. To make the matter worse, Louis and the Hungarian court failed to inform him that they had decided to fight a decisive battle on the plain of Mohács (this decision was made on 26 August, one day before Ferdinand&#x27;s departure: in a conference in Louis&#x27;s camp in Bata, the chancellor Stephen Brodarics advised the king to wait for reinforcements from Austria and Bohemia, but a group of impetuous nobles managed to persuade the king to engage in an open, immediate battle on the plains of Mohacs against the numerically superior Ottomans). Ferdinand, facing religious tensions and uprisings in his own lands as well as his brothers&#x27; requests for more troops for other theaters, decided to tend to what he thought to be more urgent affairs first. According to Stephen Fischer-Galati, that literature shows that Louis himself seemed to be unable to fully understand the seriousness or immediacy of the Turkish threat. It was possible that Louis based his confidence on the assurances of John Zápolya and his supporters, who promised to help. Magnates who feared Habsburg interference desired a total Hungarian effort to either contain (militarily or diplomatically) or reach a truce with the Porte.

The Ottomans had advanced toward Mohács almost unopposed. While Louis waited in Buda, they had besieged several towns (Petervarad, Ujlak, and Eszek), and crossed the Sava and Drava Rivers. At Mohács the Hungarians numbered some 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers. The only external help was a small contingent of Polish troops (1,500 soldiers and knights) led by the royal captain Lenart Gnoiński (but organized and equipped by the Papal State). The Ottoman army numbered perhaps 50,000, though some contemporary and modern-day historians put the number of the Ottoman troops at 100,000. Most of the Ottoman Balkan forces registered before this battle were described as Bosnians or Croats.

The Hungarian army was arrayed to take advantage of the terrain and hoped to engage the Ottoman army piecemeal. They had the advantage that their troops were well-rested, while the Turks had just completed a strenuous march in scorching summer heat.

===The Role of Firepower===
The earliest type of Turkish hand cannons are called as &quot;Şakaloz&quot;, which word came from the Hungarian hand cannon &quot;Szakállas puska&quot; in the 15th century.
Hungary had a long tradition of unusually extensive use of handheld firearms ( arquebus ) as early as the 15th century, for example in the famous Black Army of the late ruler King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458 - 1490). The Hungarians abandoned the use of the bow and crossbow completely in the last decade of the 15th century and switched entirely to firearms.

The Ottomans obtained most of the arquebuses for their janissary army from Hungarian and Venetian gunsmiths. This phenomenon was so widespread and severe, that in 1525 the Hungarian Parliament had to pass a law against the export of Hungarian-made arquebuses for the Ottoman Empire.

Contrary to popular belief, the Hungarian infantry was so well equipped with arquebuses that, it had an unusually high firepower in a comparison with contemporary Western European standards. Both armies faced a tactical challenge, namely that they could not move their firepower very well. As a result, they were only able to use them effectively if they fired from a defensive position.
The question was who could force the other to start the attack on the battlefield, that is, to attack positions that could then be defended with cannons and arquebuses.

Only half of the jannisaries used arquebuses and muskets, the other half still belonged to the traditional archery. The Ottomans have no numerical superiority regarding to handheld firearms during the battle of Mohács.
During the battle, the Ottomans utilised the firearm kneeling position, the first of its kind, with 200 &quot;tüfenks&quot; (muskets) forming &quot;nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row&quot; in a &quot;kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest&quot;. This method was later adopted by the Chinese, with writer Zhao Shizhen deeming Turkish muskets superior to European ones. Volley fire with matchlocks was also first used in this battle by Janissaries.

The Ottomans deployed the largest field artillery of the era, comprising some 300 cannons, while the Hungarians had only 85 cannons, though even this number was greater than other contemporary Western European armies deployed on the battlefields during the major conflicts of Western European powers.

==Battle==

The Hungarian deployment for battle consisted of two lines.
The first had a center of mercenary infantry and artillery and the majority of the cavalry on either flank. The second was a mix of levy infantry and cavalry. The rest of the Ottoman force consisted of feudal Timarli cavalry and conscripted levies from Rumelia and the Balkans.

As the first of Suleiman&#x27;s troops, the Rumelian army, advanced onto the battlefield, they were attacked and routed by Hungarian troops led by Pál Tomori. This attack by the Hungarian right caused considerable chaos among the irregular Ottoman troops, but even as the Hungarian attack pressed forward, the Ottomans rallied with the arrival of Ottoman regulars deployed from the reserves. While the Hungarian right advanced far enough at one time to place Suleiman in danger from Hungarian bullets that struck his cuirass, the superiority of the Ottoman regulars and the timely charge of the Janissaries overwhelmed the attackers, particularly on the Hungarian left. The Hungarians took serious casualties from the skillfully handled Turkish artillery and musket volleys. The Hungarian army was surrounded by Ottoman cavalry in a pincer movement, and in the center the Hungarian heavy knights and infantry were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties, especially from the well-positioned Ottoman cannons and well-armed and trained Janissary musketeers. The Hungarians could not hold their positions, and those who did not flee were surrounded and killed or captured. 
Nearly the entire Hungarian royal army was destroyed in about two hours on the battlefield. During the retreat, the twenty-year-old king died when he fell backwards off his horse while trying to ride up a steep ravine of the Csele stream. He fell into the stream and, weighed down by his armor, was unable to stand up, and drowned. Suleiman the Magnificent expressed regret at the death of his young adversary. Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, the Sultan is said to have lamented: &quot;I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off before he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty.&quot;

The result was catastrophic for the Hungarians, with their lines advancing into withering fire and flank attacks, and falling into the same trap that John Hunyadi had so often used successfully against the Ottomans. Beside the king, some 1,000 other Hungarian nobles and leaders were also killed. It is generally accepted that more than 14,000 Hungarian soldiers were killed in the initial battle.

Suleiman could not believe that this small, suicidal army was all that the once powerful country could muster against him, so he waited at Mohacs for a few days before moving cautiously against Buda. On 31 August, 2,000 Hungarian prisoners were massacred on the orders of the Sultan.

==Aftermath==
The victory did not give the Ottomans the security they wanted. Buda was left undefended; only the French and Venetian ambassadors waited for the Sultan to congratulate him on his great victory. Though they entered the unguarded evacuated Buda and pillaged the castle and surroundings, they retreated soon afterwards. It was not until 1541 that the Ottomans finally captured and occupied Buda following the 1541 Siege of Buda. However, for all intents and purposes, the Battle of Mohács meant the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary as a unified entity. Amid political chaos, the divided Hungarian nobility elected two kings simultaneously, John Zápolya in 1526 and Ferdinand of Austria in 1527. The Ottoman occupation was contested by the Habsburg Archduke of Austria, Ferdinand I, Louis&#x27;s brother-in-law and successor by treaty with King Vladislaus II.

Bohemia fell to the Habsburgs, who also dominated the northern and western parts of Hungary and the remnants of the Kingdom of Croatia, while the Ottomans held central Hungary and suzerainty over semi-independent Transylvania. This provided the Hungarians with sufficient impetus to continue to resist the Ottoman occupation, which they did for another seventy years.

The Austrian branch of Habsburg monarchs needed the economic power of Hungary for the Ottoman wars. During the Ottoman wars the territory controlled by the Kingdom of Hungary shrank by around 60%. Despite these territorial and demographic losses, the smaller, heavily war-torn Royal Hungary remained as economically important as the Austrian hereditary lands or the Bohemian crown lands in the late 16th century. Of Ferdinand&#x27;s territories, the depleted Kingdom of Hungary was at that time his largest source of revenue.

The subsequent near constant warfare required a sustained commitment of Ottoman forces, proving a drain on resources that the largely rural and war-torn kingdom proved unable to repay. Crusader armies besieged Buda several times during the 16th century. Sultan Suleiman himself died of natural causes in Hungary during the Battle of Szigetvár in 1566. There were also two unsuccessful Ottoman sieges of Eger, which did not fall until 1596, seventy years after the Ottoman victory at Mohács. The Turks proved unable to conquer the northern and western parts of Hungary, which belonged to the Habsburg monarchs.

A book on the Turkish culture was written by Georgius Bartholomaeus with information obtained from Christian troops released by the Ottomans after the battle.

==Legacy==

Mohács is seen by many Hungarians as the decisive downward turning point in the country&#x27;s history, a national trauma that persists in the nation&#x27;s folk memory. To indicate magnitude of bad luck at hand, Hungarians still say: &quot;more was lost at Mohács&quot; (). Hungarians view Mohács as marking the end of Hungary as an independent and powerful European nation.

Whilst Mohács was a decisive loss, it was the aftermath that truly put an end to fully independent Hungary. The ensuing two hundred years of near constant warfare between the two empires, Habsburg and Ottoman, turned Hungary into a perpetual battlefield and its territories were split into three parts. The countryside was regularly ravaged by armies moving back and forth, in turn devastating the population. Only in the 19th century would Hungary reestablish its former boundaries, with full independence from Habsburg rule coming only after the First World War. 
The battlefield, beside the village of Sátorhely, became an official national historical memorial site in 1976 on the 450th anniversary of the battle. The memorial was designed by architect György Vadász. A new reception hall and exhibition building, also designed by Vadász and partially funded by the European Union, was completed in 2011.

<text>Peter Schickele (; July 17, 1935 – January 16, 2024) was an American composer, musical educator and parodist, best known for comedy albums featuring his music, which he presented as being composed by the fictional P.D.Q. Bach. He also hosted a long-running weekly radio program called &quot;Schickele Mix&quot;.

From 1990 to 1993, Schickele&#x27;s P.D.Q. Bach recordings earned him four consecutive wins for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.

==Early life==
Peter Schickele was born on July 17, 1935, in Ames, Iowa, to Alsatian immigrant parents. His father, Rainer Schickele (1905, Berlin – 1989, Berkeley, California), was the son of writer René Schickele and was an agricultural economist teaching at Iowa State University. 
In 1945, Schickele&#x27;s father took a position at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., then became chairman of the Agricultural Sciences Department at North Dakota Agricultural College (now North Dakota State University) in Fargo, North Dakota in 1946.

In Fargo, the younger Schickele studied composition with Sigvald Thompson of the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra. He graduated from Fargo Central High School in 1952, then attended Swarthmore College, graduating in 1957 with a degree in music. He was the first student at Swarthmore to earn a music degree. He was a contemporary of Ted Nelson at Swarthmore, and he scored Nelson&#x27;s experimental film &quot;The Epiphany of Slocum Furlow&quot;. It was his first film score. He graduated from the Juilliard School in 1960 with a master&#x27;s degree in musical composition. He studied composition with Roy Harris and Vincent Persichetti.

==Early career==
Schickele wrote music for a number of folk musicians, most notably Joan Baez, for whom he also orchestrated and arranged three albums during the mid-1960s, &quot;Noël&quot; (1966), &quot;Joan&quot; (1967), and &quot;&quot; (1968). He also composed the original score for the 1972 science fiction film &quot;Silent Running&quot;.

Schickele, an accomplished bassoonist, was also a member of the chamber rock trio the Open Window, which wrote and performed music for the 1969 revue &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; and released three albums.

The humorous aspect of Schickele&#x27;s musical career came from his early interest in the music of Spike Jones, whose musical ensemble lampooned popular music in the 1940s and 1950s. in 1959, while at Juilliard, Schickele teamed with conductor Jorge Mester to present a humorous concert, which became an annual event at the college. In 1965, Schickele moved the concept to The Town Hall in New York City and invited the public to attend; Vanguard Records released an album of that concert, and the character of &quot;P.D.Q. Bach&quot; was launched. By 1972, the concerts had become so popular that they were moved to Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.

==P. D. Q. Bach==

Schickele developed an elaborate parody around his studies of P.D.Q. Bach, the fictional &quot;youngest and the oddest of the twenty-odd children&quot; of Johann Sebastian Bach. Among the fictional composer&#x27;s &quot;forgotten&quot; repertory are such farcical works as &quot;The Abduction of Figaro&quot;, the &quot;Unbegun&quot; symphony, &quot;Pervertimento for Bagpipes, Bicycle and Balloons&quot;, &quot;Canine Cantata: &quot;Wachet Arf!&quot;&quot;, &quot;Good King Kong Looked Out&quot;, the &quot;&quot;Trite&quot; Quintet&quot;, &quot;O Little Town of Hackensack&quot;, &quot;A Little Nightmare Music&quot;, the cantata &quot;Iphigenia in Brooklyn&quot;, the &quot;Concerto for Horn and Hardart&quot;, &quot;The Stoned Guest&quot;, &quot;Hansel and Gretel and Ted and Alice&quot;, the &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos vs. Orchestra&quot;, the dramatic oratorio &quot;Oedipus Tex&quot; and &quot;Einstein on the Fritz&quot;, a parody of Schickele&#x27;s Juilliard classmate Philip Glass.

His fictitious &quot;home establishment&quot; is the University of Southern North Dakota at Hoople, where he reports having tenure as &quot;Very Full Professor&quot; of &quot;musicolology&quot; and &quot;musical pathology&quot;. He invented a range of rather unusual instruments. The most complicated of these is the Hardart, a tone-generating device mounted on the frame of an &quot;automat&quot;, a coin-operated food dispenser. This modified automat is used in the &quot;Concerto for Horn and Hardart&quot;, a play on the name of Horn &amp; Hardart who pioneered the American use of the automat in their restaurants.

Schickele also invented the &quot;dill piccolo&quot; for playing sour notes, the &quot;left-handed sewer flute&quot;, the &quot;tromboon&quot; (&quot;a cross between a trombone and a bassoon, having all the disadvantages of both&quot;), the &quot;lasso d&#x27;amore&quot;, the double-reed slide music stand, the &quot;tuba mirum&quot; (a flexible tube filled with wine), and the &quot;pastaphone&quot; (an uncooked tube of pasta played as a horn).

To a large degree, Schickele&#x27;s music as P.D.Q. Bach has overshadowed his work as a &quot;serious&quot; composer. 

Schickele performed two concerts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his first concert at The Town Hall in New York on December 28 and 29, 2015. He reduced his concert appearances due to health issues, but continued to schedule live concert performances through 2018.

==Other musical career==
Schickele composed more than 100 original works for symphony orchestra, choral groups, chamber ensemble, voice, television and an animated adaptation of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (which he also narrated). He made a brief foray into cinema with the Bruce Dern film &quot;Silent Running&quot; (1972), for which he composed the musical score and co-wrote the original songs &quot;Silent Running&quot; and &quot;Rejoice in the Sun&quot; with Diane Lampert. He also wrote music for school bands, as well as for a number of musicals, including &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, and organized numerous concert performances as both musical director and performer. Schickele was active on the international and North American concert circuit.

Schickele&#x27;s musical creations won him multiple awards. His extensive body of work is marked by a distinctive style which integrates the European classical tradition with an unmistakable American idiom.

Schickele also created such not-quite-P.D.Q. Bach albums as &quot;Hornsmoke&quot;, &quot;Sneaky Pete and the Wolf&quot;, and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;.

Schickele&#x27;s music is published by the Theodore Presser Company.

==Radio==
As a musical educator he also hosted the classical music educational radio program &quot;Schickele Mix&quot;, which aired on many public radio stations in the United States (and internationally on Public Radio International). The program began in 1992; lack of funding ended the production of new programs by 1999, and rebroadcasts of the existing programs finally ceased in June 2007. Only 119 of the 169 programs were in the rebroadcast rotation, because earlier shows contained American Public Radio production IDs rather than ones crediting Public Radio International. In March 2006, some of the other &quot;lost episodes&quot; were added back to the rotation, with one notable program remnant of the &quot;Periodic Table of Musics&quot;, listing the names of musicians and composers as mythical element names in a format reminiscent of the periodic table.

==Personal life==
Schickele married poet Susan Sindall on October 27, 1962. His children, Matt and Karla, are both musicians. The two played together in the trio Beekeeper in the 1990s. Karla is also an orchestral music composer.

Schickele&#x27;s brother David Schickele (1937–1999) was a film director and musician.

Peter Schickele died at his home in Bearsville, New York, on January 16, 2024, at the age of 88, due to a series of infections that damaged his health.

<doc id="39083" wikidata="Q7766630" url="?curid=39083" title="The Stoned Guest">
<text>The Stoned Guest is a &quot;half-act opera&quot; by Peter Schickele in the satirical persona of P. D. Q. Bach. The title is a play on the &quot;stone guest&quot; character in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; by Mozart, as well as the opera &quot;The Stone Guest&quot; by Alexander Sergeyevich Dargomïzhsky after the play by Pushkin. The work is a parody of classical opera. The opera appears on the 1970 album of the same name.

The loose story combines elements of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with elements of &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet. Some character names, such as &quot;Don Octave&quot; and &quot;Donna Ribalda&quot;, play on the Mozart opera, referring to Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira respectively, while the castanet-clicking &quot;Carmen Ghia&quot; plays on the title character of Bizet&#x27;s opera (and puns on the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia). The &quot;Commendatoreador&quot; plays on both operas at once, being a combination of &quot;Il Commendatore&quot; and the toreador Escamillo. The orchestral accompaniment for Donna Ribalda&#x27;s opening aria, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it—I&#x27;m lost&quot;, resembles the &quot;Rex tremendae majestatis&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;.

At one point in the opera, the rival divas Carmen Ghia and Donna Ribalda break character in the middle of a &quot;recitative&quot; to hold a conversation (still in recitative) about their singing careers. At a subsequent point, they have a contest to see who can hold a note the longest. The final scenes of the opera parody first the stereotype (exemplified by &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; itself) of classical opera as having a tragic ending and then the stereotype of the Romantic narrative (as reflected in, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Goethe&#x27;s revision of the Faust legend) by revealing the tragic ending to have been a false ending and introducing &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to generate a happy conclusion not warranted by the earlier plot.

<text>Boris Godunov ( ) is an opera by Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881). The work was composed between 1868 and 1873 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is Mussorgsky&#x27;s only completed opera and is considered his masterpiece. Its subjects are the Russian ruler Boris Godunov, who reigned as Tsar (1598 to 1605) during the Time of Troubles, and his nemesis, the False Dmitriy (reigned 1605 to 1606). The Russian-language libretto was written by the composer, and is based on the 1825 drama &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; by Aleksandr Pushkin, and, in the Revised Version of 1872, on Nikolay Karamzin&#x27;s &quot;History of the Russian State&quot;.

Among major operas, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; shares with Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1867) the distinction of having an extremely complex creative history, as well as a great wealth of alternative material. The composer created two versions—the Original Version of 1869, which was rejected for production by the Imperial Theatres, and the Revised Version of 1872, which received its first performance in 1874 in Saint Petersburg.

&quot;Boris Godunov&quot; has often been subjected to cuts, recomposition, re-orchestration, transposition of scenes, or conflation of the original and revised versions.

Several composers, chief among them Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov and Dmitri Shostakovich, have created new editions of the opera to &quot;correct&quot; perceived technical weaknesses in the composer&#x27;s original scores. Although these versions held the stage for decades, Mussorgsky&#x27;s individual harmonic style and orchestration are now valued for their originality, and revisions by other hands have fallen out of fashion.

In the 1980s, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; was closer to the status of a repertory piece than any other Russian opera, even Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, and is the most recorded Russian opera.

==History==

===Composition history===
&quot;Note: Dates provided in this article for events taking place in Russia before 1918 are Old Style.&quot;
By the close of 1868, Mussorgsky had already started and abandoned two important opera projects—the antique, exotic, romantic tragedy &quot;Salammbô&quot;, written under the influence of Aleksandr Serov&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot;, and the contemporary, Russian, anti-romantic farce &quot;Marriage&quot;, influenced by Aleksandr Dargomïzhsky&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;. Mussorgsky&#x27;s next project would be a very original and successful synthesis of the opposing styles of these two experiments—the romantic-lyrical style of &quot;Salammbô&quot;, and the realistic style of &quot;Marriage&quot;.

In the autumn of 1868, Vladimir Nikolsky, a professor of Russian history and language, and an authority on Pushkin, suggested to Mussorgsky the idea of composing an opera on the subject of Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;dramatic chronicle&quot; &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. &quot;Boris&quot; the play, modelled on Shakespeare&#x27;s histories, was written in 1825 and published in 1831, but was not approved for performance by the state censors until 1866, almost 30 years after the author&#x27;s death. Production was permitted on condition that certain scenes were cut. Although enthusiasm for the work was high, Mussorgsky faced a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to his plans in that an Imperial ukaz of 1837 forbade the portrayal in opera of Russian Tsars (amended in 1872 to include only Romanov Tsars).
Original Version

When Lyudmila Shestakova, the sister of Mikhail Glinka, learned of Mussorgsky&#x27;s plans, she presented him with a volume of Pushkin&#x27;s dramatic works, interleaved with blank pages and bound, and using this, Mussorgsky began work in October 1868 preparing his own libretto. consists of 25 scenes, written predominantly in blank verse. Mussorgsky adapted the most theatrically effective scenes, mainly those featuring the title character, along with a few other key scenes (Novodevichy, Cell, Inn), often preserving Pushkin&#x27;s verses.

Mussorgsky worked rapidly, composing first the vocal score in about nine months (finished 18 July 1869), and completed the full score five months later (15 December 1869), at the same time working as a civil servant. In 1870, he submitted the libretto to the state censor for examination, and the score to the literary and music committees of the Imperial Theatres. However, the opera was rejected (10 February 1871) by a vote of 6 to 1, ostensibly for its lack of an important female role. Lyudmila Shestakova recalled the reply made by conductor Eduard Nápravník and stage manager Gennadiy Kondratyev of the Mariinsky Theatre in response to her question of whether &quot;Boris&quot; had been accepted for production:

Other questionable accounts, such as Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s, allege that there were additional reasons for rejection, such as the work&#x27;s novelty:


Meanwhile, Pushkin&#x27;s drama (18 of the published 24 scenes, condensed into 16) finally received its first performance in 1870 at the Mariinsky Theatre, three years in advance of the premiere of the opera in the same venue, using the same scene designs by Matvey Shishkov that would be recycled in the opera.

Revised Version

In 1871, Mussorgsky began recasting and expanding the opera with enthusiasm, ultimately going beyond the requirements of the directorate of the Imperial Theatres, which called simply for the addition of a female role and a scene to contain it. He added three scenes (the two Sandomierz scenes and the Kromï Scene), cut one (The Cathedral of Vasiliy the Blessed), and recomposed another (the Terem Scene). The modifications resulted in the addition of an important prima donna role (Marina Mniszech), the expansion of existing female roles (additional songs for the Hostess, Fyodor, and the Nurse), and the expansion of the first tenor role (the Pretender). Mussorgsky augmented his adaptation of Pushkin&#x27;s drama with his own lyrics, assisted by a study of the monumental &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; by Karamzin, to whom Pushkin&#x27;s drama is dedicated.
The Revised Version was finished in 1872 (vocal score, 14 December 1871; full score 23 June 1872), and submitted to the Imperial Theatres in the autumn.

Most Mussorgsky biographers claim that the directorate of the Imperial Theatres also rejected the revised version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, even providing a date: 6 May 1872 (Calvocoressi), or 29 October 1872 (Lloyd-Jones). Recent researchers point out that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim, emphasizing that in his revision Mussorgsky had rectified the only objection the directorate is known to have made.

In any case, Mussorgsky&#x27;s friends took matters into their own hands, arranging the performance of three scenes (the Inn and both Sandomierz scenes) at the Mariinsky Theatre on 5 February 1873, as a benefit for stage manager Gennadiy Kondratyev. César Cui&#x27;s review noted the audience&#x27;s enthusiasm:

The success of this performance led V. Bessel and Co. to announce the publication of the piano vocal score of Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera, issued in January 1874.

Premiere

The triumphant 1873 performance of three scenes paved the way for the first performance of the opera, which was accepted for production on 22 October 1873. The premiere took place on 27 January 1874, as a benefit for prima donna Yuliya Platonova. The performance was a great success with the public. The Mariinsky Theatre was sold out; Mussorgsky had to take some 20 curtain calls; students sang choruses from the opera in the street. This time, however, the critical reaction was exceedingly hostile [see Critical Reception in this article for details].

Initial performances of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; featured significant cuts. The entire Cell Scene was cut from the first performance, not, as is often supposed, due to censorship, but because Nápravník wished to avoid a lengthy performance, and frequently cut episodes he felt were ineffective. Later performances tended to be even more heavily cut, including the additional removal of the Kromï scene, likely for political reasons (starting 20 October 1876, the 13th performance). After protracted difficulties in obtaining the production of his opera, Mussorgsky was compliant with Nápravník&#x27;s demands, and even defended these mutilations to his own supporters.

&quot;Boris Godunov&quot; was performed 21 times during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, and 5 times after his death (in 1881) before being withdrawn from the repertory on 8 November 1882. When Mussorgsky&#x27;s subsequent opera &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; was rejected for production in 1883, the Imperial Opera Committee reputedly said: &quot;One radical opera by Mussorgsky is enough.&quot; &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; did not return to the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre until 9 November 1904, when the Rimsky-Korsakov edition was presented under conductor Feliks Blumenfeld with bass Feodor Chaliapin in the title role.

===&quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and the Imperial Family===
The reports of the antipathy of the Imperial family to Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera are supported by the following accounts by Platonova and Stasov:

1873, Saint Petersburg – Three scenes

Three scenes from the opera—the Inn Scene, the Scene in Marina&#x27;s Boudoir, and the Fountain Scene—were performed on 5 February 1873 at the Mariinsky Theatre. Eduard Nápravník conducted. The cast included Darya Leonova (Innkeeper), Fyodor Komissarzhevsky (Pretender), Osip Petrov (Varlaam), Vasiliy Vasilyev (or &#x27;Vasilyev II&#x27;) (Misail), Mikhail Sariotti (Police Officer), Yuliya Platonova (Marina), Josef Paleček (Rangoni), and Feliks Krzesiński (Old Polish Noble).

1874, Saint Petersburg – World premiere

The Revised Version of 1872 received its world premiere on 27 January 1874 at the Mariinsky Theatre. The Cell Scene was omitted. The Novodevichiy and Coronation scenes were combined into one continuous scene: &#x27;The Call of Boris to the Tsardom&#x27;. Matvey Shishkov&#x27;s design for the last scene of Pushkin&#x27;s drama, &#x27;The House of Boris&#x27; (see illustration, right), was substituted for this hybrid of the Novodevichiy and Coronation scenes. The scenes were grouped in five acts as follows:

:Act 1: &#x27;The Call of Boris to the Tsardom&#x27; and &#x27;Inn&#x27;
:Act 2: &#x27;With Tsar Boris&#x27;
:Act 3: &#x27;Marina&#x27;s Boudoir&#x27; and &#x27;At the Fountain&#x27;
:Act 4: &#x27;The Death of Boris&#x27;
:Act 5: &#x27;The Pretender near Kromï&#x27;

Production personnel included Gennadiy Kondratyev (stage director), Ivan Pomazansky (chorus master), Matvey Shishkov, Mikhail Bocharov, and Ivan Andreyev (scene designers), and Vasiliy Prokhorov (costume designer). Eduard Nápravník conducted. The cast included Ivan Melnikov (Boris), Aleksandra Krutikova (Fyodor), Wilhelmina Raab (Kseniya), Olga Shryoder (nurse), Vasiliy Vasilyev, &#x27;Vasilyev II&#x27; (Shuysky), Vladimir Sobolev (Shchelkalov), Vladimir Vasilyev, &#x27;Vasilyev I&#x27; (Pimen, Lawicki), Fyodor Komissarzhevsky (Pretender), Yuliya Platonova (Marina), Josef Paleček (Rangoni), Osip Petrov (Varlaam), Pavel Dyuzhikov (Misail), Antonina Abarinova (Innkeeper), Pavel Bulakhov (Yuródivïy), Mikhail Sariotti (Nikitich), Lyadov (Mityukha), Sobolev (Boyar-in-Attendance), Matveyev (Khrushchov), and Sobolev (Czernikowski). The production ran for 26 performances over 9 years.

The premiere established traditions that have influenced subsequent Russian productions (and many abroad as well): 1) Cuts made to shorten what is perceived as an overlong work; 2) Declamatory and histrionic singing by the title character, often degenerating in climactic moments into shouting (initiated by Ivan Melnikov, and later reinforced by Fyodor Shalyapin); and 3) Realistic and historically accurate sets and costumes, employing very little stylization.

===Publication history===

==Versions==

&quot;Note: Musicologists are often not in agreement on the terms used to refer to the two authorial versions of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. Editors Pavel Lamm and Boris Asafyev used &quot;preliminary redaction&quot; and &quot;principal redaction&quot; for the 1st and 2nd versions, respectively, and David Lloyd-Jones designated them &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;definitive.&quot; This article, aiming for utmost objectivity, uses &quot;original&quot; and &quot;revised.&quot;&quot;

The differences in approach between the two authorial versions are sufficient as to constitute two distinct ideological conceptions, not two variations of a single plan.

1869 Original Version

The Original Version of 1869 is rarely heard. It is distinguished by its greater fidelity to Pushkin&#x27;s drama and its almost entirely male cast of soloists. It also conforms to the recitative opera style (opéra dialogué) of &quot;The Stone Guest&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot;, and to the ideals of kuchkist realism, which include fidelity to text, formlessness, and emphasis on the values of spoken theatre, especially through naturalistic declamation. The unique features of this version include:
*Pimen&#x27;s narrative of the scene of the murder of Dmitriy Ivanovich (Part 2, Scene 1)
*The original Terem Scene (Part 3), which follows Pushkin&#x27;s text more closely than does the revised version.
*The scene &#x27;The Cathedral of Vasiliy the Blessed&#x27; (the &#x27;St. Basil&#x27;s Scene&#x27;—Part 4, Scene 1)
The terse Terem Scene of the 1869 version and the unrelieved tension of the two subsequent and final scenes make this version more dramatically effective to some critics (e.g., Boris Asafyev).

1872 Revised Version

The Revised Version of 1872 represents a retreat from the ideals of Kuchkist realism, which had come to be associated with comedy, toward a more exalted, tragic tone, and a conventionally operatic style—a trend that would be continued in the composer&#x27;s next opera, &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. This version is longer, is richer in musical and theatrical variety, and balances naturalistic declamation with more lyrical vocal lines. The unique features of this version include:
*Two new offstage choruses of monks in the otherwise abbreviated Cell Scene (Act 1, Scene 1)
*The innkeeper&#x27;s &#x27;Song of the Drake&#x27; (Act 1, Scene 2)
*The revised Terem Scene (Act 2), which presents the title character in a more tragic and melodramatic light, and includes new songs and new musical themes borrowed from &quot;Salammbô&quot;
*The conventionally operatic &#x27;Polish&#x27; act (Act 3)
*The novel final scene of anarchy (the Kromï Scene—Act 4, Scene 2)
Mussorgsky rewrote the Terem Scene for the 1872 version, modifying the text, adding new songs and plot devices (the parrot and the clock), modifying the psychology of the title character, and virtually recomposing the music of the entire scene.

This version has made a strong comeback in recent years, and has become the dominant version.

1874 Piano Vocal Score

The Piano Vocal Score of 1874 was the first published form of the opera, and is essentially the 1872 version with some minor musical variants and small cuts. The 1874 vocal score does not constitute a &#x27;third version&#x27;, but rather a refinement of the 1872 Revised Version.

==Scene structure==

The distribution of scenes in the authorial versions is as follows:
Upon revising the opera, Mussorgsky initially replaced the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene with the Kromï Scene. However, on the suggestion of Vladimir Nikolsky, he transposed the order of the last two scenes, concluding the opera with the Kromï Scene rather than the Faceted Palace Scene. This gives the overall structure of the 1872 Revised Version the following symmetrical form:

Editions by other hands
* Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, 1896
* Rimsky-Korsakov, 1908
* Emilis Melngailis, 1924
* Dmitri Shostakovich, 1940
* Karol Rathaus, 1952

The Rimsky-Korsakov Version of 1908 has been the most traditional version over the last century, but has recently been almost entirely eclipsed by Mussorgsky&#x27;s Revised Version (1872). It resembles the Vocal Score of 1874, but the order of the last two scenes is reversed [see Versions by Other Hands in this article for more details].

==Roles==
&quot;Note:&quot; Roles designated with an asterisk (*) do not appear in the 1869 Original Version. &#x27;Yuródivïy&#x27; is often translated as &#x27;Simpleton&#x27; or &#x27;Idiot&#x27;. However, &#x27;Holy Fool&#x27; is a more accurate English equivalent. In other roles lists created by Mussorgsky, Pimen is designated a monk (инок), Grigoriy a novice (послушник), Rangoni a Cardinal (кардинал), Varlaam and Misail vagrant-monks (бродяги-чернецы), the Innkeeper a hostess (хозяйка), and Khrushchov a Voyevoda (воевода). Pimen, Grigoriy, Varlaam, and Misail were likely given non-clerical designations to satisfy the censor.

==Historical basis of the plot==

An understanding of the drama of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; may be facilitated by a basic knowledge of the historical events surrounding the Time of Troubles, the interregnum of relative anarchy following the end of the Ryurik Dynasty (1598) and preceding the Romanov Dynasty (1613). Key events are as follows:
* &quot;1584&quot; – Ivan IV &quot;The Terrible&quot;, the first Grand Prince of Muscovy to officially adopt the title &quot;Tsar&quot; (Caesar), dies. Ivan&#x27;s successor is his feeble son, Fyodor I, who cares only for spiritual matters and leaves the affairs of state to his capable brother-in-law, boyar Boris Godunov.
* &quot;1591&quot; – Ivan&#x27;s other son, the eight-year-old Tsarevich Dmitriy Ivanovich, dies under mysterious circumstances in Uglich. An investigation, ordered by Godunov and carried out by Prince Vasiliy Shuysky, determines that the Tsarevich, while playing with a knife, suffered an epileptic seizure, fell, and died from a self-inflicted wound to the throat. Dmitriy&#x27;s mother, Maria Nagaya, banished with him to Uglich by Godunov, claims he was assassinated. Rumors linking Boris to the death are circulated by his enemies.
* &quot;1598&quot; – Tsar Fyodor I dies. He is the last of the Ryurik Dynasty, who have ruled Russia for seven centuries. Patriarch Job of Moscow nominates Boris to succeed as Tsar, despite the rumors that Boris ordered the murder of Dmitriy. Boris agrees to accept the throne only if elected by the Zemsky Sobor. This the assembly does unanimously, and Boris is crowned the same year.
* &quot;1601&quot; – The Russian famine of 1601–1603 undermines Boris Godunov&#x27;s popularity and the stability of his administration.

* &quot;1604&quot; – A pretender to the throne appears in Poland, claiming to be Tsarevich Dmitriy, but believed to be in reality one Grigoriy Otrepyev. He gains the support of the Szlachta, magnates, and, upon conversion to Roman Catholicism, the Apostolic Nuncio Claudio Rangoni. Obtaining a force of soldiers, he marches on Moscow. The False Dmitriy&#x27;s retinue includes the Jesuits Lawicki and Czernikowski, and the monks Varlaam and Misail of the Chudov Monastery. Crossing into Russia, Dmitriy&#x27;s invasion force is joined by disaffected Cossacks. However, after a few victories, the campaign falters. Polish mercenaries mutiny and desert.
* &quot;1605&quot; – Boris dies of unknown causes. He is succeeded by his son, Fyodor II. The death of Boris gives new life to the campaign of the False Dmitriy. Boyars who have gone over to the Pretender murder Fyodor II and his mother. The False Dmitriy enters Moscow and is soon crowned. Prince Shuysky begins plotting against him.
* &quot;1606&quot; – The Russian boyars oppose Dmitriy&#x27;s Polish and Catholic alliances. He is murdered shortly after wedding Marina Mniszech, and is succeeded by Vasiliy Shuysky, now Vasiliy IV.
* &quot;1610&quot; – Battle of Klushino and Polish seizure and occupation of Moscow. Vasiliy IV is deposed, and dies two years later in a Polish prison. Another pretender claiming to be Dmitriy Ivanovich, False Dmitriy II, is murdered.
* &quot;1611&quot; – Yet a third pretender, False Dmitriy III, appears. He is captured and executed in 1612.
* &quot;1613&quot; – The Time of Troubles comes to a close with the accession of Mikhail Romanov, son of Fyodor Romanov, who had been persecuted under Boris Godunov&#x27;s reign.

Note: The culpability of Boris in the matter of Dmitriy&#x27;s death can neither be proved nor disproved. Karamzin accepted his responsibility as fact, and Pushkin and Mussorgsky after him assumed his guilt to be true, at least for the purpose of creating a tragedy in the mold of Shakespeare. Modern historians, however, tend to acquit Boris.

===Part 1 / Prologue===

&quot;Scene 1: The Courtyard of the Novodevichiy Monastery near Moscow (1598)&quot;

There is a brief introduction foreshadowing the &#x27;Dmitriy Motif&#x27;. The curtain opens on a crowd in the courtyard of the monastery, where the weary regent Boris Godunov has temporarily retired. Nikitich the police officer orders the assembled people to kneel. He goads them to clamor for Boris to accept the throne. They sing a chorus of supplication (&quot;To whom dost thou abandon us, our father?&quot;). The people are bewildered about their purpose and soon fall to bickering with each other, resuming their entreaties only when the policeman threatens them with his club. Their chorus reaches a feverish climax. Andrey Shchelkalov, the Secretary of the Duma, appears from inside the convent, informs the people that Boris still refuses the throne of Russia (&quot;Orthodox folk! The boyar is implacable!&quot;), and requests that they pray that he will relent. An approaching procession of pilgrims sings a hymn (&quot;Glory to Thee, Creator on high&quot;), exhorting the people to crush the spirit of anarchy in the land, take up holy icons, and go to meet the Tsar. They disappear into the monastery.
:[&quot;Original 1869 Version only:&quot; The people discuss the statements of the pilgrims. Many remain bewildered about the identity of this Tsar. The police officer interrupts their discussion, ordering them to appear the next day at the Moscow Kremlin. The people move on, stoically exclaiming &quot;if we are to wail, we might as well wail at the Kremlin&quot;.]
&quot;Scene 2: [Cathedral] Square in the Moscow Kremlin (1598).&quot;

The orchestral introduction is based on bell motifs. From the porch of the Cathedral of the Dormition, Prince Shuysky exhorts the people to glorify Tsar Boris. As the people sing a great chorus of praise (&quot;Like the beautiful sun in the sky, glory&quot;), a solemn procession of boyars exits the cathedral. The people kneel. Boris appears on the porch of the cathedral. The shouts of &quot;Glory!&quot; reach a climax and subside. Boris delivers a brief monologue (&quot;My soul grieves&quot;) betraying a feeling of ominous foreboding. He prays for God&#x27;s blessing, and hopes to be a good and just ruler. He invites the people to a great feast, and then proceeds to the Cathedral of the Archangel to kneel at the tombs of Russia&#x27;s past rulers. The people wish Boris a long life (&quot;Glory! Glory! Glory!&quot;). A crowd breaks toward the cathedral. The police officers struggle to maintain order. The people resume their shouts of &quot;Glory!&quot;

In this scene, Mussorgsky has been hailed as ahead of his time musically. His use of the whole tone scale, which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This technique was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and were believed to be almost too overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.

===Part 2 / Act 1===

&quot;Scene 1: Night. A Cell in the Chudov Monastery [within the Moscow Kremlin] (1603)&quot;

Pimen, a venerable monk, writes a chronicle (&quot;Yet one last tale&quot;) of Russian history. The young novice Grigoriy awakes from a horrible (and prophetic) dream, which he relates to Pimen, in which he climbed a high tower, was mocked by the people of Moscow, and fell. Pimen advises him to fast and pray. Grigoriy regrets that he retired so soon from worldly affairs to become a monk. He envies Pimen&#x27;s early life of adventure. Pimen speaks approvingly of Ivan the Terrible and his son Fyodor, who both exhibited great spiritual devotion, and draws a contrast with Boris, a regicide.
:[&quot;Original 1869 Version only:&quot; At Grigoriy&#x27;s request, Pimen tells the vivid details of the scene of the murder of Dmitriy Ivanovich, which he witnessed in Uglich.]
Upon discovering the similarity in age between himself and the murdered Tsarevich, Grigoriy conceives the idea of posing as the Pretender. As Pimen departs for Matins, Grigoriy declares that Boris shall escape neither the judgment of the people, nor that of God.
&quot;Scene 2: An Inn on the Lithuanian Border (1603)&quot;

There is a brief orchestral introduction based on three prominent themes from this scene.
::[&quot;Revised 1872 Version only:&quot; The Hostess enters and sings the &#x27;Song of the Drake&#x27; (&quot;I have caught a gray drake&quot;). It is interrupted towards the end by approaching voices].
The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who are dressed as monks and are begging for alms, and their companion Grigoriy, who is in secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song (&quot;So it was in the city of Kazan&quot;) of Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam&#x27;s suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam&#x27;s description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.

===Part 3 / Act 2===

&quot;The Interior of the Tsar&#x27;s Terem in the Moscow Kremlin (1605)&quot;

Kseniya (or Xenia), clutching a portrait of &quot;Prince Ivan&quot;, her betrothed who has died, sings a brief mournful aria (&quot;Where are you, my bridegroom?&quot;). Fyodor studies a great map of the Tsardom of Russia.
:[&quot;Revised 1872 Version only:&quot; Fyodor tries to console Kseniya and shows her the magic of the clock, once it starts chiming].
Kseniya&#x27;s nurse assures her that she will soon forget about &quot;Prince Ivan&quot;.
:[&quot;1872:&quot; The nurse and Fyodor attempt to cheer Kseniya up with some songs (&quot;A gnat was chopping wood&quot; and &quot;A little tale of this and that&quot;).]
Boris abruptly enters, briefly consoles Kseniya, and then sends her and her nurse to their own quarters. Fyodor shows Boris the map of Russia. After encouraging his son to resume his studies, Boris delivers a long and fine soliloquy (&quot;I have attained supreme power&quot;).

:[&quot;1872:&quot; At the end of this arioso he reveals that he has been disturbed by a vision of a bloody child begging for mercy. A commotion breaks out in his children&#x27;s quarters. Boris sends Fyodor to investigate.]
The boyar-in-attendance brings word of the arrival of Prince Shuysky, and reports a denunciation against him for his intrigues.
:[&quot;1872:&quot; Fyodor returns to relate a whimsical tale (&quot;Our little parrot was sitting&quot;) involving a pet parrot. Boris takes comfort in his son&#x27;s imagination and advises Fyodor, when he becomes Tsar, to beware of evil and cunning advisors such as Shuysky.]
Prince Shuysky now enters. Boris insults him, accusing him of conspiring with Pushkin, an ancestor of the poet. However, the prince brings grave tidings. A Pretender has appeared in Lithuania. Boris angrily demands to know his identity. Shuysky fears the Pretender might attract a following bearing the name of Tsarevich Dmitriy. Shaken by this revelation, Boris dismisses Fyodor. He orders Shuysky to seal the border with Lithuania, and, clearly on the edge of madness, asks Shuysky whether he has ever heard of dead children rising from their graves to question Tsars. Boris seeks assurance that the dead child the prince had seen in Uglich was really Dmitriy. He threatens Shuysky, if he dissembles, with a gruesome execution. The Prince describes the ghastly scene of Dmitriy&#x27;s murder in a brief and beautiful aria (&quot;In Uglich, in the cathedral&quot;). But he gives hints that a miracle (incorruptibility) has occurred. Boris begins choking with guilt and remorse, and gives a sign for Shuysky to depart.
:[&quot;1872:&quot; The chiming clock again begins working.]
Boris hallucinates (&quot;Hallucination or &#x27;Clock&#x27; Scene&quot;). The spectre of the dead Dmitriy reaches out to him. Addressing the apparition, he denies his responsibility for the crime: &quot;Begone, begone child! I am not thy murderer... the will of the people!&quot; He collapses, praying that God will have mercy on his guilty soul.

===Act 3 (The &#x27;Polish&#x27; Act) (1872 Version only)===

&quot;Scene 1: The Boudoir of Marina Mniszech in Sandomierz [Poland] (1604)&quot;

Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song (&quot;On the blue Vistula&quot;) to entertain Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom (&quot;How tediously and sluggishly&quot;), of Dmitriy, and of her thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans the wretched state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina&#x27;s promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina wonders why she should do this, Rangoni angrily insists that she stop short of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the dictates of the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her she is in the thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.
&quot;Scene 2: Mniszech&#x27;s Castle in Sandomierz. A Garden. A Fountain. A Moonlit Night (1604)&quot;

Woodwind and harp accompany a pensive version of the &#x27;Dmitriy Motif&#x27;. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina in the garden of her father&#x27;s castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina&#x27;s feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (&quot;Polonaise&quot;). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father&#x27;s throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet (&quot;O Tsarevich, I implore you&quot;). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.

===Part 4 / Act 4===
&quot;Scene 1 [1869 Version only]: The Square before the Cathedral of Vasiliy the Blessed in Moscow (1605)&quot;

A crowd mills about before the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen occasionally appear. A group of men enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father&#x27;s throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song (&quot;The moon is flying, the kitten is crying&quot;). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus (&quot;Benefactor father... Give us bread!&quot;), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy&#x27;s cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys&#x27; slaughter, just as he did in the case of the Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man&#x27;s prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament (&quot;Flow, flow, bitter tears!&quot;) about the fate of Russia.
&quot;Scene 2 [1869 Version] / Scene 1 [1872 version]: The Faceted Palace in the Moscow Kremlin (1605)&quot;

A session of the Duma is in progress.
:[&quot;Original 1869 Version only:&quot; The assembled boyars listen as Shchelkalov, reading the Tsar&#x27;s ukaz (edict), informs them of the Pretender&#x27;s claim to the throne of Russia, and requests they pass judgment on him.]
After some arguments, the boyars agree (&quot;Well, let&#x27;s put it to a vote, boyars&quot;), in a powerful chorus, that the Pretender and his sympathizers should be executed. Shuysky, whom they distrust, arrives with an interesting story. Upon leaving the Tsar&#x27;s presence, he observed Boris attempting to drive away the ghost of the dead Tsarevich, exclaiming: &quot;Begone, begone child!&quot; The boyars accuse Shuysky of spreading lies. However, a dishevelled Boris now enters, echoing Shuysky: &quot;Begone child!&quot; The boyars are horrified. After Boris comes to his senses, Shuysky informs him that a humble old man craves an audience. Pimen enters and tells the story (&quot;One day, at the evening hour&quot;) of a blind man who heard the voice of the Tsarevich in a dream. Dmitry instructed him to go to Uglich and pray at his grave, for he has become a miracle worker in heaven. The man did as instructed and regained his sight. This story is the final blow for Boris. He calls for his son, declares he is dying (&quot;Farewell, my son, I am dying&quot;), gives Fyodor final counsel, and prays for God&#x27;s blessing on his children. In a very dramatic scene (&quot;The bell! The funeral bell!&quot;), he dies.

&quot;Scene 2 [1872 Version only]: A Forest Glade near Kromï (1605)&quot;

Tempestuous music accompanies the entry of a crowd of vagabonds who have captured the boyar Khrushchov. The crowd taunts him, then bows in mock homage (&quot;Not a falcon flying in the heavens&quot;). The yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song (&quot;The moon is flying, the kitten is crying&quot;). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Varlaam and Misail are heard in the distance singing of the crimes of Boris and his henchmen (&quot;The sun and moon have gone dark&quot;). They enter. The crowd gets worked up to a frenzy (&quot;Our bold daring has broken free, gone on a rampage&quot;) denouncing Boris. Two Jesuits are heard in the distance chanting in Latin (&quot;Domine, Domine, salvum fac&quot;), praying that God will save Dmitriy. They enter. At the instigation of Varlaam and Misail, the vagabonds prepare to hang the Jesuits, who appeal to the Holy Virgin for aid. Processional music heralds the arrival of Dmitriy and his forces. Varlaam and Misail glorify him (&quot;Glory to thee, Tsarevich!&quot;) along with the crowd. The Pretender calls those persecuted by Godunov to his side. He frees Khrushchov, and calls on all to march on Moscow. All exeunt except the yuródivïy, who sings a plaintive song (&quot;Flow, flow, bitter tears!&quot;) of the arrival of the enemy and of woe to Russia.

==Critical reception==
Russian opera of the early 1870s was dominated by Western European works—mainly Italian. The domestic product was regarded with skepticism and sometimes hostility. The playwright Tikhonov wrote in 1898:

As the most daring and innovative member of the Mighty Handful, Mussorgsky frequently became the target of conservative critics and rival composers, and was often derided for his supposedly clumsy and crude musical idiom. After the premiere of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, influential critic Herman Laroche wrote:
Reviews of the premiere performance of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; were for the most part hostile. Some critics dismissed the work as &quot;chaotic&quot; and &quot;a cacophony&quot;. Even his friends Mily Balakirev and César Cui, leading members of the Mighty Handful, minimized his accomplishment. Unable to overlook Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;trespasses against the conventional musical grammar of the time&quot;, they failed to recognize the giant step forward in musical and dramatic expression that &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; represented. Cui betrayed Mussorgsky in a notoriously scathing review of the premiere performance:
Although he found much to admire, particularly the Inn Scene and the Song of the Parrot, he reproved the composer for a poorly constructed libretto, finding the opera to exhibit a lack of cohesion between scenes. He claimed that Mussorgsky was so deficient in the ability to write instrumental music that he dispensed with composing a prelude, and that he had &quot;borrowed the cheap method of characterization by leitmotives from Wagner.&quot;

Other composers were even more censorious. Pyotr Tchaikovsky wrote in a letter to his brother Modest:
Of the critics who evaluated the new opera, only the 19-year-old critic Vladimir Baskin defended Mussorgsky&#x27;s skill as a composer. Writing under the pen name &quot;Foma Pizzicato&quot;, Baskin wrote,
Although &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; is usually praised for its originality, dramatic choruses, sharply delineated characters, and for the powerful psychological portrayal of Tsar Boris, it has received an inordinate amount of criticism for technical shortcomings: weak or faulty harmony, part-writing, and orchestration. Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov said:

The perception that &quot;Boris&quot; needed correction due to Mussorgsky&#x27;s poverty of technique prompted Rimsky-Korsakov to revise it after his death. His edition supplanted the composer&#x27;s Revised Version of 1872 in Russia, and launched the work abroad, remaining the preferred edition for some 75 years (see Versions by Other Hands in this article for more details). For decades, critics and scholars pressing for the performance of Mussorgsky&#x27;s own versions fought an often losing battle against the conservatism of conductors and singers, who, raised on the plush Rimsky-Korsakov edition, found it impossible to adapt to Mussorgsky&#x27;s comparatively unrefined and bleak original scores.

Recently, however, a new appreciation for the rugged individuality of Mussorgsky&#x27;s style has resulted in increasing performances and recording of his original versions. Musicologist Gerald Abraham wrote:

==Performance practice==
A conflation of the 1869 and 1872 versions is often made when staging or recording &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. This typically involves choosing the 1872 version and augmenting it with the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene from the 1869 version. This practice is popular because it conserves a maximum amount of music, it gives the title character another appearance on stage, and because in the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene Boris is challenged by the Yurodivïy, the embodiment of his conscience.

However, because the composer transferred the episode of the Yurodivïy and the urchins from the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene to the Kromï Scene when revising the opera, restoring the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene to its former location creates a problem of duplicate episodes, which can be partially solved by cuts. Most performances that follow this practice cut the robbery of the Yurodivïy in the Kromï Scene, but duplicate his lament that ends each scene.

The Rimsky-Korsakov Version is often augmented with the Ippolitov-Ivanov reorchestration of the St. Basil&#x27;s Scene (commissioned by the Bolshoy Theatre in 1925, composed in 1926, and first performed in 1927).

Conductors may elect to restore the cuts the composer himself made in writing the 1872 version [see Versions in this article for more details]. The 1997 Mariinsky Theatre recording under Valery Gergiev is the first and only to present the 1869 Original Version side by side with the 1872 Revised Version, and, it would seem, attempts to set a new standard for musicological authenticity. However, although it possesses many virtues, the production fails to scrupulously separate the two versions, admitting elements of the 1872 version into the 1869 recording, and failing to observe cuts the composer made in the 1872 version.

Critics argue that the practice of restoring the St. Basil&#x27;s scene and all the cuts that Mussorgsky made when revising the opera—that is, creating a &quot;supersaturated&quot; version—can have negative consequences, believing that it destroys the symmetrical scene structure of the Revised Version, it undermines the composer&#x27;s carefully devised and subtle system of leitmotiv deployment, and results in the overexposure of the Dmitriy motive.

==Versions by other hands==

===Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov (1896)===

After Mussorgsky&#x27;s death in 1881, his friend Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov undertook to put his scores in order, completing and editing &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; for publication (1883), reconstructing &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; (1886), and &quot;correcting&quot; some songs. Next, he turned to &quot;Boris&quot;.

He experimented first with the Polonaise, temporarily scoring it for a Wagner-sized orchestra in 1889. In 1892 he revised the Coronation Scene, and, working from the 1874 Vocal Score, completed the remainder of the opera, although with significant cuts, by 1896.

===Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov (1908)===
In the spring of 1906, Rimsky-Korsakov revised and orchestrated several passages omitted in the 1896 revision:
#&quot;Pimen&#x27;s story of Tsars Ivan and Fyodor&quot; (Cell Scene)
#&quot;Over the map of the Muscovite land&quot; (Terem Scene)
#&quot;The story of the parrot&quot; (Terem Scene)
#&quot;The chiming clock&quot; (Terem Scene)
#&quot;The scene of the False Dmitriy with Rangoni at the fountain&quot; (Fountain Scene)
#&quot;The False Dmitriy&#x27;s soliloquy after the Polonaise&quot; (Fountain Scene)

Rimsky-Korsakov compiled a new edition in 1908, this time restoring the cuts, and making some significant changes:
* He omitted the end of the Novodievichy Scene, so that it ends with the Pilgrims&#x27; Chorus. (As does the 1874 vocal score.)
* He added some music to the Coronation Scene, because producer Sergey Dyagilev wanted more stage spectacle for the Paris premiere. The additions are a 40 bar insert placed before Boris&#x27;s monologue, and a 16 bar insert following it, both of which are based on the bell motifs that open the scene and on the &quot;Slava&quot; theme.
* He altered the dynamics of the end of the Inn Scene, making the conclusion loud and bombastic, perhaps because he was dissatisfied that all of Mussorgsky&#x27;s scenes with the exception of the Coronation Scene end quietly.
* He similarly altered the conclusion of the Fountain Scene, replacing Mussorgsky&#x27;s quiet moonlit trio with a grand peroration combining the 6 note descending theme that opens the scene, the 5 note rhythmic figure that opens the Polonaise, and the lusty cries of &quot;Vivat!&quot; that close the Polonaise.

These revisions clearly went beyond mere reorchestration. He made substantial modifications to harmony, melody, dynamics, etc., even changing the order of scenes.

Rimsky-Korsakov immediately came under fire from some critics for altering &quot;Boris&quot;, particularly in France, where his revision was introduced. The defense usually made by his supporters was that without his ministrations, Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera would have faded from the repertory due to difficulty in appreciating his raw and uncompromising idiom. Therefore, Rimsky-Korsakov was justified in making improvements to keep the work alive and increase the public&#x27;s awareness of Mussorgsky&#x27;s melodic and dramatic genius.

The Rimsky-Korsakov version remained the one usually performed in Russia, even after Mussorgsky&#x27;s earthier original (1872) gained a place in Western opera houses. The Bolshoy Theatre has only recently embraced the composer&#x27;s own version.

===Dmitriy Shostakovich (1940)===

Dmitriy Shostakovich worked on &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1939–1940 on a commission from the Bolshoy Theatre for a new production of the opera. A conflation of the 1869 and 1872 versions had been published by Pavel Lamm and aroused keen interest in the piece. However, it did not erase doubts as to whether Mussorgsky&#x27;s own orchestration was playable. The invasion of Russia by Nazi Germany prevented this production from taking place, and it was not until 1959 that Shostakovich&#x27;s version of the score was premiered.

To Shostakovich, Mussorgsky was successful with solo instrumental timbres in soft passages but did not fare as well with louder moments for the whole orchestra. Shostakovich explained:

Shostakovich confined himself largely to reorchestrating the opera, and was more respectful of the composer&#x27;s unique melodic and harmonic style. However, Shostakovich greatly increased the contributions of the woodwind and especially brass instruments to the score, a significant departure from the practice of Mussorgsky, who exercised great restraint in his instrumentation, preferring to utilize the individual qualities of these instruments for specific purposes. Shostakovich also aimed for a greater symphonic development, wanting the orchestra to do more than simply accompany the singers.

Shostakovich remembered Alexander Glazunov telling him how Mussorgsky himself played scenes from &quot;Boris&quot; at the piano. Mussorgsky&#x27;s renditions, according to Glazunov, were brilliant and powerful—qualities Shostakovich felt did not come through in the orchestration of much of &quot;Boris&quot;. Shostakovich, who had known the opera since his student days at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, assumed that Mussorgsky&#x27;s orchestral intentions were correct but that Mussorgsky simply could not realize them:

One of those &quot;old shore&quot; moments was the large monastery bell in the scene in the monk&#x27;s cell. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov both use the gong. To Shostakovich, this was too elemental and simplistic to be effective dramatically, since this bell showed the atmosphere of the monk&#x27;s estrangement. &quot;When the bell tolls,&quot; Shostakovich reportedly told Solomon Volkov, &quot;it&#x27;s a reminder that there are powers mightier than man, that you can&#x27;t escape the judgment of history.&quot; Therefore, Shostakovich reorchestrated the bell&#x27;s tolling by the simultaneous playing of seven instruments—bass clarinet, double bassoon, French horns, gong, harps, piano, and double basses (at an octave). To Shostakovich, this combination of instruments sounded more like a real bell.

Shostakovich admitted Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s orchestration was more colorful than his own and used brighter timbres. However, he also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov chopped up the melodic lines too much and, by blending melody and subvoices, may have subverted much of Mussorgsky&#x27;s intent. Shostakovich also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov did not use the orchestra flexibly enough to follow the characters&#x27; mood changes, instead making the orchestra calmer, more balanced.

===Igor Buketoff (1997)===
The American conductor Igor Buketoff created a version in which he removed most of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s additions and reorchestrations, and fleshed out some other parts of Mussorgsky&#x27;s original orchestration. This version had its first performance in 1997 at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, under Valery Gergiev.

<text>Waylon Arnold Jennings (June 15, 1937 – February 13, 2002) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. He is considered one of the pioneers of the outlaw movement in country music.

Jennings started playing guitar at age eight and performed at fourteen on KVOW radio, after which he formed his first band, the Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and worked as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings&#x27;s first recording session, a cover of Jole Blon, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P. &quot;the Big Bopper&quot; Richardson and Ritchie Valens.

Jennings then returned to Texas, taking several years off from music before eventually moving to Arizona and forming a rockabilly club band, the Waylors, which became the house band at &quot;JD&#x27;s&quot;, a club in Tempe, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&amp;M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor in 1965. In 1972 he acquired Neil Reshen as his manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts. After he gained creative control from RCA Records, he released the critically acclaimed albums &quot;Lonesome, On&#x27;ry and Mean&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot;, followed by the hit albums &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready for the Country&quot;.

During the 1970s, Jennings drove outlaw country. With Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter he recorded country music&#x27;s first platinum album, &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;. It was followed by another platinum album, a first for any solo artist in country music, &quot;Ol&#x27; Waylon&quot;, and the hit song &quot;Luckenbach, Texas&quot;. He was featured on the 1978 album &quot;White Mansions&quot;, performed by various artists documenting the lives of Confederates during the Civil War. He appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street and a stint as the balladeer on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, composing and singing its theme song and narrating the show.

Jennings struggled with cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup the Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album &quot;Will the Wolf Survive&quot;. He has been named as one of the innovators of progressive country.

Jennings toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, health problems limited his appearances. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the Academy of Country Music.

== Early life ==
Jennings was born on June 15, 1937, on the J. W. Bittner farm near Littlefield, Texas. He was the son of Lorene Beatrice (née Shipley, 1919–2006) and William Albert Jennings (1911–1968). The Jennings family line descended from Irish and Black-Dutch. He was the oldest of four children, followed by Tommy Jennings (1941–2019), James Jennings, and Bo Jennings (1950–2018). The Shipley line descended from his great-grandfather, a farmer and lawman from Tennessee, with Jennings adding that &quot;along the way, a lot of Indian blood mixed in,&quot; including Cherokee and Comanche families.

The name on Jennings&#x27;s birth certificate was Wayland. It was changed after a Baptist preacher visited his parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the Wayland Baptist College, now Wayland Baptist University, in Plainview, Texas. Lorene Jennings, who was Church of Christ and had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like Waylon. It sounded so corny and hillbilly, but it&#x27;s been good to me, and I&#x27;m pretty well at peace with it now.&quot; After working as a laborer on the Bittner farm, Jennings&#x27;s father moved the family to Littlefield and established a retail creamery.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings in music ===
When Jennings was 8, his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune &quot;Thirty Pieces of Silver&quot;. Jennings used to practice with his relatives&#x27; instruments until his mother bought him a used Stella guitar, and later ordered a Harmony Patrician. Early influences included Bob Wills, Floyd Tillman, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams, Carl Smith, and Elvis Presley.

Beginning with performing at family gatherings, Jennings played his first public concert at the Youth Center with Anthony Bonanno, followed by appearances at the local Jaycees and Lions Clubs. He won a talent show at Channel 13, in Lubbock, singing &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. He later made frequent performances at the Palace Theater in Littlefield, during local talent night.

At age 14, Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield, Texas. Owner J. B. McShan, along with Emil Macha, recorded Jennings&#x27;s performance. McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30-minute program. Following his performance on the show, Jennings formed his own band. He asked Macha to play bass for him and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form the Texas Longhorns. The style of the band—a mixture of country and western and bluegrass music—was often not well received.
After several disciplinary infractions, 16-year-old Jennings was convinced to drop out of Littlefield High School by the superintendent. Upon leaving school, he worked for his father in the family store and also took temporary jobs. Jennings felt that music would turn into his career. The next year he, along with the Texas Longhorns, recorded demo versions of the songs &quot;Stranger in My Home&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;ll Be a New Day&quot; at KFYO radio in Lubbock. Meanwhile, he drove a truck for the Thomas Land Lumber Company, and a cement truck for the Roberts Lumber Company. Tired of the owner, Jennings quit after a minor driving accident. Jennings, and other local musicians, often performed at country radio station KDAV. During this time he met Buddy Holly at a Lubbock restaurant. The two often met during local shows, and Jennings began to attend Holly&#x27;s performances on KDAV&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Party&quot;.

In addition to performing on air for KVOW, Jennings started to work as a DJ in 1956 and moved to Lubbock. His program ran from 4:00 in the afternoon to 10:00 in the evening, filled with two hours of country classics, two of current country, and two of mixed recordings. The latter included early rock-and-roll stars such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The owner reprimanded Jennings for his selection, and after playing two Little Richard records in a row Jennings was fired.

During his time at KVOW Jennings was visited by DJ Sky Corbin of KLVT in Levelland. Corbin was impressed with his voice, and decided to visit Jennings at the station after hearing him sing a jingle to the tune of Hank Snow&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot;. Jennings expressed his struggle to live on a $50-a-week salary. Corbin invited Jennings to visit KLVT, where he eventually took Corbin&#x27;s position when it opened. The Corbin family later purchased KLLL, in Lubbock. They changed the format of the station to country, becoming the main competition of KDAV. The Corbins hired Jennings as the station&#x27;s first DJ.
Jennings produced commercials and created jingles with the rest of the DJs. As their popularity increased, the DJs made public appearances. Jennings&#x27;s events included live performances. During one performance, Holly&#x27;s father, L. O. Holley, approached them with his son&#x27;s latest record and asked them to play it at the station. Holley mentioned his son&#x27;s intention to start producing artists himself, and Corbin recommended Jennings. After returning from his tour of England Buddy Holly visited KLLL.

Holly took Jennings as his first artist. He outfitted him with new clothes, and worked with him to improve his image. He arranged a session for Jennings at Norman Petty&#x27;s recording studios in Clovis, New Mexico. On September 10, Jennings recorded the songs &quot;Jole Blon&quot; and &quot;When Sin Stops (Love Begins)&quot; with Holly and Tommy Allsup on guitars and saxophonist King Curtis. Holly then hired Jennings to play bass for him during his &quot;Winter Dance Party Tour&quot;.

=== Winter Dance Party Tour ===
Before the tour, Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings&#x27;s radio station in December 1958. Jennings and Sky Corbin performed the hand-claps to Holly&#x27;s tune &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;. Jennings and Holly soon left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly&#x27;s apartment by Washington Square Park prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the General Artists Corporation, which organized the tour. They later took a train to Chicago to join the band.
The Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, leading to drummer Carl Bunch being hospitalized for frostbite on his toes. Holly made the decision to find another means of transportation.

Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, for himself, Jennings, and Tommy Allsup, to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Following the Clear Lake show (which ended around midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens, while Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, known as the Big Bopper, who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size.

When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly, a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued, and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow: Holly jokingly told Jennings, &quot;Well, I hope your ol&#x27; bus freezes up!&quot; Jennings jokingly replied, &quot;Well, I hope your ol&#x27; plane crashes!&quot; Under 90 minutes later, shortly after 1:00 am on February 3, 1959, Holly&#x27;s charter plane crashed into a cornfield outside Mason City, instantly killing all on board.

Later that morning, Jennings&#x27;s family heard on the radio that &quot;Buddy Holly and his band had been killed.&quot; After calling his family, Jennings called Sky Corbin at KLLL from Fargo to confirm that he had not been aboard the plane. The General Artists Corporation promised to pay for first-class tickets for Jennings and the band to attend Holly&#x27;s funeral in Lubbock in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead. After the first show, they were initially denied their payment by the venue, but after Jennings&#x27;s persistence, they were paid. The flights were never paid for, and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks, featuring Jennings as the lead singer. They were paid less than half of the original agreed salary, and upon returning to New York, Jennings put Holly&#x27;s guitar and amplifier in a locker in Grand Central Terminal and mailed the keys to Maria Elena Holly. Then he returned to Lubbock.

In the early 1960s, Jennings wrote and recorded &quot;The Stage (Stars in Heaven)&quot;, a tribute to Valens, the Big Bopper, and Holly, as well as Eddie Cochran, a young musician who died in a road accident a year after the plane crash.

For decades afterward, Jennings repeatedly stated that he felt responsible for the crash that killed Holly. This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of his career.

&quot;Jole Blon&quot; was released on Brunswick in March 1959 with limited success. Now unemployed, Jennings returned to KLLL. Deeply affected by Holly&#x27;s death, Jennings&#x27;s performance at the station worsened. He left the station after he was denied a raise, and later worked briefly for the competition, KDAV.

=== Phoenix ===
Due to his father-in-law&#x27;s illness, Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas. While his family lived back in Littlefield, Jennings found a job briefly at KOYL in Odessa, Texas. He moved with his family to Coolidge, Arizona, where his wife Maxine&#x27;s sister lived. He found a job performing at the Galloping Goose bar, where he was heard by Earl Perrin, who offered him a spot on KCKY. Jennings also played during the intermission at drive-in theaters and in bars. After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in Phoenix, he was approached by two contractors (Paul Pristo and Dean Coffman) who were building a club in Scottsdale for James (Jimmy) D. Musil, called JD&#x27;s. Musil engaged Jennings as his main artist and designed the club around his act.

Jennings formed his backing band, the Waylors, with bassist Paul Foster, guitarist Jerry Gropp, and drummer Richie Albright. The band soon earned a strong local fan base at JD&#x27;s, where Jennings developed his rock-influenced style of country music that defined him on his later career.
In 1961, Jennings signed a recording contract with Trend Records, and experienced moderate success with his single, &quot;Another Blue Day&quot;. His friend Don Bowman took demos of Jennings to Jerry Moss, who at the time was starting A&amp;M Records with associate Herb Alpert. In July 1963 Jennings signed a contract with A&amp;M that granted him 5% of record sales. At A&amp;M, he recorded &quot;Love Denied&quot; backed with &quot;Rave On&quot;, and Ian Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; backed with &quot;Just to Satisfy You&quot;. He followed up by recording demos of &quot;The Twelfth of Never&quot;, &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, and also produced the single &quot;Sing the Girls a Song, Bill&quot;, backed with &quot;The Race Is On&quot;. The singles were released between April and October 1964.

Jennings&#x27;s records found little success at A&amp;M, because the label was releasing mostly folk music rather than country at the time. He had a few regional hits around Phoenix, due to local radio airplay with &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; and &quot;Just To Satisfy You&quot;, which was co-written with Bowman. Meanwhile, he recorded an album on BAT records produced by James Musil and engineered by Jack Miller, called &quot;JD&#x27;s Waylon Jennings&quot; on the front of the album, and &quot;Waylon Jennings at JD&#x27;s&quot; on the back side. After 500 copies were sold at the club another 500 were pressed by the Sounds label. He also played lead guitar for Patsy Montana on a 1964 album.

Singer Bobby Bare heard Jennings&#x27;s &quot;Just to Satisfy You&quot; on his car radio while passing through Phoenix, and recorded it and &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;. After stopping in Phoenix to attend a Jennings performance at JD&#x27;s, Bare called Chet Atkins, head of the RCA Victor studios in Nashville, and suggested he sign Jennings. Unsure after being offered a deal with RCA if he should quit his gig at JD&#x27;s and relocate to Nashville, he sought the advice of RCA artist and friend Willie Nelson, who had attended one of Jennings&#x27;s shows. Upon hearing how well financially Jennings was doing at JD&#x27;s Nelson suggested he stay in Phoenix.

Jennings then asked Herb Alpert to release him from his contract with A&amp;M, which Alpert did. Later, after Jennings became successful, A&amp;M compiled all of his singles and unreleased recordings and issued them as an album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice&quot;. Atkins formally signed Jennings to RCA Victor in 1965. In August Jennings made his first appearance on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Songs chart with &quot;That&#x27;s the Chance I&#x27;ll Have to Take&quot;.

===The Nashville Sound===

In 1966, Jennings released his debut RCA Victor album &quot;Folk-Country&quot;, followed by &quot;Leavin&#x27; Town&quot; and &quot;Nashville Rebel&quot;. &quot;Leavin&#x27; Town&quot; resulted in significant chart success as the first two singles &quot;Anita, You&#x27;re Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Time to Bum Again&quot; both peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. The album&#x27;s third single, a cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;(That&#x27;s What You Get) For Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;, peaked at no. 9, Jennings&#x27;s first top 10 single. &quot;Nashville Rebel&quot; was the soundtrack to an independent film, &quot;The Nashville Rebel&quot;, starring Jennings. The single &quot;Green River&quot; charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles at no. 11.
In 1967, Jennings released a hit single, &quot;Just to Satisfy You&quot;. During an interview, Jennings remarked that the song was a &quot;pretty good example&quot; of the influence of his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music. Jennings produced mid-chart albums that sold well, including 1967&#x27;s &quot;Just to Satisfy You&quot;, which included the hit single. Jennings&#x27;s singles enjoyed success. &quot;The Chokin&#x27; Kind&quot; peaked at number eight on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles in 1967, while &quot;Only Daddy That&#x27;ll Walk the Line&quot; hit number two the following year. In 1969, his collaboration with the Kimberlys on the single &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group. His single &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; reached number three at the Hot Country Singles chart by the end of the year.

During this time, Jennings rented an apartment in Nashville with singer Johnny Cash. Jennings and Cash were both managed by &quot;Lucky&quot; Moeller&#x27;s booking agency Moeller Talent, Inc. The tours organized by the agency were unproductive, with the artists being booked to venues located far from each other in close dates. After paying for the accommodation and travel expenditures, Jennings was frequently forced to request advances from the agency or RCA Victor to make the next venue. While playing 300 days on the road, Jennings&#x27;s debt increased, and along with it his consumption of amphetamine. He believed himself to be &quot;trapped on the circuit&quot;.

In 1972, Jennings released &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot;. The single that headlined the album became a hit for Jennings, and was his first approach to outlaw country. Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band, the Waylors, a practice that was not encouraged by powerful Nashville producers, who favored the Nashville sound produced by a roster of experienced local studio musicians. The music style publicized as &quot;countrypolitan&quot; was characterized by orchestral arrangements and the absence of most traditional country music instruments. The producers did not let Jennings play his own guitar or select material to record. Jennings felt limited by Nashville&#x27;s lack of artistic freedom.

=== Outlaw country ===
By 1972, after the release of &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot;, his recording contract was nearing an end. Upon contracting hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Sick and frustrated with the Nashville music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue, suggesting he hire Neil Reshen as his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a $25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Reshen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings $5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing the offer with Reshen, he rejected it and hired Reshen.
Reshen started to renegotiate Jennings&#x27;s recording and touring contracts. At a meeting in a Nashville airport Jennings introduced Reshen to Willie Nelson. By the end of the meeting Reshen had become Nelson&#x27;s manager as well. Jennings&#x27;s new deal included a $75,000 advance and artistic control. Reshen advised Jennings to keep the beard that he had grown in the hospital, to match the image of outlaw country.

By 1973 Nelson found success with Atlantic Records. Now based in Austin, Texas, he began to attract rock and roll fans to his shows, which gained him notice in its press. Atlantic Records made a bid to sign Jennings, but Nelson&#x27;s rise to popularity persuaded RCA to renegotiate with him before losing another potential star.

In 1973, Jennings released &quot;Lonesome, On&#x27;ry and Mean&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot;, the first albums recorded and released under his creative control. This heralded a major turning point for Jennings, resulting in his most critically and commercially successful years. More hit albums followed with &quot;This Time&quot; and &quot;The Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot;, both released in 1974. The title tracks of both albums topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country singles chart, with the self-penned &quot;This Time&quot; becoming Jennings&#x27;s first no. 1 single. &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot;, released in 1975, included the no. 1 single &quot;Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way&quot;, and became his first album to be certified gold by the RIAA; it was also the first of six consecutive solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher. In 1976 Jennings released &quot;Are You Ready for the Country&quot;. Jennings wanted Los Angeles producer Ken Mansfield to produce the record, but RCA initially balked. Jennings and the Waylors traveled to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at Jennings&#x27;s own expense. A month later, Jennings returned to Nashville and presented the master tape to Chet Atkins, who, after listening to it, decided to release it. The album reached number 1 &quot;Billboard&quot;″s country albums three times the same year, topping the charts for 10 weeks. It was named country album of the year in 1976 by &quot;Record World&quot; magazine and was certified gold by the RIAA.

In 1976, RCA released the compilation album &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;, with Jennings, Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jennings&#x27;s wife, Jessi Colter. The album was the first country music album certified platinum. The following year, RCA issued &quot;Ol&#x27; Waylon&quot;, an album that produced a hit duet with Nelson, &quot;Luckenbach, Texas&quot;. The album &quot;Waylon and Willie&quot; followed in 1978, producing the hit single &quot;Mammas Don&#x27;t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys&quot;. Jennings released &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Been Crazy&quot;, also in 1978. The same year, at the peak of his success, Jennings began to feel limited by the outlaw movement. Jennings referred to the overexploitation of the image in the song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Think This Outlaw Bit&#x27;s Done Got Out of Hand?&quot;, claiming that the movement had become a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot;. In 1979, RCA released Jennings first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, which was certified gold the same year, and quintuple platinum in 2002.

Also in 1979, Jennings joined the cast of the CBS series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as the Balladeer, the narrator. The only episode to feature him as an actor was &quot;Welcome, Waylon Jennings&quot;, during the seventh season. Jennings played himself, presented as an old friend of the Duke family. For the show he also wrote and sang the theme song &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Boys&quot;, which became the biggest hit of his career. Released as a single in promotion with the show, it became Jennings&#x27;s 12th single to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Singles chart. It was also a crossover hit, peaking at no. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

=== Later years ===

In the mid-1980s, Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Jennings formed a successful group called the Highwaymen. Aside from his work with the Highwaymen, Jennings released a gold album &quot;WWII&quot; (1982) with Willie Nelson.

In 1985, Jennings joined with USA for Africa to record &quot;We Are the World&quot;, but he left the studio because of a dispute over the song&#x27;s lyrics that were to be sung in Swahili. By this time, his sales had decreased. After the release of &quot;Sweet Mother Texas&quot;, Jennings signed with MCA Records. His debut release with the label, &quot;Will the Wolf Survive&quot; (1985), peaked at number one in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Country albums in 1986. Jennings&#x27;s initial success tailed off, and in 1990, he signed with Epic Records. His first release, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, became his final top 10 album.

Also in 1985, he made a cameo appearance in the live-action children&#x27;s film &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;. In the movie, he plays a turkey farm truck driver who gives Big Bird a lift. He also sings one of the film&#x27;s songs, entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Road Too Long&quot;. In 1993, in collaboration with Rincom Children&#x27;s Entertainment, Jennings recorded an album of children&#x27;s songs, &quot;Cowboys, Sisters, Rascals &amp; Dirt&quot;, which included &quot;Shooter&#x27;s Theme&quot;, a tribute to his 14-year-old with the theme of &quot;a friend of mine&quot;.

As his record sales and radio play declined through the 1990s, Jennings continued to draw large crowds to his live performances. In 1994 Jennings made a small appearance in the movie &quot;Maverick&quot;, with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner.

In 1996, Jennings released his album, &quot;Right for the Time&quot;. In 1997, after the &quot;Lollapalooza&quot; tour, he decreased his tour schedule to focus on his family. In 1998, Jennings teamed up with Bare, Jerry Reed, and Mel Tillis to form the Old Dogs. The group recorded a double album of songs by Shel Silverstein.

In mid-1999, Jennings assembled what he referred to as his &quot;hand-picked dream team&quot; and formed Waylon &amp; the Waymore Blues Band. Consisting primarily of former Waylors, the 13-member group performed concerts from 1999 to 2001. As his health declined, Jennings decided to end his touring career. In January 2000, Jennings recorded what became his final album at Nashville&#x27;s Ryman Auditorium, &quot;Never Say Die: Live&quot;.

== Music style and image ==

Jennings&#x27;s music was characterized by his powerful rough-edged singing voice, phrasing and texture.
He was also recognized for his &quot;spanky-twang&quot; guitar style. To create his sound, he used a pronounced &#x27;phaser&#x27; effect (see &#x27;Modulation Effects&#x27;: below) plus a mixture of thumb and fingers during the rhythmic parts, while using picks for the lead runs. He combined hammer-on and pull-off riffs, with eventual upper-fret double stops and modulation effects. Jennings played a 1953 Fender Telecaster, a used guitar that was a gift from the Waylors. Jennings&#x27;s bandmates adorned his guitar with a distinctive leather cover that featured a black background with a white floral work. Jennings further customized it by filing down the frets to lower the strings on the neck to obtain the slapping sound. Among his other guitars, Jennings used a 1950 Fender Broadcaster from the mid-1970s, until he gave it to guitarist Reggie Young in 1993. The leather covers of his guitars were carved by leather artist Terry Lankford.

Jennings&#x27;s signature image was characterized by his long hair and beard, and black hat and black leather vest he wore during his appearances.

== Personal life ==
Jennings was married four times and had six children. He married Maxine Caroll Lawrence in 1956 at age 18, with whom he had four children. Jennings married Lynne Jones on December 10, 1962, and they adopted a daughter, but divorced in 1967. He married Barbara Elizabeth Rood the same year. He composed the song &quot;This Time&quot; about the trials and tribulations of his marriages and divorces, it went on to become his first number 1 chart-topping song upon release in 1974.

Jennings married country singer Jessi Colter in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 26, 1969. Colter had a daughter, Jennifer, from her previous marriage to Duane Eddy. The couple had a son in 1979, Waylon Albright, known as Shooter Jennings. In the early 1980s, Colter and Jennings nearly divorced due to his abuse of drugs and alcohol. In 1990, after he stopped touring, Jennings earned a GED to set an example to Shooter about the importance of education. He studied for his GED by watching tapes of GED on TV programs from the Kentucky Educational Television network on his tour bus in 1989.

=== Addiction and recovery ===
Jennings started to consume amphetamines while he lived with Johnny Cash during the mid-1960s. Jennings later stated, &quot;Pills were the artificial energy on which Nashville ran around the clock.&quot;

In 1977, Jennings was arrested by federal agents for conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. A private courier warned the Drug Enforcement Administration about the package sent to Jennings by a New York colleague that contained 27 grams of cocaine. The DEA and the police searched Jennings&#x27;s recording studio but found no evidence because, while they were waiting for a search warrant, Jennings disposed of the drug. The charges were later dropped and Jennings was released. The episode was recounted in Jennings&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Think This Outlaw Bit&#x27;s Done Got Out of Hand&quot;.

During the early 1980s, his cocaine addiction intensified. Jennings claimed to have spent $1,500 () a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5 million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to do so, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings leased a home in the Phoenix area and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine, claiming that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to finally do so.

== Illness and death ==

Decades of smoking and drug use took a large toll on Jennings&#x27;s health in addition to obesity and a poor diet, which resulted in his developing Type 2 diabetes. In 1988, four years after quitting cocaine, he ended his six-pack-a-day smoking habit. That same year, he underwent heart bypass surgery. By 2000, his diabetes worsened, and the pain reduced his mobility to the point where he was forced to end most touring. That same year, he underwent surgery to improve his left leg&#x27;s blood circulation. In December 2001, his left foot was amputated at a hospital in Phoenix.

On February 13, 2002, Jennings died in his sleep from complications of diabetes at his home in Chandler, Arizona, aged 64. He was buried in the City of Mesa Cemetery in nearby Mesa. At his memorial service on February 15, Jessi Colter sang &quot;Storms Never Last&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Between 1965 and 1991, ninety-six Jennings singles appeared on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles chart and sixteen topped it. Between 1966 and 1995 fifty-four of his albums charted on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Country Albums, with 11 reaching Number 1.

In October 2001, Jennings was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, but he was unable to attend the ceremony due to the pain caused by his diabetes. On July 6, 2006, Jennings was inducted to Guitar Center&#x27;s RockWalk in Hollywood, California. Jessi Colter attended the ceremony along with Kris Kristofferson, who was inducted on the same day. On June 20, 2007, Jennings was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the Academy of Country Music. During the ceremony, Ray Scott sang &quot;Rainy Day Woman&quot; and the award was accepted by Buddy Jennings.

Jennings&#x27;s music had an influence on numerous artists, including Hank Williams Jr., the Marshall Tucker Band, Travis Tritt, Steve Earle, Waylon, Eric Church, Cody Jinks, Jamey Johnson, John Anderson, his son Shooter Jennings, Sturgill Simpson, and Hank Williams III.
Littlefield, Texas, renamed one of its major roads, Tenth Street, to Waylon Jennings Boulevard.
He was inducted to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999.

In 2008, the posthumous album &quot;Waylon Forever&quot; was released, which consisted of songs recorded with his then-16-year-old son, Shooter. In 2012, the three-volume &quot;Waylon: The Music Inside&quot; was released, featuring covers of Jennings&#x27;s songs by different artists. Also released the same year was &quot;Goin&#x27; Down Rockin&#x27;: The Last Recordings&quot;, a set of 12 songs recorded by Jennings and bassist Robby Turner before Jennings&#x27;s death in 2002. The songs initially featured only Jennings&#x27;s guitar and vocals, with Turner on bass; further accompaniment was to be added later. Turner completed the recordings in 2012 with the help of former Waylors. The Jennings family approved the release. Meanwhile, it launched a new business focused on his estate. Shooter Jennings arranged deals for a clothing line, launched a renewed website, and started talks with different producers on a biographical film. George Jones&#x27; 1985 single &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes&quot; references Waylon Jennings with the line, &quot;Like the outlaw who walks through Jessi&#x27;s dream&quot;. In early 2024 his son Shooter along with Jessi announced another posthumous album would be released in 2025, this time with unearthed material from the 1970s through the 1980s that had yet to be released.

<doc id="39087" wikidata="Q4668625" url="?curid=39087" title="Black tie">
<text>Black tie is a semi-formal Western dress code for evening events, originating in British and North American conventions for attire in the 19th century. In British English, the dress code is often referred to synecdochically by its principal element for men, the dinner suit or dinner jacket. In American English, the equivalent term tuxedo (or tux) is common. The dinner suit is a black, midnight blue or white two- or three-piece suit, distinguished by satin or grosgrain jacket lapels and similar stripes along the outseam of the trousers. It is worn with a white dress shirt with standing or turndown collar and link cuffs, a black bow tie, typically an evening waistcoat or a cummerbund, and black patent leather dress shoes or court pumps. Accessories may include a semi-formal homburg, bowler, or boater hat. For women, an evening gown or other fashionable evening attire may be worn.

The first dinner jacket is traditionally traced to 1865 on the then Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII (1841–1910). The late 19th century saw gradual introduction of the lounge jacket without tails as a less formal and more comfortable leisure alternative to the frock coat. Similarly, the shorter dinner jacket evolved as a less formal alternative to the dress coat out of the informal smoking jacket, itself derived from the banyan. Thus in many non-English languages, a dinner jacket is still known as the false friend &quot;smoking&quot;. In American English, its synonym &quot;tuxedo&quot; was derived from the village of Tuxedo Park in New York State, where it was introduced in 1886 following the example of Europeans. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, black tie has increasingly replaced white tie for more formal settings in the United States, along with cultures influenced by American culture.

Traditionally worn only for events after 6 p.m., black tie is less formal than white tie, but more formal than informal or business dress. As semi-formal, black tie is worn for dinner parties (public, fraternities, private) and sometimes even to balls and weddings, although etiquette experts discourage wearing of black tie for weddings. Traditional semi-formal day wear equivalent is black lounge suit. Supplementary semi-formal alternatives may be accepted for black tie: mess dress uniform, religious clothing (such as cassock), folk costumes (such as highland dress), etc.

== Name ==
&quot;Dinner jacket&quot; in the context of menswear first appeared in the United Kingdom around 1887 and in the United States around 1889. In the 1960s it became associated in the United States with white or coloured jackets specifically. In modern British English, &quot;dinner jacket&quot; may be abbreviated to simply &quot;DJ&quot;.

&quot;Tuxedo&quot; in the context of menswear originated in the United States around 1888. It was named after Tuxedo Park, a Hudson Valley enclave for New York&#x27;s social elite where it was often seen in its early years. The term was capitalized until the 1930s and traditionally referred only to a white jacket. When the jacket was later paired with its own unique trousers and accessories in the 1900s the term began to be associated with the entire suit. Sometimes it is shortened to &quot;tux&quot;.

In a number of European and other languages the style is referred to by the pseudo-anglicism &quot;smoking&quot;. This generic colloquialism comes from its similarity to the 19th century smoking jacket. In French the dress code may also be called &quot;cravate noire&quot;, a term that is sometimes adopted directly into English.

The suit with accompanying accessories is sometimes nicknamed a &quot;monkey suit&quot; and, since 1918, &quot;soup and fish&quot; – a term derived from the sort of food thought to be served at black tie dinners.

== History ==
=== British origins in the 19th century ===

In the 1860s, the increasing popularity of outdoor activities among the middle and upper classes of the UK led to a corresponding increase in the popularity of the then casual lounge suit as a country alternative to the more formal day wear frock coat that was traditionally worn in town. Men also sought a similar alternative to the formal evening tailcoat, then known as a &quot;dress coat&quot;, worn every evening.

The earliest record of a tailless coat being worn with evening wear is an 1865 midnight blue smoking jacket in silk with matching trousers ordered by the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII of the United Kingdom, from Savile Row tailors Henry Poole &amp; Co. The smoking jacket was tailored for use at Sandringham, the British Royal Family&#x27;s informal country estate. Henry Poole never saw his design become known as a dinner jacket or cross the Atlantic and be called a tuxedo over there; he died in 1876 leaving behind a well-respected business to be run by his cousin Samuel Cundey.

Other accounts of the Prince&#x27;s experimentation appear around 1885, referring variously to &quot;a garment of many colours, such as was worn by our ancestors&quot; and &quot;short garments coming down to the waist and made on the model of the military men&#x27;s jackets&quot;. The suit jacket with tailcoat finishes, as is most commonly known, was first described around the same time and often associated with Cowes, a seaside resort in southern England and centre of British yachting that was closely associated with the Prince. It was originally intended for warm weather use but soon spread to informal or stag winter occasions. As it was simply an evening tailcoat substitute, it was worn with all the same accoutrements as the tailcoat, including the trousers. As such, in these early days, black tie, in contrast to formal white tie, was considered informal wear.

In the following decades of the Victorian era, the style became known as a dinner jacket: a fashionable, formal alternative for the tailcoat which men of the upper classes wore every evening. Thus it was worn with the standard accompaniments for the evening tailcoat at the time: matching trousers, white or black waistcoat, white bow tie, white detachable wing-collar formal shirt, and black formal shoes. Lapels were often faced or edged in silk or satin in varying widths. In comparison with a full dress such as a cutaway tailcoat, etiquette guides declared dinner jacket inappropriate for wear in mixed company, meaning together with ladies.

During the Edwardian era, the practice of wearing a black waistcoat and black bow tie with a dinner jacket became the convention, establishing the basis of the current black tie and white tie dress codes. The dinner jacket was also increasingly accepted at less formal evening occasions such as warm-weather gatherings or intimate dinners with friends.
After World War I, the dinner jacket became established as a semi-formal evening wear, while the evening tailcoat was limited to the most formal or ceremonial occasions. During this interwar period, double-breasted jackets, turndown-collar shirts and cummerbunds became popular for black tie evenings as white jackets were experimented with in warm weather. Since then, black tie is often referred to as being semi-formal.

In the decades following the World War II, black tie became special occasion attire rather than standard evening wear. In the 1950s, some experimented with coloured and patterned jackets, cummerbunds and bow ties. The 1960s and 1970s saw the colour palette move from muted to bright day-glow and pastel, as well as ruffled-placket shirts as lapels got wider and piping was revived. The 1980s and 1990s saw a return to traditional styles, with black jackets and trousers again becoming nearly universal. Some insist the 21st century has seen increased variation and a relaxation of previous strict standards; midnight blue once again became popular and lapel facings were sometimes reduced to wide edging.

=== Introduction to the United States ===

The earliest references to a dress coat substitute in America are from the summer and fall of 1886 and, like the British references from this time, vary between waist-length mess-jacket style and the conventional suit jacket style. The most famous reference originates from Tuxedo Park, an upstate New York countryside enclave for Manhattan&#x27;s wealthiest citizens. A son of one of the community&#x27;s founders, Griswold Lorillard, and his friends were widely reported in society columns for showing up at the club&#x27;s first Autumn Ball in October 1886 wearing &quot;a tailless dress coat&quot;. Although it is not known whether this garment was a mess jacket or a conventional dinner jacket, it has no doubt cemented the tailcoat substitute&#x27;s association with Tuxedo Park in the mind of the public.

An essay in the Tuxedo Park archives attributes the jacket&#x27;s importation to America to resident James Brown Potter, a merchant banker who had worked in London for Brown Brothers. However, this claim for Potter cannot be verified through independent sources. Period newspaper accounts indicate that at first the jacket was worn by young mavericks to gatherings considered strictly formal. This led the American establishment to reject it out of hand. It was only by 1888 that polite society accepted its role solely as summer and informal evening substitute, at which point it became very popular.

=== 20th century changes ===

The earliest dinner jackets were of the same black material as the dress coat with one, two or no buttons, and a shawl collar faced in satin or ribbed silk. By the turn of the twentieth century, the peaked lapel was equally popular and the one-button model had become standard. When trousers were sold with the jacket they were of the same material. Edwardian dandies often opted for Oxford grey or a very dark blue for their evening wear.

By World War I, the grey option had fallen out of favour but the &quot;midnight blue&quot; alternative became increasingly popular and rivalled black by the mid-1930s. Notch lapels, imported from the ordinary business suit, were a brief vogue in the 1920s. A single stripe of braid covering the outseam on each leg was an occasional variation at first but became standard by the 1930s. At this time double-breasted jackets and white jackets became popular for wear in hot weather.

Colour, texture and pattern became increasingly popular in warm-weather jackets in the 1950s. In the 1960s, these variations became increasingly common regardless of season or climate. Notch lapels were once again a fad. By the 1970s, mass-market retailers began offering white and coloured versions of the entire suit to its rental customers. The 1980s vogue for nostalgic and retro styles returned evening wear to its black tone. Notch lapels returned for good in the 1980s, and in the 1990s dinner jackets increasingly took on other traits of the business suit, such as two- and three-button styling, flap pockets, and centre vents. These trends have continued into the early 21st century, and midnight blue is now once again a popular alternative.

== Composition ==

The dinner suit&#x27;s accompaniments have also evolved over time. The most traditional interpretations of these elements — dress shirt, low cut waistcoat (in the &quot;V&quot; or &quot;U&quot; shape), black bow tie, oxford dress shoes — are incorporated in the black tie dress code.

Unlike white tie, which is very strictly regulated, black tie ensembles can display more variation. More extensively, the traditional components for men are:

* A dinner jacket, also called a tuxedo jacket in the United States, is primarily made of black or midnight blue wool. Dinner jackets in an off-white colour are also considered appropriate for some occasions, but are traditionally associated with warmer climates and differ from other dinner jackets in that they are self-faced and can be made of fabrics including linen and cotton. Silk Jacket lapels and facings, usually grosgrain or satin, are a defining element of the jacket and can be seen on every type of lapel. The dinner jacket may have a peaked lapel, a shawl lapel, or a notched lapel, with some fashion stylists and writers seeing shawl lapels as less formal and notched lapels as the least formal, despite the fact that they, like peaked and shawl, were used (though somewhat rarely) in some of the early forms of the garment.
* Trousers with a single silk or satin braid covering the outer seams, uncuffed and worn with braces
* A black low-cut waistcoat or a cummerbund
* A white dress shirt, with a marcella or pleated bib being traditional, with double or &quot;French&quot; cuffs and a turndown collar. While the turndown is most appropriately semi-formal, the attached wing collar has been popular with American men since the 1980s. However, many style authorities argue that the attached version now typically offered is insubstantial with minuscule wings and inappropriately paired with soft pleated fronts.
* A black silk bow tie matching the lapel facings
* Shirt studs and cufflinks. Some classic etiquette authorities limit studs to stiff-front marcella shirts only and prescribe pearl buttons for soft-front models instead.
* Black dress socks, usually of silk or fine wool. Some style guides recommend that the socks should come up to the knee.
* Black shoes – traditionally patent leather court shoes or pumps; now often highly polished or patent leather Oxford dress shoes instead, without brogueing

=== Jacket ===
The original and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool-mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, the most appropriate and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double-breasted models have become less common, but are generally considered equally appropriate for most black tie occasions. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but in the 21st century come ventless, with side vents, or, less commonly, with centre vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels, traditionally pointed and shawl, are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave, but can also be silk barathea. A notched lapel is usually considered more appropriate for a business suit than a dinner jacket but is commonly seen on inexpensive off the rack dinner jackets. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and shawl collar are equally authentic and correct, with the latter being slightly less formal. The buttons are covered in similarly coloured material to the main part of the jacket, which would typically be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this traditional method of closure is common in the United Kingdom.

The double-besomed jetted or slit hip pocket is the only style understated enough to complement the dinner jacket. Flap pockets are not considered appropriate for formal attire&#x27;s refined minimalism due to their busier and bulkier design, and some believe that they are simply an attempt by dinner jacket manufacturers to save money by using standard suit patterns, although sometimes they will trim the edges of a flap pocket so that the flap can be tucked in or removed if desired. Besom welts can be of self fabric or trimmed with the lapel&#x27;s silk facing, though classic menswear scholar Nicholas Antongiavanni suggests that for the English this latter touch &quot;is a sure sign of hired clothes&quot;. The dinner jacket also has a welt breast pocket to hold a pocket handkerchief, which is generally self-faced rather than covered with silk.
Emily Post, a resident of Tuxedo Park, New York, stated in 1909 that &quot;[Tuxedos] can have lapels or be shawl-shaped, in either case they are to have facings of silk, satin or grosgrain&quot;. She later republished this statement in her 1922 book &quot;Etiquette&quot;, adding that only single-breasted jackets are appropriately called &quot;tuxedos&quot;. There is a fashion movement suggesting that a man&#x27;s appearance when wearing the wider and higher peak lapel is superior to the narrower notch lapel.
White dinner jackets are often worn in warm climates. They are ivory in colour rather than pure white, and have self-faced lapels, i.e., made of the same fabric as the jacket, rather than silk-faced lapels. They are generally worn with the same types of shirts and accessories as black dinner jackets, though the turndown collar and cummerbund are preferred to the wing collar or waistcoat. Similarly, the shawl lapel is more common in white dinner jackets. In the United Kingdom, the 20th-century etiquette was that white dinner jackets were never worn, even on the hottest day of summer, but were reserved for wear abroad. In the 21st century, white dinner jackets are frequently seen at weddings, formal beach events, and high-school proms, in the United States and at some concerts, famously for instance the Last Night of the Proms, in the United Kingdom. In tropical climates, such as in Imperial Burma, the desert fawn was historically used as the less formal colour. At one time, the civilian mess jacket was also an option in warmer climates.

It is generally considered inappropriate for a man to remove his jacket during a formal social event, but when hot weather and humidity dictate, the ranking man of the royal family or the guest of honour may give men permission by noticeably taking off his jacket. In anticipated hot weather, Red Sea rig is specified in the invitation, although this dress is esoteric in civilian circles, and is particular to certain expatriate communities.

=== Black bow tie ===
Traditionally, the only neckwear appropriate is the black bow tie that is a self-tie and it always matches the lapel facing of the dinner jacket and braiding of the trouser seams. The bow tie is tied using a common shoelace knot, which is also called the bow knot for that reason.

=== Trousers ===

Black tie trousers traditionally have no turn-ups, also called cuffs in American English, or belt loops. The outer seams are usually decorated with a single braid of silk or a material that matches or complements the lapel facing. Traditionally, braces, called suspenders in US English, hidden by the waistcoat, are used to support the trousers. Belts are never worn with black tie trousers. Evening trousers may be flat-fronted or pleated, with pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers have become more fashionable, pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.

=== Waist coverings ===
A waist covering is generally worn as part of a black tie ensemble. Either a low cut waistcoat or cummerbund may be worn, but never both at the same time. Although the English authority Debrett&#x27;s consider that wearing a waistcoat is smart, they no longer consider either waist covering to be essential. The American authority, The Emily Post Institute, considers them to be an essential component of proper black tie attire. Waist coverings are not matched to wedding theme colours.
==== Waistcoat ====
A low cut waistcoat should be worn when wearing a single-breasted coat. The waistcoat plays an important part in black tie&#x27;s refined minimalism by helping to conceal its working parts by discreetly covering the trousers&#x27; exposed waistband and the shirt bosom&#x27;s bottom edge. Waistcoats come in the &#x27;V&#x27; or rarer &#x27;U&#x27; shape, in backless or fully backed versions, double- or single-breasted, with or without lapels. Single-breasted styles typically have three buttons, and double-breasted ones three or four rows. Before World War II, while black tie was still gaining acceptance, men would wear a white waistcoat, along with other details now associated primarily with white tie, such as stiff fronted shirts. However, this style, though increasingly viewed as an affectation, is still acceptable in the United States. The waistcoat may be made from either the same fabric as the dinner jacket, as is traditional, or the same silk as the jacket&#x27;s lapels, which is more popular. When a waistcoat has lapels, they are faced in the same silk as those of the jacket; in this case it is considered more refined if the body is made from the same fabric as the jacket. The buttons may be self-faced or covered in the same silk as the lapels. Vintage waistcoats were sometimes closed with studs made from onyx or mother-of-pearl, which were often surrounded by a setting of silver or gold.

A waistcoat is never worn with a double-breasted jacket. Since this style of jacket is never unbuttoned, the waist of the trousers is never exposed, and therefore does not need to be covered, though before World War II an edge of the waistcoat was often shown between the jacket and shirt.

==== Cummerbund ====

A cummerbund may be worn with a dinner jacket in lieu of a waistcoat and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially well with a shawl collar dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels. The material of the cummerbund should be silk satin, grosgrain, also called faille, or barathea to match that of the bow tie. It features upward-facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the waistcoat, cummerbunds are not worn with a double-breasted jacket.

As the cummerbund is seen as an extension of the trousers, traditionally it is the same colour, i.e. black. However, the &quot;Black Tie Guide&quot; endorses deep and rich colours as a tasteful way to introduce some colour into an outfit that is otherwise monochromatic. Bright colours, such as those often worn by members of wedding parties, should be avoided and the bow tie must remain black in any case. Some higher quality models feature a hidden pocket and an elastic loop to fasten to the trousers.

=== Shirt ===

Dress shirts designed to be worn with black tie are sometimes called &quot;tuxedo shirts&quot; in American English. Traditionally, the shirt is white, has a bibbed front that is either marcella or pleated, a turndown collar, and double, or &quot;french&quot; cuffs. In the early-20th century, a piqué shirt with a detachable wing collar and single cuffs such as is worn with white tie was used, and in the 1960s and 1970s ruffled bibs were popular, but have since become uncommon. The wing collar originally disappeared in black tie after the 1920s when the appropriately semi-formal attached turndown collar shirt became preferred, but it has been popular with American men in a less substantial, attached form since the 1980s. However, many style authorities argue that the wing collar should remain the domain of white tie for aesthetic reasons. Etiquette maven Miss Manners is one of those who feel that while the bow tie&#x27;s uncovered band is fine in a white-on-white scheme, &quot;gentlemen with their black ties exposed all-around their necks look silly&quot;.
Although some style authorities consider the wing collar to be an acceptable option for black tie shirts, they are not worn with double cuffs or a pleated bib, and are better suited to the more formal single-breasted peak lapel jacket. They may feature a bib that is either marcella or starched and include stiff single cuffs secured with cufflinks, made of the same fabric as the bib; this type of shirt is exactly the same as one worn with white tie attire. The collar in this case is tall and stiff, which may be attached or detachable. When a full dress shirt is worn in this fashion, it is accompanied by the white marcella waistcoat ordinarily associated with white tie. Wearing white tie accessories in this manner is considered by many to be an affectation. Debrett&#x27;s do not endorse the wing collar as being compatible with the black tie dress code.

The more formal marcella version of the shirt fastens with matching shirt studs. These are most commonly in silver or gold settings, featuring onyx or mother-of-pearl; various geometrical shapes are worn, e.g., circles, which are most common for studs, octagons, or rectangles, which are most common for cufflinks. There has been no consistent fashion preference for gold or silver, but studs with mother-of-pearl are more formal and therefore often associated with white tie. The soft-front pleated version of the shirt should be fastened with mother-of-pearl buttons, typically supplied with the shirt on a separate strip of fabric. Alternatively, a fly-front shirt, appropriate with both the marcella and pleated bibs, conceals the placket for a more minimalistic look.

There are several types of cufflinks that may be worn with black tie. The most formal and decorative are the double-panel type, which dress both sides of the cuff and are connected by a chain or link of metal; this model conceals the mechanism by which the cuff is secured. The most common, and least decorative, are the swivel bar type; whilst these are acceptable, they leave the inner side of the cuffs and mechanism exposed which is incongruous with formal dress.
=== Footwear ===
The most formal and traditional shoes are patent leather opera pumps, also called court shoes, decorated with grosgrain bows. The more popular alternative is the black lace-up Oxford shoe, in patent leather or calfskin, with a rounded plain toe. Brogueing or any other decorative patterns should never be seen on black tie footwear. Matte finish pumps are also seen. Shoes are almost invariably black and patent leather is considered more formal than matte finishes while pumps are considered more formal than lace-ups. Generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing, such as the Derby shoe, called &quot;bluchers&quot; in American English. Notable alternatives include the black button boot, primarily of historical interest only, and the monogrammed Albert slipper which was originally worn only at home. Hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silk.

=== Accessories ===

Most etiquette and fashion guides of the current decade recommend keeping colour touches and favouring a single colour, usually dark; muted reds, such as maroon, are a traditional choice.

Handkerchief: A handkerchief in linen traditionally, or silk, or cotton is usually worn in the breast pocket. Although precedents for tasteful exceptions exist, pocket squares are normally white, and may not match the waist covering or bow tie.

Boutonnière: A flower may be worn. Red and white carnation, blue cornflower, and rosebud have all been popular at times. In France, the boutonnière is usually a gardenia.

Outerwear: Black tie events do not involve outerwear and coats and gloves are no longer considered part of the dress code. However, etiquette for what to wear in public in transit to and from black tie occasions was stiffer in earlier eras and remain an option: Matching overcoats are usually black, charcoal, or dark blue, and traditionally of the Chesterfield style. A guards coat was also once popular, and a lighter topcoat can be worn in summer. Historically, an Inverness coat was also worn. Until the mid-20th century, gloves and scarves were always worn, and are still occasionally seen in grey leather and white silk, respectively. White kid gloves have never been standard with black tie, remaining exclusive to white tie dress.

Hat: The 20th-century standard hat for black tie was a black or midnight blue Homburg in winter, or straw boater in spring and summer. Fedoras were originally regarded as too informal but have become more common. Top hats were originally worn with black tie, but had been reserved to white tie and morning dress from World War I. In the 1960s, it became optional to wear a hat with black tie, while from the 1970s onwards hats became less common.
Decorations and orders: Military, civil, and organizational decorations are usually worn only to full dress events, generally of formal governmental or diplomatic significance. Miniature orders and awards are typically worn on the left lapel of the jacket, and neck badges, breast stars, and sashes are worn according to country-specific or organizational regulations. Unlike in white tie, where decorations are always permitted, the dress code will usually give some indication when decorations are to be worn with black tie.

Timepiece: Traditionally visible timepieces are not worn with formal evening dress, because timekeeping is not supposed to be considered a priority. Pocket watches are acceptable.

===Women===

Women&#x27;s dress for black tie occasions has varied greatly throughout the years; traditionally it was:

*A dinner length gown at the ankle or tea length gown below mid-calf, which is a sleeveless evening gown, often accompanied by:
**A wrap or stole and
**Gloves
*Evening shoes

Other fashionable evening attire may be worn. Unlike the men&#x27;s standard, the specifics of black tie for women are linked to whatever evening wear is currently in fashion. Today ladies&#x27; dress for black tie occasions covers a much wider level of formality ranging from just below the white tie standard to something more informal such as a little black dress. Specifically it can also include:
*Evening shoes and
*A ballgown, evening gown or cocktail dress. Cocktail dresses may be long or moderately short and need not be black.
*In England, evening trousers with a palazzo cut are another acceptable option.

Still, while &quot;black tie&quot; dress code traditionally implies evening dress for women, in 1966 famous couturier Yves Saint Laurent proposed &quot;Le Smoking&quot;, a dinner suit designed for women. Most initial reactions to the collection were negative. The designer took bits and pieces from both men&#x27;s suit and women&#x27;s clothing and combined it with new ideas. As this dinner suit was designed for women, it was different from the normal male dinner suit. The collar was more feminine, as the shape and curve were more subtle. The waistline of the blouse was narrowed to show the body shape, and pants were adjusted to help elongate the leg. It pioneered long, minimalist, androgynous styles for women, as well as the female use of power suits and the pantsuit in modern-day society. Some described Saint Laurent&#x27;s initiative as empowerment of women by giving them the option to wear clothes that were normally worn by men with influence and power. Fashion photography echoes the influence of this suit in shoots that feature androgynous models with slicked-back hair in a mannish three-piece suit, a style that was first popularized in photographs by Helmut Newton. This suit has continued to influence fashion designers&#x27; collections through the 2000s.

== Social occasions ==

In traditional Western dress codes etiquette black tie is intended for men&#x27;s evening wear. Traditionally in the 20th century black tie, in contrast to formal white tie, was considered informal. In the 21st century black tie is often referred to as being semi-formal.

Black tie is worn to private and public dinners, balls and parties. At the more formal end of the social spectrum, it has to a large extent replaced the more formal white tie. Once more common, white tie dress code is fairly rare, being reserved for only the most formal occasions. Black tie is traditionally worn only after six o&#x27;clock in the evening, or after sundown during winter months. Black tie&#x27;s rough daytime equivalent is the stroller, which is less formal than morning dress because, as with black tie, it replaces the tailcoat with a lounge coat. Contrary to the trend seen in evening dress, the less formal stroller is now extraordinarily rare, whereas morning dress is still relatively common.

The most popular uses of the dinner suit in the United States in the early 21st century are for balls, galas, proms, cruise ship dinners and weddings. In these circumstances the dinner suit&#x27;s styling and accessories are most commonly chosen according to the wearer&#x27;s tastes. Less popular are black tie events, such as gala fundraisers, where men typically wear more traditional dinner suits and accessories as dictated by the dress code. They are also often worn by male musicians at concerts.

As a general rule, boys do not wear dinner jackets much before they are 15 or dress coats before they are about 18.

===Academia===

Some British university debating societies, such as at Oxford, Durham and University College London conduct at least some of their debates in black tie. Notably, the Cambridge Union abolished the long-standing mandatory wearing of black tie at debates in 2002. The Irish Times hosts an annual black tie debating competition.

Learned societies, such as the Royal Aeronautical Society, may also follow a similar practice.

Black tie dinners and debates are held through the academic year by British university Conservative associations, such as those at Oxford, Cambridge, York, and Nottingham.

=== Opera and ballet ===
Historically, white tie was worn for the opera. Since the 20th century, however, black tie has been worn increasingly and today a dark lounge suit is generally acceptable. In the 21st century, many opera houses in the English-speaking world do not stipulate black tie. For example, neither the Royal Opera House nor the Sydney Opera House maintain a black tie dress code. Notwithstanding, black tie is customary at English country house operas, such as during the summer Festival at Glyndebourne. Black tie is also worn at a ballet or orchestra gala.

=== Cruise ships ===
At more formal dinners on cruise ships the dress code will typically be black tie, although a dark lounge suit may be worn as a substitute. In 2013 Cunard, noted for its adherence to formal dress codes, relaxed its dress standards. Cunard requires one of a dinner jacket, a dark suit, formal national dress or military uniform for gentlemen diners on formal evenings. Similarly, the luxury cruise liner, Seabourn, stipulates either a dinner suit or a dark business suit on formal evenings.

=== Weddings ===
Black tie has been increasingly seen in the United States at weddings in place of the traditional morning dress. However, etiquette and clothing experts see the wearing of black tie before 6 p.m. as out of the ordinary. Prior to the late 1930s, black tie was even discouraged as too informal for evening weddings, with Amy Vanderbilt arguing that &quot;no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo&quot;. Emily Post would continue to argue in preference of white tie at evening weddings into the 1950s.

In the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, although a minority accepts black tie at evening wedding receptions, including some Jewish weddings, it is seldom worn at church weddings or civil ceremonies where morning dress or a lounge suit is normally favoured.

Other than that, supplementary alternatives include local variations of white tie etiquette, such as highland dress in Scotland, if neither white tie nor black tie is preferred.

<text>Richard Somers (September 15, 1778 – September 4, 1804) was an officer of the United States Navy, killed during an assault on Tripoli during the First Barbary War.

==Early career==
Born at Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey, he attended the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia with future naval heroes Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart. He was appointed midshipman on April 23, 1797, and served in the West Indies during the Quasi-War with France on the frigate &quot;United States&quot; with Decatur and Stewart, a ship commanded by Captain John Barry. He was promoted to lieutenant on May 21, 1799.

In 1800, Somers fought three duels on the same day with multiple opponents because they accused him of cowardice for failing to challenge Decatur over a joking insult they overheard. Somers was wounded in the first two duels and had to be supported during the third (by Decatur, who was acting as his second).

Somers was detached from &quot;United States&quot; on June 13, 1801, and ordered to &quot;Boston&quot; on July 30, 1801. He served in the latter frigate in the Mediterranean. After &quot;Boston&quot; returned to Washington, DC, Somers was furloughed on November 11, 1802, to await orders.

==First Barbary War==
On May 5, 1803, Somers was ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, to man, fit out, and command , and when that schooner was ready for sea, to sail her to the Mediterranean. &quot;Nautilus&quot; got underway on 30 June, reached Gibraltar on July 27, and sailed four days later to Spain. He then returned to Gibraltar to meet Commodore Edward Preble, in &quot;Constitution&quot;, who was bringing a new squadron for action against the Barbary pirates. &quot;Nautilus&quot; sailed with Preble on October 6 to Tangier where the display of American naval strength induced the Europeans of Morocco to renew the treaty of 1786. Thereafter, Tripoli became the focus of Preble&#x27;s attention.

Somers&#x27; service as commanding officer of &quot;Nautilus&quot; during operations against Tripoli won him promotion to master commandant on May 18, 1804. In the summer, he commanded a division of gunboats amidst five attacks on Tripoli, during the First Barbary War.

On September 4, 1804, Somers assumed command of the fire ship &quot;Intrepid&quot;, which had been fitted out as a &quot;floating volcano&quot;, alongside 12 members of a volunteer crew. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was to be sailed into Tripoli harbor and blown up in the midst of the corsair fleet close under the walls of the city. That night, she got underway into the harbor, but she exploded prematurely, killing Somers and his entire crew.

==Legacy==
News of Somers&#x27; death would take some months to arrive to the United States, with newspapers in New York and New Jersey reporting on the assault in January 1805. Some reports suggested the premature detonation to be a deliberate act by Somers to avoid capture by approaching sailors, an account which led to Somers&#x27; depiction as a martyr within the American Navy. However, the true reasons for the explosion remain unclear and no reliable account is known from the &quot;Intrepid&quot; final moments.

Somers is buried in Tripoli, alongside the bodies of other sailors recovered from the explosion. In 2004, the New Jersey State Assembly passed two resolutions calling for the return of his remains. It was hoped that with the fall of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime in Libya in August 2011 that the remains might finally be repatriated, but efforts by diplomatic staff and relatives of Somers in the United States remained unsuccessful as of 2015.

Since 1804, six ships of the US Navy have successively been named the USS &quot;Somers&quot; in his honor.

The town of Somers, New York, located in Westchester County is named in his honor. Somers Point, New Jersey, is named after Richard&#x27;s great-grandfather. Every year there is a Richard Somers Day celebration in Somers Point.

<text>OS-9 is a family of real-time, process-based, multitasking, multi-user operating systems, developed in the 1980s, originally by Microware Systems Corporation for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. It was purchased by Radisys Corp in 2001, and was purchased again in 2013 by its current owner Microware LP.

The OS-9 family was popular for general-purpose computing and remains in use in commercial embedded systems and amongst hobbyists. Today, OS-9 is a product name used by both a Motorola 68000-series machine language OS and a portable (PowerPC, x86, ARM, MIPS, SH4, etc.) version written in C, originally known as OS-9000.

==History==
The first version (&quot;OS-9 Level One&quot;), which dates back to 1979–1980, was written in assembly language for the Motorola 6809 CPU, and all of its processes ran within the 64KB address space of the CPU without a memory management unit. It was developed as a supporting operating system for the BASIC09 project, contracted for by Motorola as part of the 6809 development. A later 6809 version (&quot;Level Two&quot;) takes advantage of memory mapping hardware, supported up to 2 MB of memory (ca. 1980) in most implementations, and included a GUI on some platforms.

In 1983, OS-9/6809 was ported to Motorola 68000 assembly language and extended (called OS-9/68K); and a still later (1989) version was rewritten mostly in C for further portability. The portable version was initially called OS-9000 and was released for 80386 PC systems around 1989, then ported to PowerPC around 1995. These later versions lack the memory mapping facilities of OS-9/6809 Level Two simply because they do not need them. They used a single flat address space that all processes share; memory mapping hardware, if present, is mostly used to ensure that processes access only memory they have the right to access. The 680x0 and 80386 (and later) MPUs all directly support far more than of memory in any case.

As a consequence of early pervasive design decisions taking advantage of the easily used reentrant object code capabilities of the 6809 processor, programs intended for OS-9 are required to be reentrant; compilers produce reentrant code automatically and assemblers for OS-9 offer considerable support for it. OS-9 also uses position-independent code and data because the 6809 also supports it directly; compilers and assemblers support position independence. The OS-9 kernel loads programs (including shared code), and allocates data, wherever sufficient free space is available in the memory map. This allows the entire OS and all applications to be placed in ROM or Flash memory, and eases memory management requirements when programs are loaded into RAM and run. Programs, device drivers, and I/O managers under OS-9 are all &#x27;modules&#x27; and can be dynamically loaded and unloaded (subject to link counts) as needed.

OS-9/6809 runs on Motorola EXORbus systems using the Motorola 6809, SS-50 Bus and SS-50C bus systems from companies such as SWTPC, Tano, Gimix, Midwest Scientific, and Smoke Signal Broadcasting, STD-bus 6809 systems from several suppliers, personal computers such as the Fujitsu FM-11, FM-8, FM-7 and FM-77, Hitachi , and many others.
System Industries, a third-party provider of DEC compatible equipment, used a 68B09E processor running OS9 in its QIC (quarter-inch cartridge) tape backup controllers in VAX installations.

The best known hardware (due to its low price and broad distribution) was the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo) and the similar Dragon series. Even on the CoCo, a quite minimalist hardware platform, it was possible under OS-9/6809 Level One to have more than one interactive user running concurrently (for example, one on the console keyboard, another in the background, and perhaps a third interactively via a serial connection) as well as several other non-interactive processes. One system, the Positron 9000, was positioned as a multi-user system for educational use, offering Microware&#x27;s BASIC and Pascal environments, fitted with 64 KB to 512 KB of RAM, and featuring four to twelve serial ports. Responsiveness was reportedly impacted by multi-user operations in the system&#x27;s minimal configuration, however. A second processor implementation of OS-9 for the BBC Micro was produced by Cumana. It included on-board RAM, SCSI hard disk interface and a MC68008 processor.

OS-9 was also ported to the Commodore SP-9000 or SuperPET, which had a 6809 in addition to the 6502 of the base 8032 model, as well as 64 KB more. The Toronto PET Users Group sponsored a HW/SW project which included a daughter board with an MMU as well as the OS-9 distribution disks. With two processors, 96 KB, a 25×80 screen and serial, parallel and IEEE-488 ports and many peripherals this was one of the most capable OS-9 systems available.

OS-9&#x27;s multi-user and multi-tasking capabilities make it usable as a general-purpose interactive computer system. Many third-party interactive applications have been written for it, such as the Dynacalc spreadsheet, the VED text formatter, and the Stylograph and Screditor-3 WYSIWYG word processors. TSC&#x27;s nroff emulating formatter was ported to OS-9 by MicroWay, as well.

In mid 1980s, OS-9 was selected for the CD-i operating system. Around the same time, Microsoft approached Microware for acquisition of the company primarily because it was attracted by CD-RTOS, the CD-i operating system. The negotiation failed and no deal was made; Microware decided to remain independent.

In late 1980s, Microware released OS-9000, a more portable version of the operating system. The vast majority of the operating system kernel was rewritten in C leaving a handful of hardware-dependent parts in assembly language. A few &quot;more advanced features&quot; were added such as tree-like kernel module name space. OS-9000 was initially ported to the Motorola 680x0 family CPUs, Intel 80386, and PowerPC. The OS-9000/680x0 was a marketing failure and withdrawn very quickly, probably because few customers wanted to try the fatter and slower operating system over the existing OS-9/680x0 proven record of stability. Microware later started calling all of its operating systems — including what had been originally called OS-9000 — simply OS-9, and started shifting its business interest towards portable consumer device markets such as cellphones, car navigation, and multimedia.

In late 1980s and early 1990s, the Character Generators computers used in Broadcast Systems used OS-9 and OS-9000 extensively. The now defunct Pesa Electronica used OS-9 on their CGs such as CG 4722 and CG4733.

==Name conflicts and court decisions==
In 1999, nineteen years after the first release of OS-9, Apple Computer released Mac OS 9. Microware sued Apple that year for trademark infringement, although a judge ruled that there would be little chance for confusion between the two. Some Macintosh users who are unaware of Microware&#x27;s lesser known OS-9 have posted to the comp.os.os9 newsgroup not realizing what OS-9 is.

In 2001, RadiSys purchased Microware to acquire the Intel IXP-1200 network processor resources. This acquisition infused Microware with capital and allowed Microware to continue OS-9 development and support.

On February 21, 2013, Microware LP (a partnership formed by Freestation of Japan, Microsys Electronics of Germany and RTSI LLC of the USA) announced that they signed an Asset Purchase Agreement to buy the rights to the names Microware, OS-9 and all assets from RadiSys.

==Technology==

===Modern and archaic design===
OS-9 (especially the 68k version and thereafter) clearly distinguishes itself from the prior generation of embedded operating systems in many aspects.
* Runs on 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit CPUs.
* Clear separation between user mode and supervisor (kernel) mode.
* Dynamic use of individually and separately built software components (executable program images and kernel modules) rather than a statically linked single monolithic image.
* Unix-like process name-space model (not memory model) and user shell program.
* Clear separation between hardware independent (e.g. file managers) and hardware dependent (e.g. device drivers) layers.

When compared with more modern operating systems:
* The kernel is written entirely in assembly language (OS-9/68K version only) and C (portable version to other architectures) using simple internal data structures, reducing flexibility and improvement scope while improving determinability required for real-time operating systems.
* Performance was also affected for some operations, but assembly language helped with the speed issue.
* Systems without a memory management unit (MMU) have no memory protection against illegal access, nor per-process memory protection, while systems with an MMU can have memory protection enabled. The module controlling the MMU can be included or omitted by the system integrator to enable or disable memory protection. This allows OS-9 to run on older systems which do not include an MMU.
* Older versions of OS-9 do not support POSIX threads, while all OS-9 supported processors support POSIX threads.
* No SMP support for multiple sockets, cores, or hardware threads in the same OS-9 instance (can run as a RTOS on one of the cores of dual core processors like Core Duo and Core 2 Duo, when Linux is running on the other core doing general purpose tasks).

===Task scheduling===
OS-9&#x27;s real-time kernel allows multiple independent applications to execute simultaneously through task switching and inter-process communication facilities. All OS-9 programs run as processes containing at least one lightweight process (thread) but may contain an effectively unlimited number of threads. Within a process, these lightweight processes share memory, I/O paths, and other resources in accordance with the POSIX threads specification and API. OS-9 schedules the threads using a fixed-priority preemptive scheduling algorithm with round-robin scheduling within each priority. Time slicing is supported. The priority levels can be divided into a range that supports aging and a higher-priority range that uses strict priority scheduling. Each process can access any system resource by issuing the appropriate OS-9 service request. At every scheduling point, OS-9 compares the priority of the thread at the head of the active queue to the priority of the current thread. It context switches to the thread on the active queue if its priority is higher than the current processes&#x27; priority. Aging artificially increases the effective priority of threads in the active queue as time passes. At defined intervals, time slicing returns the current thread to the active queue behind other threads at the same priority.

===Kernel modules===
* Kernel – Contains task switching, memory allocation, and most non-I/O calls
* IOMAN – Handles I/O calls to various file managers and drivers.
*File managers basic set:
** SCF, Serial files (serial devices)
** RBF, Random block (disk devices)
** SBF, Sequential block (tape Devices)
** NFM, NULL devices (USB and other devices)
** MFM, Message
** SPF, Stacked Protocol devices ( Networking) 
** PCF, PC FAT files
** PIPEMAN, Pipe manager
** Modman - Memory module directories 
* SSM – System security (MMU handling)
* Cache – Cache handling, 
* VectXXX – Vector / PIC handler 
* FPU – Floating point emulation
* Align – Address alignment fault handler

==Comparisons with Unix==
OS-9&#x27;s notion of processes and I/O paths is quite similar to that of Unix in nearly all respects, but there are some significant differences. Firstly, the file system is not a single tree, but instead is a forest with each tree corresponding to a device. Second, OS-9 does not have a Unix-style fork() system call—instead it has a system call which creates a process running a specified program, performing much the same function as a fork-exec or a spawn. Additionally, OS-9 processes keep track of two &quot;current directories&quot; rather than just one; the &quot;current execution directory&quot; is where it will by default look first to load programs to run (which is similar to the use of PATH environment variable under UNIX). The other is the current data directory.

Another difference is that in OS-9, grandparent directories can be indicated by repeating periods three or more times, without any intervening slashes (a feature also found in 4DOS/4OS2/4NT/TC). For example, codice_1 in OS-9, is similar to codice_2 in Unix. But codice_3 and codice_4, with just one or two periods, each work the same in both OS-9 and Unix.

OS-9 has had a modular design from the beginning, influenced by notions of the designers of the 6809 and how they expected software would be distributed in the future (see the three-part series of articles in January–March 1979 &quot;Byte&quot; by Terry Ritter, et al. of Motorola who designed the CPU).

The module structure requires more explanation: OS-9 keeps a &quot;module directory&quot;, a memory-resident list of all modules that are in memory either by having been loaded, or by having been found in ROM during an initial scan at boot time. When one types a command to the OS-9 shell, it will look first in the current module directory for a module of the specified name and will use it (and increase its link count) if found, or it will look on disk for an appropriately named file if not. In OS-9/6809 and OS-9/68000, the module directory is flat, but OS-9000 made the module directory tree-structured. The OS-9000 shell looks in one&#x27;s alternative module directory for a MODPATH environment variable, analogous to the PATH variable in all versions, indicating the sequence of module directories in which to look for pre-loaded modules.

Modules are not only used to hold programs, but can also be created on the fly to hold data, and are the way in which OS-9 supports shared memory.
OS-9/non-68000 supports POSIX threads. A single process can start any number of threads.

==Status==
OS-9 has faded from popular use, though Microware LP does still support it and it does run on modern architectures such as ARM and x86. The compiler provided, Ultra C/C++, supports C89, but supports neither C99 nor C++98. Ultra C++ does provide limited support for C++ templates. It is also supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL.
* A Version of OS-9 running Steve Adams&#x27; G-Windows is present on semiconductor wafer scrubbers manufactured by Ontrak Systems / Lam Research. Thousands of these systems are in use today, however, the software running on them dates to 1999 when the last version was created to handle Y2K issues. 
* Versions of OS-9/68K ran on a wide variety of 68000 family platforms, including the X68000 in Japan, some personal computers intended by their designers as upgrades from the Color Computer (e.g., the 68070 and 68340-based MM/1, and on other computers from Frank Hogg Laboratories, PEP Modular Computers, and Delmar Co.) It was also ported to the Atari ST by Recc-o-ware in the early 1990s, and was distributed by Cumana in Europe. A port for 68000-based Apple Macintoshes distributed by Ultrascience exists. A port to the Amiga by Digby Tarvin is also purported to exist.
* OS-9/68K is mandated by Caltrans to be used in the 2070-1B and 2070-1E controller cards, and so ends up being used to run many North American traffic signal control systems.
* OS-9/68K is also found in some other embedded applications, including the Quanta Delta television broadcast character generator, still in production by ScanLine Technologies in Utah. While the user-level interface code on this system started at boot time, there was a hidden, undocumented keyboard sequence that would provide a user with a root shell prompt in a scroll window on the device&#x27;s edit-channel monitor.
* In the embedded market, where OS-9 has found application in such devices as the Fairlight CMI synthesizers, robotics, in-car navigation systems, and Philips&#x27; Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i) industry standard.
* The TRS-80 Color Computer (and clones) still has users and an annual conference in Chicago; as of 2018 the 27th Annual &quot;Last&quot; Chicago CoCoFEST was scheduled for April 21–22, 2018. A group of Canadian programmers rewrote OS-9/6809 Level II for the CoCo 3 (w/ address translation hardware) for efficiency, and to take advantage of the native mode of the Hitachi 6309. Today&#x27;s serious CoCo users now typically have replaced the 68B09E in the CoCo 3 with an Hitachi 63B09E and run the rewrite, called NitrOS-9. The combination is surprisingly fast, considering that it runs on an expressly low cost, 8-bit computer system.
* Gary Becker&#x27;s CoCo3 FPGA is a synthesized TRS-80 Color Computer which runs NitrOS-9 on an Altera DE-1 development board. The core 6809 CPU was designed by John Kent and is currently running at 25 MHz.
* OS-9000/80x86 can be run on PC-type machines built around the Intel x86 CPUs. OS-9000 has also been ported to the PowerPC, MIPS, some versions of Advanced RISC Machines&#x27; ARM processor, and some of the Hitachi SH family of processors.
* The DigiCart/II Plus audio playback unit runs OS-9/68K. It is a solid state replacement for radio station style cart players. These units are used in radio and at places like Walt Disney World where they play park announcements.
* German electronics manufacturer Eltec has been manufacturing the Eurocom-model CPU boards for industrial purposes since the late 1970s, starting with the 6802 and 6809 Eurocom-1 and Eurocom-2, and onwards with 68K, and derivative, CPU boards up to today. The modern boards can be delivered with a range of operating systems, amongst which is OS-9.
*Omron used OS-9 in their NS series HMI panels. However, for their new NA series, Omron selected Windows Embedded Compact 7. Omron indicated that with OS-9 nearly all the drivers, for example for a USB stick, had to be written by Omron.
* OS-9000/SH4 can be found in loader (inside KIWI-format container LOADING.KWI) on Map CD/DVD for old automotive GPS navigation systems made by Matsushita for Japan domestical market.

<text>In metaphysics, extension signifies both &#x27;stretching out&#x27; (Latin: &quot;extensio&quot;) as well as later &#x27;taking up space&#x27;, and most recently, spreading one&#x27;s internal mental cognition into the external world.

The history of thinking about &quot;extension&quot; can be traced back at least to Archytas&#x27; spear analogy for the infinity of space. How far can one&#x27;s hand or spear stretch out until it reaches the edge of reality? &quot;If I arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the nature of space] not to be able to extend it.&quot;

==History==
===Descartes===
René Descartes defined extension as the property of existing in more than one dimension, a property that was later followed up in Grassmann&#x27;s n-dimensional algebra. For Descartes, the primary characteristic of matter is extension (&quot;res extensa&quot;), just as the primary characteristic of mind is thought (&quot;res cogitans&quot;).

===Newton===
After rejecting Cartesian identification of body with extension, Newton turns to the question of what the nature of the &quot;immobile being&quot;—space or extension itself, distinguished from body—was. He raises three possible definitions for extension: as a kind of &quot;substance&quot;; or as a kind of &quot;accident&quot; (a standard philosophical term for &quot;attribute&quot;: anything that can be predicated of substance); or &quot;simply nothing&quot; (a reference to atomism), all of which he repudiates. Instead he proposes that extension &quot;has a certain mode of existence of its own, which agrees neither with substances nor accidents.&quot; After struggling with this question, Newton provides perhaps one of the clearest definitions of extension

which lead Stein to conclude Newton&#x27;s conception of Space, the existence of space, or extension, &quot;follows from&quot; that of anything whatsoever; but extension does not require a subject in which it &quot;inheres&quot;, as a property; and it can be conceived as existent without presupposing any &quot;particular&quot; thing, God included. On the other hand, it is an &quot;affection of every being.&quot;

===Locke===
John Locke, in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, defined extension as &quot;only the Space that lies between the Extremities of those solid coherent Parts&quot; of a body. It is the space possessed by a body. Locke refers to the extension in conjunction with &quot;solidity&quot; and &quot;impenetrability,&quot; the other primary characteristics of matter.

===Spinoza===
Extension also plays an important part in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza, who says that substance (that which has extension) can be limited only by substance of the same sort, i.e. matter cannot be limited by ideas and vice versa. From this principle, he determines that substance is infinite. This infinite substance is what Spinoza calls God, or better yet nature, and it possesses both unlimited extension and unlimited consciousness.

==Infinite divisibility==
&quot;Infinite divisibility&quot; refers to the idea that extension, or quantity, when divided and further divided infinitely, cannot reach the point of zero quantity. It can be divided into very small or negligible quantity but not zero or no quantity at all. Using a mathematical approach, specifically geometric models, Gottfried Leibniz and Descartes discussed the infinite divisibility of extension. Actual divisibility may be limited due to unavailability of cutting instruments, but its possibility of breaking into smaller pieces is infinite.

==Compenetration==
&quot;Compenetration&quot; refers to two or more extensions occupying the same space at the same time. This, according to scholastic philosophers, is impossible; according to this view, only spirits or spiritualized matter can occupy a place occupied already by an entity (matter or spirit)

==Extended mind thesis==
In more recent work, philosophers David Chalmers and Andy Clark in 1998 published &quot;The Extended Mind.&quot; This has opened a wide channel of new research at the nexus of epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive and neuro-science, dynamic systems thinking, science, technology &amp; innovation studies.

<doc id="39095" wikidata="Q1384998" url="?curid=39095" title="Extension (semantics)">
<text>In any of several fields of study that treat the use of signs — for example, in linguistics, logic, mathematics, semantics, semiotics, and philosophy of language — the extension of a concept, idea, or sign consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its comprehension or intension, which consists very roughly of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

In philosophical semantics or the philosophy of language, the &#x27;extension&#x27; of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy. Concepts and expressions of this sort are monadic or &quot;one-place&quot; concepts and expressions.

So the extension of the word &quot;dog&quot; is the set of all (past, present and future) dogs in the world: the set includes Fido, Rover, Lassie, Rex, and so on. The extension of the phrase &quot;Wikipedia reader&quot; includes each person who has ever read Wikipedia, including &quot;you&quot;.

The extension of a whole statement, as opposed to a word or phrase, is defined (since Gottlob Frege&#x27;s &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot;) as its truth value. So the extension of &quot;Lassie is famous&quot; is the logical value &#x27;true&#x27;, since Lassie is famous.

Some concepts and expressions are such that they don&#x27;t apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects. For example, the words &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say &quot;Jim is before&quot; or &quot;Jim is after&quot;—but to one thing in relation to another, as in &quot;The wedding is before the reception&quot; and &quot;The reception is after the wedding&quot;. Such &quot;relational&quot; or &quot;polyadic&quot; (&quot;many-place&quot;) concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question. So the extension of &quot;before&quot; is the set of all (ordered) pairs of objects such that the first one is before the second one.

== Mathematics ==
In mathematics, the &#x27;extension&#x27; of a mathematical concept formula_1 is the set that is specified by formula_1. (That set might be empty, currently.)

For example, the extension of a function is a set of ordered pairs that pair up the arguments and values of the function; in other words, the function&#x27;s graph. The extension of an object in abstract algebra, such as a group, is the underlying set of the object. The extension of a set is the set itself. That a set can capture the notion of the extension of anything is the idea behind the axiom of extensionality in axiomatic set theory.

This kind of extension is used so constantly in contemporary mathematics based on set theory that it can be called an implicit assumption. A typical effort in mathematics evolves out of an observed mathematical object requiring description, the challenge being to find a characterization for which the object becomes the extension.

== Computer science ==

In computer science, some database textbooks use the term &#x27;intension&#x27; to refer to the schema of a database, and &#x27;extension&#x27; to refer to particular instances of a database.

== Metaphysical implications ==

There is an ongoing controversy in metaphysics about whether or not there are, in addition to actual, existing things, non-actual or nonexistent things. If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions. If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression. Note that &quot;actual&quot; may not mean the same as &quot;existing&quot;. Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, but not actual. (Maybe they exist in other universes, and these universes are other &quot;possible worlds&quot;—possible alternatives to the actual world.) Perhaps some actual things are nonexistent. (Sherlock Holmes seems to be an &quot;actual&quot; example of a fictional character; one might think there are many other characters Arthur Conan Doyle &quot;might&quot; have invented, though he actually invented Holmes.)

A similar problem arises for objects that no longer exist. The extension of the term &quot;Socrates&quot;, for example, seems to be a (currently) non-existent object. Free logic is one attempt to avoid some of these problems.

== General semantics ==

Some fundamental formulations in the field of general semantics rely heavily on a valuation of extension over intension. See for example extension, and the extensional devices.

<doc id="39096" wikidata="Q285483" url="?curid=39096" title="Mary Martin">
<text>Mary Virginia Martin (December 1, 1913 – November 3, 1990) was an American actress and singer. A muse of Rodgers and Hammerstein, she originated many leading roles on stage over her career, including Nellie Forbush in &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1949), the title character in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1954), and Maria von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1959). She was named a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1989. She was the mother of actor Larry Hagman.

== Early life ==
Martin was born in Weatherford, Texas. Her autobiography described her childhood as secure and happy. She had close relationships with both of her parents as well as her siblings. As a young actress Martin had an instinctive ear for recreating musical sounds. 

Martin&#x27;s father, Preston Martin, was a lawyer, and her mother, Juanita Presley, was a violin teacher. Although the doctors told Juanita that she would risk her life if she attempted to have another baby, she was determined to have a boy. Instead, she had Mary, who became a tomboy. 

Martin&#x27;s family had a barn and orchard that kept her entertained. She played with her elder sister Geraldine (whom she called &quot;Sister&quot;), climbing trees and riding ponies. Martin adored her father. &quot;He was tall, good-looking, silver-haired, with the kindest brown eyes. Mother was the disciplinarian, but it was Daddy who could turn me into an angel with just one look.&quot; Martin, who said &quot;I&#x27;d never understand the law&quot; began singing every Saturday night at a bandstand that was near the courtroom where her father worked. She sang in a trio with her sister and Marion Swofford, all three in bellhop costumes. &quot;Even in those days, without microphones, my high piping voice carried all over the square. I have always thought that I inherited my carrying voice from my father.&quot;

She remembered having a photographic memory as a child. School tests were not a problem, and learning songs was easy. She had her first experience of singing solo at a fire hall, where she felt the crowd&#x27;s appreciation. &quot;Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that&#x27;s the way I was made; I truly don&#x27;t think I could help it.&quot; Martin&#x27;s craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. &quot;Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child — that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don&#x27;t remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I&#x27;d miss something.&quot;

==Marriage==
During high school, Martin dated Benjamin Hagman before she left to attend finishing school at Ward–Belmont in Nashville, Tennessee. In Nashville she enjoyed imitating Fanny Brice at singing gigs, but she found school dull and felt confined by its strict rules. She was homesick for Weatherford, her family and Hagman. During a visit, Mary and Benjamin persuaded Mary&#x27;s mother to allow them to marry. She was legally married on November 3, 1930, at Grace Episcopal Church (Hopkinsville, Kentucky). 10 months later, pregnant with her first child (Larry Hagman) she was forced to leave Ward–Belmont. She was, however, happy to begin her new life, but she soon learned that this life as she would later say was nothing but &quot;role playing&quot;.

Their honeymoon was at her parents&#x27; house, and Martin&#x27;s dream of life with a family and a white-picket fence faded. &quot;I was 17, a married woman without real responsibilities, miserable about my mixed-up emotions, afraid there was something awfully wrong with me because I didn&#x27;t enjoy being a wife. Worst of all, I didn&#x27;t have enough to do.&quot; (p. 39) It was &quot;Sister&quot; who came to her rescue, suggesting that she should teach dance. &quot;Sister&quot; taught Martin her first real dance—the waltz clog. Martin perfectly imitated her first dance move, and she opened a dance studio. Here, she created her own moves, imitated the famous dancers she watched in the movies and taught &quot;Sister&#x27;s&quot; waltz clog. As she later recalled, &quot;I was doing something I wanted to do—creating.&quot;

==Apprenticeship==
Wanting to learn more moves, Martin went to California to attend the dance school at the Franchon and Marco School of the Theatre and then opened her own dance studio in Mineral Wells, Texas. She was given a ballroom studio with the premise that she would sing in the lobby every Saturday. There, she learned how to sing into a microphone and how to phrase blues songs. One day at work, she accidentally walked into the wrong room, where auditions were being held. They asked her in what key she would like to sing &quot;How Red the Rose, How Blue the Sky&quot;. Having absolutely no idea what her key was, she sang regardless and got the job. 

Returning to California, Martin was hired to sing &quot;How Red the Rose&quot; at the Fox Theater in San Francisco followed by a gig at the Paramount Theater in Los Angeles. There was one catch: she had to sing in the wings. She scored her first professional gig unaware that she would soon be center stage. 

Soon after, Martin learned that her studio in Texas had been burned down by a man who thought dancing was a sin. She began to express her unhappiness. Her father gave her advice, saying she was too young to be married. Martin left everything behind including her young son, Larry, and stayed in Los Angeles while her father handled her divorce from Benjamin Hagman for her. In Los Angeles, Martin plunged herself into auditions—so many that she became known as &quot;Audition Mary&quot;. Her first professional audition and job was on a national radio network. Among Martin&#x27;s first auditions, she sang &quot;Indian Love Call&quot;. After she finished the song, &quot;a tall, craggly man who looked like a mountain&quot; told Martin that he thought she had something special. It was Oscar Hammerstein II This marked the start of her career.

==Radio==
Martin began her radio career in 1939 as the vocalist on a short-lived revival of &quot;The Tuesday Night Party&quot; on CBS. In 1940, she was a singer on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Good News of 1940&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Time&quot; during that year. In 1942, she joined the cast of Kraft Music Hall on NBC, replacing Connee Boswell. She was also one of the stars of &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; on CBS, 1942–1945.

==Broadway==
Martin was cast in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Leave It to Me!&quot;, making her Broadway debut in November 1938 in that production. She became popular on Broadway and received attention in the national media singing the spoof striptease song &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot;. With that one song in the second act, she became a star &#x27;overnight&#x27;. Martin reprised the song in &quot;Night and Day&quot;, a Hollywood film about Cole Porter, in which she played herself auditioning for Porter (Cary Grant). &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; catapulted her career and became very special to Martin—she even sang it to her ailing father in his hospital bed while he was in a coma. Martin did not learn immediately that her father had died. Headlines read &quot;Daddy Girl Sings About Daddy as Daddy Dies&quot;. Because of the show&#x27;s demanding schedule, Martin was unable to attend her father&#x27;s funeral. In 1943 she starred in the new Kurt Weill musical &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; and then &quot;Lute Song&quot; in 1946.

As nurse Nellie Forbush, Martin opened on Broadway in &quot;South Pacific&quot; on April 7, 1949. Her performance was called &quot;memorable ... funny and poignant in turns&quot;, and she earned a Tony Award.
Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote: &quot;nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush ... Hers is a completely irresistible performance.&quot; She opened in the West End production on November 1, 1951.

Her next major success was in the role of Peter in the Broadway production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in October 1954 with Martin winning the Tony Award. 

Martin opened on Broadway in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; as Maria on November 16, 1959, and stayed in the show until October 1961. She won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The musical gave Martin &quot;the chance to display her homespun charm&quot;.

In 1966, she appeared on Broadway in the two-person musical &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; with Robert Preston and was nominated for the Tony Award (Leading Actress in a Musical). A national tour with Preston began in March 1968 but was canceled early due to Martin&#x27;s illness.
Although she appeared in nine films between 1938 and 1943, she was generally passed over for the filmed version of the musical plays. She herself once explained that she did not enjoy making films because she did not have the connection with an audience that she had in live performances. The closest that she ever came to preserving her stage performances was her television appearances as &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. The Broadway production from 1954 was subsequently performed on NBC television in RCA&#x27;s compatible color in 1955, 1956, and 1960. Martin also preserved her 1957 stage performance as Annie Oakley in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; when NBC television broadcast the production live that year.

While Martin did not enjoy making films, she frequently appeared on television. Her last feature film appearance was a cameo as herself in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot; in 1953. Martin made an appearance in 1980 in a Royal Variety Performance in London performing &quot;Honeybun&quot; from &quot;South Pacific.&quot; Martin appeared in the play &quot;Legends&quot; with Carol Channing in a one-year US national tour opening in Dallas on January 9, 1986.

==Awards and honors==

Martin was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual honor for career achievements, in 1989. She received the Donaldson Award in 1943 for &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;. A Special Tony Award was presented to her in 1948 while she appeared in the national touring company of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; for &quot;spreading theatre to the rest of the country while the originals perform in New York.&quot; In 1955 and 1956, she received, first, a Tony Award for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and then an Emmy for appearing in the same role on television. She also received Tonys for &quot;South Pacific&quot; and in 1959 for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

In September 1963, a statue of Peter Pan dedicated to her was unveiled in Weatherford, donated by the Peter Pan Peanut Butter Company.

==Personal life==
After Martin&#x27;s 1936 divorce from Benjamin Hagman, she married Richard Halliday in 1940. Early in their marriage, he worked as a drama critic for the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; and a movie critic for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Eventually, Halliday became producer or co-producer of at least two of Martin&#x27;s projects. In the early 1970s, the couple lived, according to his March 1973 obituary in the &quot;Connecticut Sunday Herald&quot;, &quot;on a vast ranch they own near Anápolis&quot; in the state of Goiás, Brazil. The ranch was called &quot;Nossa Fazenda Halliday&quot; (Our Halliday Farm). Martin was called Dona Maria by people in the vicinity of the Brazilian ranch.

Cultural scholar Lillian Faderman wrote that Martin and actress Janet Gaynor often traveled together along with Halliday and with Gaynor&#x27;s husband.

Gaynor and her husband discovered Anápolis in 1950, soon after, Martin and her husband visited.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/1979/girls-brazil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Janet Gaynor had adjoining ranches near Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1971/martin-brazil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of September 5, 1982, Martin, Janet Gaynor, Gaynor&#x27;s husband Paul Gregory, and Martin&#x27;s manager Ben Washer were involved in a serious car crash in San Francisco.
A van ran a red light at the corner of California and Franklin streets and crashed into the Luxor taxicab in which the group was riding, knocking it into a tree. Washer was killed, Martin sustained two broken ribs and a broken pelvis, and Gaynor&#x27;s husband suffered two broken legs. Gaynor sustained several serious injuries. The driver of the van was arrested on two counts of felony drunk driving, reckless driving, speeding, running a red light, and vehicular homicide. On March 15, 1983, he was found guilty of drunk driving and vehicular homicide and was sentenced to three years in prison. Gaynor died two years later from complications from her injuries.

Martin was a Democrat and supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Martin&#x27;s sexuality has long been a topic of debate. In 1979, Patsy Kelly told Boze Hadleigh that Martin was a lesbian. In 2016, biographer David Kaufman stated that Halliday served as &quot;[Martin&#x27;s] husband, her best friend, her gay/straight &#x27;cover,&#x27;&quot; while in 2019, &quot;The Advocate&quot; stated that Martin &quot;simply [was the subject of] a lifetime of lavender rumors.&quot;

===Death===
Martin died of cancer at age 76 at her home in Rancho Mirage, California, on November 3, 1990.
She is buried in City Greenwood Cemetery in Weatherford, Texas.

<text>Kidderminster is a market town and civil parish in Worcestershire, England, south-west of Birmingham and north of Worcester. Located north of the River Stour and east of the River Severn, in the 2021 census, it had a population of 57,400. The town is twinned with Husum, Germany.

Situated in the far north of Worcestershire (and with its northern suburbs only 3 and 4 miles from the Staffordshire and Shropshire borders respectively), the town is the main administration centre for the wider Wyre Forest District, which includes the towns of Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley, along with other outlying settlements.

==History==

The land around Kidderminster may have been first populated by the Husmerae, an Anglo-Saxon tribe first mentioned in the Ismere Diploma, a document in which Ethelbald of Mercia granted a &quot;parcel of land of ten hides&quot; to Cyneberht. This developed as the settlement of Stour-in-Usmere, which was later the subject of a territorial dispute settled by Offa of Mercia in 781, when he restored certain rights to Bishop Heathored. This allowed for the founding of a monastery or in the area.

The earliest written form of the name Kidderminster was first documented in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Chideminstre&quot;, meaning &#x27;Cydda or Cydela&#x27;s minster or monastery&#x27;. It was a large manor held by William the Conqueror, with 16 outlying settlements (Bristitune, Fastochesfeld, Franche, Habberley, Hurcott, Mitton, Oldington, Ribbesford, Sudwale, Sutton, Teulesberge, Trimpley, Wannerton and Wribbenhall). Various spellings were in use – &quot;Kedeleministre&quot; or &quot;Kideministre&quot; (in the 12th and 13th centuries), &quot;Kyderemunstre&quot; (13th–15th centuries) – until the name of the town was settled as Kidderminster by the 16th century. Between 1156 and 1162 Henry II granted the manor to his steward, Manasser Biset. By six decades later, the settlement grew and a fair (1228) and later a market (1240) were established there.

To the south by the River Stour, dating from the 15th century, is a single surviving tower of Caldwall (or Caldwell) Castle, a fortified manor house. 

Kidderminster owes its growth to the early development of the cloth industry, which was aided by its position upon the River Stour, and its location at the confluence of four main roads to Birmingham, Dudley, Worcester, Bewdley and Bridgnorth. In a visit to the town sometime around 1540, King&#x27;s Antiquary John Leland noted that Kidderminster &quot;standeth most by clothing&quot;. Over the following centuries the town specialised in textile trades such as weaving, fulling, cloth working and milling, and was also home to numerous other trades including shoemaking, haberdashery, saddle making, dyers, tailors, tanners and glovers.

King Charles I granted the Borough of Kidderminster a Charter in 1636. the original charter can be viewed at Kidderminster Town Hall.

Kidderminster&#x27;s position at the junction of several main roads made it a place of strategic importance during the English Civil War, with several skirmishes taking place in and around the town.

In 1670–1 Kidderminster&#x27;s cloth industry obtained a guild by act of parliament and by 1677, the town had as many as 459 weavers and perhaps 3,000 spinners. Following King Louis XIV&#x27;s revocation of the Edict of Nantes in October 1685 and the subsequent renewed persecution of French Protestants in France, many Huguenots emigrated to Britain. The immigration and settlement of waves of industrious Huguenots brought the benefits of skilled artisans, merchants and manufacturers to Britain. They contributed to a preexisting but basic cloth weaving industry in towns and cities throughout England, in some cases establishing new businesses. In Worcestershire, the Huguenots established themselves at Worcester, Evesham, Droitwich and Kidderminster.

In the early 18th century, carpet weaving was introduced to Kidderminster, and this rapidly became the staple trade of the town. Its growth was aided by the opening of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal in 1771, and later the arrival of the railway to the town in 1852. The carpet industry went into decline in the 1970s, but still continues on a reduced scale.

Poor trade conditions in 1828, when 2,000 looms were not working for an 18-week period, led to riots where £3,000 of damage was done during one night.

The town&#x27;s local government was reformed by the Municipal Reform Act 1835, which incorporated Kidderminster as a municipal borough. This superseded the charter of 1636, and divided the borough into three wards represented by six aldermen and eighteen councillors, the number of wards was doubled in the 1880s. The current Town Hall on Vicar Street was built in 1877.

Kidderminster has two Commissioners&#x27; churches. The first was St George&#x27;s Church, on Radford Avenue. This was designed by Francis Goodwin and built in 1821–1824, finally being consecrated in April 1824. Its grant of just over £17,000.00, was the third-largest given by the commission to any church outside London. The second church was St John&#x27;s Church, on the Bewdley Road. This was built in 1843 and the architect was Matthew Steele; its grant was just over £4,000.

The Shrubbery was converted into a military headquarters towards the end of the 19th century.

In 1974 the old borough of Kidderminster was abolished and merged into the new Wyre Forest District. In December 2015 Kidderminster was established as a civil parish with a new Town Council, following a public referendum.

==Geography==
The River Stour and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal both flow through Kidderminster town centre.
==Economy==
The modern carpet industry was founded in the area in 1785 by Brintons. The carpet industry became extremely important to the local economy, so much so that the local newspaper is still named &quot;The Shuttle&quot; after the shuttles used on the carpet looms. A type of carpet was known as Kidderminster carpet or, in the United States, Ingrain carpet: this was a reversible carpet with no pile, with the pattern showing in opposite colours on the two faces, and was popular from the 18th to early 20th centuries. By 1951 there were over thirty carpet manufacturers in the town, including, for example, Quayle &amp; Tranter (now defunct). They commissioned such notable artists as George Bain to create their traditional Celtic designs.
Aided by a 2004 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, a museum dedicated to the Kidderminster carpet industry was officially opened by Lord Cobham in 2012.

==Politics==

Kidderminster Town is a civil parish within Wyre Forest District, with Kidderminster Town Council created in the early 21st century to take on the duties of a parish council, following a referendum in May 2015. Prior to this, Charter Trustees maintained the traditions of the town and elected a Mayor. At the 2019 local elections to Wyre Forest District Council, the Conservatives lost their majority and the council was taken over by a &#x27;Progressive Alliance&#x27; formed of independents and councillors from other parties. However, in May 2022 Health Concern announced they would not be standing at the next election, instead favouring a unified independent offering. At the following election in 2023 the Conservatives regained majority control after a collapse in the independent and former Health Concern vote, one of only two council gains nationally.

The area (initially as Kidderminster, then after 1983 as the Wyre Forest constituency) has been represented by Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) Gerald Nabarro 1950–1964, Tatton Brinton 1964–1974, Esmond Bulmer 1974–1987, Anthony Coombs 1987–1997, and Labour MP David Lock 1997–2001. In the 2001 United Kingdom general election, the town returned Dr Richard Taylor as an independent MP for the Wyre Forest parliamentary constituency. Taylor had fought the election to protest against the proposed reduction in services at Kidderminster Hospital. He held his seat at the 2005 election, the first independent MP to do so since 1949. Mark Garnier has held the seat of Wyre Forest since the 2010 election increasing his majority each time.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 census there were 55,530 residents in Kidderminster in 24,869 households, the median age of Kidderminster residents was 41.

Kidderminster&#x27;s population at the 2011 census was predominantly White (96.8%). The largest non-white groups were Asian at 1.7%, and mixed race at 1.2%.

67% of Kidderminster residents identified as Christian, with 24.7% stating they had no religion, and 6.6% not stating any religion. The largest non-Christian group were Muslims at 0.8%, followed by Buddhists at 0.2% and Hindus and Sikhs at 0.1% each, with others at 0.4%.

==Architecture and landmarks==

Kidderminster&#x27;s parish church of St Mary and All Saints&#x27; is a grade I listed building dating mostly from the 15th and 16th centuries. Another notable church is St John&#x27;s Church, which is grade II listed, and dates from 1843. Other listed buildings of note in the town include the Town Hall of 1877. The Shrubbery, a 19th-century mansion, and the Kidderminster Register Office. Many of Kidderminster&#x27;s historic buildings were lost from the 1960s onwards, this led to the creation of the Kidderminster Civic Society in 1993 to promote preservation of the town&#x27;s heritage.

There are some former factory buildings of note in Kidderminster, which have mostly been converted to other uses. A notable one is the former Slingfield Mill, dating from 1864 to 1870, which is grade II listed, and has been converted for retail use.

In the 1968 &quot;Buildings of England&quot; volume on Worcestershire, Pevsner described the town as: &quot;uncommonly devoid of visual pleasure and architectural interest.&quot; Crown House, an early 1970s office block was particularly criticised, and was once rated among the top 10 ugliest buildings in Britain. Demolition was completed in April 2020, improving the Kidderminster skyline. In the 2007 revision of this volume, Alan Brooks wrote: &quot;the 19th century mill buildings, together with the churches, provide most of the architectural interest in a town otherwise uncommonly lacking in visual pleasures.&quot;

==Transport==
;Rail
Two railway stations in the town share the same approach road and are located less than fifty metres apart. The main National Rail station, operated by West Midlands Trains, is Kidderminster, from where trains run to Birmingham, Worcester and London. The other station, Kidderminster Town, is the terminus of the preserved Heritage Railway line, Severn Valley Railway, from where trains run to Bridgnorth.

;Road
Several major routes run through the town, including the A456 which runs from Birmingham to just south of Woofferton, Shropshire; the A451 which runs from Stourbridge to Abberley; the A442 which runs from Droitwich to Hodnet, Shropshire, a few miles north of Telford; the A449 which runs from Newport in south Wales to Stafford and crosses the A456 at the Land Oak; and the A448 road which starts in the town and goes to Studley in Warwickshire, via Bromsgrove and Redditch. A major change in the town centre road infrastructure was the construction of the ring road in the 1970s and 1980s. This relieved the town&#x27;s growing congestion but diverted traffic outside the centre, drawing off customers for businesses. The final phase of the ring road was never completed, which results in the town having a ring road that does not form a complete ring.

The nearest motorway is the M5, which signs Kidderminster from junction 3 (Halesowen) with the A456, and junction 6 (Worcester North) with the A449.

;Waterways

The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal passes through the town.

;Bus
There are direct bus links with towns including Worcester, Halesowen, Bewdley, Stourport, Bridgnorth, Bromsgrove and Redditch. The majority of the services in Kidderminster are operated by Diamond West Midlands (previously First Midland Red) while the rest is operated by Select Bus Services (297), Finesse and Yarranton Brothers. Services 291 and 292 were operated by R &amp; B Travel prior to the company surrendering its licence in January 2020.
Services 15A/C, S15, 294, 580 and 133were operated by Coniston Coaches prior to surrendering its licence in October 2020.
15A/C, S15 &amp; 294 were passed onto Astons until 2021 and 2022. Service 297 was operated by Arriva Midlands until 4 September 2023 when Select won the contract for the service.

==Education==
As part of educational restructuring in the Wyre Forest district, Kidderminster&#x27;s schools were reorganised from a three-tier system of first, middle and high schools to the two-tier system more common in the UK as a whole, featuring primary schools and secondary schools. In this process, several first and middle schools were closed or merged into new primaries. The three high schools of King Charles I School, Wolverley C E Secondary School, and Baxter College (formerly Harry Cheshire High School) became secondary schools that included sixth forms.

Independent schools include Heathfield Knoll School in Wolverley. Formerly independent, Holy Trinity School became a state-funded free school in 2014. Kidderminster College is located in Market Street in the town centre, having moved from older premises in Hoo Road in 2003. Other local secondary schools include The Stourport High School &amp; VIth Form Centre and The Bewdley School.

==Sport==

===Cricket===
Kidderminster CC is a local cricket club at whose home ground of Chester Road North Ground Worcestershire County Cricket Club play occasional County Championship and county 2nd XI games.

===Football===

Formed in 1886, Kidderminster Harriers F.C. is the town&#x27;s professional football club. Local rivals of the Harriers were traditionally Worcester City and Bromsgrove Rovers, and in recent years also Cheltenham Town and Hereford United. As of 2023 Cheltenham are in League One, two divisions above Kidderminster, with Hereford being the division below Kidderminster.

In 2005 the Harriers were relegated to the Conference Premier after five years in the Football League Two division. They had reached the Football League as Conference champions in 2000, and are Worcestershire&#x27;s only representative in the league. They had won the title in 1994 but were denied promotion then as their stadium did not meet Football League capacity requirements. That same year they eliminated Birmingham City from the FA Cup; they eventually reached the fifth round of the competition (just missing the quarter-finals), where they hosted Premier League side West Ham United, narrowly losing 0–1. Prior to Lincoln City&#x27;s run in the competition in 2017, Harriers were the last non-league side to reach round five of the FA Cup. Harriers were relegated to the National League North in 2016.

In recent years, Kidderminster have seen some success under manager and former Harriers player Russell Penn. A strong FA Cup run in the 2021–2022 season led to the Harriers facing Premier League side West Ham in, as they had done in 1994. The affair ended in a 1–2 defeat, yet the game led to major economic benefit for the club, with TV money and ticket sales generating large amounts of income. Harriers further went into the Play-Offs that same season, but were eliminated in their first game to Boston United. In the 2022–2023 season, Kidderminster again reached the Play-Offs, achieving the feat on the last game of the season after an excellent late run of league form. Harriers beat Alfreton, Kings Lynn and finally Brackley in the Play-Offs and regained promotion to the National League.

The Kidderminster &amp; District League has operated since 1984 and draws teams from Worcestershire and South Staffordshire.

===Rugby===
Kidderminster Carolians RFC is a local rugby union club, currently playing at level 7 in Counties 1 Midlands West (North) at First XV Level and Counties 4 Midlands West (South) at 2nd XV level.

Regularly putting out three senior teams including veterans, the club also has a thriving Colts (U18s) age group, a developing women&#x27;s team since 2021, and a large minis and juniors section.

===Hockey===
Kidderminster Hockey club was founded in 1892 and in 2010 there were five men&#x27;s hockey teams, a women&#x27;s team and a junior team.

<doc id="39104" wikidata="Q604164" url="?curid=39104" title="Chinese food therapy">
<text>Chinese food therapy (, also called nutrition therapy and dietary therapy) is a mode of dieting rooted in Chinese beliefs concerning the effects of food on the human organism, and centered on concepts such as seasonal eating and in moderation. Its basic precepts are a mix of Taoist Wuxing and eight principle theory that are concepts drawn from the modern representation of traditional Chinese medicine. Food that conform to the mode are called &quot;yaoshan&quot; ().

Food therapy has long been a common approach to health among Chinese people both in China and overseas, and was popularized for western readers in the 1990s with the publication of books like &quot;The Tao of Healthy Eating&quot; () and &quot;The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen&quot; ().

==Origins==
A number of ancient Chinese cookbooks and treatises on food (now lost) display an early Chinese interest in food, but no known focus on its medical value. The literature on &quot;nourishing life&quot; () integrated advice on food within broader advice on how to attain immortality. Such books, however, are only precursors of &quot;dietary therapy&quot;, because they did not systematically describe the effect of individual food items. In the volume on &quot;Fermentations and Food Science&quot; of Joseph Needham&#x27;s &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot;, H. T. Huang considers the &quot;Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments&quot; (c. 200 BCE) and the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Inner Canon&quot; as precursors of the &quot;dietary therapy&quot; tradition, the former because it recommends food products as remedies for various illnesses, the latter because it discusses the impact of food on health. The &quot;materia medica&quot; literature, exemplified by the &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; (1st century CE), also discussed food products, but without specializing on them.

The earliest extant Chinese dietary text is a chapter of Sun Simiao&#x27;s &quot;Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold&quot; (), which was completed in the 650s during the Tang dynasty. Sun&#x27;s work contains the earliest known use of the term &quot;food (or dietary) therapy&quot; (&quot;shiliao&quot;). Sun stated that he wanted to present current knowledge about food so that people would first turn to food rather than drugs when suffering from an ailment. His chapter contains 154 entries divided into four sections – on fruits, vegetables, cereals, and meat – in which Sun explains the properties of individual foodstuffs with concepts borrowed from the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Inner Canon&quot;: &quot;qi&quot;, the viscera, and vital essence (), as well as correspondences between the Five Phases, the &quot;five flavors&quot; (sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty), and the five grains. He also set a large number of &quot;dietary interdictions&quot; (), some based on calendrical notions (no water chestnuts in the 7th month), others on purported interactions between foods (no clear wine with horse meat) or between different flavors.

Sun Simiao&#x27;s disciple Meng Shen (; 621–713) compiled the first work entirely devoted to the therapeutic value of food: the &quot;Materia Dietetica&quot; (). This work has not survived, but it was quoted in later texts – like the 10th-century Japanese text Ishinpō – and a fragment of it has been found among the Dunhuang manuscripts. Surviving excerpts show that Meng gave less importance to dietary prohibitions than Sun, and that he provided information on how to prepare foodstuffs rather than just describe their properties. The works of Sun Simiao and Meng Shen established the genre of &quot;materia dietetica&quot; and shaped its development in the following centuries.

==Later history==
An abundant literature developed in China around the medicinal uses of food. A mid-ninth-century work, now lost, called &quot;Candid Views of a Nutritionist-Physician&quot; () discussed how food could treat various disorders, while several works from the Song dynasty (960–1279) explained how to feed the elderly to extend their life.

In the early 14th century, Hu Sihui, who served as Grand Dietician () at the court of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1260–1368), compiled a treatise called &quot;Yinshan zhengyao&quot;, or &quot;Proper and Essential Things for the Emperor&#x27;s Food and Drink&quot; (), which is still recognized in China as a classic of both &quot;materia medica&quot; and &quot;materia dietetica&quot;. Influenced by the culinary and medical traditions of the Turko-Islamic world and integrating Mongol food stuffs like mutton into its recipes, Hu&#x27;s treatise interpreted the effects of food according to the scheme of correspondences between the five phases that had recently been systematized by northern Chinese medical writers of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) and Yuan eras. Before that period, food materials had not yet been comprehensively assigned to the five flavors systematically correlated with specific internal organs and therapeutic effects.

Chinese understandings of the therapeutic effects of food were influential in East Asia. Cited in Japanese works as early as the 10th century, Chinese dietary works shaped Korean literature on food well into the Joseon period (1392–1897). In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the imperial court of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) ordered several works on Chinese food therapy translated into Manchu.

The concept entered Japan in 1972 as &quot;ishokudōgen&quot;. By the late 1990s, the (&quot;yakuzen&quot;) diet evolved into a simplified version where herbs are added to relatively balanced meals.

Although the precepts of Chinese food therapy are neither systematic nor identical in all times and places, some basic concepts can be isolated. One central tenet is that &quot;medicine and food share a common origin&quot;, and that food materials can therefore be used to prevent or treat medical disorders. Like medicinal drugs, food items are classified as &quot;heating&quot; () or &quot;cooling&quot; (). In popular understanding, &quot;heating&quot; food is typically &quot;high-calorie, subjected to high heat in cooking, spicy or bitter, or &#x27;hot&#x27; in color (red, orange)&quot;, and includes red meat, innards, baked and deep-fried goods, and alcohol. They are to be avoided in the summer and can be used to treat &quot;cold&quot; illnesses like excessive pallor, watery feces, fatigue, chills, and low body temperature caused by a number of possible causes, including anemia. Green vegetables are the most typical &quot;cooling&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; food, which is &quot;low-calorie, watery, soothing or sour in taste, or &#x27;cool&#x27; in color (whitish, green)&quot;. They are recommended for &quot;hot&quot; conditions: rashes, dryness or redness of skin, heartburns, and other &quot;symptoms similar to those of a burn&quot;, but also sore throat, swollen gums, and constipation.

In more systematic understandings, each medicine or food item has one of five flavors: sour, sweet, bitter, pungent (or &quot;acrid&quot;), and salty. Besides describing the taste of food, each of these &quot;flavors&quot; purportedly has specific effects on particular viscera. The sour flavor, for instance, has &quot;constriction and emollient effects&quot; and &quot;can emolliate the liver and control diarrhea and perspiration&quot;, whereas &quot;bitter&quot; food can &quot;purge the heart &#x27;fire&#x27;, reduce excessive fluids, induce diarrhea, and reinforce the heart &#x27;Yin&#x27;&quot;.

One common saying among proponents of Chinese food therapy is &quot;medicine and food, same origin&quot; (; Japanese: ), where certain food items are given medicinal properties, and where certain herbal medicines are deemed acceptable in food.

==Scientific assessments==
Historically, there have been few studies in English literature about the practice of Chinese food therapy.

== Other examples ==

* Qiu Li Gao is a pear syrup or paste used to treat lung ailments.

== Regulations ==
The Chinese government has approved a number of herbs as food ingredients using the &quot;Traditionally Both Food and Chinese Medicinal Materials&quot; () lists. These are colloquially known as the &quot;Yàoshí Tóngyuān Catalog&quot; () in Chinese. In addition, farm-grown ginseng and &quot;Cordyceps militaris&quot;, two herbs known from TCM, are considered novel food ingredients.

<text>The Boehm system is a system of keywork for the flute, created by inventor and flautist Theobald Boehm between 1831 and 1847.

==History==
Immediately prior to the development of the Boehm system, flutes were most commonly made of wood, with an inverse conical bore, eight keys, and tone holes (the openings where the fingers are placed to produce specific notes) that were small in size, and thus easily covered by the fingertips. Boehm&#x27;s work was inspired by an 1831 concert in London, given by soloist Charles Nicholson, who, with his father in the 1820s, had introduced a flute constructed with larger tone holes than were used in previous designs. This large-holed instrument could produce greater volume of sound than other flutes, and Boehm set out to produce his own large-holed design.

In addition to large holes, Boehm provided his flute with &quot;full venting&quot;, meaning that all keys were normally open (previously, several keys were normally closed, and opened only when the key was operated). Boehm also wanted to locate tone holes at acoustically optimal points on the body of the instrument, rather than locations conveniently covered by the player&#x27;s fingers. To achieve these goals, Boehm adapted a system of axle-mounted keys with a series of &quot;open rings&quot; (called &quot;brille&quot;, German for &quot;eyeglasses&quot;, as they resembled the type of eyeglass frames common during the 19th century) that were fitted around other tone holes, such that the closure of one tone hole by a finger would also close a key placed over a second hole.

In 1832 Boehm introduced a new conical-bore flute, which achieved a fair degree of success. Boehm, however, continued to look for ways to improve the instrument. Finding that an increased volume of air produced a stronger and clearer tone, he replaced the conical bore with a cylindrical bore, finding that a parabolic contraction of the bore near the embouchure hole improved the instrument&#x27;s low register. He also found that optimal tone was produced when the tone holes were too large to be covered by the fingertips, and he developed a system of finger plates to cover the holes. These new flutes were at first made of silver, although Boehm later produced wooden versions. 

The cylindrical Boehm flute was introduced in 1847, with the instrument gradually being adopted almost universally by professional and amateur players in Europe and around the world during the second half of the 19th century. The instrument was adopted for the performance of orchestral and chamber music, opera and theater, wind ensembles (e.g., military and civic bands), and most other music which might be loosely described as relating to &quot;Western classical music&quot; (including, for example, jazz). Many further refinements have been made, and countless design variations are common among flutes today (the &quot;offset G&quot; key, addition of the low B foot, etc.) The concepts of the Boehm system have been applied across the range of flutes available, including piccolos, alto flutes, bass flutes, and so on, as well as other wind instruments. The material of the instrument may vary (many piccolos are made of wood, some very large flutes are wooden or even made of PVC).

The flute is perhaps the oldest musical instrument, other than the human voice itself. There are very many flutes, both traversely blown and end-blown &quot;fipple&quot; flutes, currently produced which are not built on the Boehm model.

The fingering system for the saxophone closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm&#x27;s for the clarinet family is also known as the &quot;Boehm system&quot;, although it was developed by Hyacinthe Klosé and not Boehm himself. The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of flageolets. Boehm did work on a system for the bassoon, and Boehm-inspired oboes have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The Albert system is another key system for the clarinet.
